ndplayed every lively thing that I could think of on the piano. And Isang there, too--silly little songs that Marie used to sing to Lester.And I tried to think I was really down there to Boston, singing toLester; and that Mother was right in the next room waiting for me.Then I stopped and turned around on the piano-stool. And there was thecoffin plate, and the wax cross, and the hair wreath; and the room wasjust as still as death. And I knew I wasn't in Boston. I was there inAndersonville, And there wasn't any Baby Lester there, nor any motherwaiting for me in the next room. And all the fluffy white dresses andsilk stockings in the world wouldn't make me Marie. I was really justMary, and I had got to have three whole months more of it.And then is when I began to cry. And I cried just as hard as I'd beensinging a minute before. I was on the floor with my head in my arms onthe piano-stool when Father's voice came to me from the doorway."Mary, Mary, what in the world does this mean?"I jumped up and stood "at attention," the way you have to, of course,when fathers speak to you. I couldn't help showing I had beencrying--he had seen it. But I tried very hard to stop now. My firstthought, after my startled realization that he was there, was towonder how long he had been there--how much of all that awful singingand banging he had heard."Yes, sir." I tried not to have my voice shake as I said it; but Icouldn't quite help that."What is the meaning of this, Mary? Why are you crying?"I shook my head. I didn't want to tell him, of course; so I juststammered out something about being sorry I had disturbed him. ThenI edged toward the door to show him that if he would step one side Iwould go away at once and not bother him any longer.But he didn't step one side. He asked more questions, one right afteranother."Are you sick, Mary?"I shook my head."Did you hurt yourself?"I shook my head again."It isn't--your mother--you haven't had bad news from her?"And then I blurted it out without thinking--without thinking at allwhat I was saying: "No, no--but I wish I had, I wish I had; 'causethen I could go to her, and go away from here!" The minute I'd saidit I _knew_ what I'd said, and how awful it sounded; and I clapped myfingers to my lips. But 'twas too late. It's always too late, whenyou've once said it. So I just waited for him to thunder out hisanger; for, of course, I thought he _would_ thunder in rage andrighteous indignation.But he didn't. Instead, very quietly and gently he said:"Are you so unhappy, then, Mary--here?"And I looked at him, and his eyes and his mouth and his whole faceweren't angry at all. They were just sorry, actually sorry. Andsomehow, before I knew it, I was crying again, and Father, with hisarm around me--_with his arm around me!_ think of that!--was leadingme to the sofa.And I cried and cried there, with my head on the arm of the sofa, tillI'd made a big tear spot on the linen cover; and I wondered if itwould dry up before Aunt Jane saw it, or if it would change coloror leak through to the red plush underneath, or some other dreadfulthing. And then, some way, I found myself telling it all over toFather--about Mary and Marie, I mean, just as if he was Mother, orsome one I loved--I mean, some one I loved and _wasn't afraid of_; forof course I love Father. Of course I do!Well, I told him everything (when I got started there was nostopping)--all about how hard it was to be Mary, and how to-day I hadtried to be Marie for just a little while, to rest me. He interruptedhere, and wanted to know if that was why I looked so differentto-day--more as I had when I first came; and I said yes, that thesewere Marie things that Mary couldn't wear. And when he asked, "Why,pray?" in a voice almost cross, I told him, of course, that Aunt Janewouldn't let me; that Mary had to wear brown serge and calfskin bootsthat were durable, and that would wear well.And when I told him how sorry I was about the music and such a noiseas I'd been making, he asked if _that_ was Marie's fault, too; and Isaid yes, of course--that Aunt Jane didn't like to have Mary play atall, except hymns and funeral marches, and Mary didn't know any. Andhe grunted a queer little grunt, and said, "Well, well, upon my soul,upon my soul!" Then he said, "Go on." And I did go on.I told him how I was afraid it _was_ going to be just like Dr. Jekylland Mr. Hyde. (I forgot to say I've read it now. I found it inFather's library.) Of course not _just_ like it, only one of me wasgoing to be bad, and one good, I was afraid, if I didn't look out. Itold him how Marie always wanted to kick up rugs, and move the chairsout of their sockets in the carpet, and leave books around handy, andsuch things. And so to-day it seemed as if I'd just got to have avacation from Mary's hot gingham dresses and clumpy shoes. And I toldhim how lonesome I was without anybody, not _anybody_; and I toldabout Charlie Smith and Paul Mayhew and Mr. Claude Livingstone,and how Aunt Jane wouldn't let me have them, either, even if I wasstanding where the brook and river meet.Father gave another funny little grunt here, and got up suddenly andwalked over to the window. I thought at first he was angry; but hewasn't. He was even more gentle when he came back and sat down again,and he seemed interested, very much interested in everything I toldhim. But I stopped just in time from saying again how I wished I couldgo back to Boston; but I'm not sure but he knew I was going to say it.But he was very nice and kind and told me not to worry about themusic--that he didn't mind it at all. He'd been in several times andheard it. And I thought almost, by the way he spoke, that he'd come inon purpose to hear it; but I guess that was a mistake. He just put itthat way so I wouldn't worry over it--about its bothering him, I mean.He was going to say more, maybe; but I don't know, I had to run. Iheard Aunt Jane's voice on the piazza saying good-bye to the lady thathad brought her home; so, of course, I had to run and hang Marie inthe closet and get out Mary from the corner before she saw me. And Idid.By dinner-time I had on the gingham dress and the hot clumpy shoesagain; and I had washed my face in cold water so I had got most of thetear spots off. I didn't want Aunt Jane to see them and ask questions,of course. And I guess she didn't. Anyway, she didn't say anything.Father didn't say anything either, but he acted queer. Aunt Jane triedto tell him something about the missionary meeting and the heathen,and a great famine that was raging. At first he didn't say anything;then he said, oh, yes, to be sure, how very interesting, and he wasglad, very glad. And Aunt Jane was so disgusted, and accused himof being even more absent-minded than usual, which was entirelyunnecessary, she said.But even that didn't move Father a mite. He just said, yes, yes, verylikely; and went on scowling to himself and stirring his coffee afterhe'd drank it all up--I mean, stirring where it had been in the cup.I didn't know but after supper he'd speak to me and ask me to come tothe library. I _hoped_ he would. There were lots more things I'd liketo have said to him. But he didn't. He never said a word. He just keptscowling, and got up from the table and went off by himself. But hedidn't go out to the observatory, as he most generally does. He wentinto the library and shut the door.He was there when the telephone message came at eight o'clock. Andwhat do you think? He'd _forgotten_ he was going to speak before theCollege Astronomy Club that evening! Forgotten his old stars for once.I don't know why. I did think, for a minute, 'twas 'cause of me--whatI'd told him. But I knew, of course, right away that it couldn't bethat. He'd never forget his stars for _me_! Probably he was justreading up about some other stars, or had forgotten how late it was,or something. (Father's always forgetting things.) But, anyway, whenAunt Jane called him he got his hat and hurried off without so muchas one word to me, who was standing near, or to Aunt Jane, who wasfollowing him all through the hall, and telling him in her mostI'm-amazed-at-you voice how shockingly absent-minded he was getting tobe.       *       *       *       *       *_One week later._Father's been awfully queer this whole week through. I can't make himout at all. Sometimes I think he's glad I told him all those things inthe parlor that day I dressed up in Marie's things, and sometimes Ithink he's sorry and wished I hadn't.The very next morning he came down to breakfast with such a funny lookon his face. He said good-morning to me three times, and all throughbreakfast he kept looking over at me with a kind of scowl that was notcross at all--just puzzled.After breakfast he didn't go out to the observatory, not even into thelibrary. He fidgeted around the dining-room till Aunt Jane went outinto the kitchen to give her orders to Susie; then he burst out, allof a sudden:"Well, Mary, what shall we do to-day?" Just like that he said it, asif we'd been doing things together every day of our lives."D-do?" I asked; and I know I showed how surprised I was by the way Istammered and flushed up."Certainly, do," he answered, impatient and scowling. "What shall wedo?""Why, Father, I--I don't know," I stammered again."Come, come, of course you know!" he cried. "You know what you want todo, don't you?"I shook my head. I was so astonished I couldn't even think. And whenyou can't think you certainly can't talk."Nonsense, Mary," scowled Father again. "Of course you know whatyou want to do! What are you in the habit of doing with your youngfriends--your Carries and Charlies, and all the rest?"I guess I just stood and stared and didn't say anything; for after aminute he cried: "Well--well--well? I'm waiting.""Why, we--we walk--and talk--and play games," I began; but right awayhe interrupted."Good! Very well, then, we'll walk. I'm not Carrie or Charlie, but Ibelieve I can walk and talk--perhaps even play games. Who knows? Come,get your hat."And I got my hat, and we went.But what a funny, funny walk that was! He meant to make it a good one;I know he did. And he tried. He tried real hard. But he walked sofast I couldn't half keep up with him; then, when he saw how I washurrying, he'd slow down, 'way down, and look so worried--till he'dforget and go striding off again, way ahead of me.We went up on the hill through the Benton woods, and it was perfectlylovely up there. He didn't say much at first. Then, all of a sudden,he began to talk, about anything and everything. And I knew, by theway he did it, that he'd just happened to think he'd got to talk.And how he talked! He asked me was I warmly clad (and here it isAugust!), and did I have a good breakfast, and how old was I, and didI enjoy my studies--which shows how little he was really thinking whathe was saying. He knows school closed ages ago. Wasn't he teaching mehimself the last of it, too? All around us were flowers and birds, andoh, so many, many lovely things. But he never said a word about them.He just talked--because he'd got to talk. I knew it, and it made melaugh inside, though all the while it made me sort of want to cry,too. Funny, wasn't it?After a time he didn't talk any more, but just walked on and on; andby and by we came home.Of course, it wasn't awfully jolly--that walk wasn't; and I guessFather didn't think it was either. Anyhow, he hasn't asked me togo again this week, and he looked tired and worried and sort ofdiscouraged when he got back from that one.But he's asked me to do other things. The next day after the walk heasked me to play to him. Yes, he _asked_ me to; and he went into theparlor and sat down on one of the chairs and listened while I playedthree pieces. Of course, I didn't play loud ones, nor very fast ones,and I was so scared I'm afraid I didn't play them very well. But hewas very polite and said, "Thank you, Mary," and, "That that was verynice"; then he stood up and said, "Thank you" again and went away intothe library, very polite, but stiff, like company.The next evening he took me out to the observatory to see the stars.That was lovely. Honestly I had a perfectly beautiful time, and Ithink Father did, too. He wasn't stiff and polite one bit. Oh, I don'tmean that he was _impolite_ or rude. It's just that he wasn't stiffas if I was company. And he was so happy with his stars and histelescope, and so glad to show them to me--oh, I had a beautiful time,and I told him so; and he looked real pleased. But Aunt Jane came forme before I'd had half enough, and I had to go to bed.The next morning I thought he'd be different, somehow, because we'dhad such a lovely time together the night before. But he wasn't. Hejust said, "Good-morning, Mary," and began to read his paper. And heread his paper all through breakfast without saying another word tome. Then he got up and went into the library, and I never saw himagain all day except at dinner-time and supper-time, and _then_ hedidn't talk to me.But after supper he took me out again to see the stars, and he wasjust as nice and friendly as could be. Not a bit like a man that'sonly a father by order of the court. But the next day--!Well--and that's the way it's been all the week. And that's why I sayhe's been so queer. One minute he'll be just as nice and folksy as youcould ask anybody to be, and the very next he's looking right throughyou as if he didn't see you at all, and you wonder and wonder what'sthe matter, and if you've done anything to displease him.Sometimes he seems almost glad and happy, and then he'll look so sorryand sad!I just can't understand my father at all.       *       *       *       *       *_Another week later_.I'm so excited I don't know what to do. The most wonderful thing hashappened. I can't hardly believe it yet myself. Yet it's so. My trunkis all packed, and I'm to go home to-morrow. _To-morrow!_This is the way it happened.Mother wrote Aunt Jane and asked if I might not be allowed to comehome for the opening of school in September. She said she understoodquite well that she had no _right_ to ask this, and, of course, ifthey saw fit, they were entirely within their rights to refuse toallow me to go until the allotted time. But that she could not helpasking it for my sake, on account of the benefit to be derived frombeing there at the opening of the school year.Of course, I didn't know Mother was going to write this. But she knewall about the school here, and how I came out, and everything. I'vealways told Mother everything that has happened. Oh, of course, Ihaven't written "every few minutes," as she asked me to. (That was ajoke, anyway, of course.) But I have written every few days, and, as Isaid before, I told her everything.Well, when the letter came I took it to Aunt Jane myself; and I was_crazy_ to know what was in it, for I recognized the writing, ofcourse. But Aunt Jane didn't tell me. She opened it, read it, kind offlushed up, and said, "Humph! The idea!" under her breath, and put theletter in her pocket.Marie wanted to make a scene and insist on knowing what was in her ownmother's letter; but Mary contented herself with looking superb andhaughty and disdainful, and marching out of the room without givingAunt Jane the satisfaction of even being asked what was in thatletter.But at the table that noon Aunt Jane read it to Father out loud. Sothat's how I came to know just what was in it. She started first tohand it over to him to read; but as he put out his hand to take it Iguess he saw the handwriting, for he drew back quickly, looking redand queer."From Mrs. Anderson to you?" he asked. And when Aunt Jane nodded herhead he sat still farther back in his chair and said, with a littlewave of his hand, "I never care to read--other people's letters."Aunt Jane said, "Stuff and nonsense, Charles, don't be silly!" But shepulled back the letter and read it--after giving a kind of an uneasyglance in my direction.Father never looked up once while she was reading it. He kept his eyeson his plate and the baked beans he was eating. I watched him. Yousee, I knew, by Aunt Jane's reading the letter to him, that it wassomething he had got to decide; and when I found out what it was, ofcourse, I was just crazy. I wanted to go so. So I watched Father'sface to see if he was going to let me go. But I couldn't make out. Icouldn't make out at all. It changed--oh, yes, it changed a great dealas she read; but I couldn't make out what kind of a change it was atall.Aunt Jane finished the letter and began to fold it up. I could see shewas waiting for Father to speak; but he never said a word. He keptright on--eating beans.Then Aunt Jane cleared her throat and spoke."You will not let her go, of course, Charles; but naturally I had toread the letter to you. I will write to Mrs. Anderson to-night."Father looked up then."Yes," he said quietly; "and you may tell her, please, that Mary_will_ go.""Charles!"Aunt Jane said that. But I--I almost ran around the table and huggedhim. (Oh, how I wish he was the kind of a father you could do thatto!)"Charles!" said Aunt Jane again. "Surely you aren't going to give inso tamely as this to that child and her mother!""I'm not giving in at all, Jane," said Father, very quietly again. "Iam consulting my own wishes in the matter. I prefer to have her go."_I_ 'most cried out then. Some way, it _hurt_ to have him say it likethat, right out--that he _wanted_ me to go. You see, I'd begun tothink he was getting so he didn't mind so very much having me here.All the last two weeks he'd been different, really different. But moreof that anon. I'll go on with what happened at the table. And, as Isaid, I did feel bad to have him speak like that. And I can remembernow just how the lump came right up in my throat.Then Aunt Jane spoke, stiff and dignified."Oh, very well, of course, if you put it that way. I can quite wellunderstand that you would want her to go--for _your_ sake. But Ithought that, under the circumstances, you would manage somehow to putup with the noise and--""Jane!" Just like that he interrupted, and he thundered, too, so thatAunt Jane actually jumped. And I guess I did, too. He had sprung tohis feet. "Jane, let us close this matter once for all. I am notletting the child go for _my_ sake. I am letting her go for her own.So far as I am concerned, if I consulted no one's wishes but my own, Ishould--keep her here always."With that he turned and strode from the room, leaving Aunt Jane and mejust staring after him.But only for a minute did _I_ stare. It came to me then what he hadsaid--that he would like to keep me here _always_. For I had heard it,even if he had said the last word very low, and in a queer, indistinctvoice. I was sure I had heard it, and I suddenly realized what itmeant. So I ran after him; and that time, if I had found him, I thinkI _would_ have hugged him. But I didn't find him. He must have gonequite away from the house. He wasn't even out to the observatory. Iwent out to see.He didn't come in all the afternoon. I watched for that, too. And whenhe did come--well, I wouldn't have dared to hug him then. He had hisvery sternest I-am-not-thinking-of-you-at-all air, and he just camein to supper and then went into the library without saying hardlyanything. Yet, some way, the look on his face made me cry. I don'tknow why.The next day he was more as he has been since we had that talk in theparlor. And he _has_ been different since then, you know. He reallyhas. He has talked quite a lot with me, as I have said, and I thinkhe's been trying, part of the time, to find something I'll beinterested in. Honestly, I think he's been trying to make upfor Carrie Heywood and Stella Mayhew and Charlie Smith and Mr.Livingstone. I think that's why he took me to walk that day in thewoods, and why he took me out to the observatory to see the starsquite a number of times. Twice he's asked me to play to him, and oncehe asked me if Mary wasn't about ready to dress up in Marie's clothesagain. But he was joking then, I knew, for Aunt Jane was right therein the house. Besides, I saw the twinkle in his eyes that I've seenthere once or twice before. I just love that twinkle in Father's eyes!But that hasn't come any since Mother's letter to Aunt Jane arrived.He's been the same in one way, yet different in another. Honestly, ifit didn't seem too wildly absurd for anything, I should say he wasactually sorry to have me go. But, of course, that isn't possible. Oh,yes, I know he said that day at the dinner-table that he should liketo keep me always. But I don't think he really meant it. He hasn'tacted a mite like that since, and I guess he said it just to hush upAunt Jane, and make her stop arguing the matter.Anyway, I'm _going_ to-morrow. And I'm so excited I can hardlybreathe.CHAPTER VIWHEN I AM BOTH TOGETHERBOSTON AGAIN.Well, I came last night. Mother and Grandfather and Aunt Hattie andBaby Lester all met me at the station. And, my! wasn't I glad to seethem? Well, I just guess I was!I was specially glad on account of having such a dreadful time withFather that morning. I mean, I was feeling specially lonesome andhomesick, and not-belonging-anywhere like.You see, it was this way: I'd been sort of hoping, I know, that atthe last, when I came to really go, Father would get back theunderstanding smile and the twinkle, and show that he really _did_care for me, and was sorry to have me go. But, dear me! Why, henever was so stern and solemn, andyou're-my-daughter-only-by-the-order-of-the-court sort of way as hewas that morning.He never even spoke at the breakfast-table. (He wasn't there hardlylong enough to speak, anyway, and he never ate a thing, only hiscoffee--I mean he drank it.) Then he pushed his chair back from thetable and stalked out of the room.He went to the station with me; but he didn't talk there much, only toask if I was sure I hadn't forgotten anything, and was I warmly clad.Warmly clad, indeed! And there it was still August, and hot as itcould be! But that only goes to show how absent-minded he was, and howlittle he was really thinking of _me_!Well, of course, he got my ticket and checked my trunk, and did allthose proper, necessary things; then we sat down to wait for thetrain. But did he stay with me and talk to me and tell me how glad hehad been to have me with him, and how sorry he was to have me go, andall the other nice, polite things 'most everybody thinks they've gotto say when a visitor goes away? He did not. He asked me again if Iwas sure I had not left anything, and was I warmly clad; then he tookout his newspaper and began to read. That is, he pretended to read;but I don't believe he read much, for he never turned the sheet once;and twice, when I looked at him, he was looking fixedly at me, as ifhe was thinking of something. So I guess he was just pretending toread, so he wouldn't have to talk to me.But he didn't even do that long, for he got up and went over andlooked at a map hanging on the wall opposite, and at a big time-tablenear the other corner. Then he looked at his watch again with awon't-that-train-ever-come? air, and walked back to me and sat down.And how do you suppose _I_ felt, to have him act like that before allthose people--to show so plainly that he was just longing to have mego? I guess he wasn't any more anxious for that train to come than _I_was. And it did seem as if it never would come, too. And it didn'tcome for ages. It was ten minutes late.Oh, I did so hope he wouldn't go down to the junction. It's so hard tobe taken care of "because it's my duty, you know"! But he went. I toldhim he needn't, when he was getting on the train with me. I told him Ijust knew I could do it beautifully all by myself, almost-a-young ladylike me. But he only put his lips together hard, and said, cold, likeice: "Are you then so eager to be rid of me?" Just as if _I_ was theone that was eager to get rid of somebody!Well, as I said, he went. But he wasn't much better on the train thanhe had been in the station. He was as nervous and fidgety as a witch,and he acted as if he did so wish it would be over and over quick. Butat the junction--at the junction a funny thing happened. He put me onthe train, just as Mother had done, and spoke to the conductor. (HowI hated to have him do that! Why, I'm six whole months older, 'most,than I was when I went up there!) And then when he'd put me in myseat (Father, I mean; not the conductor), all of a sudden he leanedover and kissed me; _kissed me--Father_! Then, before I could speak,or even look at him, he was gone; and I didn't see him again, thoughit must have been five whole minutes before that train went.I had a nice trip down to Boston, though nothing much happened. Thisconductor was not near so nice and polite as the one I had coming up;and there wasn't any lady with a baby to play with, nor any nice younggentleman to loan me magazines or buy candy for me. But it wasn't avery long ride from the junction to Boston, anyway. So I didn't mind.Besides, I knew I had Mother waiting for me.And wasn't I glad to get there? Well, I just guess I was! And _they_acted as if they were glad to see me--Mother, Grandfather, AuntHattie, and even Baby Lester. He knew me, and remembered me. He'dgrown a lot, too. And they said I had, and that I looked very nice. (Iforgot to say that, of course, I had put on the Marie clothes to comehome in--though I honestly think Aunt Jane wanted to send me home inMary's blue gingham and calfskin shoes. As if I'd have appeared inBoston in _that_ rig!)My, but it was good to get into an automobile again and just _go_! Andit was so good to have folks around you dressed in something besidesdon't-care black alpaca and stiff collars. And I said so. And Motherseemed so pleased."You did want to come back to me, darling, didn't you?" she cried,giving me a little hug. And she looked so happy when I told her allover again how good it seemed to be Marie again, and have her andBoston, and automobiles, and pretty dresses and folks and noise again.She didn't say anything about Father then; but later, when we were upin my pretty room alone, and I was taking off my things, she made metell her that Father _hadn't_ won my love away from her, and that I_didn't_ love him better than I did her; and that I _wouldn't_ ratherstay with him than with her.Then she asked me a lot of questions about what I did there, and AuntJane, and how she looked, and Father, and was he as fond of stars asever (though she must have known 'most everything, 'cause I'd alreadywritten it, but she asked me just the same). And she seemed realinterested in everything I told her.And she asked was he lonesome; and I told her no, I didn't think so;and that, anyway, he could have all the ladies' company he wanted byjust being around when they called. And when she asked what I meant, Itold her about Mrs. Darling, and the rest, and how they came eveningsand Sundays, and how Father didn't like them, but would flee to theobservatory. And she laughed and looked funny, for a minute. But rightaway she changed and looked very sober, with the kind of expressionshe has when she stands up in church and says the Apostles' Creed onSunday; only this time she said she was very sorry, she was sure; thatshe hoped my father would find some estimable woman who would make agood home for him.Then the dinner-gong sounded, and she didn't say any more.There was company that evening. The violinist. He brought his violin,and he and Mother played a whole hour together. He's awfully handsome.I think he's lovely. Oh, I do so hope he's _the_ one! Anyhow, I hopethere's _some_ one. I don't want this novel to all fizzle out withoutthere being _any_ one to make it a love story! Besides, as I saidbefore, I'm particularly anxious that Mother shall find somebody tomarry her, so she'll stop being divorced, anyway.       *       *       *       *       *_A month later_.Yes, I know it's been _ages_ since I've written here in this book; butthere just hasn't been a minute's time.First, of course, school began, and I had to attend to that. And, ofcourse, I had to tell the girls all about Andersonville--except theparts I didn't want to tell, about Stella Mayhew, and my coming out ofschool. I didn't tell _that_. And right here let me say how glad I wasto get back to this school--a real school--so different from that oneup in Andersonville! For that matter, _everything's_ different herefrom what it is in Andersonville. I'd so much rather be Marie thanMary. I know I won't ever be Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde here. I'll be thegood one all the time.It's funny how much easier it is to be good in silk stockings and afluffy white dress than it is in blue gingham and calfskin. Oh, I'llown up that Marie forgets sometimes and says things Mary used to say;like calling Olga a hired girl instead of a maid, as Aunt Hattiewants, and saying dinner instead of luncheon at noon, and some otherthings.I heard Aunt Hattie tell Mother one day that it was going to takeabout the whole six months to break Mary Marie of those outlandishcountry ways of hers. (So, you see, it isn't all honey and pie evenfor Marie. This trying to be Mary and Marie, even six months apart,isn't the easiest thing ever was!) I don't think Mother liked it verywell--what Aunt Hattie said about my outlandish ways. I didn't hearall Mother said, but I knew by the way she looked and acted, and thelittle I did hear, that she didn't care for that word "outlandish"applied to her little girl--not at all.Mother's a dear. And she's so happy! And, by the way, I think it _is_the violinist. He's here a lot, and she's out with him to concertsand plays, and riding in his automobile. And she always puts on herprettiest dresses, and she's very particular about her shoes, and herhats, that they're becoming, and all that. Oh, I'm so excited! And I'mhaving such a good time watching them! Oh, I don't mean watching themin a disagreeable way, so that they _see_ it; and, of course, I don'tlisten--not the sneak kind of listening. But, of course, I have to getall I can--for the book, you know; and, of course, if I just happento be in the window-seat corner in the library and hear thingsaccidentally, why, that's all right.And I have heard things.He says her eyes are lovely. He likes her best in blue. He's verylonely, and he never found a woman before who really understood him.He thinks her soul and his are tuned to the same string. (Oh, dear!That sounds funny and horrid, and not at all the way it did when _he_said it. It was beautiful then. But--well, that is what it meant,anyway.)She told him she was lonely, too, and that she was very glad tohave him for a friend; and he said he prized her friendship aboveeverything else in the world. And he looks at her, and follows heraround the room with his eyes; and she blushes up real pink and prettylots of times when he comes into the room.Now, if that isn't making love to each other, I don't know what _is_.I'm sure he's going to propose. Oh, I'm so excited!Oh, yes, I know if he does propose and she says yes, he'll be my newfather. I understand that. And, of course, I can't help wondering howI'll like it. Sometimes I think I won't like it at all. Sometimes Ialmost catch myself wishing that I didn't have to have any new fatheror mother. I'd _never_ need a new mother, anyway, and I wouldn't needa new father if my father-by-order-of-the-court would be as nice as hewas there two or three times in the observatory.But, there! After all, I must remember that I'm not the one that'sdoing the choosing. It's Mother. And if she wants the violinist Imustn't have anything to say. Besides, I really like him very much,anyway. He's the best of the lot. I'm sure of that. And that'ssomething. And then, of course, I'm glad to have something to makethis a love story, and best of all I would be glad to have Mother stopbeing divorced, anyway.Mr. Harlow doesn't come here any more, I guess. Anyway, I haven't seenhim here once since I came back; and I haven't heard anybody mentionhis name.Quite a lot of the others are here, and there are some new ones. Butthe violinist is here most, and Mother seems to go out with him mostto places. That's why I say I think it's the violinist.I haven't heard from Father.Now just my writing that down that way shows that I _expected_ to hearfrom him, though I don't really see why I should, either. Of course,he never _has_ written to me; and, of course, I understand that I'mnothing but his daughter by order of the court. But, some way, I didthink maybe he'd write me just a little bit of a note in answer tomine--my bread-and-butter letter, I mean; for of course, Mother had mewrite that to him as soon as I got here.But he hasn't.I wonder how he's getting along, and if he misses me any. But ofcourse, he doesn't do _that_. If I was a star, now--!       *       *       *       *       *_Two days after Thanksgiving_.The violinist has got a rival. I'm sure he has. It's Mr. Easterbrook.He's old--much as forty--and bald-headed and fat, and has got lots ofmoney. And he's a very estimable man. (I heard Aunt Hattie say that.)He's awfully jolly, and I like him. He brings me the loveliest boxesof candy, and calls me Puss. (I don't like _that_, particularly. I'dprefer him to call me Miss Anderson.) He's not nearly so good-lookingas the violinist. The violinist is lots more thrilling, but Ishouldn't wonder if Mr. Easterbrook was more comfortable to live with.The violinist is the kind of a man that makes you want to sit up andtake notice, and have your hair and finger nails and shoes just right;but with Mr. Easterbrook you wouldn't mind a bit sitting in a bigchair before the fire with a pair of old slippers on, if your feetwere tired.Mr. Easterbrook doesn't care for music. He's a broker. He looksawfully bored when the violinist is playing, and he fidgets with hiswatch-chain, and clears his throat very loudly just before hespeaks every time. His automobile is bigger and handsomer than theviolinist's. (Aunt Hattie says the violinist's automobile is a hiredone.) And Mr. Easterbrook's flowers that he sends to Mother arehandsomer, too, and lots more of them, than the violinist's. AuntHattie has noticed that, too. In fact, I guess there isn't anythingabout Mr. Easterbrook that she doesn't notice.Aunt Hattie likes Mr. Easterbrook lots better than she does theviolinist. I heard her talking to Mother one day. She said that anyone that would look twice at a lazy, shiftless fiddler with probablynot a dollar laid by for a rainy day, when all the while there wasjust waiting to be picked an estimable gentleman of independentfortune and stable position like Mr. Easterbrook--well, she had heropinion of her; that's all. She meant Mother, of course. _I_ knewthat. I'm no child.Mother knew it, too; and she didn't like it. She flushed up and bither lip, and answered back, cold, like ice."I understand, of course, what you mean, Hattie; but even if Iacknowledged that this very estimable, unimpeachable gentleman waswaiting to be picked (which I do not), I should have to remind youthat I've already had one experience with an estimable, unimpeachablegentleman of independent fortune and stable position, and I do notcare for another.""But, my dear Madge," began Aunt Hattie again, "to marry a man without_any_ money--""I haven't married him yet," cut in Mother, cold again, like ice. "Butlet me tell you this, Hattie. I'd rather live on bread and water ina log cabin with the man I loved than in a palace with an estimable,unimpeachable gentleman who gave me the shivers every time he cameinto the room."And it was just after she said this that I interrupted. I was right inplain, sight in the window-seat reading; but I guess they'd forgottenI was there, for they both jumped a lot when I spoke. And yet I'llleave it to you if what I said wasn't perfectly natural."Of course, you would, Mother!" I cried. "And, anyhow, if you didmarry the violinist, and you found out afterward you didn't like him,that wouldn't matter a mite, for you could _un_marry him at any time,just as you did Father, and--"But they wouldn't let me finish. They wouldn't let me say anythingmore. Mother cried, "_Marie_!" in her most I'm-shocked-at-you voice;and Aunt Hattie cried, "Child--child!" And she seemed shocked, too.And both of them threw up their hands and looked at each other in thedid-you-ever-hear-such-a-dreadful-thing? way that old folks do whenyoung folks have displeased them. And them they both went right out ofthe room, talking about the unfortunate effect on a child's mind, andperverted morals, and Mother reproaching Aunt Hattie for talking aboutthose things before that child (meaning me, of course). Then they gottoo far down the hall for me to hear any more. But I don't see whythey needed to have made such a fuss. It wasn't any secret that Mothergot a divorce; and if she got one once, of course she could again.(That's what I'm going to do when I'm married, if I grow tired ofhim--my husband, I mean.) Oh, yes, I know Mrs. Mayhew and her crowddon't seem to think divorces are very nice; but there needn't anybodytry to make me think that anything my mother does isn't perfectly niceand all right. And _she_ got a divorce. So, there!       *       *       *       *       *_One week later_.There hasn't much happened--only one or two things. But maybe I'dbetter tell them before I forget it, especially as they have a gooddeal to do with the love part of the story. And I'm always so glad toget anything of that kind. I've been so afraid this wouldn't be muchof a love story, after all. But I guess it will be, all right. Anyhow,I _know_ Mother's part will be, for it's getting more and moreexciting--about Mr. Easterbrook and the violinist, I mean.They both want Mother. Anybody can see that now, and, of course,Mother sees it. But which she'll take I don't know. Nobody knows. It'sperfectly plain to be seen, though, which one Grandfather and AuntHattie want her to take! It's Mr. Easterbrook.And he is awfully nice. He brought me a perfectly beautiful braceletthe other day--but Mother wouldn't let me keep it. So he had to takeit back. I don't think he liked it very well, and I didn't like it,either. I _wanted_ that bracelet. But Mother says I'm much too youngto wear much jewelry. Oh, will the time ever come when I'll be oldenough to take my proper place in the world? Sometimes it seems as ifit never would!Well, as I said, it's plain to be seen who it is that Grandfatherand Aunt Hattie favor; but I'm not so sure about Mother. Mother actsfunny. Sometimes she won't go with either of them anywhere; then sheseems to want to go all the time. And she acts as if she didn't carewhich she went with, so long as she was just going--somewhere. Ithink, though, she really likes the violinist the best; and I guessGrandfather and Aunt Hattie think so, too.Something happened last night. Grandfather began to talk at thedinner-table. He'd heard something he didn't like about the violinist,I guess, and he started in to tell Mother. But they stopped him.Mother and Aunt Hattie looked at him and then at me, and then back tohim, in their most see-who's-here!--you-mustn't-talk-before-her way.So he shrugged his shoulders and stopped.But I guess he told them in the library afterwards, for I heard themall talking very excitedly, and some loud; and I guess Mother didn'tlike what they said, and got quite angry, for I heard her say, whenshe came out through the door, that she didn't believe a word of it,and she thought it was a wicked, cruel shame to tell stories like thatjust because they didn't like a man.This morning she broke an engagement with Mr. Easterbrook to goauto-riding and went with the violinist to a morning musicale instead;and after she'd gone Aunt Hattie sighed and looked at Grandfather andshrugged her shoulders, and said she was afraid they'd driven herstraight into the arms of the one they wanted to avoid, and that Madgealways _would_ take the part of the under dog.I suppose they thought I wouldn't understand. But I did, perfectly.They meant that by telling stories about the violinist they'd beenhoping to get her to give him up, but instead of that, they'd made herturn to him all the more, just because she was so sorry for him.Funny, isn't it?       *       *       *       *       *_One week later_.Well, I guess now something has happened all right! And let me sayright away that _I_ don't like that violinist now, either, any betterthan Grandfather and Aunt Hattie. And it's not entirely because ofwhat happened last night, either. It's been coming on for quite awhile--ever since I first saw him talking to Theresa in the hall whenshe let him in one night a week ago.Theresa is awfully pretty, and I guess he thinks, so. Anyhow, I heardhim telling her so in the hall, and she laughed and blushed and lookedsideways at him. Then they saw me, and he stiffened up and said, veryproper and dignified, "Kindly hand my card to Mrs. Anderson." AndTheresa said, "Yes, sir." And she was very proper and dignified, too.Well, that was the beginning. I can see now that it was, though, Inever thought of its meaning anything then, only that he thoughtTheresa was a pretty girl, just as we all do.But four days ago I saw them again. He tried to put his arm around herthat time, and the very next day he tried to kiss her, and after aminute she let him. More than once, too. And last night I heard himtell her she was the dearest girl in all the world, and he'd beperfectly happy if he could only marry her.Well, you can imagine how I felt, when I thought all the time it wasMother he was coming to see! And now to find out that it was Theresahe wanted all the time, and he was only coming to see Mother so hecould see Theresa!At first I was angry,--just plain angry; and I was frightened, too,for I couldn't help worrying about Mother--for fear she would mind,you know, when she found out that it was Theresa that he cared for,after all. I remembered what a lot Mother had been with him, and thepretty dresses and hats she'd put on for him, and all that. And Ithought how she'd broken engagements with Mr. Easterbrook to go withhim, and it made me angry all over again. And I thought how _mean_ itwas of him to use poor Mother as a kind of shield to hide his courtingof Theresa! I was angry, too, to have my love story all spoiled, whenI was getting along so beautifully with Mother and the violinist.But I'm feeling better now. I've been thinking it over. I don'tbelieve Mother's going to care so very much. I don't believe she'd_want_ a man that would pretend to come courting her, when all thewhile he was really courting the hired girl--I mean maid. Besides,there's Mr. Easterbrook left (and one or two others that I haven'tsaid much about, as I didn't think they had much chance). And so faras the love story for the book is concerned, _that_ isn't spoiled,after all, for it will be ever so much more exciting to have theviolinist fall in love with Theresa than with Mother, for, of course,Theresa isn't in the same station of life at all, and that makes ita--a mess-alliance. (I don't remember exactly what that word is; butI know it means an alliance that makes a mess of things because thelovers are not equal to each other.) Of course, for the folks who haveto live it, it may not be so nice; but for my story here this makes itall the more romantic and thrilling. So _that's_ all right.Of course, so far, I'm the only one that knows, for I haven't told it,and I'm the only one that's seen anything. Of course, I shall warnMother, if I think it's necessary, so she'll understand it isn't her,but Theresa, that the violinist is really in love with and courting._She_ won't mind, I'm sure, after she thinks of it a minute. And won'tit be a good joke on Aunt Hattie and Grandfather when they find outthey've been fooled all the time, supposing it's Mother, and worryingabout it?Oh, I don't know! This is some love story, after all!       *       *       *       *       *_Two days later._Well, I should say it was! What do you suppose has happened now? Why,that wretched violinist is nothing but a deep-dyed villain! Listenwhat he did. He proposed to Mother--actually proposed to her--andafter all he'd said to that Theresa girl, about his being perfectlyhappy if he could marry _her_. And Mother--Mother all the time notknowing! Oh, I'm so glad I was there to rescue her! I don't mean atthe proposal--I didn't hear that. But afterward.It was like this.They had been out automobiling--Mother and the violinist. He came forher at three o'clock. He said it was a beautiful warm day, and maybethe last one they'd have this year; and she must go. And she went.I was in my favorite window-seat, reading, when they came home andwalked into the library. They never looked my way at all, but justwalked toward the fireplace. And there he took hold of both her handsand said:"Why must you wait, darling? Why can't you give me my answer now, andmake me the happiest man in all the world?""Yes, yes, I know," answered Mother; and I knew by her voice thatshe was all shaky and trembly. "But if I could only be sure--sure ofmyself.""But, dearest, you're sure of me!" cried the violinist. "You _know_how I love you. You know you're the only woman I have ever loved, orever could love!"Yes, just like that he said it--that awful lie--and to my mother. Mystars! Do you suppose I waited to hear any more? I guess not![Illustration: "WHY MUST YOU WAIT, DARLING?"]I fairly tumbled off my seat, and my book dropped with a bang, as Iran forward. Dear, dear, but how they did jump--both of them! And Iguess they _were_ surprised. I never thought how 'twas going to affectthem--my breaking in like that. But I didn't wait--not a minute. AndI didn't apologize, or say "Excuse me," or any of those things thatI suppose I ought to have done. I just started right in and began totalk. And I talked hard and fast, and lots of it.I don't know now what I said, but I know I asked him what he meant bysaying such an awful lie to my mother, when he'd just said the samething, exactly 'most, to Theresa, and he'd hugged her and kissed her,and everything. I'd _seen_ him. And--But I didn't get a chance to say half I wanted to. I was going on totell him what I thought of him; but Mother gasped out, "Marie! _Marie!Stop_!"And then I stopped. I had to, of course. Then she said that would do,and I might go to my room. And I went. And that's all I know about it,except that she came up, after a little, and said for me not to talkany more about it, to her, or to any one else; and to please try toforget it.I tried to tell her what I'd seen, and what I'd heard that wicked,deep-dyed villain say; but she wouldn't let me. She shook her head,and said, "Hush, hush, dear"; and that no good could come of talkingof it, and she wanted me to forget it. She was very sweet and verygentle, and she smiled; but there were stern corners to her mouth,even when the smile was there. And I guess she told him what was what.Anyhow, I know they had quite a talk before she came up to me, for Iwas watching at the window for him to go; and when he did go helooked very red and cross, and he stalked away with anever-will-I-darken-this-door-again kind of a step, just as far as Icould see him.I don't know, of course, what will happen next, nor whether he'll evercome back for Theresa; but I shouldn't think even _she_ would wanthim, after this, if she found out.And now where's _my_ love story coming in, I should like to know?       *       *       *       *       *_Two days after Christmas_.Another wonderful thing has happened. I've had a letter fromFather--from _Father_--a _letter_--ME!It came this morning. Mother brought it in to me. She looked queer--alittle. There were two red spots in her cheeks, and her eyes were verybright."I think you have a letter here from--your father," she said, handingit out.She hesitated before the "your father" just as she always does. And'tisn't hardly ever that she mentions his name, anyway. But when shedoes, she always stops a funny little minute before it, just as shedid to-day.And perhaps I'd better say right here, before I forget it, that Motherhas been different, some way, ever since that time when the violinistproposed. I don't think she _cares_ really--about the violinist, Imean--but she's just sort of upset over it. I heard her talking toAunt Hattie one day about it, and she said:"To think such a thing could happen--to _me_! And when for a minute Iwas really hesitating and thinking that maybe I _would_ take him. Oh,Hattie!"And Aunt Hattie put her lips together with her most I-told-you-so air,and said:"It was, indeed, a narrow escape, Madge; and it ought to show you theworth of a real man. There's Mr. Easterbrook, now--"But Mother wouldn't even listen then. She pooh-poohed and tossed herhead, and said, "Mr. Easterbrook, indeed!" and put her hands to herears, laughing, but in earnest just the same, and ran out of the room.And she doesn't go so much with Mr. Easterbrook as she did. Oh, shegoes with him some, but not enough to make it a bit interesting--forthis novel, I mean--nor with any of the others, either. In fact, I'mafraid there isn't much chance now of Mother's having a love story tomake this book right. Only the other day I heard her tell Grandfatherand Aunt Hattie that _all_ men were a delusion and a snare. Oh, shelaughed as she said it. But she was in earnest, just the same. I couldsee that. And she doesn't seem to care much for any of the differentmen that come to see her. She seems to ever so much rather stay withme. In fact, she stays with me a lot these days--almost all the timeI'm out of school, indeed. And she talks with me--oh, she talks withme about lots of things. (I love to have her talk with me. You knowthere's a lot of difference between talking _with_ folks and _to_folks. Now, Father always talks _to_ folks.)One day it was about getting married that Mother talked with me, andI said I was so glad that when you didn't like being married, or gottired of your husband, you could get _un_married, just as she did, andgo back home and be just the same as you were before.But Mother didn't like that, at all. She said no, no, and that Imustn't talk like that, and that you _couldn't_ go back and be thesame. And that she'd found it out. That she used to think you could.But you couldn't. She said it was like what she read once, that youcouldn't really be the same any more than you could put the dress youwere wearing back on the shelf in the store, and expect it to turnback into a fine long web of cloth all folded up nice and tidy, as itwas in the first place. And, of course, you couldn't do that--afterthe cloth was all cut up into a dress!She said more things, too; and after Father's letter came she saidstill more. Oh, and I haven't told yet about the letter, have I? Well,I will now.As I said at first, Mother brought it in and handed it over to me,saying she guessed it was from Father. And I could see she waswondering what could be in it. But I guess she wasn't wondering anymore than _I_ was, only I was gladder to get it than she was, Isuppose. Anyhow, when she saw _how_ glad I was, and how I jumped forthe letter, she drew back, and looked somehow as if she'd been hurt,and said:"I did not know, Marie, that a letter from--your father would mean somuch to you."I don't know what I did say to that. I guess I didn't say anything.I'd already begun to read the letter, and I was in such a hurry tofind out what he'd said.I'll copy it here. It wasn't long. It was like this:    MY DEAR MARY:    Some way Christmas has made me think of you. I wish I had sent you    some gift. Yet I have not the slightest idea what would please    you. To tell the truth, I tried to find something--but had to give    it up.    I am wondering if you had a good time, and what you did. After    all, I'm pretty sure you did have a good time, for you are    Marie now. You see I have not forgotten how tired you got of    being--Mary. Well, well, I do not know as I can blame you.    And now that I have asked what you did for Christmas, I suspect it    is no more than a fair turnabout to tell you what I did. I suppose    I had a very good time. Your Aunt Jane says I did. I heard her    telling one of the neighbors that last night. She said she left no    stone unturned to give me a good time. So, of course, I must have    had a good time.    She had a very fine dinner, and she invited Mrs. Darling and Miss    Snow and Miss Sanborn to eat it with us. She said she didn't want    me to feel lonesome. But you can feel real lonesome in a crowd    sometimes. Did you know that, Mary?    But I left them to their chatter after dinner and went out to the    observatory. I think I must have fallen asleep on the couch there,    for it was quite dark when I awoke. But I didn't mind that,    for there were some observations I wanted to take. It was a    beautifully clear night, so I stayed there till nearly morning.    How about it? I suppose Marie plays the piano every day now,    doesn't she? The piano here hasn't been touched since you went    away. Oh, yes, it was touched once. Your aunt played hymns on it    for a missionary meeting.    Well, what did you do Christmas? Suppose you write and tell    Your    FATHERI'd been reading the letter out loud, and when I got through Motherwas pacing up and down the room. For a minute she didn't say anything;then she whirled 'round suddenly and faced me, and said, just as ifsomething inside of her was _making_ her say it:"I notice there is no mention of your mother in that letter, Marie. Isuppose--your father has quite forgotten that there is such a personin the world as--I."But I told her no, oh, no, and that I was sure he remembered her,for he used to ask me questions often about what she did, and theviolinist and all."The violinist!" cried Mother, whirling around on me again. (She'dbegun to walk up and down once more.) "You don't mean to say you evertold your father about _him_!""Oh, no, not everything," I explained, trying to show how patient Iwas, so she would be patient, too. (But it didn't work.) "I couldn'ttell him everything because everything hadn't happened then. But Itold about his being here, and about the others, too; but, of course,I said I didn't know which you'd take, and--""You told him you didn't know _which I'd take_!" gasped Mother.Just like that she interrupted, and she looked so shocked. And shedidn't look much better when I explained very carefully what I didsay, even though I assured her over and over again that Father wasinterested, very much interested. When I said that, she just muttered,"Interested, indeed!" under her breath. Then she began to walk again,up and down, up and down. Then, all of a sudden, she flung herself onthe couch and began to cry and sob as if her heart would break. Andwhen I tried to comfort her, I only seemed to make it worse, for shethrew her arms around me and cried:"Oh, my darling, my darling, don't you see how dreadful it is, howdreadful it is?"And then is when she began to talk some more about being married, and_un_married as we were. She held me close again and began to sob andcry."Oh, my darling, don't you see how dreadful it all is--how unnaturalit is for us to live--this way? And for you--you poor child!--whatcould be worse for you? And here I am, jealous--jealous of your ownfather, for fear you'll love him better than you do me!"Oh, I know I ought not to say all this to you--I know I ought not to.But I can't--help it. I want you! I want you every minute; but I haveto give you up--six whole months of every year I have to give you upto him. And he's your father, Marie. And he's a good man. I know he'sa good man. I know it all the better now since I've seen--other men.And I ought to tell you to love him. But I'm so afraid--you'll lovehim better than you do me, and want to leave--me. And I can't give youup! I can't give you up!"Then I tried to tell her, of course, that she wouldn't have to giveme up, and that I loved her a whole lot better than I did Father. Buteven that didn't comfort her, 'cause she said I _ought_ to love _him_.That he was lonesome and needed me. He needed me just as much asshe needed me, and maybe more. And then she went on again about howunnatural and awful it was to live the way we were living. And shecalled herself a wicked woman that she'd ever allowed things to get tosuch a pass. And she said if she could only have her life to live overagain she'd do so differently--oh, so differently.Then she began to cry again, and I couldn't do a thing with her; andof course, that worked me all up and I began to cry.She stopped then, right off short, and wiped her eyes fiercely withher wet ball of a handkerchief. And she asked what was she thinkingof, and didn't she know any better than to talk like this to me. Thenshe said, come, we'd go for a ride.And we did.And all the rest of that day Mother was so gay and lively you'd thinkshe didn't know how to cry.Now, wasn't that funny?Of course, I shall answer Father's letter right away, but I haven'tthe faintest idea _what_ to say.       *       *       *       *       *_One week later._I answered it--Father's letter, I mean--yesterday, and it's gone now.But I had an awful time over it. I just didn't know what in the worldto say. I'd start out all right, and I'd think I was going to getalong beautifully. Then, all of a sudden, it would come over me, whatI was doing--_writing a letter to my father_! And I could imagine justhow he'd look when he got it, all stern and dignified, sitting inhis chair in the library, and opening the letter _just so_ with hispaper-cutter; and I'd imagine his eyes looking down and reading what Iwrote. And when I thought of that, my pen just wouldn't go. The ideaof _my_ writing anything my father would want to read!And so I'd try to think of things that I could write--big things--bigthings that would interest big men: about the President, andour-country-'tis-of-thee, and the state of the weather and the crops.And so I'd begin:"Dear Father: I take my pen in hand to inform you that--"Then I'd stop and think and think, and chew my pen-handle. Then I'dput down _something_. But it was awful, and I knew it was awful. SoI'd have to tear it up and begin again. Three times I did that; then Ibegan to cry. It did seem as if I never could write that letter. OnceI thought of asking Mother what to say, and getting her to help me.Then I remembered how she cried and took on and said things when theletter came, and talked about how dreadful and unnatural it all was,and how she was jealous for fear I'd love Father better than I didher. And I was afraid she'd do it again, and so I didn't like to askher. And so I didn't do it.Then, after a time, I got out his letter and read it again. And all ofa sudden I felt all warm and happy, just as I did when I first got it;and some way I was back with him in the observatory and he was tellingme all about the stars. And I forgot all about being afraid of him,and about the crops and the President and my-country-'tis-of-thee.And I just remembered that he'd asked me to tell him what I did onChristmas Day; and I knew right off that that would be easy. Why, justthe easiest thing in the world! And so I got out a fresh sheet ofpaper and dipped my pen in the ink and began again.And this time I didn't have a bit of trouble. I told him all about thetree I had Christmas Eve, and the presents, and the little coloredlights, and the fun we had singing and playing games. And then how, onChristmas morning, there was a lovely new snow on the ground, and Mr.Easterbrook came with a perfectly lovely sleigh and two horses to takeMother and me to ride, and what a splendid time we had, and how lovelyMother looked with her red cheeks and bright eyes, and how, when wegot home, Mr. Easterbrook said we looked more like sisters than motherand daughter, and wasn't that nice of him. Of course, I told a littlemore about Mr. Easterbrook, too, so Father'd know who he was--a newfriend of Mother's that I'd never known till I came back this time,and how he was very rich and a most estimable man. That Aunt Hattiesaid so.Then I told him that in the afternoon another gentleman came and tookus to a perfectly beautiful concert. And I finished up by tellingabout the Christmas party in the evening, and how lovely the houselooked, and Mother, and that they said I looked nice, too.And that was all. And when I had got it done, I saw that I had writtena long letter, a great long letter. And I was almost afraid it wastoo long, till I remembered that Father had asked me for it; he had_asked_ me to tell him all about what I did on Christmas Day.So I sent it off.       *       *       *       *       *_March_.Yes, I know it's been quite a while, but there hasn't been a thing tosay--nothing new or exciting, I mean. There's just school, and theusual things; only Mr. Easterbrook doesn't come any more. (Of course,the violinist hasn't come since that day he proposed.) I don't knowwhether Mr. Easterbrook proposed or not. I only know that all of asudden he stopped coming. I don't know the reason.I don't overhear so much as I used to, anyway. Not but that I'm in thelibrary window-seat just the same; but 'most everybody that comes inlooks there right off, now; and, of course, when they see me theydon't hardly ever go on with what they are saying. So it justnaturally follows that I don't overhear things as I used to.Not that there's much to hear, though. Really, there just isn'tanything going on, and things aren't half so lively as they used to bewhen Mr. Easterbrook was here, and all the rest. They've all stoppedcoming, now, 'most. I've about given up ever having a love story ofMother's to put in.And mine, too. Here I am fifteen next month, going on sixteen. (Why,that brook and river met long ago!) But Mother is getting to be almostas bad as Aunt Jane was about my receiving proper attentions fromyoung men. Oh, she lets me go to places, a little, with the boys atschool; but I always have to be chaperoned. And whenever are theygoing to have a chance to say anything really _thrilling_ with Motheror Aunt Hattie right at my elbow? Echo answers never! So I've aboutgiven up _that's_ amounting to anything, either.Of course, there's Father left, and of course, when I go back toAndersonville this summer, there may be something doing there. But Idoubt it.I forgot to say I haven't heard from Father again. I answered hisChristmas letter, as I said, and wrote just as nice as I knew how, andtold him all he asked me to. But he never answered, nor wrote again. Iam disappointed, I'll own up. I thought he would write. I think Motherdid, too. She's asked me ever so many times if I hadn't heard from himagain. And she always looks so sort of funny when I say no--sort ofglad and sorry together, all in one.But, then, Mother's queer in lots of ways now. For instance: Oneweek ago she gave me a perfectly lovely box of chocolates--a wholetwo-pound box all at once; and I've never had more than a half-poundat once before. But just as I was thinking how for once I was going tohave a real feast, and all I wanted to eat--what do you think she toldme? She said I could have three pieces, and only three pieces a day;and not one little tiny one more. And when I asked her why she gave mesuch a big box for, then, if that was all I could have, she said itwas to teach me self-discipline. That self-discipline was one of themost wonderful things in the world. That if she'd only been taught itwhen she was a girl, her life would have been very, very different.And so she was giving me a great big box of chocolates for my veryown, just so as to teach me to deny myself and take only three piecesevery day.Three pieces!--and all that whole big box of them just making mymouth water all the while; and all just to teach me that horrid oldself-discipline! Why, you'd think it was Aunt Jane doing it instead ofMother!       *       *       *       *       *_One week later._It's come--Father's letter. It came last night. Oh, it was short, andit didn't say anything about what _I_ wrote. But I was proud of it,just the same. I just guess I was! There wasn't much in it but justthat I might stay till the school closed in June, and then come. But_he wrote it_. He didn't get Aunt Jane to write to Mother, as he didbefore. And then, besides, he must have forgotten his stars longenough to think of me a _little_--for he remembered about the school,and that I couldn't go there in Andersonville, and so he said I hadbetter stay here till it finished.And I was so glad to stay! It made me very happy--that letter. It madeMother happy, too. She liked it, and she thought it was very, verykind of Father to be willing to give me up almost three whole monthsof his six, so I could go to school here. And she said so. She saidonce to Aunt Hattie that she was almost tempted to write and thankhim. But Aunt Hattie said, "Pooh," and it was no more than he ought todo, and that _she_ wouldn't be seen writing to a man who so carefullyavoided writing to _her_. So Mother didn't do it, I guess.But I wrote. I had to write three letters, though, before I got onethat Mother said would do to send. The first one sounded so _glad_ Iwas staying that Mother said she was afraid he would feel hurt, andthat would be too bad--when he'd been so kind. And the second onesounded as if I was so _sorry_ not to go to Andersonville the first ofApril that Mother said that would never do in the world. He'd thinkI didn't _want_ to stay in Boston. But the third letter I managed tomake just glad enough to stay, and just sorry enough not to go. Sothat Mother said it was all right. And I sent it. You see I _asked_Mother to help me about this letter. I knew she wouldn't cry and moanabout being jealous this time. And she didn't. She was real excitedand happy over it.       *       *       *       *       *_April_.Well, the last chocolate drop went yesterday. There were justseventy-six pieces in that two-pound box. I counted them that firstday. Of course, they were fine and dandy, and I just loved them; butthe trouble is, for the last week I've been eating such snippy littlepieces. You see, every day, without thinking, I'd just naturally pickout the biggest pieces. So you can imagine what they got down totoward the last--mostly chocolate almonds.As for the self-discipline--I don't see as I feel any more disciplinedthan I did before, and I _know_ I want chocolates just as much asever. And I said so to Mother.But Mother _is_ queer. Honestly she is. And I can't help wondering--isshe getting to be like Aunt Jane?Now, listen to this:Last week I had to have a new party dress, and we found a perfectdarling of a pink silk, all gold beads, and gold slippers to match.And I knew I'd look perfectly divine in it; and once Mother would havegot it for me. But not this time. She got a horrid white muslin withdots in it, and a blue silk sash, suitable for a child--for any child.Of course, I was disappointed, and I suppose I did show it--some. Infact, I'm afraid I showed it a whole lot. Mother didn't say anything_then_; but on the way home in the car she put her arm around me andsaid:"I'm sorry about the pink dress, dear. I knew you wanted it. But itwas not suitable at all for you--not until you're older, dear."She stopped a minute, then went on with another little hug:"Mother will have to look out that her little daughter isn't gettingto be vain, and too fond of dress."I knew then, of course, that it was just some more of thatself-discipline business.But Mother never used to say anything about self-discipline._Is_ she getting to be like Aunt Jane?       *       *       *       *       *_One week later._She is.I _know_ she is now.I'm learning to cook--_to cook_! And it's Mother that says I must. Shetold Aunt Hattie--I heard her--that she thought every girl shouldknow how to cook and to keep house; and that if she had learned thosethings when she was a girl, her life would have been quite different,she was sure.Of course, I'm not learning in Aunt Hattie's kitchen. Aunt Hattie'sgot a new cook, and she's worse than Olga used to be--about notwanting folks messing around, I mean. So Aunt Hattie said right offthat we couldn't do it there. I am learning at a Domestic ScienceSchool, and Mother is going with me. I didn't mind so much when shesaid she'd go, too. And, really, it is quite a lot of fun--really itis. But it _is_ queer--Mother and I going to school together to learnhow to make bread and cake and boil potatoes! And, of course, AuntHattie laughs at us. But I don't mind. And Mother doesn't, either.But, oh, how Aunt Jane would love it, if she only knew!       *       *       *       *       *_May_.Something is the matter with Mother, certainly. She's acting queererand queerer, and she _is_ getting to be like Aunt Jane. Why, only thismorning she hushed me up from laughing so loud, and stopped myromping up and down the stairs with Lester. She said it was noisy andunladylike--and only just a little while ago she just loved to have melaugh and play and be happy! And when I said so to her this morning,she said, yes, yes, of course, and she wanted me to be happy now, onlyshe wished to remind me that very soon I was going back to my fatherin Andersonville, and that I ought to begin now to learn to be morequiet, so as not to trouble him when I got there.Now, what do you think of that?And another thing. What _do_ you suppose I am learning about _now_?You'd never guess. Stars. Yes, _stars_! And that is for Father, too.Mother came into my room one day with a book of Grandfather's underher arm. She said it was a very wonderful work on astronomy, and shewas sure I would find it interesting. She said she was going to readit aloud to me an hour a day. And then, when I got to Andersonvilleand Father talked to me, I'd _know_ something. And he'd be pleased.She said she thought we owed it to Father, after he'd been so good andkind as to let me stay here almost three whole months of his six, soI could keep on with my school. And that she was very sure this wouldplease him and make him happy.And so, for 'most a week now, Mother has read to me an hour a dayout of that astronomy book. Then we talk about it. And it _is_interesting. Mother says it is, too. She says she wishes _she'd_ knownsomething about astronomy when she was a girl; that she's sure itwould have made things a whole lot easier and happier all around, whenshe married Father; for then she would have known something aboutsomething _he_ was interested in. She said she couldn't help thatnow, of course; but she could see that _I_ knew something about suchthings. And that was why she was reading to me now. Then she saidagain that she thought we owed it to Father, when he'd been so good tolet me stay.It seems so funny to hear her talk such a lot about Father as shedoes, when before she never used to mention him--only to say howafraid she was that I would love him better than I did her, and tomake me say over and over again that I didn't. And I said so one dayto her--I mean, I said I thought it was funny, the way she talked now.She colored up and bit her lip, and gave a queer little laugh. Thenshe grew very sober and grave, and said:"I know, dear. Perhaps I am talking more than I used to. But, you see,I've been thinking quite a lot, and I--I've learned some things. Andnow, since your father has been so kind and generous in giving you upto me so much of his time, I--I've grown ashamed; and I'm trying tomake you forget what I said--about your loving me more than him. Thatwasn't right, dear. Mother was wrong. She shouldn't try to influenceyou against your father. He is a good man; and there are none too manygood men in the world--No, no, I won't say that," she broke off.But she'd already said it, and, of course, I knew she was thinking ofthe violinist. I'm no child.She went on more after that, quite a lot more. And she said again thatI must love Father and try to please him in every way; and she cried alittle and talked a lot about how hard it was in my position, andthat she was afraid she'd only been making it harder, through herselfishness, and I must forgive her, and try to forget it. And shewas very sure she'd do better now. And she said that, after all, lifewasn't in just being happy yourself. It was in how much happiness youcould give to others.Oh, it was lovely! And I cried, and she cried some more, and wekissed each other, and I promised. And after she went away I felt allupraised and holy, like you do when you've been to a beautiful churchservice with soft music and colored windows, and everybody kneeling.And I felt as if I'd never be naughty or thoughtless again. And thatI'd never mind being Mary now. Why, I'd be glad to be Mary half thetime, and even more--for Father.But, alas!Listen. Would you believe it? Just that same evening Mother stopped meagain laughing too loud and making too much noise playing with Lester;and I felt real cross. I just boiled inside of me, and said I hatedMary, and that Mother _was_ getting to be just like Aunt Jane. Andyet, just that morning--Oh, if only that hushed, stained-window-soft-music feeling _would_last!       *       *       *       *       *_June_.Well, once more school is done, my trunk is all packed, and I'm readyto go to Andersonville. I leave to-morrow morning. But not as I leftlast year. Oh, no. It is very, very different. Why, this year I'mreally _going_ as Mary. Honestly, Mother has turned me into Mary_before I go_. Now, what do you think of that? And if I've got to beMary there and Mary here, too, when can I ever be _Marie_? Oh, I knowI _said_ I'd be willing to be Mary half, and maybe more than half, thetime. But when it comes to really _being_ Mary out of turn extra time,that is quite another thing.And I am Mary.Listen:I've learned to cook. That's Mary.I've been studying astronomy. That's Mary.I've learned to walk quietly, speak softly, laugh not too loudly, andbe a lady at all times. That's Mary.And now, to add to all this, Mother has had me _dress_ like Mary. Yes,she began two weeks ago. She came into my room one morning and saidshe wanted to look over my dresses and things; and I could see, by theway she frowned and bit her lip and tapped her foot on the floor, thatshe wasn't suited. And I was glad; for, of course, I always like tohave new things. So I was pleased when she said:"I think, my dear, that on Saturday we'll have to go in town shopping.Quite a number of these things will not do at all."And I was so happy! Visions of new dresses and hats and shoes rosebefore me, and even the pink beaded silk came into my mind--though Ididn't really have much hopes of that.Well, we went shopping on Saturday, but--did we get the pink silk? Wedid not. We did get--you'd never guess what. We got two new ginghamdresses, very plain and homely, and a pair of horrid, thick low shoes.Why, I could have cried! I did 'most cry as I exclaimed:"Why, Mother, those are _Mary_ things!""Of course, they're Mary things," answered Mother, cheerfully--thekind of cheerfulness that says: "I'm being good and you ought to be."Then she went on. "That's what I meant to buy--Mary things, as youcall them. Aren't you going to be Mary just next week? Of course, youare! And didn't you tell me last year, as soon as you got there, MissAnderson objected to your clothing and bought new for you? Well, I amtrying to see that she does not have to do that this year."And then she bought me a brown serge suit and a hat so tiresomelysensible that even Aunt Jane will love them, I know. And to-morrowI've got to put them on to go in.Do you wonder that I say I am Mary already?CHAPTER VIIWHEN I AM NEITHER ONEANDERSONVILLE.Well, I came last night. I had on the brown suit and the sensible hat,and every turn of the wheels all day had been singing: "Mary, Mary,now you're Mary!" Why, Mother even _called_ me Mary when she saidgood-bye. She came to the junction with me just as she had before, andput me on the other train."Now, remember, dear, you're to try very hard to be a joy and acomfort to your father--just the little Mary that he wants you to be.Remember, he has been very kind to let you stay with me so long."She cried when she kissed me just as she did before; but she didn'ttell me this time to be sure and not love Father better than I didher. I noticed that. But, of course, I didn't say anything, though Imight have told her easily that I knew nothing could ever make me love_him_ better than I did _her_.But I honestly tried, as long as I was dressed like Mary, to feel likeMary; and I made up my mind that I would _be_ Mary, too, just as wellas I knew how to be, so that even Aunt Jane couldn't find any faultwith me. And I'd try to please Father, and make him not mind my beingthere, even if I couldn't make him love me. And as I got to thinkingof it, I was _glad_ that I had on the Mary things, so I wouldn't haveto make any change. Then I could show Aunt Jane that I was reallygoing to be Mary, right along from the start, when she met me atthe station. And I would show Father, too, if he was at home. And Icouldn't help hoping he _would_ be home this time, and not off to lookat any old stars or eclipses.When we got to Andersonville, and the train rolled into the station, I'most forgot, for a minute, and ran down the aisle, so as to get outquick. I was so excited! But right away I thought of Aunt Jane andthat she might see me; so I slowed down to a walk, and I let quite alot of other folks get ahead of me, as I was sure Mary ought to. Yousee, I was determined to be a good little Mary from the very start, sothat even Aunt Jane couldn't find a word of fault--not even with myactions. I knew she couldn't with my clothes!Well, I stepped down from the cars and looked over to where thecarriages were to find John and Aunt Jane. But they weren't there.There wasn't even the carriage there; and I can remember now just howmy heart sort of felt sick inside of me when I thought that even AuntJane had forgotten, and that there wasn't anybody to meet me.There was a beautiful big green automobile there, and I thought howI wished _that_ had come to meet me; and I was just wondering what Ishould do, when all of a sudden somebody spoke my name. And who do youthink it was? You'd never guess it in a month. It was _Father_. Yes,FATHER!Why, I could have hugged him, I was so glad. But of course I didn't,right before all those people. But he was so tall and handsome andsplendid, and I felt so proud to be walking along the platform withhim and letting folks see that he'd come to meet me! But I couldn'tsay anything--not anything, the way I wanted to; and all I could dowas to stammer out:"Why, where's Aunt Jane?"And that's just the thing I didn't _want_ to say; and I knew it theminute I'd said it. Why, it sounded as if I missed Aunt Jane, andwanted _her_ instead of _him_, when all the time I was so pleased andexcited to see him that I could hardly speak.I don't know whether Father liked it, or minded it. I couldn't tell byhis face. He just kind of smiled, and looked queer, and said that AuntJane--er--couldn't come. Then _I_ felt sorry; for I saw, of course,that that was why _he_ had come; not because he wanted to, but becauseAunt Jane couldn't, so he had to. And I could have cried, all thewhile he was fixing it up about my trunk.He turned then and led the way straight over to where the carriageswere, and the next minute there was John touching his cap to me;only it was a brand-new John looking too sweet for anything in achauffeur's cap and uniform. And, what do you think? He was helping meinto that beautiful big green car before I knew it."Why, Father, Father!" I cried. "You don't mean"--I just couldn'tfinish; but he finished for me."It is ours--yes. Do you like it?""Like it!" I guess he didn't need to have me say any more. But I didsay more. I just raved and raved over that car until Father's eyescrinkled all up in little smile wrinkles, and he said:"I'm glad. I hoped you'd like it.""I guess I do like it!" I cried. Then I went on to tell him how Ithought it was the prettiest one I ever saw, and 'way ahead of evenMr. Easterbrook's."And, pray, who is Mr. Easterbrook?" asked Father then. "Theviolinist, perhaps--eh?"Now, wasn't it funny he should have remembered that there was aviolinist? But, of course, I told him no, it wasn't the violinist. Itwas another one that took Mother to ride, the one I told him aboutin the Christmas letter; and he was very rich, and had two perfectlybeautiful cars; and I was going on to tell more--how he didn't takeMother now--but I didn't get a chance, for Father interrupted, andsaid, "Yes, yes, to be sure." And he _showed_ he wasn't interested,for all the little smile wrinkles were gone, and he looked stern anddignified, more like he used to. And he went on to say that, as we hadalmost reached home, he had better explain right away that Aunt Janewas no longer living there; that his cousin from the West, Mrs.Whitney, was keeping house for him now. She was a very nice lady, andhe hoped I would like her. And I might call her "Cousin Grace."And before I could even draw breath to ask any questions, we werehome; and a real pretty lady, with a light-blue dress on, was helpingme out of the car, and kissing me as she did so.Now, do you wonder that I have been rubbing my eyes and wondering if Iwas really I, and if this was Andersonville? Even now I'm not sure butit's a dream, and I shall wake up and find I've gone to sleep on thecars, and that the train is just drawing into the station, and thatJohn and the horses, and Aunt Jane in her I-don't-care-how-it-looksblack dress are there to meet me.       *       *       *       *       *_One week later_.It isn't a dream. It's all really, truly true--everything: Fathercoming to meet me, the lovely automobile, and the pretty lady in thelight-blue dress, who kissed me. And when I went downstairs the nextmorning I found out it was real, 'specially the pretty lady; for shekissed me again, and said she hoped I'd be happy there. And she neversaid one word about dusting one hour and studying one hour and weedingone hour. (Of course, she couldn't say anything about my clothes, forI was already in a Mary blue-gingham dress.) She just told me to amusemyself any way I liked, and said, if I wanted to, I might run over tosee some of the girls, but not to make any plans for the afternoon,for she was going to take me to ride.Now, what do you think of that? Go to see the girls in the morning,and take a ride--an automobile ride!--in the afternoon. _InAndersonville_! Why, I couldn't believe my ears. Of course, I was wildand crazy with delight--but it was all so different. Why, I began tothink almost that I was Marie, and not Mary at all.And it's been that way the whole week through. I've had a beautifultime. I've been so excited! And Mother is excited, too. Of course, Iwrote her and told her all about it right away. And she wrote rightback and wanted to know everything--everything I could tell her; allthe little things. And she was so interested in Cousin Grace, andwanted to know all about her; said _she_ never heard of her before,and was she Father's own cousin, and how old was she, and was shepretty, and was Father around the house more now, and did I see a lotof him? She thought from something I said that I did.I've just been writing her again, and I could tell her more now, ofcourse, than I could in that first letter. I've been here a wholeweek, and, of course, I know more about things, and have done more.I told her that Cousin Grace wasn't really Father's cousin at all, soit wasn't any wonder she hadn't ever heard of her. She was the wifeof Father's third cousin who went to South America six years ago andcaught the fever and died there. So this Mrs. Whitney isn't really anyrelation of his at all. But he'd always known her, even before shemarried his cousin; and so, when her husband died, and she didn't haveany home, he asked her to come here.I don't know why Aunt Jane went away, but she's been gone 'most fourmonths now, they say here. Nellie told me. Nellie is the maid--I meanhired girl--here now. (I _will_ keep forgetting that I'm Mary now andmust use the Mary words here.)I told Mother that she (Cousin Grace) was quite old, but not so oldas Aunt Jane. (I asked Nellie, and Nellie said she guessed she wasthirty-five, but she didn't look a day over twenty-five.) And she _is_pretty, and everybody loves her. I think even Father likes to have heraround better than he did his own sister Jane, for he sometimes staysaround quite a lot now--after meals, and in the evening, I mean. Andthat's what I told Mother. Oh, of course, he still likes his stars thebest of anything, but not quite as well as he used to, maybe--not togive _all_ his time to them.I haven't anything especial to write. I'm just having a beautifultime. Of course, I miss Mother, but I know I'm going to have her againin just September--I forgot to say that Father is going to let me goback to school again this year ahead of his time, just as he did lastyear.So you see, really, I'm here only a little bit of a while, as it isnow, and it's no wonder I keep forgetting I am Mary.I haven't got anything new for the love part of my story. I _am_ sorryabout that. But there just isn't anything, so I'm afraid the booknever will be a love story, anyway.Of course, I'm not with Mother now, so I don't know whether there'sanything there, or not; but I don't think there will be. And as forFather--I've pretty nearly given him up. Anyhow, there never used tobe any signs of hope for me there. As for myself--well, I've aboutgiven that up, too. I don't believe they're going to give me anychance to have anybody till I'm real old--probably not till I'mtwenty-one or two. And I can't wait all that time to finish this book.       *       *       *       *       *_One week later_.Things are awfully funny here this time. I wonder if it's all CousinGrace that makes it so. Anyhow, she's just as different as differentcan be from Aunt Jane. And _things_ are different, everywhere.Why, I forget half the time that I'm Mary. Honestly, I do. I try to beMary. I try to move quietly, speak gently, and laugh softly, just asMother told me to. But before I know it I'm acting natural again--justlike Marie, you know.And I believe it _is_ Cousin Grace. She never looks at you in AuntJane's I'm-amazed-at-you way. And she laughs herself a lot, and singsand plays, too--real pretty lively things; not just hymn tunes. Andthe house is different. There are four geraniums in the dining-roomwindow, and the parlor is open every day. The wax flowers are there,but the hair wreath and the coffin plate are gone. Cousin Gracedoesn't dress like Aunt Jane, either. She wears pretty white and bluedresses, and her hair is curly and fluffy.And so I think all this is why I keep forgetting to be Mary. But, ofcourse, I understand that Father expects me to be Mary, and so I tryto remember--only I can't. Why, I couldn't even show him how much Iknew about the stars. I tried to the other night. I went out to theobservatory where he was, and asked him questions about the stars.I tried to seem interested, and was going to tell him how I'd beenstudying about them, but he just laughed kind of funny, and said notto bother my pretty head about such things, but to come in and play tohim on the piano.So, of course, I did. And he sat and listened to three whole pieces.Now, wasn't that funny?       *       *       *       *       *_Two weeks later_.I understand it all now--everything: why the house is different, andFather, and everything. And it _is_ Cousin Grace, and it _is_ a lovestory._Father is in love with her_._Now_ I guess I shall have something for this book!It seems funny now that I didn't think of it at first. But Ididn't--not until I heard Nellie and her beau talking about it. Nelliesaid she wasn't the only one in the house that was going to getmarried. And when he asked her what she meant, she said it was Dr.Anderson and Mrs. Whitney. That anybody could see it that wasn't asblind as a bat.My, but wasn't I excited? I just guess I was. And, of course, I sawthen that I had been blind as a bat. But I began to open my eyesafter that, and watch--not disagreeably, you know, but just glad andinterested, and on account of the book.And I saw:That father stayed in the house a lot more than he used to.That he talked more.That he never thundered--I mean spoke stern and uncompromising toCousin Grace the way he used to to Aunt Jane.That he smiled more.That he wasn't so absent-minded at meals and other times, but seemedto know we were there--Cousin Grace and I.That he actually asked Cousin Grace and me to play for him severaltimes.That he went with us to the Sunday-School picnic. (I never saw Fatherat a picnic before, and I don't believe he ever saw himself at one.)That--oh, I don't know, but a whole lot of little things that I can'tremember; but they were all unmistakable, very unmistakable. And Iwondered, when I saw it all, that I _had_ been as blind as a batbefore.Of course, I was glad--glad he's going to marry her, I mean. I wasglad for everybody; for Father and Cousin Grace, for they would behappy, of course, and he wouldn't be lonesome any more. And I was gladfor Mother because I knew she'd be glad that he'd at last found thegood, kind woman to make a home for him. And, of course, I was gladfor myself, for I'd much rather have Cousin Grace here than Aunt Jane,and I knew she'd make the best new mother of any of them. And last,but not least, I'm glad for the book, because now I've got a lovestory sure. That is, I'm pretty sure. Of course, it may not be so; butI think it is.When I wrote Mother I told her all about it--the signs and symptoms, Imean, and how different and thawed-out Father was; and I asked if shedidn't think it was so, too. But she didn't answer that part. Shedidn't write much, anyway. It was an awfully snippy letter; but shesaid she had a headache and didn't feel at all well. So that was thereason, probably, why she didn't say more--about Father's love affair,I mean. She only said she was glad, she was sure, if Father had foundan estimable woman to make a home for him, and she hoped they'd behappy. Then she went on talking about something else. And she didn'twrite much more, anyway, about anything.       *       *       *       *       *_August_.Well, of all the topsy-turvy worlds, this is the topsy-turviest, I amsure. What _do_ they want me to do, and which do they want me to be?Oh, I wish I was just a plain Susie or Bessie, and not a cross-currentand a contradiction, with a father that wants me to be one thing anda mother that wants me to be another! It was bad enough before, whenFather wanted me to be Mary, and Mother wanted me to be Marie. Butnow--Well, to begin at the beginning.It's all over--the love story, I mean, and I know now why it's been sohard for me to remember to be Mary and why everything is different,and all._They don't want me to be Mary_._They want me to be Marie_.And now I don't know what to think. If Mother's going to want me tobe Mary, and Father's going to want me to be Marie, how am I going toknow what anybody wants, ever? Besides, it was getting to be such abeautiful love story--Father and Cousin Grace. And now--But let me tell you what happened.It was last night. We were on the piazza, Father, Cousin Grace, andI. And I was thinking how perfectly lovely it was that Father _was_there, and that he was getting to be so nice and folksy, and how I_did_ hope it would last, even after he'd married her, and not haveany of that incompatibility stuff come into it. Well, just thenshe got up and went into the house for something--Cousin Grace, Imean--and all of a sudden I determined to tell Father how glad I was,about him and Cousin Grace; and how I hoped it would last--having himout there with us, and all that. And I told him.I don't remember what I said exactly. But I know I hurried on and saidit fast, so as to get in all I could before he interrupted; for he hadinterrupted right at the first with an exclamation; and I knew he wasgoing to say more right away, just as soon as he got a chance. And Ididn't want him to get a chance till I'd said what _I_ wanted to. ButI hadn't anywhere near said what I wanted to when he did stop me. Why,he almost jumped out of his chair."Mary!" he gasped. "What in the world are you talking about?""Why, Father, I was telling you," I explained. And I tried to be socool and calm that it would make him calm and cool, too. (But itdidn't calm him or cool him one bit.) "It's about when you're married,and--""Married!" he interrupted again. (They never let _me_ interrupt likethat!)"To Cousin Grace--yes. But, Father, you--you _are_ going to marryCousin Grace, aren't you?" I cried--and I did 'most cry, for I saw byhis face that he was not."That is not my present intention," he said. His lips came togetherhard, and he looked over his shoulder to see if Cousin Grace wascoming back."But you're going to _sometime_," I begged him."I do not expect to." Again he looked over his shoulder to see if shewas coming. I looked, too, and we both saw through the window that shehad gone into the library and lighted up and was sitting at the tablereading.I fell back in my chair, and I know I looked grieved and hurt anddisappointed, as I almost sobbed:"Oh, Father, and when I _thought_ you were going to!""There, there, child!" He spoke, stern and almost cross now. "Thisabsurd, nonsensical idea has gone quite far enough. Let us think nomore about it.""It isn't absurd and nonsensical!" I cried. And I could hardly say thewords, I was choking up so. "Everybody said you were going to, and Iwrote Mother so; and--""You wrote that to your mother?" He did jump from his chair this time."Yes; and she was glad.""Oh, she was!" He sat down sort of limp-like and queer."Yes. She said she was glad you'd found an estimable woman to make ahome for you.""Oh, she did." He said this, too, in that queer, funny, quiet kind ofway."Yes." I spoke, decided and firm. I'd begun to think, all of a sudden,that maybe he didn't appreciate Mother as much as she did him; andI determined right then and there to make him, if I could. When Iremembered all the lovely things she'd said about him--"Father," I began; and I spoke this time, even more decided and firm."I don't believe you appreciate Mother.""Eh? What?"He made _me_ jump this time, he turned around with such a jerk, andspoke so sharply. But in spite of the jump I still held on to mysubject, firm and decided."I say I don't believe you appreciate my mother. You acted right nowas if you didn't believe she meant it when I told you she was glad youhad found an estimable woman to make a home for you. But she did meanit. I know, because she said it before, once, last year, that shehoped you _would_ find one.""Oh, she did." He sat back in his chair again, sort of limp-like. ButI couldn't tell yet, from his face, whether I'd convinced him or not.So I went on."Yes, and that isn't all. There's another reason, why I know Motheralways has--has your best interest at heart. She--she tried to make meover into Mary before I came, so as to please you.""She did _what_?" Once more he made me jump, he turned so suddenly,and spoke with such a short, sharp snap.But in spite of the jump I went right on, just as I had before, firmand decided. I told him everything--all about the cooking lessons, andthe astronomy book we read an hour every day, and the pink silkdress I couldn't have, and even about the box of chocolates and theself-discipline. And how she said if she'd had self-discipline whenshe was a girl, her life would have been very different. And I toldhim about how she began to hush me up from laughing too loud, ormaking any kind of noise, because I was soon to be Mary, and shewanted me to get used to it, so I wouldn't trouble him when I gothere.I talked very fast and hurriedly. I was afraid he'd interrupt, and Iwanted to get in all I could before he did. But he didn't interruptat all. I couldn't see how he was taking it, though--what I said--forafter the very first he sat back in his chair and shaded his eyes withhis hand; and he sat like that all the time I was talking. He did noteven stir until I said how at the last she bought me the homely shoesand the plain dark suit so I could go as Mary, and be Mary when AuntJane first saw me get off the train.When I said that, he dropped his hand and turned around and stared atme. And there was such a funny look in his eyes."I _thought_ you didn't look the same!" he cried; "not so white andairy and--and--I can't explain it, but you looked different. And yet,I didn't think it could be so, for I knew you looked just as you didwhen you came, and that no one had asked you to--to put on Mary'sthings this year."He sort of smiled when he said that; then he got up and began to walkup and down the piazza, muttering: "So you _came_ as Mary, you _came_as Mary." Then, after a minute, he gave a funny little laugh and satdown.Mrs. Small came up the front walk then to see Cousin Grace, and Fathertold her to go right into the library where Cousin Grace was. So wewere left alone again, after a minute.It was 'most dark on the piazza, but I could see Father's face in thelight from the window; and it looked--well, I'd never seen it looklike that before. It was as if something that had been on it for yearshad dropped off and left it clear where before it had been blurred andindistinct. No, that doesn't exactly describe it either. I _can't_describe it. But I'll go on and say what he said.After Mrs. Small had gone into the house, and he saw that she wassitting down with Cousin Grace in the library, he turned to me andsaid:"And so you came as Mary?"I said yes, I did."Well, I--I got ready for Marie."But then I didn't quite understand, not even when I looked at him, andsaw the old understanding twinkle in his eyes."You mean--you thought I was coming as Marie, of course," I said then."Yes," he nodded."But I came as Mary.""I see now that you did." He drew in his breath with a queer littlecatch to it; then he got up and walked up and down the _piazza_ again.(Why do old folks always walk up and down the room like that whenthey're thinking hard about something? Father always does; and Motherdoes lots of times, too.) But it wasn't but a minute this time beforeFather came and sat down."Well, Mary," he began; and his voice sounded odd, with a little shakein it. "You've told me your story, so I suppose I may as well tell youmine--now. You see, I not only got ready for Marie, but I had plannedto keep her Marie, and not let her be Mary--at all."And then he told me. He told me how he'd never forgotten that dayin the parlor when I cried (and made a wet spot on the arm of thesofa--_I_ never forgot that!), and he saw then how hard it was for meto live here, with him so absorbed in his work and Aunt Jane so sternin her black dress. And he said I put it very vividly when I talkedabout being Marie in Boston, and Mary here, and he saw just how itwas. And so he thought and thought about it all winter, and wonderedwhat he could do. And after a time it came to him--he'd let me beMarie here; that is, he'd try to make it so I could be Marie. And hewas just wondering how he was going to get Aunt Jane to help him whenshe was sent for and asked to go to an old friend who was sick. And hetold her to go, by all means to go. Then he got Cousin Grace to comehere. He said he knew Cousin Grace, and he was very sure she wouldknow how to help him to let me stay Marie. So he talked it over withher--how they would let me laugh, and sing and play the piano all Iwanted to, and wear the clothes I brought with me, and be just as nearas I could be the way I was in Boston."And to think, after all my preparation for Marie, you should _be_Mary already, when you came," he finished."Yes. Wasn't it funny?" I laughed. "All the time _you_ were gettingready for Marie, Mother was getting me ready to be Mary. It _was_funny!" And it did seem funny to me then.But Father was not laughing. He had sat back in his chair, and hadcovered his eyes with his hand again, as if he was thinking andthinking, just as hard as he could. And I suppose it did seem queerto him, that he should be trying to make me Marie, and all the whileMother was trying to make me Mary. And it seemed so to me, as I beganto think it over. It wasn't funny at all, any longer."And so your mother--did that," Father muttered; and there was thequeer little catch in his breath again.He didn't say any more, not a single word. And after a minute he gotup and went into the house. But he didn't go into the library whereMrs. Small and Cousin Grace were talking. He went straight upstairsto his own room and shut the door. I heard it. And he was still therewhen I went up to bed afterwards.Well, I guess he doesn't feel any worse than I do. I thought at firstit was funny, a good joke--his trying to have me Marie while Motherwas making me over into Mary. But I see now that it isn't. It's awful.Why, how am I going to know at all who to be--now? Before, I used toknow just when to be Mary, and when to be Marie--Mary with Father,Marie with Mother. Now I don't know at all. Why, they can't evenseem to agree on that! I suppose it's just some more of thatincompatibility business showing up even when they are apart. And poorme--I have to suffer for it. I'm beginning to see that the child doessuffer--I mean the child of unlikes.Now, look at me right now--about my clothes, for instance. (Ofcourse clothes are a little thing, you may think; but I don't thinkanything's little that's always with you like clothes are!) Well, hereall summer, and even before I came, I've been wearing stuffy ginghamand clumpy shoes to please Father. And Father isn't pleased at all. Hewanted me to wear the Marie things.And there you are.How do you suppose Mother's going to feel when I tell her that afterall her pains Father didn't like it at all. He wanted me to be Marie.It's a shame, after all the pains she took. But I won't write it toher, anyway. Maybe I won't have to tell her, unless she _asks_ me.But _I_ know it. And, pray, what am I to do? Of course, I can _act_like Marie here all right, if that is what folks want. (I guess I havebeen doing it a good deal of the time, anyway, for I kept forgettingthat I was Mary.) But I can't _wear_ Marie, for I haven't a singleMarie thing here. They're all Mary. That's all I brought.Oh, dear suz me! Why couldn't Father and Mother have been just thecommon live-happy-ever-after kind, or else found out before theymarried that they were unlikes?       *       *       *       *       *_September_.Well, vacation is over, and I go back to Boston to-morrow. It's beenvery nice and I've had a good time, in spite of being so mixed up asto whether I was Mary or Marie. It wasn't so bad as I was afraid itwould be. Very soon after Father and I had that talk on the piazza,Cousin Grace took me down to the store and bought me two new whitedresses, and the dearest little pair of shoes I ever saw. She saidFather wanted me to have them.And that's all--every single word that's been said about thatMary-and-Marie business. And even that didn't really _say_anything--not by name. And Cousin Grace never mentioned it again. AndFather never mentioned it at all. Not a word.But he's been queer. He's been awfully queer. Some days he's been justas he was when I first came this time--real talky and folksy, and asif he liked to be with us. Then for whole days at a time he'd be moreas he used to--stern, and stirring his coffee when there isn't anycoffee there; and staying all the evening and half the night out inhis observatory.Some days he's talked a lot with me--asked me questions just as heused to, all about what I did in Boston, and Mother, and the peoplethat came there to see her, and everything. And he spoke of theviolinist again, and, of course, this time I told him all about him,and that he didn't come any more, nor Mr. Easterbrook, either; andFather was _so_ interested! Why, it seemed sometimes as if he justcouldn't hear enough about things. Then, all of a sudden, at times,he'd get right up in the middle of something I was saying and act asif he was just waiting for me to finish my sentence so he could go.And he did go, just as soon as I _had_ finished my sentence. And afterthat, maybe, he wouldn't hardly speak to me again for a whole day.And so that's why I say he's been so queer since that night on thepiazza. But most of the time he's been lovely, perfectly lovely. Andso has Cousin Grace, And I've had a beautiful time.But I do wish they _would_ marry--Father and Cousin Grace, I mean. AndI'm not talking now entirely for the sake of the book. It's for theirsakes--especially for Father's sake. I've been thinking what Motherused to say about him, when she was talking about my being Mary--howhe was lonely, and needed a good, kind woman to make a home for him.And while I've been thinking of it, I've been watching him; and Ithink he does need a good, kind woman to make a home for him. I'd be_willing_ to have a new mother for his sake!Oh, yes, I know he's got Cousin Grace, but he may not have her always.Maybe she'll be sent for same as Aunt Jane was. _Then_ what's he goingto do, I should like to know?CHAPTER VIIIWHICH IS THE REAL LOVE STORYBOSTON. _Four days later_.Well, here I am again in Boston. Mother and the rest met me at thestation, and everybody seemed glad to see me, just as they did before.And I was glad to see them. But I didn't feel anywhere near soexcited, and sort of crazy, as I did last year. I tried to, but Icouldn't. I don't know why. Maybe it was because I'd been Marie allsummer, anyway, so I wasn't so crazy to be Marie now, not needing anyrest from being Mary. Maybe it was 'cause I sort of hated to leaveFather.And I did hate to leave him, especially when I found he hated to haveme leave him. And he did. He told me so at the junction. You see, ourtrain was late, and we had to wait for it; and there was where he toldme.He had come all the way down there with me, just as he had before. Buthe hadn't acted the same at all. He didn't fidget this time, nor walkover to look at maps and time-tables, nor flip out his watch everyother minute with such a bored air that everybody knew he was seeingme off just as a duty. And he didn't ask if I was warmly clad, and hadI left anything, either. He just sat and talked to me, and he asked mehad I been a little happier there with him this year than last; and hesaid he hoped I had.And I told him, of course, I had; that it had been perfectly beautifulthere, even if there had been such a mix-up of him getting ready forMarie, and Mother sending Mary. And he laughed and looked queer--sortof half glad and half sorry; and said he shouldn't worry about that.Then the train came, and we got on and rode down to the junction. Andthere, while we were waiting for the other train, he told me how sorryhe was to have me go.He said I would never know how he missed me after I went last year. Hesaid you never knew how you missed things--and people--till they weregone. And I wondered if, by the way he said it, he wasn't thinkingof Mother more than he was of me, and of her going long ago. And helooked so sort of sad and sorry and noble and handsome, sitting therebeside me, that suddenly I 'most wanted to cry. And I told him I _did_love him, I loved him dearly, and I had loved to be with him thissummer, and that I'd stay his whole six months with him next year ifhe wanted me to.He shook his head at that; but he did look happy and pleased, and saidI'd never know how glad he was that I'd said that, and that he shouldprize it very highly--the love of his little daughter. He said younever knew how to prize love, either, till you'd lost it; and he saidhe'd learned his lesson, and learned it well. I knew then, of course,that he was thinking of Mother and the long ago. And I felt so sorryfor him."But I'll stay--I'll stay the whole six months next year!" I criedagain.But again he shook his head."No, no, my dear; I thank you, and I'd love to have you; but it ismuch better for you that you stay in Boston through the school year,and I want you to do it. It'll just make the three months I do haveyou all the dearer, because of the long nine months that I do not,"he went on very cheerfully and briskly; "and don't look so solemn andlong-faced. You're not to blame--for this wretched situation."The train came then, and he put me on board, and he kissed meagain--but I was expecting it this time, of course. Then I whizzedoff, and he was left standing all alone on the platform. And I feltso sorry for him; and all the way down to Boston I kept thinking ofhim--what he said, and how he looked, and how fine and splendid andany-woman-would-be-proud-of-him he was as he stood on the platformwaving good-bye.And so I guess I was still thinking of him and being sorry forhim when I got to Boston. That's why I couldn't be so crazy andhilariously glad when the folks met me, I suspect. Some way, all of asudden, I found myself wishing _he_ could be there, too.Of course, I knew that that was bad and wicked and unkind to Mother,and she'd feel so grieved not to have me satisfied with her. And Iwouldn't have told her of it for the world. So I tried just as hard asI could to forget him--on account of Mother, so as to be loyal to her.And I did 'most forget him by the time I'd got home. But it all cameback again a little later when we were unpacking my trunk.You see, Mother found the two new white dresses, and the dear littleshoes. I knew then, of course, that she'd have to know all--I mean,how she hadn't pleased Father, even after all her pains trying to haveme go as Mary."Why, Marie, what in the world is this?" she demanded, holding up oneof the new dresses.I could have cried.I suppose she saw by my face how awfully I felt 'cause she'd found it.And, of course, she saw something was the matter; and she thought itwas--Well, the first thing _I_ knew she was looking at me in her verysternest, sorriest way, and saying:"Oh, Marie, how could you? I'm ashamed of you! Couldn't you wear theMary dresses one little three months to please your father?"I did cry, then. After all I'd been through, to have her accuse _me_of getting those dresses! Well, I just couldn't stand it. And I toldher so as well as I could, only I was crying so by now that I couldhardly speak. I told her how it was hard enough to be Mary part of thetime, and Marie part of the time, when I _knew_ what they wanted me tobe. But when she tried to have me Mary while he wanted me Marie, andhe tried to have me Marie while she wanted me Mary--I did not knowwhat they wanted; and I wished I had never been born unless I couldhave been born a plain Susie or Bessie, or Annabelle, and not a MaryMarie that was all mixed up till I didn't know what I was.And then I cried some more.Mother dropped the dress then, and took me in her arms over on thecouch, and she said, "There, there," and that I was tired and nervous,and all wrought up, and to cry all I wanted to. And by and by, when Iwas calmer I could tell Mother all about it.And I did.I told her how hard I tried to be Mary all the way up to Andersonvilleand after I got there; and how then I found out, all of a sudden oneday, that father had got ready for _Marie_, and he didn't want me tobe Mary, and that was why he had got Cousin Grace and the automobileand the geraniums in the window, and, oh, everything that made it niceand comfy and homey. And then is when they bought me the new whitedresses and the little white shoes. And I told Mother, of course, itwas lovely to be Marie, and I liked it, only I knew _she_ would feelbad to think, after all _her_ pains to make me Mary, Father didn'twant me Mary at all."I don't think you need to worry--about that," stammered Mother. Andwhen I looked at her, her face was all flushed, and sort of queer, butnot a bit angry. And she went on in the same odd little shaky voice:"But, tell me, why--why did--your father want you to be Marie and notMary?"And then I told her how he said he'd remembered what I'd said to himin the parlor that day--how tired I got being Mary, and how I'd puton Marie's things just to get a little vacation from her; and he saidhe'd never forgotten. And so when it came near time for me to comeagain, he determined to fix it so I wouldn't have to be Mary at all.And so that was why. And I told Mother it was all right, and of courseI liked it; only it _did_ mix me up awfully, not knowing which wantedme to be Mary now, and which Marie, when they were both telling medifferent from what they ever had before. And that it was hard, whenyou were trying just the best you knew how.And I began to cry again.And she said there, there, once more, and patted me on my shoulder,and told me I needn't worry any more. And that _she_ understood it,if I didn't. In fact, she was beginning to understand a lot of thingsthat she'd never understood before. And she said it was very, verydear of Father to do what he did, and that I needn't worry about herbeing displeased at it. That she was pleased, and that she believed hemeant her to be. And she said I needn't think any more whether to beMary or Marie; but to be just a good, loving little daughter to bothof them; and that was all she asked, and she was very sure it was allFather would ask, too.I told her then how I thought he _did_ care a little about havingme there, and that I knew he was going to miss me. And I told herwhy--what he'd said that morning in the junction--about appreciatinglove, and not missing things or people until you didn't have them; andhow he'd learned his lesson, and all that.And Mother grew all flushed and rosy again, but she was pleased. Iknew she was. And she said some beautiful things about making otherpeople happy, instead of looking to ourselves all the time, just asshe had talked once, before I went away. And I felt again that hushed,stained-window, soft-music, everybody-kneeling kind of a way; and Iwas so happy! And it lasted all the rest of that evening till I wentto sleep.And for the first time a beautiful idea came to me, when I thought howMother was trying to please Father, and he was trying to please her.Wouldn't it be perfectly lovely and wonderful if Father and Mothershould fall in love with each other all over again, and get married? Iguess _then_ this would be a love story all right, all right!       *       *       *       *       *_October._Oh, how I wish that stained-window, everybody-kneeling feeling _would_last. But it never does. Just the next morning, when I woke up, itrained. And I didn't feel pleased a bit. Still I remembered whathad happened the night before, and a real glow came over me at thebeautiful idea I had gone to sleep with.I wanted to tell Mother, and ask her if it couldn't be, and wouldn'tshe let it be, if Father would. So, without waiting to dress me, Ihurried across the hall to her room and told her all about it--myidea, and everything.But she said, "Nonsense," and, "Hush, hush," when I asked her if sheand Father couldn't fall in love all over again and get married. Andshe said not to get silly notions into my head. And she wasn't a bitflushed and teary, as she had been the night before, and she didn'ttalk at all as she had then, either. And it's been that way eversince. Things have gone along in just the usual humdrum way, and she'snever been the same as she was that night I came.Something--a little something--_did_ happen yesterday, though. There'sgoing to be another big astronomy meeting here in Boston this month,just as there was when Father found Mother years ago; and Grandfatherbrought home word that Father was going to be one of the chiefspeakers. And he told Mother he supposed she'd go and hear him.I couldn't make out whether he was joking or not. (I never can tellwhen Grandfather's joking.) But Aunt Hattie took it right up inearnest, and said, "Pooh, pooh," she guessed not. She could _see_Madge going down to that hall to hear Dr. Anderson speak!And then a funny thing happened. I looked at Mother, and I saw herhead come up with a queer little jerk."Well, yes, I am thinking of going," she said, just as calm and coolas could be. "When does he speak, Father?"And when Aunt Hattie pooh-poohed some more, and asked how _could_ shedo such a thing, Mother answered:"Because Charles Anderson is the father of my little girl, and I thinkshe should hear him speak. Therefore, Hattie, I intend to take her."And then she asked Grandfather again when Father was going to speak.I'm so excited! Only think of seeing my father up on a big platformwith a lot of big men, and hearing him speak! And he'll be the verysmartest and handsomest one there, too. You see if he isn't!       *       *       *       *       *_Two weeks and one day later_.Oh, I've got a lot to write this time--I mean, a lot has happened.Still, I don't know as it's going to take so very long to tell it.Besides, I'm almost too excited to write, anyway. But I'm going to dothe best I can to tell it, just as it happened.Father's here--right here in Boston. I don't know when he came. Butthe first day of the meeting was day before yesterday, and he was herethen. The paper said he was, and his picture was there, too. Therewere a lot of pictures, but his was away ahead of the others. It wasthe very best one on the page. (I told you it would be that way.)Mother saw it first. That is, I think she did. She had the paper inher hand, looking at it, when I came into the room; but as soon as shesaw me she laid it right down quick on the table. If she hadn't beenquite so quick about it, and if she hadn't looked quite so queer whenshe did it, I wouldn't have thought anything at all. But when I wentover to the table after she had gone, and saw the paper with Father'spicture right on the first page--and the biggest picture there--I knewthen, of course, what she'd been looking at.I looked at it then, and I read what it said, too. It was lovely. Why,I hadn't any idea Father was so big. I was prouder than ever of him.It told all about the stars and comets he'd discovered, and the bookshe'd written on astronomy, and how he was president of the college atAndersonville, and that he was going to give an address the next day.And I read it all--every word. And I made up my mind right there andthen that I'd cut out that piece and save it.But that night, when I went to the library cupboard to get the paper,I couldn't do it, after all. Oh, the paper was there, but that pagewas gone. There wasn't a bit of it left. Somebody had taken it rightout. I never thought then of Mother. But I believe now that it _was_Mother, for--But I mustn't tell you that part now. Stories are just like meals. Youhave to eat them--I mean tell them--in regular order, and not put theice-cream in where the soup ought to be. So I'm not going to tell yetwhy I suspect it was Mother that cut out that page of the paper withFather's picture in it.Well, the next morning was Father's lecture, and I went with Mother.Of course Grandfather was there, too, but he was with the otherastronomers, I guess. Anyhow, he didn't sit with us. And Aunt Hattiedidn't go at all. So Mother and I were alone.We sat back--a long ways back. I wanted to go up front, real farfront--the front seat, if I could get it; and I told Mother so. Butshe said, "Mercy, no!" and shuddered, and went back two more rows fromwhere she was, and got behind a big post.I guess she was afraid Father would see us, but that's what _I_wanted. I wanted him to see us. I wanted him to be right in the middleof his lecture and look down and see right there before him his littlegirl Mary, and she that had been the wife of his bosom. Now _that_would have been what I called thrilling, real thrilling, especially ifhe jumped or grew red, or white, or stammered, or stopped short, oranything to show that he'd seen us--and cared.I'd have loved that.But we sat back where Mother wanted to, behind the post. And, ofcourse, Father never saw us at all.It was a lovely lecture. Oh, of course, I don't mean to say that Iunderstood it. I didn't. But his voice was fine, and he looked justtoo grand for anything, with the light on his noble brow, and he usedthe loveliest big words that I ever heard. And folks clapped, andlooked at each other, and nodded, and once or twice they laughed. Andwhen he was all through they clapped again, harder than ever. And Iwas so proud of him I wanted to stand right up and holler, "He's myfather! He's my father!" just as loud as I could. But, of course, Ididn't. I just clapped like the rest; only I wished my hands were biglike the man's next to me, so I could have made more noise.Another man spoke then, a little (not near so good as Father), andthen it was all over, and everybody got up to go; and I saw that alot of folks were crowding down the aisle, and I looked and there wasFather right in front of the platform shaking hands with folks.I looked at Mother then. Her face was all pinky-white, and her eyeswere shining. I guess she thought I spoke, for all of a sudden sheshook her head and said:"No, no, I couldn't, I couldn't! But _you_ may, dear. Run along andspeak to him; but don't stay. Remember, Mother is waiting, and comeright back."I knew then that it must have been just my eyes that spoke, for I_did_ want to go down there and speak to Father. Oh, I did want to go!And I went then, of course.He didn't see me at first. There was a long line of us, and a big fatman was doing a lot of talking to him so we couldn't move at all, fora time. Then it came to when I was just three people away from him.And I was looking straight at him.He saw me then. And, oh, how I did love the look that came to hisface; it was so surprised and glad, and said, "Oh! _You_!" in such aperfectly lovely way that I choked all up and wanted to _cry_. (Theidea!--cry when I was so _glad_ to see him!)I guess the two folks ahead of me didn't think they got muchattention, and the next minute he had drawn me out of the line, and wewere both talking at once, and telling each other how glad we were tosee each other.But he was looking for Mother--I know he was; for the next minuteafter he saw me, he looked right over my head at the woman back of me.And all the while he was talking with me, his eyes would look at meand then leap as swift as lightning first here, and then there, allover the hall. But he didn't see her. I knew he didn't see her, by thelook on his face. And pretty quick I said I'd have to go. And then hesaid:"Your mother--perhaps she didn't--_did_ she come?" And his face grewall red and rosy as he asked the question.And I said yes, and she was waiting, and that was why I had to go backright away.And he said, "Yes, yes, to be sure," and, "good-bye." But he stillheld my hand tight, and his eyes were still roving all over the house.And I had to tell him again that I really had to go; and I had to pullreal determined at my hand, before I could break away. And I don'tbelieve I could have gone even then if some other folks hadn't come upat that minute.I went back to Mother then. The hall was almost empty, and she wasn'tanywhere in sight at all; but I found her just outside the door. Iknew then why Father's face showed that he hadn't found her. Shewasn't there to find. I suspect she had looked out for that.Her face was still pinky-white, and her eyes were shining; and shewanted to know everything we had said--everything. So she found out,of course, that he had asked if she was there. But she didn't sayanything herself, not anything. She didn't say anything, either, atthe luncheon table, when Grandfather was talking with Aunt Hattieabout the lecture, and telling some of the things Father had said.Grandfather said it was an admirable address, scholarly andconvincing, or something like that. And he said that he thought Dr.Anderson had improved greatly in looks and manner. And he lookedstraight at Mother when he said that; but still Mother never said aword.In the afternoon I went to walk with one of the girls; and when I camein I couldn't find Mother. She wasn't anywhere downstairs, nor in herroom, nor mine, nor anywhere else on that floor. Aunt Hattie said no,she wasn't out, but that she was sure she didn't know where she was.She must be somewhere in the house.I went upstairs then, another flight. There wasn't anywhere else togo, and Mother must be _somewhere_, of course. And it seemed suddenlyto me as if I'd just _got_ to find her. I _wanted_ her so.And I found her.In the little back room where Aunt Hattie keeps her trunks andmoth-ball bags, Mother was on the floor in the corner crying. And whenI exclaimed out and ran over to her, I found she was sitting besidean old trunk that was open; and across her lap was a perfectly lovelypale-blue satin dress all trimmed with silver lace that had grownblack. And Mother was crying and crying as if her heart would break.Of course, I tried and tried to stop her, and I begged her to tell mewhat was the matter. But I couldn't do a thing, not a thing, not fora long time. Then I happened to say what a lovely dress, only what apity it was that the lace was all black.She gave a little choking cry then, and began to talk--little shortsentences all choked up with sobs, so that I could hardly tell whatshe was talking about. Then, little by little, I began to understand.She said yes, it was all black--tarnished; and that it was just likeeverything that she had had anything to do with--tarnished: herlife and her marriage, and Father's life, and mine--everything wastarnished, just like that silver lace on that dress. And she had doneit by her thoughtless selfishness and lack of self-discipline.And when I tried and tried to tell her no, it wasn't, and that Ididn't feel tarnished a bit, and that she wasn't, nor Father either,she only cried all the more, and shook her head and began again, allchoked up.She said this little dress was the one she wore at the big receptionwhere she first met Father. It was a beautiful blue then, all shiningand spotless, and the silver lace glistened like frost in thesunlight. And she was so proud and happy when Father--and he was fineand splendid and handsome then, too, she said--singled her out, andjust couldn't seem to stay away from her a minute all the evening. Andthen four days later he asked her to marry him; and she was still moreproud and happy.And she said their married life, when they started out, was just likethat beautiful dress, all shining and spotless and perfect; but thatit wasn't two months before a little bit of tarnish appeared, and thenanother and another.She said she was selfish and willful and exacting, and wanted Fatherall to herself; and she didn't stop to think that he had his work todo, and his place to make in the world; and that all of living, tohim, wasn't just in being married to her, and attending to her everywhim. She said she could see it all now, but that she couldn't then,she was too young, and undisciplined, and she'd never been denied athing in the world she wanted. As she said that, right before my eyesrose that box of chocolates she made me eat one at a time; but, ofcourse, I didn't say anything! Besides, Mother hurried right ontalking.She said things went on worse and worse--and it was all her fault. Shegrew sour and cross and disagreeable. She could see now that she did.But she did not realize at all then what she was doing. She was justthinking of herself--always herself; her rights, her wrongs, her hurtfeelings, her wants and wishes. She never once thought that _he_ hadrights and wrongs and hurt feelings, maybe.And so the tarnish kept growing more and more. She said there wasnothing like selfishness to tarnish the beautiful fabric of marriedlife. (Isn't that a lovely sentence? I said that over and over tomyself so as to be sure and remember it, so I could get it into thisstory. I thought it was beautiful.)She said a lot more--oh, ever so much more; but I can't remember itall. (I lost some while I was saying that sentence over and over, soas to remember it.) I know that she went on to say that by and by thetarnish began to dim the brightness of my life, too; and that was theworst of all, she said--that innocent children should suffer, andtheir young lives be spotted by the kind of living I'd had to have,with this wretched makeshift of a divided home. She began to cry againthen, and begged me to forgive her, and I cried and tried to tell herI didn't mind it; but, of course, I'm older now, and I know I do mindit, though I'm trying just as hard as I can not to be Mary when Iought to be Marie, or Marie when I ought to be Mary. Only I get allmixed up so, lately, and I said so, and I guess I cried some more.Mother jumped up then, and said, "Tut, tut," what was she thinking ofto talk like this when it couldn't do a bit of good, but only madematters worse. And she said that only went to prove how she was stillkeeping on tarnishing my happiness and bringing tears to my brighteyes, when certainly nothing of the whole wretched business was myfault.She thrust the dress back into the trunk then, and shut the lid. Thenshe took me downstairs and bathed my eyes and face with cold water,and hers, too. And _she_ began to talk and laugh and tell stories, andbe gayer and jollier than I'd seen her for ever so long. And she wasthat way at dinner, too, until Grandfather happened to mention thereception to-morrow night, and ask if she was going.She flushed up red then, oh, so red! and said, "Certainly not." Thenshe added quick, with a funny little drawing-in of her breath, thatshe should let Marie go, though, with her Aunt Hattie.There was an awful fuss then. Aunt Hattie raised her eyebrows andthrew up her hands, and said:"That child--in the evening! Why, Madge, are you crazy?"And Mother said no, she wasn't crazy at all; but it was the onlychance Father would have to see me, and she didn't feel that she hadany right to deprive him of that privilege, and she didn't think itwould do me any harm to be out this once late in the evening. And sheintended to let me go.Aunt Hattie still didn't approve, and she said more, quite a lot more;but Grandfather spoke up and took my part, and said that, in hisopinion, Madge was right, quite right, and that it was no more thanfair that the man should have a chance to talk with his own child fora little while, and that he would be very glad to take me himself andlook after me, if Aunt Hattie did not care to take the trouble.Aunt Hattie bridled up at that, and said that that wasn't the case atall; that she'd be very glad to look after me; and if Mother had quitemade up her mind that she wanted me to go, they'd call the mattersettled.And Mother said she had, and so it was settled. And I'm going. I'm towear my new white dress with the pink rosebud trimming, and I'm soexcited I can hardly wait till to-morrow night. But--oh, if onlyMother would go, too!       *       *       *       *       *_Two days later_.Well, _now_ I guess something's doing all right! And my hand isshaking so I can hardly write--it wants to get ahead so fast and_tell_. But I'm going to keep it sternly back and tell it just as ithappened, and not begin at the ice-cream instead of the soup.Very well, then. I went last night with Grandfather and Aunt Hattieto the reception; and Mother said I looked very sweet, andany-father-ought-to-be-proud-of me in my new dress. Grandfather pattedme, put on his glasses, and said, "Well, well, bless my soul! Is thisour little Mary Marie?" And even Aunt Hattie said if I acted as wellas I looked I'd do very well. Then Mother kissed me and ran upstairs_quick_. But I saw the tears in her eyes, and I knew why she hurriedso.At the reception I saw Father right away, but he didn't see me for along time. He stood in a corner, and lots of folks came up and spoketo him and shook hands; and he bowed and smiled--but in between, whenthere wasn't anybody noticing, he looked so tired and bored. After atime he stirred and changed his position, and I think he was huntingfor a chance to get away, when all of a sudden his eyes, roving aroundthe room, lighted on me.My! but just didn't I love the way he came through that crowd,straight toward me, without paying one bit of attention to the folksthat tried to stop him on the way. And when he got to me, he looked soglad to see me, only there was the same quick searching with his eyes,beyond and around me, as if he was looking for somebody else, just ashe had done the morning of the lecture. And I knew it was Mother, ofcourse. So I said:"No, she didn't come.""So I see," he answered. And there was such a hurt, sorry look awayback in his eyes. But right away he smiled, and said: "But _you_ came!I've got _you_."Then he began to talk and tell stories, just as if I was a young ladyto be entertained. And he took me over to where they had things toeat, and just heaped my plate with chicken patties and sandwiches andolives and pink-and-white frosted cakes and ice-cream (not all atonce, of course, but in order). And I had a perfectly beautiful time.And Father seemed to like it pretty well. But after a while he grewsober again, and his eyes began to rove all around the room.He took me to a little seat in the corner then, and we sat down andbegan to talk--only Father didn't talk much. He just listened to whatI said, and his eyes grew deeper and darker and sadder, and theydidn't rove around so much, after a time, but just stared fixedly atnothing, away out across the room. By and by he stirred and drew along sigh, and said, almost under his breath:"It was just such another night as this."And of course, I asked what was--and then I knew, almost before he hadtold me."That I first saw your mother, my dear.""Oh, yes, I know!" I cried, eager to tell him that I _did_ know. "Andshe must have looked lovely in that perfectly beautiful blue silkdress all silver lace."He turned and stared at me."How did _you_ know that?" he demanded."I saw it.""You saw it!""Yesterday, yes--the dress," I nodded."But how _could_ you?" he asked, frowning, and looking so surprised."Why, that dress must be--seventeen years old, or more."I nodded again, and I suppose I did look pleased: it's such fun tohave a secret, you know, and watch folks guess and wonder. And I kepthim guessing and wondering for quite a while. Then, of course, I toldhim that it was upstairs in Grandfather's trunk-room; that Mother hadgot it out, and I saw it."But, what--was your mother doing with that dress?" he asked then,looking even more puzzled and mystified.And then suddenly I thought and remembered that Mother was crying.And, of course, she wouldn't want Father to know she was crying overit--that dress she had worn when he first met her long ago! (I don'tthink women ever want men to know such things, do you? I know Ishouldn't!) So I didn't tell. I just kind of tossed it off, andmumbled something about her looking it over; and I was going to saysomething else, but I saw that Father wasn't listening. He had begunto talk again, softly, as if to himself."I suppose to-night, seeing you, and all this, brought it back to meso vividly." Then he turned and looked at me. "You are very like yourmother to-night, dear.""I suppose I am, maybe, when I'm Marie," I nodded.He laughed with his lips, but his eyes didn't laugh one bit as hesaid:"What a quaint little fancy of yours that is, child--as if you weretwo in one.""But I am two in one," I declared. "That's why I'm a cross-current anda contradiction, you know," I explained.I thought he'd understand. But he didn't. I supposed, of course, heknew what a cross-current and a contradiction was. But he turned againand stared at me."A--_what_?" he demanded."A cross-current and a contradiction," I explained once more."Children of unlikes, you know. Nurse Sarah told me that long ago.Didn't you ever hear that--that a child of unlikes was a cross-currentand a contradiction?""Well, no--I--hadn't," answered Father, in a queer, half-smotheredvoice. He half started from his seat. I think he was going to walk upand down, same as he usually does. But in a minute he saw he couldn't,of course, with all those people around there. So he sat back again inhis chair. For a minute he just frowned and stared at nothing; then hespoke again, as if half to himself."I suppose, Mary, we were--unlikes, your mother and I. That's justwhat we were; though I never thought of it before, in just that way."He waited, then went on, still half to himself, his eyes on thedancers:"She loved things like this--music, laughter, gayety. I abhorred them.I remember how bored I was that night here--till I saw her.""And did you fall in love with her right away?" I just couldn't helpasking that question. Oh, I do so adore love stories!A queer little smile came to Father's lips."Well, yes, I think I did, Mary. There'd been dozens and dozens ofyoung ladies that had flitted by in their airy frocks--and I neverlooked twice at them. I never looked twice at your mother, for thatmatter, Mary." (A funny little twinkle came into Father's eyes. I_love_ him with that twinkle!) "I just looked at her once--and thenkept on looking till it seemed as if I just couldn't take my eyes offher. And after a little her glance met mine--and the whole throngmelted away, and there wasn't another soul in the room but just ustwo. Then she looked away, and the throng came back. But I stilllooked at her.""Was she so awfully pretty, Father?" I could feel the little thrillstingling all over me. _Now_ I was getting a love story!"She was, my dear. She was very lovely. But it wasn't just that--itwas a joyous something that I could not describe. It was as if shewere a bird, poised for flight. I know it now for what it was--thevery incarnation of the spirit of youth. And she _was_ young. Why,Mary, she was not so many years older than you yourself, now."I nodded, and I guess I sighed."I know--where the brook and river meet," I said; "only they won't let_me_ have any lovers at all.""Eh? What?" Father had turned and was looking at me so funny. "Well,no, I should say not," he said then. "You aren't sixteen yet. And yourmother--I suspect _she_ was too young. If she hadn't been quite soyoung--"He stopped, and stared again straight ahead at the dancers--withoutseeing one of them, I knew. Then he drew a great deep sigh that seemedto come from the very bottom of his boots."But it was my fault, my fault, every bit of it," he muttered, stillstaring straight ahead. "If I hadn't been so thoughtless--As if Icould imprison that bright spirit of youth in a great dull cage ofconventionality, and not expect it to bruise its wings by flutteringagainst the bars!"I thought that was perfectly beautiful--that sentence. I said it rightover to myself two or three times so I wouldn't forget how to write itdown here. So I didn't quite hear the next things that Father said.But when I did notice, I found he was still talking--and it was aboutMother, and him, and their marriage, and their first days at the oldhouse. I knew it was that, even if he did mix it all up about thespirit of youth beating its wings against the bars. And over and overagain he kept repeating that it was his fault, it was his fault; andif he could only live it over again he'd do differently.And right there and then it came to me that Mother said it was herfault, too; and that if only she could live it over again, _she'd_ dodifferently. And here was Father saying the same thing. And all of asudden I thought, well, why can't they try it over again, if they bothwant to, and if each says it, was their--no, his, no, hers--well, hisand her fault. (How does the thing go? I hate grammar!) But I mean, ifshe says it's her fault, and he says it's his. That's what I thought,anyway. And I determined right then and there to give them the chanceto try again, if speaking would do it.I looked up at Father. He was still talking half under his breath, hiseyes looking straight ahead. He had forgotten all about me. That wasplain to be seen. If I'd been a cup of coffee without any coffee init, he'd have been stirring me. I know he would. He was like that."Father. _Father!_" I had to speak twice, before he heard me. "Do youreally mean that you would like to try again?" I asked."Eh? What?" And just the way he turned and looked at me showed howmany _miles_ he'd been away from me."Try it again, you know--what you said," I reminded him."Oh, that!" Such a funny look came to his face, half ashamed, halfvexed. "I'm afraid I _have_ been--talking, my dear.""Yes, but would you?" I persisted.He shook his head; then, with such an oh-that-it-could-be! smile, hesaid:"Of course;--we all wish that we could go back and do it overagain--differently. But we never can.""I know; like the cloth that's been cut up into the dress," I nodded."Cloth? Dress?" frowned Father."Yes, that Mother told me about," I explained. Then I told him thestory that Mother had told me--how you couldn't go back and beunmarried, just as you were before, any more than you could put thecloth back on the shelf, all neatly folded in a great long web afterit had been cut up into a dress."Did your mother say--that?" asked Father. His voice was husky, andhis eyes were turned away, but they were not looking at the dancers.He was listening to me now. I knew that, and so I spoke quick, beforehe could get absent-minded again."Yes, but, Father, you can go back, in this case, and so can Mother,'cause you both want to," I hurried on, almost choking in my anxietyto get it all out quickly. "And Mother said it was _her_ fault. Iheard her.""_Her_ fault!" I could see that Father did not quite understand, evenyet."Yes, yes, just as you said it was yours--about all those things atthe first, you know, when--when she was a spirit of youth beatingagainst the bars."Father turned square around and faced me."Mary, what are you talking about?" he asked then. And I'd have beenscared of his voice if it hadn't been for the great light that wasshining in his eyes.But I looked into his eyes, and wasn't scared; and I told himeverything, every single thing--all about how Mother had cried overthe little blue dress that day in the trunk-room, and how she hadshown the tarnished lace and said that _she_ had tarnished thehappiness of him and of herself and of me; and that it was all herfault; that she was thoughtless and willful and exacting and a spoiledchild; and, oh, if she could only try it over again, how differentlyshe would do! And there was a lot more. I told everything--everythingI could remember. Some way, I didn't believe that Mother would mind_now_, after what Father had said. And I just knew she wouldn't mindif she could see the look in Father's eyes as I talked.He didn't interrupt me--not long interruptions. He did speak out aquick little word now and then, at some of the parts; and once I knowI saw him wipe a tear from his eyes. After that he put up his hand andsat with his eyes covered all the rest of the time I was talking. Andhe didn't take it down till I said:"And so, Father, that's why I told you; 'cause it seemed to me if_you_ wanted to try again, and _she_ wanted to try again, why can'tyou do it? Oh, Father, think how perfectly lovely 'twould be if youdid, and if it worked! Why, I wouldn't care whether I was Mary orMarie, or what I was. I'd have you and Mother both together, and, oh,how I should love it!"It was just here that Father's arm came out and slipped around me in agreat big hug."Bless your heart! But, Mary, my dear, how are we going to--to bringthis about?" And he actually stammered and blushed, and he lookedalmost young with his eyes so shining and his lips so smiling. Andthen is when my second great idea came to me."Oh, Father!" I cried, "couldn't you come courting her again--callsand flowers and candy, and all the rest? Oh, Father, couldn't you?Why, Father, of course, you could!"This last I added in my most persuasive voice, for I could see the"no" on his face even before he began to shake his head."I'm afraid not, my dear," he said then. "It would take more thana flower or a bonbon to to win your mother back now, I fear.""But you could try," I urged.He shook his head again."She wouldn't see me--if I called, my dear," he answered.He sighed as he said it, and I sighed, too. And for a minute I didn'tsay anything. Of course, if she wouldn't _see_ him--Then another idea came to me."But, Father, if she _would_ see you--I mean, if you got a chance, you_would_ tell her what you told me just now; about--about its beingyour fault, I mean, and the spirit of youth beating against the bars,and all that. You would, wouldn't you?"He didn't say anything, not anything, for such a long time I thoughthe hadn't heard me. Then, with a queer, quick drawing-in of hisbreath, he said:"I think--little girl--if--if I ever got the chance I would say--agreat deal more than I said to you to-night.""Good!" I just crowed the word, and I think I clapped my hands; butright away I straightened up and was very fine and dignified, for Isaw Aunt Hattie looking at me from across the room, as I said:"Very good, then. You shall have the chance."He turned and smiled a little, but he shook his head."Thank you, child; but I don't think you know quite what you'repromising," he said."Yes, I do."Then I told him my idea. At first he said no, and it couldn't be, andhe was very sure she wouldn't see him, even if he called. But I saidshe would if he would do exactly as I said. And I told him my plan.And after a time and quite a lot of talk, he said he would agree toit.And this morning we did it.At exactly ten o'clock he came up the steps of the house here, but hedidn't ring the bell. I had told him not to do that, and I was on thewatch for him. I knew that at ten o'clock Grandfather would be gone,Aunt Hattie probably downtown shopping, and Lester out with hisgoverness. I wasn't so sure of Mother, but I knew it was Saturday, andI believed I could manage somehow to keep her here with me, so thateverything would be all right there.And I did. I had a hard time, though. Seems as if she proposedeverything to do this morning--shopping, and a walk, and a call ona girl I knew who was sick. But I said I did not feel like doinganything but just to stay at home and rest quietly with her. (Whichwas the truth--I _didn't_ feel like doing _anything else_!) But thatalmost made matters worse than ever, for she said that was so totallyunlike me that she was afraid I must be sick; and I had all I could doto keep her from calling a doctor.[Illustration: THEN I TOLD HIM MY IDEA]But I did it; and at five minutes before ten she was sitting quietlysewing in her own room. Then I went downstairs to watch for Father.He came just on the dot, and I let him in and took him into thelibrary. Then I went upstairs and told Mother there was some onedownstairs who wanted to see her.And she said, how funny, and wasn't there any name, and where was themaid. But I didn't seem to hear. I had gone into my room in quite ahurry, as if I had forgotten something I wanted to do there. But,of course, I didn't do a thing--except to make sure that she wentdownstairs to the library.They're there now _together_. And he's been here a whole hour already.Seems as if he ought to say _something_ in that length of time!After I was sure Mother was down, I took out this, and began to writein it. And I've been writing ever since. But, oh, I do so wonderwhat's going on down there. I'm so excited over--       *       *       *       *       *_One week later_.At just that minute Mother came into the room. I wish you could haveseen her. My stars, but she looked pretty!--with her shining eyes andthe lovely pink in her cheeks. And _young_! Honestly, I believe shelooked younger than I did that minute.She just came and put her arms around me and kissed me; and I sawthen that her eyes were all misty with tears. She didn't say a word,hardly, only that Father wanted to see me, and I was to go right down.And I went.I thought, of course, that she was coming too. But she didn't. Andwhen I got down the stairs I found I was all alone; but I went righton into the library, and there was Father waiting for me._He_ didn't say much, either, at first; but just like Mother he puthis arms around me and kissed me, and held me there. Then, very soon,he began to talk; and, oh, he said such beautiful things--_such_tender, lovely, sacred things; too sacred even to write down here.Then he kissed me again and went away.But he came back the next day, and he's been here some part of everyday since. And, oh, what a wonderful week it has been!They're going to be married. It's to-morrow. They'd have been marriedright away at the first, only they had to wait--something aboutlicenses and a five-day notice, Mother said. Father fussed and fumed,and wanted to try for a special dispensation, or something; but Motherlaughed, and said certainly not, and that she guessed it was just aswell, for she positively _had_ to have a few things; and he needn'tthink he could walk right in like that on a body and expect her toget married at a moment's notice. But she didn't mean it. I know shedidn't; for when Father reproached her, she laughed softly, and calledhim an old goose, and said, yes, of course, she'd have married himin two minutes if it hadn't been for the five-day notice, no matterwhether she ever had a new dress or not.And that's the way it is with them all the time. They're too funny andlovely together for anything. (Aunt Hattie says they're too silly foranything; but nobody minds Aunt Hattie.) They just can't seem to doenough for each other. Father was going next week to a place 'way onthe other side of the world to view an eclipse of the moon, but hesaid right off he'd give it up. But Mother said, "No, indeed," sheguessed he _wouldn't_ give it up; that he was going, and that she wasgoing, too--a wedding trip; and that she was sure she didn't know abetter place to go for a wedding trip than the moon! And Father was_so_ pleased. And he said he'd try not to pay all his attention to thestars this time; and Mother laughed and said, "Nonsense," and that sheadored stars herself, and that he _must_ pay attention to the stars.It was his business to. Then she looked very wise and got offsomething she'd read in the astronomy book. And they both laughed, andlooked over to me to see if I was noticing. And I was. And so then weall laughed.And, as I said before, it is all perfectly lovely and wonderful.So it's all settled, and they're going right away on this trip andcall it a wedding trip. And, of course, Grandfather had to get off hisjoke about how he thought it was a pretty dangerous business; and tosee that _this_ honeymoon didn't go into an eclipse while they werewatching the other one. But nobody minds Grandfather.I'm to stay here and finish school. Then, in the spring, when Fatherand Mother come back, we are all to go to Andersonville and begin tolive in the old house again.Won't it be lovely? It just seems too good to be true. Why, I don'tcare a bit now whether I'm Mary or Marie. But, then, nobody else does,either. In fact, both of them call me the whole name now, Mary Marie.I don't think they ever _said_ they would. They just began to do it.That's all.Of course, anybody can see why: _now_ each one is calling me the otherone's name along with their own. That is, Mother is calling me Maryalong with her pet Marie, and Father is calling me Marie along withhis pet Mary.Funny, isn't it?But one thing is sure, anyway. How about this being a love story_now_? Oh, I'm so excited!CHAPTER IXWHICH IS THE TESTANDERSONVILLE. _Twelve years later_._Twelve years_--yes. And I'm twenty-eight years old. Pretty old,little Mary Marie of the long ago would think. And, well, perhapsto-day I feel just as old as she would put it.I came up into the attic this morning to pack away some things I shallno longer need, now that I am going to leave Jerry. (Jerry ismy husband.) And in the bottom of my little trunk I found thismanuscript. I had forgotten that such a thing existed; but with itslaboriously written pages before me, it all came back to me; and Ibegan to read; here a sentence; there a paragraph; somewhere else apage. Then, with a little half laugh and half sob, I carried it to anold rocking-chair by the cobwebby dormer window, and settled myself toread it straight through.And I have read it.Poor little Mary Marie! Dear little Mary Marie! To meet you like this,to share with you your joys and sorrows, hopes and despairs, ofthose years long ago, is like sitting hand in hand on a sofa with achildhood's friend, each listening to an eager "And do you remember?"falling constantly from delighted lips that cannot seem to talk halffast enough.But you have taught me much, little Mary Marie. I understand--oh, Iunderstand so many things so much better, now, since reading thislittle story in your round childish hand. You see, I had almostforgotten that I was a Mary and a Marie--Jerry calls me Mollie--and Ihad wondered what were those contending forces within me. I know now.It is the Mary and the Marie trying to settle their old, old quarrel.It was almost dark when I had finished the manuscript. The far cornersof the attic were peopled with fantastic shadows, and the spiders inthe window were swaying, lazy and full-stomached, in the midst of theday's spoils of gruesome wings and legs. I got up slowly, stiffly,shivering a little. I felt suddenly old and worn and ineffably weary.It is a long, long journey back to our childhood--sometimes, eventhough one may be only twenty-eight.I looked down at the last page of the manuscript. It was written onthe top sheet of a still thick pad of paper, and my fingers fairlytingled suddenly, to go on and cover those unused white sheets--tellwhat happened next--tell the rest of the story; not for the sake ofthe story--but for my sake. It might help me. It might make thingsclearer. It might help to justify myself in my own eyes. Not that Ihave any doubts, of course (about leaving Jerry, I mean), but thatwhen I saw it in black and white I could be even more convinced that Iwas doing what was best for him and best for me.So I brought the manuscript down to my own room, and this evening Ihave commenced to write. I can't finish it to-night, of course. But Ihave to-morrow, and still to-morrow. (I have so many to-morrows now!And what do they all amount to?) And so I'll just keep writing, as Ihave time, till I bring it to the end.I'm sorry that it must be so sad and sorry an end. But there's noother way, of course. There can be but one ending, as I can see. I'msorry. Mother'll be sorry, too. She doesn't know yet. I hate to tellher. Nobody knows--not even Jerry himself--yet. They all think I'mjust making a visit to Mother--and I am--till I write that letter toJerry. And then--I believe now that I'll wait till I've finished writing this. I'llfeel better then. My mind will be clearer. I'll know more what to say.Just the effort of writing it down--Of course, if Jerry and I hadn't--But this is no way to begin. Like the little Mary Marie of long ago Iam in danger of starting my dinner with ice-cream instead of soup!And so I must begin where I left off, of course. And that was at thewedding.I remember that wedding as if it were yesterday. I can see now, withMary Marie's manuscript before me, why it made so great an impressionupon me. It was a very quiet wedding, of course--just the membersof the family present. But I shall never forget the fine, sweetloveliness of Mother's face, nor the splendid strength and tendernessof Father's. And the way he drew her into his arms and kissed her,after it was all over--well, I remember distinctly that even AuntHattie choked up and had to turn her back to wipe her eyes.They went away at once, first to New York for a day or two, then toAndersonville, to prepare for the real wedding trip to the other sideof the world. I stayed in Boston at school; and because nothing ofconsequence happened all those weeks and months is the reason, Isuspect, why the manuscript got tossed into the bottom of my littletrunk and stayed there.In the spring, when Father and Mother returned, and we all went backto Andersonville, there followed another long period of just happygirlhood, and I suspect I was too satisfied and happy to think ofwriting. After all, I've noticed it's when we're sad or troubled oversomething that we have that tingling to cover perfectly good whitepaper with "confessions" and "stories of my life." As witness rightnow what I'm doing.And so it's not surprising, perhaps, that Mary Marie's manuscriptstill lay forgotten in the little old trunk after it was taken up tothe attic. Mary Marie was happy.And it _was_ happy--that girlhood of mine, after we came back toAndersonville. I can see now, as I look back at it, that Father andMother were doing everything in their power to blot out of my memorythose unhappy years of my childhood. For that matter, they were alsodoing everything in their power to blot out of their _own_ memoriesthose same unhappy years. To me, as I look back at it, it seemsthat they must have succeeded wonderfully. They were very happy, Ibelieve--Father and Mother.Oh, it was not always easy--even I could see that. It took a lot ofadjusting--a lot of rubbing off of square corners to keep the dailylife running smoothly. But when two persons are determined that itshall run smoothly--when each is steadfastly looking to the _other's_happiness, not at his own--why, things just can't help smoothing outthen. But it takes them both. One can't do it alone. Now, if Jerrywould only--But it isn't time to speak of Jerry yet.I'll go back to my girlhood.It was a trying period--it must have been--for Father and Mother, inspite of their great love for me, and their efforts to create for mea happiness that would erase the past from my mind. I realize it now.For, after all, I was just a girl--a young girl, like other girls;high-strung, nervous, thoughtless, full of my whims and fancies; and,in addition, with enough of my mother and enough of my father withinme to make me veritably a cross-current and a contradiction, as I hadsaid that I was in the opening sentence of my childish autobiography.I had just passed my sixteenth birthday when we all came back to livein Andersonville. For the first few months I suspect that just theglory and the wonder and joy of living in the old home, with Fatherand Mother _happy together_, was enough to fill all my thoughts. Then,as school began in the fall, I came down to normal living again, andbecame a girl--just a growing girl in her teens.How patient Mother was, and Father, too! I can see now how gently andtactfully they helped me over the stones and stumbling-blocks thatstrew the pathway of every sixteen-year-old girl who thinks, becauseshe has turned down her dresses and turned up her hair, that she isgrown up, and can do and think and talk as she pleases.I well remember how hurt and grieved and superior I was at Mother'sinsistence upon more frequent rubbers and warm coats, and fewerice-cream sodas and chocolate bonbons. Why, surely I was old enough_now_ to take care of myself! Wasn't I ever to be allowed to have myown opinions and exercise my own judgment? It seemed not! Thus spokesuperior sixteen.As for clothes!--I remember distinctly the dreary November rainstormof the morning I reproachfully accused Mother of wanting to make meback into a stupid little Mary, just because she so uncompromisinglydisapproved of the beaded chains and bangles and jeweled combs andspangled party dresses that "every girl in school" was wearing. Why,the idea! Did she want me to dress like a little frump of a countrygirl? It seems she did.Poor mother! Dear mother! I wonder how she kept her patience at all.But she kept it. I remember that distinctly, too.It was that winter that I went through the morbid period. Like ourchildhood's measles and whooping cough, it seems to come to most ofus--us women children. I wonder why? Certainly it came to me. True totype I cried by the hour over fancied slights from my schoolmates, andbrooded days at a time because Father or Mother "didn't understand," Iquestioned everything in the earth beneath and the heavens above;and in my dark despair over an averted glance from my most intimatefriend, I meditated on whether life was, or was not, worth the living,with a preponderance toward the latter.Being plunged into a state of settled gloom, I then became acutelyanxious as to my soul's salvation, and feverishly pursued every ismand ology that caught my roving eye's attention, until in one shortmonth I had become, in despairing rotation, an incipient agnostic,atheist, pantheist, and monist. Meanwhile I read Ibsen, and wiselydiscussed the new school of domestic relationships.Mother--dear mother!--looked on aghast. She feared, I think, for mylife; certainly for my sanity and morals.It was Father this time who came to the rescue. He pooh-poohedMother's fears; said it was indigestion that ailed me, or that I wasgrowing too fast; or perhaps I didn't get enough sleep, or needed,maybe, a good tonic. He took me out of school, and made it a point toaccompany me on long walks. He talked with me--not _to_ me--about thebirds and the trees and the sunsets, and then about the deeper thingsof life, until, before I realized it, I was sane and sensible oncemore, serene and happy in the simple faith of my childhood, with allthe isms and ologies a mere bad dream in the dim past.I was seventeen, if I remember rightly, when I became worried, notover my heavenly estate now, but my earthly one. I must have a career,of course. No namby-pamby everyday living of dishes and dusting andmeals and babies for me. It was all very well, of course, for somepeople. Such things had to be. But for me--I could write, of course; but I was not sure but that I preferred thestage. At the same time there was within me a deep stirring as of acall to go out and enlighten the world, especially that portion of itin darkest Africa or deadliest India. I would be a missionary.Before I was eighteen, however, I had abandoned all this. Father puthis foot down hard on the missionary project, and Mother put hers downon the stage idea. I didn't mind so much, though, as I remember, foron further study and consideration, I found that flowers and applausewere not all of an actor's life, and that Africa and India were notentirely desirable as a place of residence for a young woman alone.Besides, I had decided by then that I could enlighten the world justas effectually (and much more comfortably) by writing stories at homeand getting them printed.So I wrote stories--but I did not get any of them printed, in spiteof my earnest efforts. In time, therefore, that idea, also, wasabandoned; and with it, regretfully, the idea of enlightening theworld at all.Besides, I had just then (again if I remember rightfully) fallen inlove.Not that it was the first time. Oh, no, not at eighteen, when atthirteen I had begun confidently and happily to look for it! What asentimental little piece I was! How could they have been so patientwith me--Father, Mother, everybody!I think the first real attack--the first that I consciouslycalled love, myself--was the winter after we had all come back toAndersonville to live. I was sixteen and in the high school.It was Paul Mayhew--yes, the same Paul Mayhew that had defied hismother and sister and walked home with me one night and invited me togo for an automobile ride, only to be sent sharply about his businessby my stern, inexorable Aunt Jane. Paul was in the senior class now,and the handsomest, most admired boy in school. He didn't care forgirls. That is, he said he didn't. He bore himself with a supremeindifference that was maddening, and that took (apparently) no noticeof the fact that every girl in school was a willing slave to the merenodding of his head or the beckoning of his hand.This was the condition of things when I entered school that fall,and perhaps for a week thereafter. Then one day, very suddenly, andwithout apparent reason, he awoke to the fact of my existence. Candy,flowers, books--some one of these he brought to me every morning. Allduring the school day he was my devoted gallant, dancing attendanceevery possible minute outside of session hours, and walking home withme in the afternoon, proudly carrying my books. Did I say "_home_ withme"? That is not strictly true--he always stopped just one block shortof "home"--one block short of my gate. He evidently had not forgottenAunt Jane, and did not intend to take any foolish risks! So he saidgood-bye to me always at a safe distance.That this savored of deception, or was in any way objectionable, didnot seem to have occurred to me. Even if it had, I doubt very much ifmy course would have been altered, for I was bewitched and fascinatedand thrilled with the excitement of it all. I was sixteen, remember,and this wonderful Adonis and woman-hater had chosen me, _me!_--andleft all the other girls desolate and sighing, looking after us withlonging eyes. Of course, I was thrilled!This went on for perhaps a week. Then he asked me to attend a schoolsleigh-ride and supper with him.I was wild with delight. At the same time I was wild withapprehension. I awoke suddenly to the fact of the existence of Fatherand Mother, and that their permission must be gained. And I had mydoubts--I had very grave doubts. Yet it seemed to me at that momentthat I just _had_ to go on that sleigh-ride. That it was the onlything in the whole wide world worth while.I can remember now, as if it were yesterday, the way I debated in mymind as to whether I should ask Father, Mother, or both together; andif I should let it be seen how greatly I desired to go, and how muchit meant to me; or if I should just mention it as in passing, and taketheir permission practically for granted.I chose the latter course, and I took a time when they were bothtogether. At the breakfast-table I mentioned casually that the schoolwas to have a sleigh-ride and supper the next Friday afternoon andevening, and that Paul Mayhew had asked me to go with him, I said Ihoped it would be a pleasant night, but that I should wear my sweaterunder my coat, anyway, and I'd wear my leggings, too, if they thoughtit necessary.(Sweater and leggings! Two of Mother's hobbies. Artful child!)But if I thought that a sweater and a pair of leggings could muffletheir ears as to what had gone before, I soon found my mistake."A sleigh-ride, supper, and not come home until evening?" criedMother. "And with whom, did you say?""Paul Mayhew," I answered. I still tried to speak casually; at thesame time I tried to indicate by voice and manner something of thegreat honor that had been bestowed upon their daughter.Father was impressed--plainly impressed; but not at all in the way Ihad hoped he would be. He gave me a swift, sharp glance; then lookedstraight at Mother."Humph! Paul Mayhew! Yes, I know him," he said grimly. "And I'mdreading the time when he comes into college next year.""You mean--" Mother hesitated and stopped."I mean I don't like the company he keeps--already," nodded Father."Then you don't think that Mary Marie--" Mother hesitated again, andglanced at me."Certainly not," said Father decidedly.I knew then, of course, that he meant I couldn't go on thesleigh-ride, even though he hadn't said the words right out. I forgotall about being casual and indifferent and matter-of-course then. Ithought only of showing them how absolutely necessary it was forthem to let me go on that sleigh-ride, unless they wanted my lifeforever-more hopelessly blighted.I explained carefully how he was the handsomest, most popular boyin school, and how all the girls were just crazy to be asked to goanywhere with him; and I argued what if Father had seen him with boyshe did not like--then that was all the more reason why nice girls likeme, when he asked them, should go with him, so as to keep him awayfrom the bad boys! And I told them, that this was the first and last,and only sleigh-ride of the school that year; and I said I'd beheart-broken, just heart-broken, if they did not let me go. And Ireminded them again that he was the very handsomest, most popular boyin school; and that there wasn't a girl I knew who wouldn't be crazyto be in my shoes.Then I stopped, all out of breath, and I can imagine just how pleadingand palpitating I looked.I thought Father was going to refuse right away, but I saw the glancethat Mother threw him--the glance that said, "Let me attend to this,dear." I'd seen that glance before, several times, and I knew justwhat it meant; so I wasn't surprised to see Father shrug his shouldersand turn away as Mother said to me:"Very well, dear. Ill think it over and let you know to-night."But I was surprised that night to have Mother say I could go, for I'dabout given up hope, after all that talk at the breakfast-table. Andshe said something else that surprised me, too. She said she'd like toknow Paul Mayhew herself; that she always wanted to know the friendsof her little girl. And she told me to ask him to call the nextevening and play checkers or chess with me.Happy? I could scarcely contain myself for joy. And when the nextevening came bringing Paul, and Mother, all prettily dressed as ifhe were really truly company, came into the room and talked sobeautifully to him, I was even more entranced. To be sure, it didbother me a little that Paul laughed so much, and so loudly, and thathe couldn't seem to find anything to talk about only himself, and whathe was doing, and what he was going to do. Some way, he had neverseemed like that at school. And I was afraid Mother wouldn't likethat.All the evening I was watching and listening with her eyes and herears everything he did, everything he said. I so wanted Mother to likehim! I so wanted Mother to see how really fine and splendid and noblehe was. But that evening--Why _couldn't_ he stop talking about theprizes he'd won, and the big racing car he'd just ordered for nextsummer? There was nothing fine and splendid and noble about that. And_were_ his finger nails always so dirty?Why, Mother would think--Mother did not stay in the room all the time; but she was in more orless often to watch the game; and at half-past nine she brought insome little cakes and lemonade as a surprise. I thought it was lovely;but I could have shaken Paul when he pretended to be afraid of it, andasked Mother if there was a stick in it.The idea--Mother! A stick!I just knew Mother wouldn't like that. But if she didn't, she nevershowed a thing in her face. She just smiled, and said no, there wasn'tany stick in it; and passed the cakes.When he had gone I remember I didn't like to meet Mother's eyes, and Ididn't ask her how she liked Paul Mayhew. I kept right on talking fastabout something else. Some way, I didn't want Mother to talk then, forfear of what she would say.And Mother didn't say anything about Paul Mayhew--then. But only a fewdays later she told me to invite him again to the house (this time toa chafing-dish supper), and to ask Carrie Heywood and Fred Small, too.We had a beautiful time, only again Paul Mayhew didn't "show off" atall in the way I wanted him to--though he most emphatically "showedoff" in _his_ way! It seemed to me that he bragged even more abouthimself and his belongings than he had before. And I didn't like atall the way he ate his food. Why, Father didn't eat like that--withsuch a noisy mouth, and such a rattling of the silverware!And so it went--wise mother that she was! Far from prohibiting me tohave anything to do with Paul Mayhew, she let me see all I wantedto of him, particularly in my own home. She let me go out with him,properly chaperoned, and she never, by word or manner, hinted that shedidn't admire his conceit and braggadocio.And it all came out exactly as I suspect she had planned from thebeginning. When Paul Mayhew asked to be my escort to the classreception in June, I declined with thanks, and immediately afterwardstold Fred Small I would go with _him_. But even when I told Mothernonchalantly, and with carefully averted eyes, that I was going to thereception with Fred Small--even then her pleasant "Well, that's good!"conveyed only cheery mother interest; nor did a hasty glance into herface discover so much as a lifted eyebrow to hint, "I thought you'dcome to your senses _sometime_!"Wise little mother that she was!In the days and weeks that followed (though nothing was said) Idetected a subtle change in certain matters, however. And as I lookback at it now, I am sure I can trace its origin to my "affair" withPaul Mayhew. Evidently Mother had no intention of running the risk ofany more block-away courtships; also evidently she intended to knowwho my friends were. At all events, the old Anderson mansion soonbecame the rendezvous of all the boys and girls of my acquaintance.And such good times as we had, with Mother always one of us, and everproposing something new and interesting!And because boys--not _a_ boy, but boys--were as free to come tothe house as were girls, they soon seemed to me as commonplace andmatter-of-course and free from sentimental interest as were the girls.Again wise little mother!But, of course, even this did not prevent my falling in love with someone older than myself, some one quite outside of my own circle ofintimates. Almost every girl in her teens at some time falls violentlyin love with some remote being almost old enough to be her father--abeing whom she endows with all the graces and perfections of her dreamAdonis. For, after all, it isn't that she is in love with _him_, thisman of flesh and blood before her; it is that she is in love with_love_. A very different matter.My especial attack of this kind came to me when I was barely eighteen,the spring I was being graduated from the Andersonville High School.And the visible embodiment of my adoration was the head master, Mr.Harold Hartshorn, a handsome, clean-shaven, well-set-up man of (Ishould judge) thirty-five years of age, rather grave, a little stern,and very dignified.But how I adored him! How I hung upon his every word, his everyglance! How I maneuvered to win from him a few minutes' conversationon a Latin verb or a French translation! How I thrilled if he bestowedupon me one of his infrequent smiles! How I grieved over his sternaloofness!By the end of a month I had evolved this: his stern aloofnessmeant that he had been disappointed in love; his melancholy wasloneliness--his heart was breaking. How I longed to help, to heal, tocure! How I thrilled at the thought of the love and companionship _I_could give him somewhere in a rose-embowered cottage far from themadding crowd! (He boarded at the Andersonville Hotel alone now.) Whatnobler career could I have than the blotting out of his stricken heartthe memory of that faithless woman who had so wounded him and blightedhis youth? What, indeed? If only he could see it as I saw it. If onlyby some sign or token he could know of the warm love that was his butfor the asking! Could he not see that no longer need he pine alone andunappreciated in the Andersonville Hotel? Why, in just a few weeks Iwas to be through school. And then--On the night before commencement Mr. Harold Hartshorn ascended ourfront steps, rang the bell, and called for my father. I knew because Iwas upstairs in my room over the front door; and I saw him come up thewalk and heard him ask for Father.Oh, joy! Oh, happy day! He knew. He had seen it as I saw it. He hadcome to gain Father's permission, that he might be a duly accreditedsuitor for my hand!During the next ecstatic ten minutes, with my hand pressed against mywildly beating heart, I planned my wedding dress, selected with careand discrimination my trousseau, furnished the rose-embowered cottagefar from the madding crowd--and wondered _why_ Father did not send forme. Then the slam of the screen door downstairs sent me to the window,a sickening terror within me,Was he _going_--without seeing me, his future bride? Impossible!Father and Mr. Harold Hartshorn stood on the front steps below,talking. In another minute Mr. Harold Hartshorn had walked away, andFather had turned back on to the piazza.As soon as I could control my shaking knees, I went downstairs.Father was in his favorite rocking-chair. I advanced slowly. I did notsit down."Was that Mr. Hartshorn?" I asked, trying to keep the shake out of myvoice."Yes.""Mr. H-Hartshorn," I repeated stupidly."Yes. He came to see me about the Downer place," nodded Father. "Hewants to rent it for next year.""To rent it--the Downer place!" (The Downer place was norose-embowered cottage far from the madding crowd! Why, it was big,and brick, and _right next_ to the hotel! I didn't want to livethere.)"Yes--for his wife and family. He's going to bring them back with himnext year," explained Father."His wife and family!" I can imagine about how I gasped out those fourwords."Yes. He has five children, I believe, and--"But I had fled to my room.After all, my recovery was rapid. I was in love with love, you see;not with Mr. Harold Hartshorn. Besides, the next year I went tocollege. And it was while I was at college that I met Jerry.Jerry was the brother of my college friend, Helen Weston. Helen'selder sister was a senior in that same college, and was graduated atthe close of my freshman year. The father, mother, and brother came onto the graduation. And that is where I met Jerry.If it might be called meeting him. He lifted his hat, bowed, said apolite nothing with his lips, and an indifferent "Oh, some friend ofHelen's," with his eyes, and turned to a radiant blonde senior at myside.And that was all--for him. But for me--All that day I watched him whenever opportunity offered; and Isuspect that I took care that opportunity offered frequently. I wasfascinated. I had never seen any one like him before. Tall, handsome,brilliant, at perfect ease, he plainly dominated every group of whichhe was a part. Toward him every face was turned--yet he never seemedto know it. (Whatever his faults, Jerry is _not_ conceited. I willgive him credit for that!) To me he did not speak again that day. I amnot sure that he even looked at me. If he did there must still havebeen in his eyes only the "Oh, some friend of Helen's," that I hadseen at the morning introduction.I did not meet Jerry Weston again for nearly a year; but that did notmean that I did not hear of him. I wonder if Helen ever noticed howoften I used to get her to talk of her home and her family life; andhow interested I was in her gallery of portraits on the mantel--therewere two fine ones of her brother there.Helen was very fond of her brother. I soon found that she loved totalk about him--if she had a good listener. Needless to say she had avery good one in me.Jerry was an artist, it seemed. He was twenty-eight years old, andalready he had won no small distinction. Prizes, medals, honorablemention, and a special course abroad--all these Helen told me about.She told me, too, about the wonderful success he had just had with theportrait of a certain New York society woman. She said that it wasjust going to "make" Jerry; that he could have anything he wantednow--anything. Then she told me how popular he always was witheverybody. Helen was not only very fond of her brother, but very proudof him. That was plain to be seen. In her opinion, evidently, therewas none to be compared with him.And apparently, in my own mind, I agreed with her--there was none tobe compared with him. At all events, all the other boys that usedto call and bring me candy and send me flowers at about this timesuffered woefully in comparison with him! I remember that. So tamethey were--so crude and young and unpolished!I saw Jerry myself during the Easter vacation of my second year incollege. Helen invited me to go home with her, and Mother wrote that Imight go. Helen had been home with me for the Christmas vacation,and Mother and Father liked her very much. There was no hesitation,therefore, in their consent that I should visit Helen at Easter-time.So I went.Helen lived in New York. Their home was a Fifth-Avenue mansion withnine servants, four automobiles, and two chauffeurs. Naturally sucha scale of living was entirely new to me, and correspondinglyfascinating. From the elaborately uniformed footman that opened thedoor for me to the awesome French maid who "did" my hair, I adoredthem all, and moved as in a dream of enchantment. Then came Jerry homefrom a week-end's trip--and I forgot everything else.I knew from the minute his eyes looked into mine that whatever I hadbeen before, I was now certainly no mere "Oh, some friend of Helen's."I was (so his eyes said) "a deucedly pretty girl, and one well worthcultivating." Whereupon he began at once to do the "cultivating."And just here, perversely enough, I grew indifferent. Or was it onlyfeigned--not consciously, but unconsciously? Whatever it was, it didnot endure long. Nothing could have endured, under the circumstances.Nothing ever endures--with Jerry on the other side.In less than thirty-six hours I was caught up in the whirlwind of hiswooing, and would not have escaped it if I could.When I went back to college he held my promise that if he could gainthe consent of Father and Mother, he might put the engagement ring onmy finger.Back at college, alone in my own room, I drew a long breath, and beganto think. It was the first chance I had had, for even Helen now hadbecome Jerry--by reflection.The more I thought, the more frightened, dismayed, and despairing Ibecame. In the clear light of calm, sane reasoning, it was all soabsurd, so impossible! What could I have been thinking of?Of Jerry, of course.With hot cheeks I answered my own question. And even the thought ofhim then cast the spell of his presence about me, and again I was backin the whirl of dining and dancing and motoring, with his dear faceat my side. Of Jerry; yes, of Jerry I was thinking. But I must forgetJerry.I pictured Jerry in Andersonville, in my own home. I tried to picturehim talking to Father, to Mother.Absurd! What had Jerry to do with learned treatises on stars, or withthe humdrum, everyday life of a stupid small town? For that matter,what had Father and Mother to do with dancing and motoring andpainting society queens' portraits? Nothing.Plainly, even if Jerry, for the sake of the daughter, liked Father andMother, Father and Mother certainly would not like Jerry. That wascertain.Of course I cried myself to sleep that night. That was to be expected.Jerry was the world; and the world was lost. There was nothing leftexcept, perhaps, a few remnants and pieces, scarcely worth thecounting--excepting, of course, Father and Mother. But one could notalways have one's father and mother. There would come a time when--Jerry's letter came the next day--by special delivery. He had gonestraight home from the station and begun to write to me. (How likeJerry that was--particularly the special-delivery stamp!) The most ofhis letter, aside from the usual lover's rhapsodies, had to do withplans for the summer--what we would do together at the Westons'summer cottage in Newport. He said he should run up to Andersonvilleearly--very early; just as soon as I was back from college, in fact,so that he might meet Father and Mother, and put that ring on myfinger.And while I read the letter, I just knew he would do it. Why, I couldeven see the sparkle of the ring on my finger. But in five minutesafter the letter was folded and put away, I knew, with equalcertitude--that he wouldn't.It was like that all that spring term. While under the spell of theletters, as I read them, I saw myself the adored wife of Jerry Weston,and happy ever after. All the rest of the time I knew myself to beplain Mary Marie Anderson, forever lonely and desolate.I had been at home exactly eight hours when a telegram from Jerryasked permission to come at once.As gently as I could I broke the news to Father and Mother. He wasHelen's brother. They must have heard me mention him, I knew him well,very well, indeed. In fact, the purpose of this visit was to ask themfor the hand of their daughter.Father frowned and scolded, and said, "Tut, tut!" and that I wasnothing but a child. But Mother smiled and shook her head, even whileshe sighed, and reminded him that I was twenty--two whole years olderthan she was when she married him; though in the same breath sheadmitted that I _was_ young, and she certainly hoped I'd be willing towait before I married, even if the young man was all that they couldask him to be.Father was still a little rebellious, I think; but Mother--bless herdear sympathetic heart!--soon convinced him that they must at leastconsent to see this Gerald Weston. So I sent the wire inviting him tocome.More fearfully than ever then I awaited the meeting between my loverand my father and mother. With the Westons' mansion and manner ofliving in the glorified past, and the Anderson homestead, and _its_manner of living, very much in the plain, unvarnished present, Itrembled more than ever for the results of that meeting. Not that Ibelieved Jerry would be snobbish enough to scorn our simplicity, butthat there would be no common meeting-ground of congeniality.I need not have worried--but I did not know Jerry then so well as I donow.Jerry came--and he had not been five minutes in the house before itmight easily have seemed that he had always been there. He _did_ knowabout stars; at least, he talked with Father about them, and so asto hold Father's interest, too. And he knew a lot about innumerablethings in which Mother was interested. He stayed four days; and allthe while he was there, I never so much as thought of ceremoniousdress and dinners, and liveried butlers and footmen; nor did it onceoccur to me that our simple kitchen Nora, and Old John's son at thewheel of our one motorcar, were not beautifully and entirely adequate,so unassumingly and so perfectly did Jerry unmistakably "fit in."(There are no other words that so exactly express what I mean.) And inthe end, even his charm and his triumph were so unobtrusively completethat I never thought of being surprised at the prompt capitulation ofboth Father and Mother.Jerry had brought the ring. (Jerry always brings his "rings"--andhe never fails to "put them on.") And he went back to New York withMother's promise that I should visit them in July at their cottage inNewport.They seemed like a dream--those four days--after he had gone; and Ishould have been tempted to doubt the whole thing had there not beenthe sparkle of the ring on my finger, and the frequent reference toJerry on the lips of both Father and Mother.They loved Jerry, both of them. Father said he was a fine, manly youngfellow; and Mother said he was a dear boy, a very dear boy. Neither ofthem spoke much of his painting. Jerry himself had scarcely mentionedit to them, as I remembered, after he had gone.I went to Newport in July. "The cottage," as I suspected, was twiceas large and twice as pretentious as the New York residence; and itsported twice the number of servants. Once again I was caught in thewhirl of dinners and dances and motoring, with the addition of tennisand bathing. And always, at my side, was Jerry, seemingly living onlyupon my lightest whim and fancy. He wished to paint my portrait; butthere was no time, especially as my visit, in accordance with Mother'sinexorable decision, was of only one week's duration.But what a wonderful week that was! I seemed to be under a kind ofspell. It was as if I were in a new world--a world such as no one hadever been in before. Oh, I knew, of course, that others had loved--butnot as we loved. I was sure that no one had ever loved as we loved.And it was so much more wonderful than anything I had ever dreamedof--this love of ours. Yet all my life since my early teens I hadbeen thinking and planning and waiting for it--love. And now it hadcome--the real thing. The others--all the others had been shams andmake-believes and counterfeits. To think that I ever thought thosesilly little episodes with Paul Mayhew and Freddy Small and Mr. HaroldHartshorn were love! Absurd! But now--And so I walked and moved and breathed in this spell that had beencast upon me; and thought--little fool that I was!--that never hadthere been before, nor could there be again, a love quite so wonderfulas ours.At Newport Jerry decided that he wanted to be married right away. Hedidn't want to wait two more endless years until I was graduated. Theidea of wasting all that valuable time when we might be together! Andwhen there was really no reason for it, either--no reason at all!I smiled to myself, even as I thrilled at his sweet insistence. I waspretty sure I knew two reasons--two very good reasons--why I could notmarry before graduation. One reason was Father; the other reason wasMother. I hinted as much."Ho! Is that all?" He laughed and kissed me. "I'll run down and seethem about it," he said jauntily.I smiled again. I had no more idea that anything he could say would--But I didn't know Jerry--_then_.I had not been home from Newport a week when Jerry kept his promiseand "ran down." And _he_ had not been there two days before Father andMother admitted that, perhaps, after all, it would not be so bad anidea if I shouldn't graduate, but should be married instead.And so I was married.(Didn't I tell you that Jerry always brought his rings and put themon?)And again I say, and so we were married.But what did we know of each other?--the real other? True, we haddanced together, been swimming together, dined together, played tennistogether. But what did we really know of each other's whims andprejudices, opinions and personal habits and tastes? I knew, to aword, what Jerry would say about a sunset; and he knew, I fancy, whatI would say about a dreamy waltz song. But we didn't either of us knowwhat the other would say to a dinnerless home with the cook gone. Wewere leaving a good deal to be learned later on; but we didn't thinkof that. Love that is to last must be built upon the realization thattroubles and trials and sorrows are sure to come, and that they mustbe borne together--if one back is not to break under the load. Wewere entering into a contract, not for a week, but, presumedly, for alifetime--and a good deal may come to one in a lifetime--not all of itpleasant. We had been brought up in two distinctly different socialenvironments, but we didn't stop to think of that. We liked the samesunsets, and the same make of car, and the same kind of ice-cream;and we looked into each other's eyes and _thought_ we knew theother--whereas we were really only seeing the mirrored reflection ofourselves.And so we were married.It was everything that was blissful and delightful, of course, atfirst. We were still eating the ice-cream and admiring the sunsets. Ihad forgotten that there were things other than sunsets and ice-cream,I suspect. I was not twenty-one, remember, and my feet fairly achedto dance. The whole world was a show. Music, lights, laughter--how Iloved them all!_Marie_, of course. Well, yes, I suspect Marie _was_ in the ascendancyabout that time. But I never thought of it that way.Then came the baby, Eunice, my little girl; and with one touch of hertiny, clinging fingers, the whole world of sham--the lights and musicand glare and glitter just faded all away into nothingness, where itbelonged. As if anything counted, with _her_ on the other side of thescales!I found out then--oh, I found out lots of things. You see, it wasn'tthat way at all with Jerry. The lights and music and the glitter andthe sham didn't fade away a mite, to him, when Eunice came. In fact,sometimes it seemed to me they just grew stronger, if anything.He didn't like it because I couldn't go with him any more--to dancesand things, I mean. He said the nurse could take care of Eunice. As ifI'd leave my baby with any nurse that ever lived, for any old dance!The idea! But Jerry went. At first he stayed with me; but the babycried, and Jerry didn't like that. It made him irritable and nervous,until I was _glad_ to have him go. (Who wouldn't be, with his eternalrepetition of "Mollie, _can't_ you stop that baby's crying?" As ifthat wasn't exactly what I was trying to do, as hard as ever I could!)But Jerry didn't see it that way. Jerry never did appreciate what awonderful, glorious thing just being a father is.I think it was at about this time that Jerry took up his paintingagain. I guess I have forgotten to mention that all through the firsttwo years of our marriage, before the baby came, he just tended to me.He never painted a single picture. But after Eunice came--But, after all, what is the use of going over these last miserableyears like this? Eunice is five now. Her father is the most popularportrait painter in the country, I am almost tempted to say that he isthe most popular _man_, as well. All the old charm and magnetism arethere. Sometimes I watch him (for, of course, I _do_ go out with himonce in a while), and always I think of that first day I saw him atcollege. Brilliant, polished, witty--he still dominates every group ofwhich he is a member. Men and women alike bow to his charm. (I'm gladit's not _only_ the women. Jerry isn't a bit of a flirt. I will saythat much for him. At any rate, if he does flirt, he flirts just asdesperately with old Judge Randlett as he does with the newest andprettiest _debutante_: with serene impartiality he bestows upon eachthe same glances, the same wit, the same adorable charm.) Praise,attention, applause, music, laughter, lights--they are the breath oflife to him. Without them he would--But, there, he never _is_ withoutthem, so I don't know what he would be.After all, I suspect that it's just that Jerry still loves theice-cream and the sunsets, and I don't. That's all. To me there'ssomething more to life than that--something higher, deeper, moreworth while. We haven't a taste in common, a thought in unison, anaspiration in harmony. I suspect--in fact I _know_--that I get on hisnerves just as raspingly as he does on mine. For that reason I'm surehe'll be glad--when he gets my letter.But, some way, I dread to tell Mother.       *       *       *       *       *Well, it's finished. I've been about four days bringing thisautobiography of Mary Marie's to an end. I've enjoyed doing it, in away, though I'll have to admit I can't see as it's made things anyclearer. But, then, it was clear before. There isn't any other way.I've got to write that letter. As I said before, I regret that it mustbe so sorry an ending.I suppose to-morrow I'll have to tell Mother. I want to tell her, ofcourse, before I write the letter to Jerry.It'll grieve Mother. I know it will. And I'm sorry. Poor Mother!Already she's had so much unhappiness in her life. But she's happynow. She and Father are wonderful together--wonderful. Father is stillPresident of the college. He got out a wonderful book on the "Eclipsesof the Moon" two years ago, and he's publishing another one about the"Eclipses of the Sun" this year. Mother's correcting proof for him.Bless her heart. She loves it. She told me so.Well, I shall have to tell her to-morrow, of course.       *       *       *       *       *_To-morrow_--_which has become to-day._I wonder if Mother _knew_ what I had come into her little sitting-roomthis morning to say. It seems as if she must have known. And yet--Ihad wondered how I was going to begin, but, before I knew it, I wasright in the middle of it--the subject, I mean. That's why I thoughtperhaps that Mother--But I'm getting as bad as little Mary Marie of the long ago. I'll trynow to tell what did happen.I was wetting my lips, and swallowing, and wondering how I was goingto begin to tell her that I was planning not to go back to Jerry, whenall of a sudden I found myself saying something about little Eunice.And then Mother said:"Yes, my dear; and that's what comforts me most of anything--becauseyou _are_ so devoted to Eunice. You see, I have feared sometimes--foryou and Jerry; that you might separate. But I know, on account ofEunice, that you never will.""But, Mother, that's the very reason--I mean, it would be the reason,"I stammered. Then I stopped. My tongue just wouldn't move, my throatand lips were so dry.To think that Mother suspected--_knew already_--about Jerry and me;and yet to say that _on account_ of Eunice I would not do it. Why, itwas _for_ Eunice, largely, that I was _going_ to do it. To let thatchild grow up thinking that dancing and motoring was all of life,and--But Mother was speaking again."Eunice--yes. You mean that you never would make her go through whatyou went through when you were her age.""Why, Mother, I--I--" And then I stopped again. And I was so angry andindignant with myself because I had to stop, when there were so many,many things that I wanted to say, if only my dry lips could articulatethe words.Mother drew her breath in with a little catch. She had grown ratherwhite."I wonder if you remember--if you ever think of--your childhood," shesaid."Why, yes, of--of course--sometimes." It was my turn to stammer. I wasthinking of that diary that I had just read--and added to.Mother drew in her breath again, this time with a catch that wasalmost a sob. And then she began to talk--at first haltingly, withhalf-finished sentences; then hurriedly, with a rush of words thatseemed not able to utter themselves fast enough to keep up with thethoughts behind them.She told of her youth and marriage, and of my coming. She told of herlife with Father, and of the mistakes she made. She told much, ofcourse, that was in Mary Marie's diary; but she told, too, oh, so muchmore, until like a panorama the whole thing lay before me.Then she spoke of me, and of my childhood, and her voice began toquiver. She told of the Mary and the Marie, and of the dual naturewithin me. (As if I didn't know about that!) But she told me much thatI did not know, and she made things much clearer to me, until I saw--You can see things so much more clearly when you stand off at adistance like this, you know, than you can when you are close to them!She broke down and cried when she spoke of the divorce, and of theinfluence it had upon me, and of the false idea of marriage it gaveme. She said it was the worst kind of thing for me--the sort of life Ihad to live. She said I grew pert and precocious and worldly-wise, andfull of servants' talk and ideas. She even spoke of that night at thelittle cafe table when I gloried in the sparkle and spangles and toldher that now we were seeing life--real life. And of how shocked shewas, and of how she saw then what this thing was doing to me. But itwas too late.She told more, much more, about the later years, and thereconciliation; then, some way, she brought things around to Jerry andme. Her face flushed up then, and she didn't meet my eyes. She lookeddown at her sewing. She was very busy turning a hem _just so_.She said there had been a time, once, when she had worried a littleabout Jerry and me, for fear we would--separate. She said that shebelieved that, for her, that would have been the very blackest momentof her life; for it would be her fault, all her fault.I tried to break in here, and say, "No, no," and that it wasn't herfault; but she shook her head and wouldn't listen, and she liftedher hand, and I had to keep still and let her go on talking. She waslooking straight into my eyes then, and there was such a deep, deephurt in them that I just had to listen.She said again that it would be her fault; that if I had done that shewould have known that it was all because of the example she herselfhad set me of childish willfulness and selfish seeking of personalhappiness at the expense of everything and everybody else. And shesaid that that would have been the last straw to break her heart.But she declared that she was sure now that she need not worry. Such athing would never be.I guess I gasped a little at this. Anyhow, I know I tried to breakin and tell her that we _were_ going to separate, and that that wasexactly what I had come into the room in the first place to say.But again she kept right on talking, and I was silenced before I hadeven begun.She said how she knew it could never be--on account of Eunice. That Iwould never subject my little girl to the sort of wretchedly dividedlife that I had had to live when I was a child.(As she spoke I was suddenly back in the cobwebby attic with littleMary Marie's diary, and I thought--what if it _were_ Eunice--writingthat!)She said I was the most devoted mother she had ever known; that I was_too_ devoted, she feared sometimes, for I made Eunice _all_ my world,to the exclusion of Jerry and everything and everybody else. But thatshe was very sure, because I _was_ so devoted, and loved Eunice sodearly, that I would never deprive her of a father's love and care.I shivered a little, and looked quickly into Mother's face. But shewas not looking at me. I was thinking of how Jerry had kissed andkissed Eunice a month ago, when we came away, as if he just couldn'tlet her go. Jerry _is_ fond of Eunice, now that she's old enough toknow something, and Eunice adores her father. I knew that part wasgoing to be hard. And now to have Mother put it like that--I began to talk then of Jerry. I just felt that I'd got to saysomething. That Mother must listen. That she didn't understand. I toldher how Jerry loved lights and music and dancing, and crowdsbowing down and worshiping him all the time. And she said yes, sheremembered; that _he'd been that way when I married him_.She spoke so sort of queerly that again I glanced at her; but shestill was looking down at the hem she was turning.I went on then to explain that _I_ didn't like such things; that _I_believed that there were deeper and higher things, and things moreworth while. And she said yes, she was glad, and that that was goingto be my saving grace; for, of course, I realized that there couldn'tbe anything deeper or higher or more worth while than keeping the hometogether, and putting up with annoyances, for the ultimate good ofall, especially of Eunice.She went right on then quickly, before I could say anything. She saidthat, of course, I understood that I was still Mary and Marie, evenif Jerry did call me Mollie; and that if Marie had married a man thatwasn't always congenial with Mary, she was very sure Mary had enoughstamina and good sense to make the best of it; and she was very sure,also, that if Mary would only make a little effort to be once in awhile the Marie he had married, things might be a lot easier--forMary.Of course, I laughed at that. I had to. And Mother laughed, too. Butwe understood. We both understood. I had never thought of it before,but I _had_ been Marie when I married Jerry. _I_ loved lights andmusic and dancing and gay crowds just exactly as well as he did. Andit wasn't his fault that I suddenly turned into Mary when the babycame, and wanted him to stay at home before the fire every eveningwith his dressing-gown and slippers. No wonder he was surprised. Hehadn't married Mary--he never knew Mary at all. But, do you know? I'dnever thought of that before--until Mother said what she did. Why,probably Jerry was just as much disappointed to find his Marie turnedinto a Mary as I--But Mother was talking again.She said that she thought Jerry was a wonderful man, in some ways;that she never saw a man with such charm and magnetism, or one whocould so readily adapt himself to different persons and circumstances.And she said she was very sure if Mary could only show a little moreinterest in pictures (especially portraits), and learn to discusslights and shadows and perspectives, that nothing would be lost, andthat something might be gained; that there was nothing, anyway, like acommunity of interest or of hobbies to bring two people together; andthat it was safer, to say the least, when it was the wife that sharedthe community of interest than when it was some other woman, though,of course, she knew as well as I knew that Jerry never would--Shedidn't finish her sentence, and because she didn't finish it, it mademe think all the more. And I wondered if she left it unfinished--onpurpose.Then, in a minute, she was talking again.She was speaking of Eunice. She said once more that because of her,she knew that she need never fear any serious trouble between Jerryand me, for, after all, it's the child that always pays for themother's mistakes and short-sightedness, just as it is the soldierthat pays for his commanding officer's blunders. That's why she feltthat I had had to pay for her mistakes, and why she knew that I'dnever compel my little girl to pay for mine. She said that the motherlives in the heart of the child long after the mother is gone, andthat was why the mother always had to be--so careful.Then, before I knew it, she was talking briskly and brightly aboutsomething entirely different; and two minutes later I found myselfalone outside of her room. And I hadn't told her.But I wasn't even thinking of that. I was thinking of Eunice, and ofthat round, childish scrawl of a diary upstairs in the attic trunk.And I was picturing Eunice, in the years to come, writing _her_ diary;and I thought, what if she should have to--I went upstairs then and read that diary again. And all the while Iwas reading I thought of Eunice. And when it was finished I knew thatI'd never tell Mother, that I'd never write to Jerry--not the letterthat I was going to write. I knew that--       *       *       *       *       *They brought Jerry's letter to me at just that point. What a wonderfulletter that man can write--when he wants to!He says he's lonesome and homesick, and that the house is like a tombwithout Eunice and me, and when _am_ I coming home?       *       *       *       *       *I wrote him to-night that I was going--to-morrow.THE ENDEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Mary Marie, by Eleanor H.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.

Side by side, on a lavishly fringed plush couch, theyconfronted the camera with differing aspects. One sat forward with adecently, even blandly, composed visage, nor had he meddled with hiscurls. His mate sat back, scowling, and fought the camera to the bitterend. His curls, at the last moment, had been mussed by a raging hand.This was in the days of an earlier Newbern, when the twins were four andWinona Penniman began to be their troubled mentor--troubled lest theyshould not grow up to be refined persons; a day when Dave Cowan, thewidely travelled printer, could rightly deride its citizenry assmall-towners; a day when the Whipples were Newbern's sole noblesse andthe Cowan twins not yet torn asunder.The little town lay along a small but potent river that turned a fewfactory wheels with its eager current, and it drew sustenance from thehill farms that encircled it for miles about. You had to take a dingyway train up to the main line if you were going the long day's journeyto New York, so that the Center of the name was often construedfacetiously by outlanders.Now Newbern Center is modern, and grows callous. Only the other day awandering biplane circled the second nine of its new golf course, and ofthe four players on the tenth green but one paid it the tribute of anupward glance. Even this was a glance of resentment, for his partner atthat instant eyed the alignment for a three-foot putt and might bedistracted. The annoyed player flung up a hostile arm at the thing andwaved it from the course. Seemingly abashed, the machine slunk off intoa cloud bank.Old Sharon Whipple, the player who putted, never knew that above him hadgone a thing he had very lately said could never be. Sharon has grownmodern with the town. Not so many years ago he scoffed at rumours of atelephone. He called it a contraption, and said it would be against thelaws of God and common sense. Later he proscribed the horseless carriageas an impracticable toy. Of flying he had affirmed that the fools whotried it would deservedly break their necks, and he had gustily raged atthe waste of a hundred and seventy-five acres of good pasture land whengolf was talked.Yet this very afternoon the inconsequent dotard had employed a telephoneto summon his car to transport him to the links, and had denied even aglance of acknowledgment at the wonder floating above him. Much likethat is growing Newbern. There was gasping aplenty when Winona Pennimanabandoned the higher life and bought a flagrant pair of satin dancingslippers, but now the town lets far more sensational doings go almostunremarked.The place tosses even with the modern fever of unrest. It has itsbourgeoisie, its proletariat, its radicals, but also a city-beautifulassociation and a rather captious sanitary league. Lately a visitingradical, on the occasion of a certain patriotic celebration, expressed aconventional wish to spit upon the abundantly displayed flag. A knowingfriend was quick to dissuade him."Don't do it! Don't try it! Here, now, you got no freedom! Should youspit only on their sidewalk, they fine the heart's blood out of you."       *       *       *       *       *Midway between these periods of very early and very late Newbern therewas once a shining summer morning on which the Cowan twins, being thennine years old, set out from the Penniman home to pick wildblackberries along certain wooded lanes that environed the town. Theywere bare-footed, wearing knee pants buttoned to calico waists, thesebeing patterned with small horseshoes which the twins had been told bytheir father would bring them good luck. They wore cloth caps, andcarried tin pails for their berries. These would be sold to thePennimans at an agreed price of five cents a quart, and it was Winona'shope that the money thus earned on a beautiful Saturday morning would onSunday be given to the visiting missionary lately returned from China.Winona had her doubts, however, chiefly of Wilbur Cowan's keenness forproselyting, on his own income, in foreign lands. Too often with moneyin hand, he had yielded to the grosser tyranny of the senses.The twins ran races in the soft dust of the highway until they reachedthe first outlying berry patch. Here they became absorbed in their work.They were finding well-laden bushes along the fence of what to-day isknown as the old graveyard.Newbern now has a sophisticated new cemetery, with carved marble andtall shafts of polished granite, trimmed shrubs, and garnished mounds,contrasting--as the newer town to the old--with the dingy inclosurewhere had very simply been inhumed the dead of that simpler day. In thenew cemetery blackberry bushes would not be permitted. Along the olderplot they flourished. The place itself is over-grown with rank grasses,with ivy run wild, with untended shrubs, often hiding the memorials,which are mostly of brown sandstone or gray slate. It lies in deepshadow under cypress and willow. It is very still under the gloom of itscareless growths--a place not reassuring to the imaginative.The bottoms of the tin pails had been covered with berries found outsidethe board fence, and now a hunt for other laden bushes led the twins toa trove of ripened fruit partly outside and partly inside that plotwhere those of old Newbern had been chested and laid unto their fathers.There was, of course, no question as to the ownership of that fruit outhere. It was any one's. There followed debate on a possible right tothat which grew abundantly beyond the fence. By some strange but notunprecedented twisting of the mature mind of authority, might it notbelong to those inside, or to those who had put them there? Further,would Mrs. Penniman care to make pies of blackberries--even the largestand ripest yet found--that had grown in a graveyard?"They taste just the same," announced the Wilbur twin, having, after acautious survey, furtively reached through two boards of the fence toretrieve a choice cluster."I guess nobody would want 'em that owns 'em," conceded Wilbur."Well, you climb over first.""We better both go together at the same time.""No, one of us better try it first and see; then, if it's all right,I'll climb over, too.""Aw, I know a better patch up over West Hill in the Whipple woods.""What you afraid of? Nobody would care about a few old blackberries.""I ain't afraid.""You act like it, I must say. If you wasn't afraid you'd climb thatfence pretty quick, wouldn't you? Looky, the big ones!"The Wilbur twin reflected on this. It sounded plausible. If he wasn'tafraid, of course he would climb that fence pretty quick. It stood toreason. It did not occur to him that any one else was afraid. He decidedthat neither was he."Well, I'm afraid of things that ain't true that scare you in the dark,"he admitted, "but I ain't afraid like that now. Not one bit!""Well, I dare you to go.""Well, of course I'll go. I was just resting a minute. I got to rest alittle, haven't I?""Well, I guess you're rested. I guess you can climb a plain and simplefence, can't you? You can rest over there, can't you--just as well aswhat you can rest here?"The resting one looked up and down the lane, then peered forward intothe shadowy tangle of green things with its rows of headstones. Then,inhaling deeply, he clambered to the top of the fence and leaped to theground beyond."Gee, gosh!" he cried, for he had landed on a trailing branch ofblackberry vine.He sat down and extracted a thorn from the leathery sole of his barefoot. The prick of the thorn had cleaned his mind of any merely fancifulfears. A surpassing lot of berries was there for the bold to take. Hisbrother stared not too boldly through the fence at the pioneer."Go on and try picking some," he urged in the subdued tones of extremecaution.The other calmly set to work. The watcher awaited some mysteriouspunishment for this desecration. Presently, nothing having happened, heglowed with a boldness of his own and mounted to the top of the fence,where he again waited. He whistled, affecting to be at ease, but with afoot on the safe side of the fence. The busy worker inside paid him noattention. Presently Merle yawned."Well, I guess I'll come in there myself and pick a few berries," hesaid very loudly.He was giving fair notice to any malign power that might be waiting toblast him. After a fitting interval, he joined his brother and fell towork."Well, I must say!" he chattered. "Who's afraid to come into a graveyardwhen they can get berries like this? We can fill the pails, and that'sthirty cents right here."The fruit fell swiftly. The Wilbur twin worked in silence. But Merleappeared rather to like the sound of a human voice. He was aimlesslyloquacious. His nerves were not entirely tranquil."They're growing right over this old one," announced Wilbur presently.Merle glanced up to see him despoiling a bush that embowered one of thebrown headstones and an all but obliterated mound."You better be careful," he warned."I guess I'm careful enough for this old one," retorted the boldertwin, and swept the trailing bush aside to scan the stone. It wasweather-worn and lichened, but the carving was still legible."It says, 'Here lies Jonas Whipple, aged eighty-seven,' and it says, 'hepassed to his reward April 23, 1828,' and here's his picture."He pointed to the rounded top of the stone where was graven a circleinclosing primitive eyes, a nose, and mouth. From the bottom of thecircle on either side protruded wings.Merle drew near to scan the device. He was able to divine that theintention of the artist had not been one of portraiture."That ain't either his picture," he said, heatedly. "That's a cupid!""Ho, gee, gosh! Ain't cupids got legs? Where's its legs?""Then it's an angel.""Angels are longer. I know now--it's a goop. And here's some morereading."He ran his fingers along the worn lettering, then brought his eyes closeand read--glibly in the beginning:    Behold this place as you pass by.    As you are now, so once was I.    As I am now, so you must be.    Prepare for death, and follow me.The reader's voice lost in fullness and certainty as he neared the endof this strophe."Say, we better get right out of here," said Merle, stepping toward thefence. Even Wilbur was daunted by the blunt warning from beyond."Here's another," called Merle, pausing on his way toward the fence. Inhushed, fearful tones he declaimed:    Dear companion in your bloom,    Behold me moldering in the tomb,                For    Death is a debt to Nature due,    Which I have paid, and so must you."There, now, I must say!" called Merle. "We better hurry out!"But the Wilbur twin lingered. Ripe berries still glistened about thestone of the departed Jonas Whipple."Aw, gee, gosh, they're just old ones!" he declared. "It says this onepassed to his reward in 1828, and we wasn't born then, so he couldn't bemeaning us, could he? We ain't passed to our reward yet, have we? Isimply ain't going to pay the least attention to it."A bit nervously he fell again to picking the berries. The mere feel ofthem emboldened him."Gee, gosh! We ain't followed him yet, have we?""'As I am now, so you must be!'" quoted the other in warning."Well, my sakes, don't everyone in town know that? But it don't meanwe're going to be--be it--right off.""You better come just the samey!"But the worker was stubborn."Ho, I guess I ain't afraid of any old Whipple as old as what this oneis!""Well, anyway," called Merle, still in hushed tones, "I guess I gotenough berries from this place.""Aw, come on!" urged the worker.In a rush of bravado he now extemporized a chant of defiance:    Old Jonas Whipple    Was an old cripple!    Old Jonas Whipple    Was an old cripple!The Merle twin found this beyond endurance. He leaped for the fence andgained its top, looking back with a blanched face to see the offendersmitten. He wanted to go at once, but this might be worth waiting for.Wilbur continued to pick berries. Again he chanted loudly, mocking thesolemnities of eternity:    Old Jonas Whipple    Was an old cripple!    Was an old--The mockery died in his throat, and he froze to a statue of fear. Beyondthe headstone of Jonas Whipple, and toward the centre of the plot, aclump of syringa was plainly observed to sway with the movements of abeing unseen."I told you!" came the hoarse whisper of Merle, but he, too, was chainedby fright to the fence top.They waited, breathless, in the presence of the king of terrors. Againthe bush swayed with a sinister motion. A deeper hush fell about them;the breeze died and song birds stilled their notes. A calamity wasimminent. Neither watcher now doubted that a mocked Jonas Whipple wouldterribly issue from the tangle of shrubbery.The bushes were again agitated; then at the breaking, point of fear forthe Cowan twins the emergent figure proved to be not Jonas but atrifling and immature female descendant of his, who now sped rapidlytoward them across the intervening glade, nor were the low mounds sacredto her in her progress. Her short shirt of a plaid gingham flopped aboveher thin, bony legs as she ran, and she grasped a wide-brimmed straw hatin one hand.       *       *       *       *       *It should be said that this girl appalled the twins hardly less thanwould an avenging apparition of the outraged Jonas Whipple. Beings of abaser extraction, they had looked upon Whipples only from afar and withawe. Upon this particular Whipple they had looked with especial awe.Other known members of the tribe were inhumanly old and gray andwithered, not creatures with whom the most daring fancy could picturethe Cowan twins sustaining any sane human relationship. But this one wasyoung and moderately understandable. Observed from across the room ofthe Methodist Sunday-school, she was undoubtedly human like them; butalways so befurbished with rare and shining garments, with glisteningsilks and costly velvets and laces, with bonnets of pink rosebuds andgloves of kid, that the thought of any secular relationship had beenpreposterous. Yet she was young, an animal of their own age, whose wayscould be comprehended.She halted her mad flight when she discovered them, then turned tosurvey the way she had come. She was panting. The twins regarded herstonily, shaping defenses if she brought up anything regarding any onewho might have mocked Jonas Whipple.When again she could breathe evenly, she said: "It was Cousin Julianadriving by was why I dashed in here. I think I have foiled her."She was not now the creature of troubled elegance that Sabbaths hadrevealed her. The gingham dress was such as a daughter of the peoplemight have worn, and the straw hat, though beribboned, was notimpressive. She was a bony little girl, with quick, greenish eyes and ameagre pigtail of hair of the hue that will often cause a girl to becalled Carrots. Her thin, eager face was lavishly freckled; her nose wastrivial to the last extreme. Besides her hat, she carried and nownonchalantly drew refreshment from a stick of spirally striped candyinserted for half its length through the end of a lemon. The candy wasevidently of a porous texture, so that the juice of the fruit wouldreach the consumer's pursed lips charmingly modified by its passagealong the length of the sweet. One needed but to approximate a vacuum atthe upper end of the candy, and the mighty and mysterious laws ofatmospheric pressure completed the benign process.It should be said for the twins that they were not social climbers. Intheir instant infatuation for this novel device they quite lost thethrill that should have been theirs from the higher aspects of theencounter. They were not impressed at meeting a Whipple on terms ofseeming equality. They had eyes and desire solely for this delectablerefection. Again and again the owner enveloped the top of the candy withprehensile lips; deep cavities appeared in her profusely spangledcheeks. Her eyes would close in an ecstasy of concentration. The twinsstared, and at intervals were constrained to swallow."Gee, gosh!" muttered the Wilbur twin, helpless in the sight of sofierce a joy. His brother descended briskly from the fence."I bet that's good," he said, genially, and taking the half-filled pailfrom his brother's unresisting grasp he approached the newcomer. "Trysome of these nice ripe blackberries," he royally urged."Thanks a lot!" said the girl, and did so. But the hospitality remainedone-sided."I have to keep up my strength," she explained. "I have a long, hardjourney before me. I'm running away."Blackberry juice now stained her chin, enriching a colour scheme alreadymade notable by dye from the candy."Running away!" echoed the twins. This, also, was sane."Where to?" demanded Wilbur."Far, far off to the great city with all its pitfalls.""New York?" demanded Merle. "What's a pitfall?""The way Ben Blunt did when his cruel stepmother beat him because hewouldn't steal and bring it home.""Ben Blunt?" questioned both twins."That's whom I am going to be. That's whom I am now--or just as soon asI change clothes with some unfortunate. It's in a book. 'Ben Blunt, theNewsboy; or, From Rags to Riches.' He run off because his cruelstepmother beat him black and blue, and he become a mere street urchin,though his father, Mr. Blunt, was a gentleman in good circumstances; andwhile he was a mere street urchin he sold papers and blacked boots, andhe was an honest, manly lad and become adopted by a kind, rich oldgentleman named Mr. Pettigrew, that he saved from a gang of rowdies thatboded him no good, and was taken to his palatial mansion and given akind home and a new suit of clothes and a good Christian education, andthat's how he got from rags to riches. And I'm going to be it; I'm goingto be a mere street urchin and do everything he did.""Ho!" The Wilbur twin was brutal. "You're nothing but a girl!"The runaway flashed him a hostile glance."Don't be silly! What difference does it make? Haven't I a cruelstepmother that is constantly making scenes if I do the least littlething, especially since Miss Murtree went home because her mother hastyphoid in Buffalo. You wait till I get the right clothes.""Does she beat you something awful?" demanded the Merle twin unctuously.The victim hesitated."Well, you might call it that.""What kind of right clothes?" asked his brother."Boy's clothes; filthy rags of boy's clothes--like yours," sheconcluded. Her appraising glance rested on the garments of thequestioning twin. Both became conscious of their mean attire, andsquirmed uneasily."These are just everyday clothes," muttered the Wilbur twin."We have fine new Sunday suits at home," boasted Merle. "Too fine towear every day. If you saw those clothes once I guess you'd talkdifferent. Shoes and stockings, too."The girl effaced his grandeur with a shrug."That's nothing--everyone has mere Sunday clothes.""Is Miss Murtree that old lady that brings you to the Sunday-school?"demanded Wilbur."Yes; she's my governess, and had to go to her dying mother, and I hopeshe gets a cruel stepmother that will be harsh to her childish sports,like that Mrs. Blunt was. But she isn't old. It's her beard makes herlook so mature.""Aw!" cried both twins, denoting incredulity."She has, too, a beard! A little moustache and some growing on herchin. When I first got 'Ben Blunt, or from Rags to Riches,' out of theSunday-school library I asked her how she made it grow, because I wantedone to grow on me, but she made a scene and never did tell me. I wish itwould come out on me that way." She ran questing fingers along her briefupper lip and round her pointed chin. "But prob'ly I ain't old enough.""You're only a girl," declared the Wilbur twin, "and you won't ever havea beard, and you couldn't be Ben Blunt.""Only a girl!" she flashed, momentarily stung into a defense of her sex."Huh! I guess I'd rather be a girl than a nasty little boy with hishands simply covered with warts."The shamed hands of Wilbur Cowan sought the depths of his pockets, buthe came up from the blow."Yes, you'd rather be a girl!" he retorted, with ponderous irony. "It'sa good thing you wasn't born in China. Do you know what? If you'd beenborn in China, when they seen what it was they'd simply have chucked youinto the river to drown'd.""The idea! They would not!""Ho! You're so smart! I guess you think you know more than thatmissionary that told us so at the meeting. I guess you think he wastelling lies. They'd have drownded you as soon as they seen it was agirl. But boys they keep.""I don't listen to gossip," said the girl, loftily."And besides," continued the inquisitor, "if you think boys are such badones, what you trying to be one for, and be Ben Blunt and all likethat?""You're too young to understand if I told you," she replied with asnappish dignity.The Merle twin was regretting these asperities. His eyes clungconstantly to the lemon and candy."She can be Ben Blunt if she wants to," he now declared in a voice ofauthority. "I bet she'll have a better moustache than that old MissMurphy's.""Murtree," she corrected him, and spoke her thanks with a brighteningglance. "Here," she added, proffering her treasure, "take a good longsuck if you want to."He did want to. His brother beheld him with anguished eyes. As Merledemonstrated the problem in hydraulics the girl studied him moreattentively, then gleamed with a sudden new radiance."Oh, I'll tell you what let's do!" she exclaimed. "We'll change clotheswith each other, and then I'll be Ben Blunt without waiting till I getto the great city. Cousin Juliana could pass me right by on the streetand never know me." She clapped her small brown hands. "Goody!" shefinished.But the twins stiffened. The problem was not so simple."How do you mean--change clothes?" demanded Merle."Why, just change! I'll put on your clothes and look like a mere streeturchin right away.""But what am I going to--""Put on my clothes, of course. I explained that.""Be dressed like a girl?""Only till you get home; then you can put on your Sunday clothes.""But they wouldn't be Sunday clothes if I had to wear 'em every day, andthen I wouldn't have any Sunday clothes.""Stupid! You can buy new ones, can't you?""Well, I don't know.""I'd give you a lot of money to buy some.""Let's see it."Surprisingly the girl stuck out a foot. Her ankle seemed badly swollen;she seemed even to reveal incipient elephantiasis."Money!" she announced. "Busted my bank and took it all. And I put it inmy stocking the way Miss Murtree did when she went to Buffalo to visither dying mother. But hers was bills, and mine is nickels and dimes andquarters and all like that--thousands of dollars' worth of 'em, andthey're kind of disagreeable. They make me limp--kind of. I'll give youa lot of it to buy some new clothes. Let's change quick." She turnedand backed up to the Merle twin. "Unbutton my waist," she commanded.The Merle twin backed swiftly away. This was too summary a treatment ofa situation that still needed thought."Let's see your money," he demanded."Very well!" She sat on the grassy low mound above her forebear,released the top of the long black stocking from the bite of a hiddengarter and lowered it to the bulky burden. "Give me your cap," she said,and into Merle's cap spurted a torrent of coins. When this had becomereduced to a trickle, and then to odd pieces that had worked down aboutthe heel, the cap held a splendid treasure. Both twins bent excitedlyabove it. Never had either beheld so vast a sum. It was beyondcomprehension. The Wilbur twin plunged a hand thrillingly into the heap."Gee, gosh!" he murmured from the sheer loveliness of it. Shiningsilver--thousands of dollars of it, the owner had declared."Now I guess you'll change," said the girl, observing the sensation shehad made.The twins regarded each other eloquently. It seemed to be acknowledgedbetween them that anything namable would be done to obtain a share ofthis hoard. Still it was a monstrous infamy, this thing she wanted.Merle filtered coins through his fingers for the wondrous feel of them."Well, mebbe we better," he said at last."How much do we get?" demanded Wilbur, exalted but still sane."Oh, a lot!" said the girl, carelessly. Plainly she was not one tohaggle. "Here, I'll give you two double handfuls--see, like that," andshe measured the price into the other cap, not skimping. They weregenerous, heaping handfuls, and they reduced her horde by half. "Now!"she urged. "And hurry! I must be far by nightfall. I'll keep my shoesand stockings and not go barefoot till I reach the great city. But I'lltake your clothes and your cap. Unbutton my waist."Again she backed up to Merle. He turned to Wilbur."I guess we better change with her for all that money. Get your pantsand waist off and I'll help button this thing on you."It was characteristic of their relations that there was no thought ofMerle being the victim of this barter. The Wilbur twin did not suggestit, but he protested miserably."I don't want to wear a girl's clothes.""Silly!" said the girl. "It's for your own good.""You only put it on for a minute, and sneak home quick," reminded hisbrother, "and look at all the money we'll have! Here, show him again allthat money we'll have!"And the girl did even so, holding up to him riches beyond the dreams ofavarice. There was bitterness in the eyes of the Wilbur twin even asthey gloated on the bribe. The ordeal would be fearful. He was to becomea thing--not a girl and still not a boy--a thing somehow shameful. Atlast the alternative came to him."You change with her," he said, brightening. "My pants got a tear hereon the side, and my waist ain't so clean as yours.""Now don't begin that!" said his brother, firmly. "We don't want a lotof silly arguments about it, do we? Look at all the money we'll have!""Your clothes are the best," said the girl. "I must be filthy andragged. Oh, please hurry!" Then to Merle: "Do unbutton my waist. Startit at the top and I can finish."Gingerly he undid the earliest buttons on that narrow back of checkedgingham, and swiftly the girl completed the process to her waist. Thenthe waist was off her meagre shoulders and she stepped from the hatedgarment. The Wilbur twin was aghast at her downright methods. He had afeeling that she should have retired for this change. How was he to knowthat an emergency had lifted her above prejudices sacred to the meanersouled? But now he raised a new objection, for beneath her gown the girlhad been still abundantly and intricately clad, girded, harnessed."I can't ever put on all those other things," he declared, indicatingthe elaborate underdressing."Very well, I'll keep 'em on under the pants and waist till I get to thegreat city," said the girl, obligingly. "But why don't you hurry?"She tossed him the discarded dress. He was seized with fresh panic as hetook the thing."I don't like to," he said, sullenly."Look at all the money we'll have!" urged the brother."Here," said the girl, beguilingly, "when you've done it I'll give youtwo long sucks of my lemon candy."She took the enticing combination from Merle and held it fair before hisyearning eyes; the last rite of a monstrous seduction was achieved. Thevictim wavered and was lost. He took the dress."Whistle if any one comes," he said, and withdrew behind the headstoneof the late Jonas Whipple. He--of the modest sex--would not disrobe inpublic. At least it was part modesty; in part the circumstance that hisvisible garments were precisely all he wore. He would not reveal to thischild of wealth that the Cowans had not the habit of multifariousunderwear. Over the headstone presently came the knee pants, the fadedcalico waist with bone buttons. The avid buyer seized and apparelledherself in them with a deft facility. The Merle twin was amazed that sheshould so soon look so much like a boy. From behind the headstone camethe now ambiguous and epicene figure of the Wilbur twin, contorted tohold together the back of his waist."I can't button it," he said in deepest gloom."Here!" said the girl."Not you!"It seemed to him that this would somehow further degrade him. At leastanother male should fasten this infamous thing about him. When thebuttoning was done he demanded the promised candy and lemon. He gluttedhimself with the stimulant. He had sold his soul and was taking theprice. His wrists projected far from the gingham sleeves, and in truthhe looked little enough like a girl. The girl looked much more like aboy. The further price of his shame was paid in full."I'd better take charge of it," said Merle, and did so with an air oflarge benevolence. "I just don't know what all we'll spend it for," headded.The Wilbur twin's look of anguish deepened."I got a pocket in this dress to hold my money," he suggested."You might lose it," objected Merle. "I better keep it for us."The girl had transferred her remaining money to the pockets which, as aboy, she now possessed. Then she tried on the cap. But it proved to bethe cap of Merle."No; you must take Wilbur's cap," he said, "because you got hisclothes.""And he can wear my hat," said the girl.The Wilbur twin viciously affirmed that he would wear no girl's hat, yetwas presently persuaded that he would, at least when he sneaked home. Itwas agreed by all finally that this would render him fairly a girl inthe eyes of the world. But he would not yet wear it. He was beginning tohate this girl. He shot hostile glances at her as--with his cap on herhead, her hands deep in the money-laden pockets--she swaggered andswanked before them."I'm Ben Blunt--I'm Ben Blunt," she muttered, hoarsely, and swung hershoulders and brandished her thin legs to prove it.He laughed with scorn."Yes, you are!" he gibed. "Look at your hair! I guess Ben Blunt didn'thave long girl's hair, did he--stringy old red hair?"Her hands flew to her pigtail."My hair is not red," she told him. "It's just a decided blonde." Thenshe faltered, knowing full well that Ben Blunt's hair was not worn in abraid. "Of course I'm going to cut it off," she said. "Haven't you boysgot a knife?"They had a knife. It was Wilbur's, but Merle quite naturally took itfrom him and assumed charge of the ensuing operation. Wilbur Cowan hadto stand by with no place to put his hands--a mere onlooker. Yet it washis practical mind that devised the method at last adopted, for theearly efforts of his brother to sever the braid evoked squeals of painfrom the patient. At Wilbur's suggestion she was backed up to the fenceand the braid brought against a board, where it could be severed strandby strand. It was not neatly done, but it seemed to suffice. When thecap was once more adjusted, rather far back on the shorn head, even thecynical Wilbur had to concede that the effect was not bad. The severedbraid, a bow of yellow ribbon at the end, now engaged the notice of itslate owner."The officers of the law might trace me by it," she said, "so we mustfoil them.""Tie a stone to it and sink it in the river," urged Wilbur."Hide it in those bushes," suggested Merle.But the girl was inspired by her surroundings."Bury it!" she ordered.The simple interment was performed. With the knife a shallow grave wasopened close to the stone whereon old Jonas Whipple taunted the livingthat they were but mortal, and in it they laid the pigtail to its lastrest, patting the earth above it and replacing the turf against possibleghouls.Again the girl swaggered broadly before them, swinging her shoulders,flaunting her emancipated legs in a stride she considered masculine.Then she halted, hands in pockets, rocked easily upon heel and toe, andspat expertly between her teeth. For the first time she impressed theWilbur twin, extorting his reluctant admiration. He had never been ableto spit between his teeth. Still, there must be things she couldn't do."You got to smoke and chew and curse," he warned her."I won't, either! It says Ben Blunt was a sturdy lad of good habits.Besides, I could smoke if I wanted to. I already have. I smoked HarveyD.'s pipe.""Who's Harvey D.?""My father. I smoked his pipe repeatedly.""Repeatedly?""Well, I smoked it twice. That's repeatedly, ain't it? I'd have done itmore repeatedly, but Miss Murtree sneaked in and made a scene.""Did you swallow the smoke through your nose?""I--I guess so. It tasted way down on my insides."Plainly there was something to the girl after all. The Wilbur twin hereextracted from the dress pocket, to which he had transferred his fewbelongings, the half of something known to Newbern as a pennygrab. Itwas a slender roll of quite inferior dark tobacco, and the originalpurchaser had probably discarded it gladly. The present owner displayedit to the girl."I'll give you a part of this, and we'll light up.""Well, I don't know. It says Ben Blunt was a sturdy lad of good----""I bet you never did smoke repeatedly!"Her manhood was challenged."I'll show you!" she retorted, grim about the lips.With his knife he cut the evil thing in fair halves. The girl receivedher portion with calmness, if not with gratitude, and lighted it fromthe match he gallantly held for her. And so they smoked. The Merle twinnever smoked for two famous Puritan reasons--it was wrong for boys tosmoke and it made him sick. He eyed the present saturnalia with strongdisapproval. The admiration of the Wilbur twin--now forgetting hisignominy--was frankly worded. Plainly she was no common girl."I bet you'll be all right in the big city," he said."Of course I will," said the girl.She spat between her teeth with a fine artistry. In truth she wasspitting rather often, and had more than once seemed to strangle, butshe held her weed jauntily between the first and second fingers andcontrived an air of relish for it."Anyway," she went on, "it'll be better than here where I suffered soterribly with everybody making the vilest scenes about any little thingthat happened. After they find it's too late they'll begin to wishthey'd acted kinder. But I won't ever come back, not if they beg me towith tears streaming down their faces, after the vile way they acted;saying maybe I could have a baby brother after Harvey D. got thatstepmother, but nothing was ever done about it, and just because I triedto hide Mrs. Wadley's baby that comes to wash, and then because I triedto get that gypsy woman's baby, because everyone knows they're alwaysstealing other people's babies, and she made a vile scene, too, andeveryone tortured me beyond endurance."This was interesting. It left the twins wishing to ask questions."Did that stepmother beat you good?" again demanded Merle."Well, not the way Ben Blunt's stepmother did, but she wanted to knowwhat I meant by it and all like that. Of course she's cruel. Don't youknow that all stepmothers are cruel? Did you ever read a story about onethat wasn't vile and cruel and often tried to leave the helplesschildren in the woods to be devoured by wolves? I should say not!""Where did you hide that Wadley baby?""Up in the storeroom in a nice big trunk, where I fixed a bed andeverything for it, while its mother was working down in the laundry, andI thought they'd look a while and give it up, but this Mrs. Wadley iskind of simple-minded or something. She took on so I had to say maybesomebody had put it in this trunk where it could have a nice time. Andthis stepmother taking on almost as bad.""Did you nearly get a gypsy woman's baby?""Nearly. They're camped in the woods up back of our place, and I wentround to see their wagons, and the man had some fighting roosters thatwould fight anybody else's roosters, and they had horses to race, andthe gypsy woman would tell the future lives of anybody and what wasgoing to happen to them, and so I saw this lovely, lovely baby asleepon a blanket under some bushes, and probably they had stole it from somegood family, so while they was busy I picked it up and run.""Did they chase you?"Wilbur Cowan was by now almost abject in his admiration of this fearlessspirit."Not at first; but when I got up to our fence I heard some of 'emyelling like very fiends, and they came after me through the woods, butI got inside our yard, and the baby woke up and yelled like a veryfiend, and Nathan Marwick came running out of our barn and says: 'Whatin time is all this?' And someone told folks in the house and out comesHarvey D.'s stepmother that he got married to, and Grandpa Gideon andCousin Juliana that happened to be there, and all the gypsies rushed upthe hill and everyone made the vilest scene and I had to give back thislovely baby to the gypsy woman that claimed it. You'd think it was theonly baby in the wide world, the way she made a scene, and not a singleone would listen to reason when I tried to explain. They acted simplycrazy, that's all.""Gee, gosh!" muttered the Wilbur twin. This was indeed a splendid anddesperate character, and he paid her the tribute of honest envy. Hewished he might have a cruel stepmother of his own, and so perhaps beraised to this eminence of infamy. "I bet they did something with you!"he said.The girl waved it aside with a gesture of repugnance, as if some thingswere too loathsome for telling. He perceived that she had, like so manyraconteurs, allowed her cigar to go out."Here's a match," he said, and courteously cupped his hands about itsflame. The pennygrab seemed to have become incombustible, and the matchdied futilely. "That's my last match," he said."Maybe I better keep this till I get to the great city."But he would not have it so."You can light it from mine," and he brought the ends of the two pennygrabs together."First thing you know you'll be dizzy," warned the moralist, Merle."Ho, I will not!"She laughed in scorn, and valiantly puffed on the noisome thing. Thusstood Ben Blunt and the Wilbur twin, their faces together about thisbusiness of lighting up; and thus stood the absorbed Merle, the moralperfectionist, earnestly hoping his words of warning would presentlybecome justified. It did not seem right to him that others should smokewhen it made him sick.At last smoke issued from the contorted face of Ben Blunt, and some ofthis being swallowed, strangulation ensued. When the paroxysm ofcoughing was past the hero revealed running eyes, but the tears were oftriumph, as was the stoic smile that accompanied them.And then, while the reformer Merle awaited the calamity he hadpredicted, while Wilbur surrendered anew to infatuation for thisintrepid soul that would dare any crime, while Ben Blunt rocked onspread feet, the glowing pennygrab cocked at a rakish angle, while, inshort, vice was crowned and virtue abased, there rang upon the still airthe other name of Ben Blunt in cold and fateful emphasis. The groupstiffened with terror. Again the name sounded along those quiet aislesof the happy dead. The voice was one of authority--cool, relentless,awful."Patricia Whipple!" said the voice.The twins knew it for the voice of Miss Juliana Whipple, who hadremotely been a figure of terror to them even when voiceless. Julianawas thirty, tall, straight, with capable shoulders, above which rose hercapable face on a straight neck. She wore a gray skirt and a waist ofwhite, with a severely starched collar about her throat, and a black bowtie. Her straw hat was narrow of brim, banded with a black ribbon. Hersteely eyes flashed from beneath the hat. Once before the twins hadencountered her and her voice, and the results were blasting, thoughthe occasion was happier. Indeed, the intention of Juliana had beenwholly amiable, for it was at the picnic of the Methodist Sunday-school.She came upon the twins in a fair dell, where they watched otherchildren at a game, and she took very civil notice of them, saying, "Howdo you do, young gentlemen?" in deep, thrilling tones, and though theyhad been doing very well until that moment, neither of the twins hadrecovered strength to say so. To them she had been more formidable thana schoolteacher. Their throats had closed upon all utterance. Now as shefaced them, a dozen feet away, even though the words "Patricia Whipple"applied to but one of their number, the twins took the challenge tothemselves and quailed. They knew that deep and terrible voice menacedthemselves as well as the late Ben Blunt--for that mere street urchin,blown upon by the winds of desolation, had shrivelled and passed. In hisplace drooped a girl in absurd boy's clothes, her hair messily cut off,smoking something she plainly did not wish to smoke. The stricken lilyof vice drooped upon its stem.One by one the three heads turned to regard the orator. How had shecontrived that noiseless approach? How had she found them at all in thisseclusion? The heads having turned to regard her, turned back and bowedin stony glares at the rich Whipple-nourished turf. They felt her cometoward them; her shadow from the high sun blended with theirs. And againthe voice, that fearsome organ on which she managed such dread effects:"Patricia Whipple, what does this mean?"She confronted them, a spare, grim figure, tall, authoritative, seemingto be old as Time itself. How were they to know that Juliana was stillyouthful, even attired youthfully, though by no means frivolously, orthat her heart was gentle? She might, indeed, have danced to them asColumbine, and her voice would still have struck them with terror. Shebrought her deepest tones to those simple words, "What does this mean?"All at once it seemed to them that something had been meant, somethingabsurd, monstrous, lawless, deserving a ghastly punishment.The late Ben Blunt squirmed and bored a heel desperately into the turfabove a Whipple whose troubles had ceased in 1828. She made a roughnoise in her throat, but it was not informing. The Wilbur twin,forgetting his own plight, glanced warm encouragement to her."I guess she's got aright to run away," he declared, brazenly.But in this burst of bravado he had taken too little account of hisattire. He recalled it now, for the frosty gray eyes of Juliana ranabout him and came to rest upon his own eyes. For the taut moment thathe braved her glance it unaccountably seemed to him that the forbiddingmouth of the woman twitched nervously into the beginning of a smile. Itwas a fleeting effect, but it did seem as if she had almost laughed,then caught herself. And there was a tremolo defect in the organ tonewith which she now again demanded in blistering politeness, "May I askwhat this means?"The quick-thinking Merle twin had by now devised an exit from anycomplicity in whatever was meant. He saw his way out. He spoke upbrightly and with no shadow of guilt upon his fair young face."I told her it was wrong for the young to smoke; it stunts their growthand leads to evil companions. But she wouldn't listen to me."There was a nice regret in his tone.Miss Juliana ignored him."Patricia!" she said, terribly.But the late Ben Blunt, after the first devastating shock, had beenrecovering vitality for this ordeal."I don't care!" she announced. "I'll run away if I want to!" And again,bitterly, "I don't care!""Run away!"Juliana fairly bayed the words. She made running away seem to besomething nice people never, never did."I don't care!" repeated the fugitive, dully.There was a finality about it that gave Juliana pause. She had expecteda crumpling, but the offender did not crumple. It seemed another tackmust be taken."Indeed?" she inquired, almost cooingly. "And may I ask if this absurdyoung creature was to accompany you on your--your travels?" Sheindicated the gowned Wilbur, who would then have gone joyously to hisreward, even as had Jonas Whipple. His look of dumb suffering would havestayed a judge less conscientious. "I presume this is some young lady ofyour acquaintance--one of your little girl friends," she continued,though it was plain to all that she presumed nothing of the sort."He is not!" The look of dumb suffering had stoutened one heart to newcourage. "He's a very nice little boy, and he gave me these raggedclothes to run away in, and now he'll have to wear his Sunday clothes.And you know he's a boy as well as I do!""She made him take a lot of money for it," broke in the Merle twin. "Iwas afraid she wasn't doing right, but she wouldn't listen to me, so shegave him the money and I took charge of it for him."He beamed virtuously at Miss Juliana, who now rewarded him with ahurried glance of approval. It seemed to Miss Juliana and to him that hehad been on the side of law and order, condemning and seeking todissuade the offenders from their vicious proceedings. He felt that hewas a very good little boy, indeed, and that the tall lady wasunderstanding it. He had been an innocent bystander.Miss Juliana again eyed the skirted Wilbur, and the viewless wind of asmile's beginning blew across the lower half of her accusing face. Thenshe favoured the mere street urchin with a glance of extreme repugnance."I shall have to ask all of you to come with me," she said, terribly."Where to?" demanded the chief culprit."You know well enough."This was all too true."Me?" demanded the upright Merle, as if there must have been somemistake. Surely no right-thinking person could implicate him in thisrowdy affair!"You, if you please," said Miss Juliana, but she smiled beautifully uponhim. He felt himself definitely aligned with the forces of justice. Heall at once wanted to go. He would go as an assistant prosecutingattorney."Not--not me?" stammered the stricken Wilbur."By all means--you!" Miss Juliana sharpened her tone She added,mysteriously: "It would be good without you--good, but not perfect.""Now I guess you'll learn how to behave yourself in future!" admonishedMerle, the preacher, and edged toward Miss Juliana as one withdrawingfrom contamination."Oh, not me!" pleaded the voice of Wilbur."I think you heard me," said Miss Juliana. "Come!"She uttered "come" so that not mountains would have dared stay, muchless a frightened little boy in a girl's dress. In his proper garb therehad been instant and contemptuous flight. But the dress debased all hismanly instincts. He came crawling, as the worm. The recent Ben Bluntpulled a cap over a shorn head and advanced stoically before the group."One moment," said Miss Juliana. "We seem to be forgetting something."She indicated the hat of Patricia Whipple lying on the ground near wheresmouldered the two ends of the abandoned pennygrab. "I think you mightresume this, my dear, and restore the cap to its rightful owner." It wasbut a further play of her debased fancy. The mere street urchin was nowdecked in a girl's hat and a presumable girl wore an incongruous cap. "Iwill ask you two rare specimens to precede me," she said when the changewas made. They preceded her."I don't care!" This was more bravado from the urchin."Well, don't you care!" Juliana said it, soothingly."I will, too, care!" retorted the urchin, betraying her sex."Will she take us to the jail?" whispered the trembling Wilbur."Worse!" said the girl. "She'll take us home!" Side by side theythreaded an aisle between rows of the carefree dead, whom no malignantMiss Juliana could torture. Behind them marched their captor, Merlestepping blithely beside her."It's lovely weather for this time of year," they heard him say.CHAPTER IIThey came all too soon to a gate giving upon the public road and theworld of the living who make remarks about strange sights they witness.Still it was a quiet street, and they were accorded no immediatereception. There stood the pony cart of Miss Juliana, and this, she madeknown, they were to enter. It was a lovely vehicle, drawn by a lovelyfat pony, and the Wilbur twin had often envied those privileged to ridein it. Never had he dreamed so rich a treat could be his. Now it was tobe his, but the thing was no longer a lovely pony cart; it was atumbril--worse than a tumbril, for he was going to a fate worse thandeath.The shameful skirt flopped about his bare legs as he awkwardly clamberedinto the rear seat beside the sex-muddled creature in a boy's suit and agirl's hat. Miss Juliana and the godly Merle in the front seat had verydefinitely drawn aloof from the outcasts. They chatted on matters atlarge in the most polite and social manner. They quite appeared to haveforgotten that their equipage might attract the notice of the vulgar.When from time to time it actually did this the girl held her headbrazenly erect and shot back stare for stare, but the Wilbur twin bowedlow and suffered.Sometimes it would merely be astounded adults who paused to regard them,to point canes or fingers at them. But again it would be the young whohad never been disciplined to restrain their emotions in public. Some ofthese ran for a time beside the cart, with glad cries, their clear,ringing voices raised in comments of a professedly humorous character.Under Juliana's direction the cart did not progress too rapidly. At onecrossing she actually stopped the thing until Ellis Bristow, who wasblind, had with his knowing cane tapped a safe way across the street.The Wilbur twin at this moment frankly rejoiced in the infirmity of poorEllis Bristow. It was sweet relief not to have him stop and stare andpoint. If given the power at this juncture he would have summarilyblinded all the eyes of Newbern Center.Up shaded streets they progressed, leaving a wake of purest joy astern.But at last they began the ascent of West Hill, that led to the WhippleNew Place, leaving behind those streets that came alive at theirapproach. For the remainder of their dread progress they would elicitonly the startled regard of an occasional adult farmer."What'll she do to us?" The Wilbur twin mumbled this under cover ofsprightly talk from the front seat. His brother at the moment wasboasting of his scholastic attainments. He had, it appeared, come onamazingly in long division."She won't do a thing!" replied his companion in shame. "Don't you beafraid!""I am afraid. But I wouldn't be afraid if I had my pants on again,"explained the Wilbur twin, going accurately to the soul of his panic."I'll do it next time," said the girl. "I'll hurry. I won't stop at anyold graveyard.""Graveyard!" uttered the other, feelingly. "I should say not!" Neveragain was he to think of such places with any real pleasure."All she wants," explained the girl--"she wants to talk up in her noselike she was giving a lecture. She loves to. She'll make a vile scene."Now they were through an imposing gate of masonry, and the ponylanguidly drew them along a wide driveway toward the Whipple mansion, anexperience which neither of the twins had ever hoped to brave; but onlyone of them was deriving any pleasure from the social elevation. TheMerle twin looked blandly over the wide expanse of lawn and flower bedsand tenderly nursed shrubs, and then at the pile of red brick with itsmany windows under gay-striped awnings, and its surmounting whitecupola, which he had often admired from afar. He glowed with rectitude.True, he suffered a brother lost to all sense of decent human values,but this could not dim the lustre of his own virtue or his pleasantsuspicion that it was somehow going to be suitably rewarded. Was he notbeing driven by a grand-mannered lady up a beautiful roadway pastmillions of flowers and toward a wonderful house? It paid to be good.The Wilbur twin had ceased to regard his surroundings. He gazed stolidlybefore him, nor made the least note of what his eyes rested upon. He wasthere, helpless. They had him!The cart drew up beside steps leading to a wide porch shaded by astriped awning."Home at last," cooed Miss Juliana with false welcome.A loutish person promptly abandoned a lawn mower in the near distanceand came to stand by the head of the languid pony. He grinned horribly,and winked as the two figures descended from the rear of the cart. For amoment, halting on the first of the steps, the Wilbur twin became awarethat just beyond him, almost to be grasped, was a veritable rainbowcurved above a whirling lawn sprinkler. And he had learned that arainbow is a thing of gracious promise. But probably they have to benatural rainbows; probably you don't get anything out of one you makeyourself. Even as he looked, the shining omen vanished, somewhere shutoff by an unseen power."This way, please," called Miss Juliana, cordially, and he followed herguiltily up the steps to the shaded porch.The girl had preceded her. The Merle twin lingered back of them,shocked, austere, deprecating, and yet somehow bland withal, as if theselittle affairs were not without their compensating features.The bowed Wilbur twin was startled by a gusty torrent of laughter. Withtorturing effort, he raised his eyes to a couple of elderly maleWhipples. One sat erect on a cushioned bench, and one had lain at easein a long, low thing of wicker. It was this one who made the ill-timedand tasteless demonstration that was still continuing. Ultimately thecreature lost all tone from his laughter. It went on, soundless butuncannily poignant. Such was the effect that the Wilbur twin wondered ifhis own ears had been suddenly deafened. This Whipple continued to shakesilently. The other, who had not laughed, whose face seemed ill-modelledfor laughing, nevertheless turned sparkling eyes from under shelvingbrows upon Juliana and said in words stressed with emotion: "My dear,you have brightened my whole day."The first Whipple, now recovered from his unseemly paroxysm, sat erectto study the newcomers in detail. He was a short, round-chested man witha round moon face marked by heavy brows like those of the other. He hadfat wrists and stout, blunt fingers. With a stubby thumb he now pushedup the outer ends of the heavy brows as if to heighten the power of hisvision for this cherished spectacle."I seem to recognize the lad," he murmured as if in privacy to his ownhairy ears. "Surely I've seen the rascal about the place, perhapshelping Nathan at the stable; but that lovely little girl--I've not hadthe pleasure of meeting her before. Come, sissy"--he held outblandishing arms--"come here, Totte, and give the old man a kiss."Could hate destroy, these had been the dying words of Sharon Whipple.But the Wilbur twin could manage only a sidelong glare insufficient toslay. His brother giggled until he saw that he made merry alone."What? Bless my soul, the minx is sulky!" roared the wit.The other Whipple intervened."What was our pride and our joy bent upon this time?" he suavelydemanded. "I take it you've thwarted her in some new plot against thepublic tranquillity.""The young person you indicate," said Juliana, "was about to leave herhome forever--going out to live her own life away from these distastefulsurroundings.""So soon? We should be proud of her! At that tender age, going out tomake a name for herself!""I gather from this very intelligent young gentleman here that she hadmade the name for herself before even starting.""It was Ben Blunt," remarked the young gentleman, helpfully."Hey!" Sharon Whipple affected dismay. "Then what about this young girlat his side? Don't tell me she was luring him from his home here?""It will surprise you to know," said Juliana in her best style, "thatthis young girl before you is not a girl."Both Whipples ably professed amazement."Not a girl?" repeated the suave Whipple incredulously. "You do amazeme, Juliana! Not a girl, with those flower-like features, those starryeyes, that feminine allure? Preposterous! And yet, if he is not a girlhe is, I take it, a boy.""A boy who incited the light of our house to wayward courses by changingclothes with her."The harsher Whipple spoke here in a new tone."Then she browbeat him into it. Scissors and white aprons--yes, I knowher!""He didn't seem browbeaten. They were smoking quite companionably when Ichanced upon them.""Smoking! Our angel child smoking!"This from Sharon Whipple in tones that every child present knew as amere pretense of horror. Juliana shrugged cynically."They always go to the bad after they leave their nice homes," she said."Children should never smoke till they are twenty-one, and then they geta gold watch for it," interjected the orator, Merle. He had felt that hewas not being made enough of. "It's bad for their growing systems," headded."And this?" asked Gideon Whipple, indicating the moralist."The brother of that"--Juliana pointed. "He did his best in the way ofadvice, I gather, but neither of the pair would listen to him. He seemsto be safely conservative, but not to have much influence over hisfellows.""Willing to talk about it, though," said Sharon Whipple, pointedly.The girl now glowered at each of them in turn."I don't care!" she muttered. "I will, too, run away! You see!""It's what they call a fixed idea," explained Juliana. "She doesn't careand she will, too, run away. But where is Mrs. Harvey?""Poor soul!" murmured Sharon. "Think what a lot she's missed already! Docall her, my dear!"Juliana stepped to the doorway and called musically into the dusky hall:"Mrs. Harvey! Mrs. Harvey! Come quickly, please! We have somethinglovely to show you!"The offenders were still to be butchered to make a Whipple holiday."Coming!" called a high voice from far within.The Wilbur twin sickeningly guessed this would be the cruel stepmother.Real cruelty would now begin. Beating, most likely. But when, a momentlater, she stood puzzling in the doorway, he felt an instant relief. Shedid not look cruel. She was not even bearded. She was a plump, meeklyprettyish woman with a quick, flustered manner and a soft voice. Shebrought something the culprits had not found in their other judges."Why, you poor, dear, motherless thing!" she cried when she had assuredherself of the girl's identity, and with this she enfolded her. "I'dlike to know what they've been doing to my pet!" she declared,aggressively."The pet did it all to herself," explained Gideon Whipple."I will, too, run away!" affirmed the girl, though some deeperconviction had faded from the threat."Still talking huge high," said Sharon. "But at your age, my youngfriend, running away is overchancy." Mrs. Harvey Whipple ignored this."Of course you will--run away all you like," she soothed. "It's goodfor people to run away." Then she turned amazingly to the Wilbur twinand spoke him fair as a fellow human. "And who is this dear little boy?I just know he was kind enough to change clothes with you so you couldrun away better! And here you're keeping him in that dress when youought to know it makes him uncomfortable--doesn't it, little boy?"The little boy movingly ogled her with a sidelong glance of gratitudefor what at the moment seemed to be the first kind words he had everheard."You have her give me back my pants!" said he. Then for the first timehe faced his inquisitors eye to eye. "I want my own pants!" he declared,stoutly. Man spoke to man there, and both the male Whipples stirredguiltily; feeling base, perhaps, that mere sex loyalty had not earlierrestrained them."Indeed, you blessed thing, you shall have them this moment!" said thecruel stepmother. "You two march along with me.""And not keep them till Harvey D. comes home?" It was the implacableJuliana."Well"--Mrs. Harvey considered--"I'm sure he would adore to see thelittle imps, but really they can't stand it any longer, can you, dears?It would be bad for their nerves. We'll have to be satisfied withtelling him. Come along quickly!""I will, too, run away!"The girl flung it over her shoulder as she swaggered into the hall. TheWilbur twin trod incessantly on her heels."Wants his pants!" murmured Sharon Whipple. "Prunes and apricots! Wantshis pants!""Mistake ever to part with 'em," observed Gideon. "Of course shebrowbeat him.""My young friend here tells me she bribed him," explained Juliana."She gave him a lot of money and I'm keeping it for him," said herself-possessed young friend, and he indicated bulging pockets."Looted her bank," said Juliana."Forehanded little tike," said Sharon, admiringly. "And smart! She canoutsmart us all any day in the week!"       *       *       *       *       *In a dim upper bedroom in the big house Wilbur Cowan divested himself ofwoman's raiment for probably the last time in his life. He hurried morethan he might have, because the room was full of large, strange,terrifying furniture. It was a place to get out of as soon as he could.Two buttons at the back of the dress he was unable to reach, but thistrifling circumstance did not for more than a scant second delay hisrelease. Then his own clothes were thrust in to him by the stepmother,who embarrassingly lingered to help him button his own waist with thefaded horseshoes to the happily restored pants."There, there!" she soothed when he was again clad as a man child, andamazingly she kissed him.Still tingling from this novel assault, he was led by the woman along adim corridor to a rear stairway. Down this they went, along anothercorridor to a far door. She brought him to rest in a small, meagrelyfurnished but delightfully scented room. It was scented with a generalaroma of cooked food, and there were many shelves behind glass doors onwhich dishes were piled. A drawer was opened, and almost instantly inhis ready hands was the largest segment of yellow cake he had everbeheld. He had not dreamed that pieces of cake for human consumptioncould be cut so large. And it was lavishly gemmed with fat raisins. Heheld it doubtfully."Let's look again," said the preposterous woman. She looked again,pushing by a loose-swinging door to do it, and returned with a vast areaof apple pie, its outer curve a full ninety degrees of the circle. "Noweat!" said the woman.She was, indeed, a remarkable woman. She had not first asked him if hewere hungry."I'm much obliged for my pants and this cake and pie," said the boy, sothe woman said, "Yes, yes," and hugged him briefly as he ate.Not until he had consumed the last morsel of these provisions and eke abumper of milk did the woman lead him back to that shaded porch where hehad lately been put to the torture. But now he was another being, cladnot only as became a man among men but inwardly fortified by food. Ifstepmothers were like this he wished his own father would find one. Thegirl with her talk about cruelty--he still admired her, but she must bean awful liar. He faced the tormenting group on the porch with almostfaultless self-possession. He knew they could not hurt him."Well, well, well!" roared Sharon Whipple, meaning again to be humorous.But the restored Wilbur eyed him coldly, with just a faint curiositythat withered the humorist in him. "Well, well!" he repeated, but indry, businesslike tones, as if he had not meant to be funny in the firstplace."I guess we'll have to be going now," said the Wilbur twin. "And we mustleave all that money. It wouldn't be honest to take it now."The Merle twin at this looked across at him with marked disfavour."Nonsense!" said Miss Juliana."Nonsense!" said Sharon Whipple."Take it, of course!" said Gideon Whipple."He's earned it fairly," said Juliana. She turned to Merle. "Give it tohim," she directed.This was not as Merle would have wished. If the money had been earned hewas still willing to take care of it, wasn't he?"A beggarly pittance for what he did," said Gideon Whipple, warmly."Wouldn't do it myself for twice the amount, whatever it is," saidSharon.Very slowly, under the Whipple regard, the Merle twin poured the priceof his brother's shame into his brother's cupped hands. The brother feltreligious at this moment. He remembered seriously those things theytold you in Sunday-school--about a power above that watches over us andmakes all come right. There must be something in that talk.The fiscal transaction was completed. The twins looked up to becomeaware that their late confederate surveyed them from the doorway. Hereyes hinted of a recent stormy past, but once more she was decorouslyapparelled."Your little guests are leaving," said the stepmother. "You must bidthem good-bye."Her little guests became statues as the girl approached them."So glad you could come," she said, and ceremoniously shook the hand ofeach. The twins wielded arms rigid from the shoulder, shaking twice downand twice up. "It has been so pleasant to have you," said the girl."We've had a delightful time," said the Merle twin.The other tried to echo this, but again his teeth were tightly locked,and he made but a meaningless squeak far back in his throat. He usedthis for the beginning of a cough, which he finished with a decentaplomb."You must come again," said the girl, mechanically."We shall be so glad to," replied the Merle twin, glancing a brightfarewell to the group.The other twin was unable to glance intelligently at any one. His eyeswere now glazed. He stumbled against his well-mannered brother andheavily descended the steps."You earned your money!" called Sharon Whipple.The Wilbur twin was in advance, and stayed so as they trudged down theroadway to the big gate. With his first free breath he had felt hisimportance as the lawful possessor of limitless wealth."Bright little skeesicks," said Sharon Whipple."But the brother is really remarkable," said Gideon--"so well-mannered,so sure of himself. He has quite a personality.""Other has the gumption," declared Sharon."I've decided to have one of them for my brother," announced the girl."Indeed?" said Gideon."Well, everybody said I might have a brother, but nobody does anythingabout it. I will have one of those. I think the nice one that doesn'tsmoke.""Poor motherless pet!" murmured the stepmother, helplessly."A brother is not what you need most at this time," broke in Juliana."It's a barber."       *       *       *       *       *Down the dusty road over West Hill went the twins, Wilbur stillforcefully leading. His brother was becoming uneasy. There was a strangelight in the other's eyes, an unwonted look of power. When they were offthe hill and come to the upper end of shaded Fair Street, Merle advancedto keep pace beside his brother. The latter's rate of speed hadincreased as they neared the town."Hadn't I better take care of our money for us?" he at last asked in avoice oily with solicitude."No, sir!"The "sir" was weighted with so heavy an emphasis that the tactful Merlemerely said "Oh!" in a hurt tone."I can take care of my own money for me," added the speeding capitalist,seeming to wish that any possible misconception as to the ownership ofthe hoard might be definitely removed."Oh," said Merle again, this being all that with any dignity he couldthink of to say. They were now passing the quiet acre that had been thescene of the morning's unpleasantness. Their pails, half filled withberries, were still there, but the strangely behaving Wilbur refused togo for them. He eyed the place with disrelish. He would not againwillingly approach that spot where he had gone down into the valley ofshame. Reminded that the pails were not theirs, he brutally asked whatdid he care, adding that he could buy a million pails if he took anotion to. But presently he listened to reason, and made reasonableproposals. The Merle twin was to go back to the evil place, salvage thepails, leave them at the Penniman house, and hasten to a certainconfectioner's at the heart of the town, where a lavish reward would beat once his. After troubled reflection he consented, and they went theirways. The Merle twin sped to the quiet nook where Jonas Whipple had beenput away in 1828, and sped away from there as soon as he had the pails.Not even did he bend a moment above the little new-made grave where laya part of all that was mortal of Patricia Whipple. He dislikedgraveyards on principle, and he wished his reward.Wilbur Cowan kept his quick way down Fair Street. He had been lifted topecuniary eminence, and incessantly the new wealth pressed upon hisconsciousness. The markets of the world were at his mercy. There wereshop windows outside which he had long been compelled to linger insterile choosing. Now he could enter and buy, and he was in a hurry tobe at it. Something warned him to seize his golden moment on the wing.The day was Saturday, and he was pleasantly thrilled by the unwontedcrowds on River Street, which he now entered. Farm horses were tetheredthickly along hitching racks and shoppers thronged the marts of trade.He threaded a way among them till he stood before the establishment ofSolly Gumble, confectioner. It brought him another thrill that thepeople all about should be unaware of his wealth--he, laden withunsuspected treasure that sagged cool and heavy on either thigh, whilethey could but suppose him to be a conventionally impoverished smallboy.He tried to be cool--to calculate sanely his first expenditure. But hecontrived an air of careless indecision as he sauntered through theportals of the Gumble place and lingered before the counter of choicestsweets, those so desirable that they must be guarded under glass from aloftily sampling public."Two of those and two of those and one of them!"It was his first order, and brought him, for five cents, two cocoanutcreams, two candied plums, and a chocolate mouse. He stood eating thesewhile he leisurely surveyed the neighbouring delicacies. Vaguely in hismind was the thought that he might buy the place and thereafter keepstore. His cheeks distended by the chocolate mouse and the last of thecocoanut creams, he now bartered for a candy cigar. It was of brownmaterial, at the blunt end a circle of white for the ash and at itscentre a brilliant square of scarlet paper for the glow, altogether acharming feat of simulation, perhaps the most delightful humoresque inall confectionery. It was priced at two cents, but what was money now?Then, his eye roving to the loftier shelves, he spied remotely above hima stuffed blue jay mounted on a varnished branch of oak. This was notproperly a part of the Gumble stock; it was a fixture, technically,giving an air to the place from its niche between two mounting rows ofladen shelves."How much for that beautiful bird for my father?" demanded the nouveauriche.His words were blurred by the still-resistant chocolate mouse, and hewas compelled to point before Solly Gumble divined his wish. Themerchant debated, removing his skullcap, smoothing his grizzled fringeof curls, fitting the cap on again deliberately. Then he turned tosurvey the bird, seemingly with an interest newly wakened. It was indeeda beautiful bird, brilliantly blue, with sparkling eyes; a bit dusty,but rarely desirable. The owner had not meant to part with it; still,trade was trade. He meditated, tapping his cheek with a pencil."How much for that beautiful bird for my father?"He had swallowed strenuously and this time got out the words cleanly."Well, now, I don't hardly know. My Bertha had her cousin give her thatbird. It's a costly bird. I guess you couldn't pay such a price. I guessit would cost a full half dollar, mebbe."He had meant the price to be prohibitive, and it did shock thequestioner, opulent though he was."Well, mebbe I will and mebbe I won't," he said, importantly. "Say, youkeep him for me till I make my mind up. If anybody else comes along,don't you sell him to anybody else till I tell you, because prob'ly I'llsimply buy him. My father, he loves animals."Solly Gumble was impressed."Well, he's a first-class animal. He's been in that one place goin' onfive years now.""Give me two of those and two of those and one of them," said the Wilburtwin, pointing to new heart's desires."Say, now, you got a lot of money for a little boy," said Solly Gumble,not altogether at ease. This might be a case of embezzlement such as hehad before known among his younger patrons. "You sure it's yours--yes?""Ho!" The Wilbur twin scorned the imputation. He was not going to tellhow he had earned this wealth, but the ease of his simple retort wasenough for the practical psychologist before him. "I could buy all thethings in this store if I wanted to," he continued, and waved apatronizing hand to the shelves. "Give me two of those and two of thoseand one of them."Solly Gumble put the latest purchase in a paper bag. Here was a patronworth conciliating. The patron sauntered to the open door to eat of hisprovender with lordly ease in the sight of an envious world. Calmlyelate, on the cushion of advantage, he scanned the going and coming oflesser folk who could not buy at will of Solly Gumble. His fortune hadgone to his head, as often it has overthrown the reason of the moremature indigent. It was thus his brother found him, and became instantlytroubled at what seemed to be the insane glitter of his eyes.He engulfed an entire chocolate mouse from his sticky left hand and withhis right proffered the bag containing two of those and two of those andone of them. Merle accepted the boon silently. He was thrilled, yetdistrustful. Until now his had been the leading mind, but his power wasgone. He resented this, yet was sensible that no resentment must beshown. His talent as a tactician was to be sorely tested. He gentlytried out this talent."Winona says you ought to come home to dinner."The magnate replied as from another world."I couldn't eat a mouthful," he said, and crowded a cocoanut cream intoan oral cavity already distended by a chocolate mouse."She says, now, you should save your money and buy some useful thingwith it," again ventured the parasite. It was the sign of a nicelysensed acumen that he no longer called it "our" money."Ho! Gee, gosh!" spluttered the rich one, and that was all."What we going to have next?" demanded the wise one."I'll have to think up something." He did not invite suggestions andnone were offered. Merle nicely sensed the arrogance of the newly rich."I know," said the capitalist at length--"candy in a lemon.""One for each?""Of course!" It was no time for petty economies.Solly Gumble parted with two lemons and two sticks of spirally stripedcandy of porous fabric. Then the moneyed gourmet dared a new flight."Two more sticks," he commanded. "You suck one stick down, then you putanother in the same old lemon," he explained."I must say!" exclaimed Merle. It was a high moment, but he never usedstrong language.When the candy had been imbedded in the lemons they sauntered out to thestreet, Merle meekly in the rear, the master mind still coerced by brutewealth. They paused before other shop windows, cheeks hollowed above thesavory mechanism invented by Patricia Whipple. Down one side of RiverStreet to its last shop, and up the other, they progressed haltingly. Atmany of the windows the capitalist displayed interest only of the mostacademic character. At others he made sportive threats. Thus before thejewellery shop of Rapp Brothers he quite unnerved Merle by announcingthat he could buy everything in that window if he wanted to--necklacesand rings and pins and gold watches--and he might do this. If, say, hedid buy that black marble clock with the prancing gold horse on it,would Merle take it home for him? He had no intention of buying thisobject--he had never found clocks anything but a source ofannoyance--but he toyed with the suggestion when he saw that it agitatedhis brother. Thereafter at other windows he wilfully dismayed hisbrother by pretending to consider the purchase of objects in no sensedesirable to any one, such as boots, parasols, manicure sets, groceries,hardware. He played with the feel of his wealth, relishing the power itgave him over the moneyless.And then purely to intensify this thrill of power he actually purchasedat the hardware shop and carelessly bestowed upon the mendicant brotheran elaborate knife with five blades and a thing which the vender saidwas to use in digging stones out of horses' feet. Merle was quiteovercome by this gift, and neither of them suspected it to be the firststep in the downfall of the capitalist. The latter, be it remembered,had bought and bestowed the knife that he might feel more acutely hispower over this penniless brother, and this mean reward was abundantlyhis. Never before had he felt superior to the Merle twin.But the penalties of giving are manifold, and he now felt a novel glowof sheer beneficence. He was a victim to the craze for philanthropy. Tooyoung to realize its insidious character, he was to embark upon aruinous career. Ever it is the first step that costs. That carelesslygiven knife--with something to dig stones out of a horse's foot--was towipe out, ere night again shrouded Newbern Center, a fortune supposed tobe as lasting as the eternal hills that encircled it.They again crossed River Street, and stopped in front of the Cut-RatePharmacy. The windows of this establishment offered little to enticesave the two mammoth chalices of green and crimson liquor. But thesewere believed to be of fabulous value. Even the Cut-Rate Pharmacy itselfcould afford but one of each. Inside the door a soda fountain hissedprovocatively. They took lemon and vanilla respectively, and the lordlypurchaser did not take up his change from the wet marble until he haddrained his glass. He had become preoccupied. He was mapping out acareer of benevolence, splendid, glittering, ostentatious--ruinous.In a show case near the soda fountain his eye rested upon an object ofstriking beauty, a photograph album of scarlet plush with a silverclasp, and lest its purpose be misconstrued the word "Album" writ inpurest silver across its front. Negotiations resulting in its sale werebrief. The Merle twin was aghast, for the cost of this thing was adollar and forty-nine cents. Even the buyer trembled when he counted outthe price in small silver and coppers. But the result was a furtheruplift raising him beyond the loudest call of caution. The album wasplaced in the ornate box--itself no mean bibelot--and wrapped in paper."It's for Winona," the purchaser loftily explained to his white-facedbrother."I must say!" exclaimed the latter, strongly moved."I'm going to buy a beautiful present for every one," added the nowfatuous giver."Every one!" It was all Merle could manage, and even it caused him togulp."Every one," repeated the hopeless addict.And even as he said it he was snared again, this time by an immenseadvertising placard propped on the counter. It hymned the virtues of theAjax Invigorator. To the left sagged a tormented male victim of manyailments meticulously catalogued below, but in too fine print foroffhand reading by one in a hurry. The frame of the sufferer was bent,upheld by a cane, one hand poignantly resting on his back. The face wasdrawn with pain and despair. "For twenty years I suffered untoldagonies," this person was made to confess in large print. It washeartrending. But opposite the moribund wretch was a figure of richhealth, erect, smartly dressed, with a full, smiling face and happyeyes. Surprisingly this was none other than the sufferer. One couldhardly have believed them the same, but so it was. "The Ajax Invigoratormade a new man of me," continued the legend. There were further detailswhich seemed negligible to the philanthropist, because the pictured heroof the invigorator already suggested Judge Penniman, the ever-ailingfather of Winona. The likeness was not wholly fanciful. True, the judgewas not so abject as the first figure, but then he was not soobtrusively vigorous as the second."A bottle of that," said Wilbur, and pointed to the card.The druggist thrust out a bottle already wrapped in a printed cover, andthe price, as became a cut-rate pharmacy, proved to be ninety-eightcents.A wish was now expressed that the advertising placard might also betaken in order that Judge Penniman might see just what sort of new manthe invigorator would make of him. But this proved impracticable; theplacard must remain where it stood for the behoof of other invalids. Butthere were smaller portraits of the same sufferer, it seemed, in theliterature inclosing the bottle. It was the Merle twin who carried thepurchases as they issued from the pharmacy. This was fitting,inevitable. The sodden philanthropist must have his hands free to spendmore money.They rested again at the Gumble counter--and now they were not alone.The acoustics of the small town are faultless, and the activities ofthis spendthrift had been noised abroad. To the twins, as two of thoseand two of those and one of them were being ordered, came four otherboys to linger cordially by and assist in the selections. Hospitalitywas not gracefully avoidable. The four received candy cigars and becamemere hangers-on of the rich, lost to all self-respect, fawning, falselysolicitous, brightly expectant. Chocolate mice were next distributed.The four guests were now so much of the party as to manifest quickhostility to a fifth boy who had beamingly essayed to be numbered amongthem. They officiously snubbed and even covertly threatened this fifthboy, who none the less lingered very determinedly by the host, and waspresently rewarded with sticky largesse; whereupon he was accepted bythe four, and himself became hostile to another aspirant.But mere candy began to cloy--Solly Gumble had opened the second box ofchocolate mice--and the host even abandoned his reenforced lemon, whichwas promptly communized by the group. He tried to think of something toeat that wouldn't be candy, whereupon mounted in his mind the pyramid ofwatermelons a block down the street before the Bon Ton Grocery."We'll have a watermelon," he announced in tones of quiet authority, andhis cohorts gurgled applause.They pressed noisily about him as he went to the Bon Ton. Theyremembered a whale of a melon they had seen there, and said they wouldbet he never had enough money to buy that one. Maybe he could buy amedium-sized one, but not that. All of them kept a repellent manner forany passing boy who might be selfishly moved to join them. Thespendthrift let them babble, preserving a rather grim silence. The whaleof a melon was indeed a noble growth, and its price was thirty-fivecents. The announcement of this caused a solemn hush to fall upon thesycophants; a hush broken by the cool, masterful tones of their host."I'll take her," he said, and paid the fearful price from a stillweighty pocket. To the stoutest of the group went the honour of bearingoff the lordly burden. They turned into a cool alley that led to therear of the shops. Here in comparative solitude the whale of a meloncould be consumed and the function be unmarred by the presence ofvolunteer guests."Open her," ordered the host, and the new knife was used to open her.She proved to be but half ripe, but her size was held to atone for thisdefect. A small, unripe melon would have been returned to the dealerwith loud complaining, but it seemed to be held that you couldn't expecteverything from one of this magnitude. It was devoured to the rind,after which the convives reclined luxuriously upon a mound of excelsiorbeside an empty crate."Penny grabs!" cried the host with a fresh inspiration, and they cheeredhim.One of the five volunteered to go for them and the money-drunken hostconfided the price of three of them to him. The messenger honorablyreturned, the pennygrabs were bisected with the new knife, and all ofthem but Merle smoked enjoyably. He, going back to his candy and lemon,admonished each and all that smoking would stunt their growth. It seemednot greatly to concern any of them. They believed Merle implicitly, butwhat cared they?Now the messenger in buying the pennygrabs had gabbled wildly to anotherboy of the sensational expenditures under way, and this boy, thoughincredulous, now came to a point in the alley from which he could surveythe fed group. The remains of the whale of a melon were there toconvince him. They were trifling remains, but they sufficed, and the sixfuming halves of pennygrabs were confirmatory. The scout departedrapidly, to return a moment later with two other boys. One of the latterled a dog.The three newcomers, with a nice observance of etiquette, surveyed therevellers from a distance. Lacking decent provocation, they might notapproach a group so plainly engaged upon affairs of its own--unless theywent aggressively, and this it did not yet seem wise to do. Therevellers became self-conscious under this scrutiny. They were moved tonew displays of wealth."I smelled 'em cookin' bologna in the back room of Hire's butcher shop,"remarked the bringer of the pennygrabs. "It smelt grand."The pliant host needed no more. He was tinder to such a spark."Get a quarter's worth, Howard," and the slave bounded off, to returnwith a splendid rosy garland of the stuff, still warm and odorous.Again the new knife of Merle was used. The now widely diffused scent ofbologna reached the three watchers, and appeared to madden one of thembeyond any restraint of good manners. He sauntered toward them,pretending not to notice the banquet until he was upon it. He was adesperate-appearing fellow--dark, saturnine, with a face of sullenmenace."Give us a hunk," he demanded.He should have put it more gently. He should have condescended a littleto the amenities, for his imperious tone at once dried a generous springof philanthropy. He was to regret this lack of a mere superficial polishthat would have cost him nothing."Ho! Go buy it like we did!" retorted the host, crisply."Is that so?" queried the newcomer with rising warmth."Yes, sat's so!""Who says it's so?""I say it's so!"This was seemingly futile; seemingly it got them nowhere, for thenewcomer again demanded: "Is that so?"They seemed to have followed a vicious circle. But in reality they weremuch farther along, for the mendicant had carelessly worked himself to apoint where he could reach for the half circle of bologna stillundivided, and the treasure was now snatched from this fate by thewatchful legal owner."Hold that!" he commanded one of his creatures, and rose quickly to hisfeet."Is that so?" repeated the unimaginative newcomer."Yes, that's so!" affirmed the Wilbur twin once again."I guess I got as much right here as you got!"This was a shifty attempt to cloud the issue. No one had faintlyquestioned his right to be there."Ho! Gee, gosh!" snapped the Wilbur twin, feeling vaguely that this wasirrelevant talk."Think you own this whole town, don't you?" demanded the aggressor."Ho! I guess I own it as much as what you do!"The Wilbur twin knew perfectly that this was not the true issue, yet hefelt compelled to accept it."For two beans I'd punch you in the eye.""Oh, you would, would you?" Each of the disputants here took a stepbackward."Yes, I would, would you!" This was a try at mockery."Yes, you would not!""Yes, I would!""You're a big liar!"The newcomer at this betrayed excessive rage."What's that? You just say that again!" He seemed unable to believe hisshocked ears."You heard what I said--you big liar, liar, liar!""You take that back!"Here the newcomer flourished clinched fists and began to prance. TheWilbur twin crouched, but was otherwise motionless. The newcomercontinued to prance alarmingly and to wield his arms as if against aninvisible opponent. Secretly he had no mind to combat. His real purposebecame presently clear. It was to intimidate and confuse until he shouldbe near enough the desired delicacy to snatch it and run. He was anexcellent runner. His opponent perceived this--the evil glance of desireand intention under all the flourish of arms. Something had to be done.Without warning he leaped upon the invader and bore him to earth. Therehe punched, jabbed, gouged, and scratched as they writhed together. Amoment of this and the prostrate foe was heard to scream with the utmostsincerity. The Wilbur twin was startled, but did not relax his hold."You let me up from here!" the foe was then heard to cry.The Wilbur twin watchfully rose from his mount, breathing heavily. Heseized his cap and drew it tightly over dishevelled locks."I guess that'll teach you a good lesson!" he warned when he had breathfor it.The vanquished Hun got to his feet, one hand over an eye. He wasabundantly blemished and his nose bled. His sense of dignity had beenoutraged and his head hurt."You get the hell and gone out of here!" shouted the Wilbur twin, quiteas if he did own the town."I must say! Cursing and swearing!" shrilled the Merle twin, but noneheeded him.The repulsed enemy went slowly to the corner of the alley. Here heturned to recover a moment of dignity."You just wait till I catch you out some day!" he roared back withgestures meant to terrify. But this was his last flash. He went on hisway, one hand still to the blighted eye.Now it developed that the two boys who had waited the Hun had profitedcunningly by the brawl. They had approached at its beginning--a fightwas anybody's to watch--they had applauded its denouement with shrilland hearty cries, and they now felicitated the victor."Aw, that old Tod McNeil thinks he can fight!" said one, and laughed inharsh derision."I bet this kid could lick him any day in the week!" observed hiscompanion.This boy, it was now seen, led a dog on a rope, a half-grown dog thatwould one day be large. He was now heavily clad in silken wool of richlymixed colours--brown, yellow, and bluish gray--and his eyes were stillthe pale blue of puppyhood.Both newcomers had learned the unwisdom of abrupt methods of approachingthis wealthy group. They conducted themselves with modesty; they werepolite, even servile, saying much in praise of the warrior twin. The onewith the dog revealed genius for this sort of thing, and insisted onfeeling the warrior's muscle. The flexed bicep appeared to leave himaghast at its hardness and immensity. He insisted that his companionshould feel it, too."Have some bologna?" asked the warrior. He would doubtless have pressedbologna now on Tod McNeil had that social cull stayed by."Oh!" said the belated guests, surprised at the presence of bolognathereabouts.They uttered profuse thanks for sizable segments of the now diminishedcircle. It was then that the Wilbur twin took pleased notice of the dog.He was a responsive animal, grateful for notice from any one. Receivinga morsel of the bologna he instantly engulfed it and overwhelmed thegiver with rough but hearty attentions."Knows me already," said the now infatuated Wilbur."Sure he does!" agreed the calculating owner. "He's a smart dog. He'sthe smartest dog ever I see, and I seen a good many dogs round thistown.""Have some more bologna," said Wilbur."Thanks," said the dog owner, "just a mite."The dog, receiving another bit, gave further signs of knowing the donor.No cynic was present to intimate that the animal would instantly knowany giver of bologna."What's his name?" demanded Wilbur.The owner hesitated. He had very casually acquired the animal but a fewhours before; he now attached no value to him, and was minded to be ridof him, nor had the dog to his knowledge any name whatever."His name is Frank," he said, his imagination being slow to start."Here, Frank! Here, Frank!" called Wilbur, and the dog leaped for morebologna."See, he knows his name all right," observed the owner, pridefully."I bet you wouldn't sell him for anything," suggested Wilbur."Sell good old Frank?" The owner was painfully shocked. "No, I couldn'thardly do that," he said more gently. "He's too valuable. My littlesister just worships him."The other guests were bored at this hint of commerce. They had no wishto see good money spent for a dog that no one could eat."He don't look to me like so much of a dog," remarked one of these. "Helooks silly to me."The owner stared at the speaker unpleasantly."Oh, he does, does he? I guess that shows what you know about dogs. Ifyou knew so much about 'em like you say I guess you'd know this kindalways does look that way. It's--it's the way they look," he floundered,briefly, but recovered. "That's how you can tell 'em," he concluded.The Wilbur twin was further impressed, though he had not thought the doglooked silly at all."I'll give you a quarter for him," he declared bluntly.There was a sensation among the guests. Some of them made noises to showthat they would regard this as a waste of money. But the owner was firm."Huh! I bet they ain't money enough in this whole crowd to buy that dog,even if I was goin' to sell him!"The wishful Wilbur jingled coins in both pockets."I guess he wouldn't be much of a fighting dog," he said."Fight!" exploded the owner. "You talk about fight! Say, that's all heis--just a fighter! He eats 'em alive, that's all he does--eats 'em!"This was for some of them not easy at once to believe, for the dog'sexpression was one of simpering amiability. The owner seemed to perceivethis discrepancy. "He looks peaceful, but you git him mad once, that'sall! He's that kind--you got to git him mad first." This soundedreasonable, at least to the dog's warmest admirer."Yes, sir," continued the owner, "you'll be goin' along the street withGeorge here--""George who?" demanded a skeptical guest.For a moment the owner was disconcerted."Well, Frank is his right name, only my little sister calls him Georgesometimes, and I get mixed. Anyway, you'll be goin' along the streetwith Frank and another dog'll come up and he's afraid of Frank and mebbehe'll just kind of clear his throat or something on account of feelingnervous and not meaning anything, but Frank'll think he's growling, andthat settles it. Eats 'em alive! I seen some horrible sights, I want totell you!""Give you thirty-five cents for him," said the impressed Wilbur."For that there dog?" exploded the owner--"thirty-five cents?" He let itbe seen that this jesting was in poor taste."I guess he wouldn't be much of a watchdog.""Watchdog! Say, that mutt watches all the time, day and night! You let aburglar come sneaking in, or a tramp or someone--wow! Grabs 'em by thethroat, that's all!""Fifty cents!" cried the snared Cowan twin. Something told the ownerthis would be the last raise."Let's see the money!"He saw it, and the prodigy, Frank, sometimes called George by theowner's little sister, had a new master. The Wilbur twin tingled throughall his being when the end of the rope leash was placed in his hand.A tradesman now descried them from the rear door of his shop. He sawsmoke from the relighted pennygrabs and noted the mound of excelsior."Hi, there!" he called, harshly. "Beat it outa there! What you want todo--set the whole town afire?"Of course nothing of this sort had occurred to them, but only Merleanswered very politely, "No, sir!" The others merely moved off, holdingthe question silly. Wilbur Cowan stalked ahead with his purchase."I hate just terrible to part with him," said the dog's late owner."Come on to Solly Gumble's," said Wilbur, significantly. He must dosomething to heal this hurt.The mob followed gleefully. The Wilbur twin was hoping they would meetno other dog. He didn't want good old Frank to eat another dog right onthe street.Back in Solly Gumble's he bought lavishly for his eight guests. Theguests were ideal; none of them spoke of having to leave early, thoughthe day was drawing in. And none of the guests noted that the almostcontinuous stream of small coin flowing to the Gumble till came now butfrom one pocket of the host. Yet hardly a guest but could eat fromeither hand as he chose. It was a scene of Babylonian profligacy--eventhe late owner of Frank joined in the revel full-spiritedly, and itendured to a certain moment of icy realization, suffered by the host. Itcame when Solly Gumble, in the midst of much serving, bethought him ofthe blue jay."I managed to save him for you," he told the Wilbur twin, and reacheddown the treasure. With a cloth he dusted the feathers and tenderlywiped the eyes. "A first-class animal for fifty cents," he said--"anddurable. He'll last a lifetime if you be careful of him--keep him in theparlour just to be pretty."The munching revellers gathered about with interest. There seemed nolimit to the daring of this prodigal. Then there came upon the Wilburtwin a moment of sinister calculation. A hand sank swiftly into a pocketand brought up a scant few nickels and pennies. Amid a thickeningsilence he counted these remaining coins.Then in deadly tones he declared to Solly Gumble, "I only gotforty-eight cents left!""Oh, my! I must say! Spent all his money!" shrilled the Merle twin on anote of triumph that was yet bitter."Spent all his money!" echoed the shocked courtiers, and looked upon himcoldly. Some of them withdrew across the store and in low tonespretended to discuss the merits of articles in another show case."I guess you couldn't let me have him for forty-eight cents," said theWilbur twin hopelessly.Solly Gumble removed his skullcap, fluffed his scanty ring of curls, anddrew on the cap again. His manner was judicial but not repellent."Mebbe I could--mebbe I couldn't," he said. "You sure you ain't got twocents more in that other pocket, hey?"The Wilbur twin searched, but it was the most arid of formalities."No, sir; I spent it all.""Spent all his money!" remarked the dog seller with a kind of pityingcontempt, and drew off toward the door. Two more of the courtiersfollowed as unerringly as if trained in palaces. Solly Gumble bent abovethe counter."Well, now, you young man, you listen to me. You been a right goodcustomer, treating all your little friends so grand, so I tell youstraight--you take that fine bird for forty-eight cents. Not to manywould I come down, but to you--yes."Wilbur Cowan, overcome, mumbled his thanks. He was alone at the counternow, Merle having joined the withdrawn courtiers."I'm a fair trader," said Solly Gumble. "I can take--I give. Here now!"And amazingly he extended to the penniless wreck a large and goldenorange, perhaps one of the largest oranges ever grown.The recipient was again overcome. He blushed as he thanked thisopen-handed tradesman. Then with his blue jay, his orange, his dog, heturned away. Now he first became aware of the changed attitude of hislate dependents. It did not distress him. It seemed wholly natural, thisicy withdrawal of their fellowship. Why should they push about him anylonger? He was, instead, rather concerned to defend his spendthriftcourses."Spent all his money!" came a barbed jeer from the Merle twin.The ruined one stalked by him with dignity, having remembered a finespeech he had once heard his father make."Oh, well," he said, lightly, "easy come, easy go!"The Merle twin still bore the album and the potent invigorator that wasto make a new man of Judge Penniman. His impoverished brother carriedthe blue jay, looking alert and lifelike in the open, the mammothorange, gift for Mrs. Penniman--he had nearly forgotten her--andtenderly he led the dog, Frank. Not to have all his money again wouldhe have parted with his treasures and the memory of supreme delights.Not for all his squandered fortune would he have bartered Frank, thedog. Frank capered at his side, ever and again looking up brightly athis new master. Never had so much attention been shown him. Never beforehad he been confined by a leash, as if he were a desirable dog.Opposite the Mansion House, Newbern's chief hotel, Frank gave signalproof of his intelligence. From across River Street he had been espiedby Boodles, the Mansion House dog, a creature of dusty, pinkish white,of short neck and wide jaws, of a clouded but still definite bullancestry. Boodles was a dog about town, wearing many scars of combat, aswashbuckler of a dog, rough-mannered, raffish; if not actuallyquarrelsome, at least highly sensitive where his honour was concerned.He made it a point to know every dog in town, and as he rose from asitting posture, where he had been taking the air before his inn, itcould be observed that Frank was new to him--certainly new and perhapsobjectionable. He stepped lightly halfway across the now empty streetand stopped for a further look. He seemed to be saying, "Maybe it ain'ta dog, after all." But the closer look and a lifted nose wrinkling intothe breeze set him right. He left for a still closer look at what wasunquestionably a dog.The Wilbur twin became concerned for Boodles. He regarded him highly.But he knew that Boodles was a fighter, and Frank ate them up. Hecommanded Boodles to go back, but though he had slowed his pace and nowhalted a dozen feet from Frank, the cannibal, Boodles showed that he wasnot going back until he had some better reason. Violence of thecruellest sort seemed forward. But perhaps Frank might be won from hisloathly practice."You, Frank, be quiet, sir!" ordered Wilbur, though Frank had not beenunquiet. "Be still, sir!" he added, and threatened his pet with an openpalm. But Frank had attention only for Boodles, who now approached,little recking his fate. The clash was at hand."Be still, sir!" again commanded Wilbur in anguished tones, whereuponthe obedient Frank tumbled to lie upon his back, four limp legs in air,turning his head to simper up at Boodles, who stood inquiringly abovehim. Boodles then sniffed an amiable contempt and ran back to his hotel.Frank strained at his leash to follow. His proud owner thought therecould be few dogs in all the world so biddable as this.The twins went on. Merle was watching his chance to recover thatspiritual supremacy over the other that had been his until the accidentof wealth had wrenched it from him."You'll catch it for keeping us out so late," he warned--"and cursingand fighting and spending all your money!"The other scarce heard him. He walked through shining clouds far abovean earth where one catches it.CHAPTER IIIThe Penniman house, white, with green blinds, is set back from themaple-and-elm-shaded street, guarded by a white picket fence. Betweenthe house and gate a green lawn was crossed by a gravelled walk, withborders of phlox; beyond the borders, on either side, were floweringshrubs, and at equal distances from the walk, circular beds of scarlettulips and yellow daffodils. Detached from the Penniman house, but stillin the same yard, was a smaller, one-storied house, also white, withgreen blinds, tenanted by Dave Cowan and his twins, who--in Newbernvernacular--mealed with Mrs. Penniman. It had been the Cowan home whenDave married the Penniman cousin who had borne the twins. There was apath worn in the grass between the two houses.On the Penniman front porch the judge was throned in a wicker chair. Hewas a nobly fronted old gentleman, with imposing head, bald at the topbut tastefully hung with pale, fluffy side curls. His face was wide andfull, smoothly shaven, his cheeks pink, his eyes a pure, pale blue. Hewas clad in a rumpled linen suit the trousers of which were drawn wellup his plump legs above white socks and low black shoes, broad and loosefitting. As the shadows had lengthened and the day cooled he abandoned apalm-leaf fan he had been languidly waving. His face at the momentglowed with animation, for he played over the deciding game in thatday's match at checkers by which, at the harness shop, he had vanquishedan acclaimed rival from over Higgston way. The fellow had been skilledbeyond the average, but supremacy was still with the Newbern champion.So absorbed was he, achieving again that last bit of strategy by whichhe had gained the place to capture two men and reach the enemy's kingrow, that his soft-stepping daughter, who had come from the house, hadto address him twice."Have you had a good day, father?"The judge was momentarily confused. He had to recall that hisinvalidism, not his checker prowess, was in question. He regained hispresence of mind; he coughed feebly, reaching a hand tenderly back to apoint between his shoulder blades."Not one of my real bad days, Winona. I can't really say I've suffered.Stuff that other cushion in back of me, will you? I got a new pain kindof in this left shoulder--neuralgia, mebbe. But my sciatica ain'ttroubled me--not too much."Winona adjusted the cushion."You're so patient, father!""I try to be, Winona," which was simple truth.A sufferer for years, debarred by obscure ailments from activeparticipation in our industrial strife, the judge, often for days at atime, would not complain unless pressed to--quite as if he had forgottenhis pains. The best doctors disagreed about his case, none of them ableto say precisely what his maladies were. True, one city doctor, avisiting friend of the Pennimans' family physician, had once gonecarefully over him, punching, prodding, listening, to announce thatnothing ailed the invalid; which showed, as the judge had said to hisface, that he was nothing but an impudent young squirt. He had neverrevealed this parody of a diagnosis to his anxious family, who alwaysbelieved the city doctor had found something deadly that might at anytime carry off the patient sufferer.The judge was also bitter about Christian Science, and could easily beled to expose its falsity. He would wittily say it wasn't Christian andwasn't science; merely the chuckleheadedness of a lot of women. Thisbecause a local adept of the cult had told him, and--what wasworse--told Mrs. Penniman and Winona, that if he didn't quit thinkinghe was an invalid pretty soon he would really have something the matterwith him.And he had incurred another offensive diagnosis: Old Doc Purdy, themedical examiner, whose sworn testimony had years before procured thejudge his pension as a Civil War veteran, became brutal about it. SaidPurdy: "I had to think up some things that would get the old cuss hismoney and dummed if he didn't take it all serious and think he did have'em!"The judge had been obliged to abandon all thoughts of a career. Yearsbefore he had been Newbern's justice of the peace, until a gang ofpolitical tricksters defeated the sovereign will of the people. Andperhaps he would again have accepted political honours, but none hadbeen offered him. Still, the family was prosperous. For in addition tothe pension, Mrs. Penniman kept a neat card in one of the front windowspromising "Plain and Fancy Dressmaking Done Here," and Winona now taughtschool.Having adjusted the cushion, Winona paused before the cage of a parroton a stand at the end of the porch. The bird sidled over to her on stifflegs, cocked upon her a leering, yellow eye and said in wheedling tones,"Pretty girl, pretty girl!" But then it harshly screeched, "Ha, ha, ha,ha, ha!" This laughter was discordant, cynical, derisive, as if the birdrelished a tasteless jest.Winona went to the hammock and resumed an open book. Its title was"Matthew Arnold--How to Know Him." She was getting up in Matthew Arnoldfor a paper. Winona at twenty was old before she should have been. Shewas small and dark, with a thin nose and pinched features. Her darkhair, wound close to her small head, was pretty enough, and her darkeyes were good, but she seemed to carry almost the years of her mother.She was an earnest girl, severe in thought, concerned about her culture,seeking to subdue a nature which she profoundly distrusted to an idealshe would have described as one of elegance and refinement. The dressshe wore was one of her best--for an exemplary young man would callthat evening, bringing his choice silver flute upon which he would playjustly if not brilliantly to Winona's piano accompaniment--but it wasdull of tint, one of her mother's plain, not fancy, creations. StillWinona felt it was daring, because the collar was low and sported afichu of lace. This troubled her, even as she renewed the earnest effortto know Matthew Arnold. She doubtfully fingered at her throat a tinychain that supported a tiny pendant. She slipped the thing under theneck of her waist. She feared that with her low neck--she thought of itas low--the bauble would be flashy.Mrs. Penniman came from the kitchen and sat on the porch steps. She wasmuch like Winona, except that certain professional touches of colour atwaist, neck, and wrists made her appear, in spirit at least, the youngerwoman. There were times when Winona suffered herself to doubt hermother's seriousness; times when the woman appeared a slave to levity.She would laugh at things Winona considered no laughing matters, and hersympathy with her ailing husband had come to be callous and matter offact, almost perfunctory. She longed, moreover, to do fancy dressmakingfor her child; and there was the matter of the silk stockings. TheChristmas before the too downright Dave Cowan, in a low spirit ofbanter, had gifted Winona with these. They were of tan silk, and Davehad challenged her to wear them for the good of her soul.Winona had been quite unpleasantly shocked at Dave's indelicacy, but hermother had been frivolous throughout the affair. Her mother said, too,that she would like to wear silk stockings at all times. But Winona--shespoke of the gift as hose--put the sinister things away at the bottom ofher third bureau drawer. Once, indeed, she had nearly nerved herself toa public appearance in them, knowing that perfectly good women often didthis. That had been the day she was to read her paper on Early GreekSculpture at the Entre Nous Club. She had put them on with her new tanpumps, but the effect had been too daring. She felt the ogling eyes.The stockings had gone back to the third bureau drawer--to thebottom--and never had her ankles flashed a silken challenge to a publicthat might misunderstand.Yet--and this it was that was making Winona old before her time--alwaysin her secret heart of hearts she did long abjectly to wear silkstockings--all manner of sinful silken trifles. Evil yearnings like thiswould sweep her. But she took them to be fruits of a natural depravitythat good women must fight. Thus far she had triumphed.Mrs. Penniman now wielded the palm-leaf fan. She eyed her husband withan almost hardened glance, then ran a professional eye over the lines ofWinona. Her head moved with quick little birdlike turnings. Her darkhair was less orderly than Winona's, and--from her kitchen work--twospots of colour burned high on her cheeks."Your locket's slipped inside your waist," she said, not dreaming thatWinona had in shame brought this about.Winona, who would have been shamed again to explain this, withdrew thebauble. The fond mother now observed the book above which her daughterbent, twisting her neck to follow the title."Is it interesting?" she asked; and then: "The way to know a man--cookfor him."Her daughter winced, suffering a swift picture of her too-light mother,cooking for Mr. Arnold."I should think you'd pick out a good novel to read," went on hermother. "That last one I got from the library--it's about a beautifulwoman that counted the world well lost for love."Winona murmured indistinctly."She didn't--she didn't stop at anything," added the mother, brightly."Oh, Mother!""I don't care! The Reverend Mallett himself said that novels should beread for an understanding of life--ever novels with a wholesome sexinterest. The very words he said!""Mother, Mother!" protested Winona with a quick glance at her father.She doubted if any sex interest could be wholesome; and surely, withboth sexes present, the less said about such things the better. To herrelief the perilous topic was abandoned."I suppose you both heard the big news today."Mrs. Penniman spoke ingenuously, but it was downright lying--no less.She supposed they had not heard the big news. She was certain they hadnot. Winona was attentive. Her mother's business of plain and fancydressmaking did not a little to make the acoustics of Newbern superior.From her clients she gleaned the freshest chronicles of Newbern's sociallife, many being such as one might safely repeat; many more, Winonauncomfortably recalled, the sort no good woman would let go any further.She hoped the imminent disclosure would not be of the latter class, yetsuddenly she wished to hear it even if it were. She affected to turnwith reluctance from her budding acquaintanceship with Matthew Arnold."It's the twins," began her mother with a look of pleased horror. "Youcouldn't guess in all day what they've been up to.""You may be sure Wilbur was the one to blame," put in Winona, quick todefend the one most responsive to her lessons in faith, morals,etiquette."Ought to be soundly trounced," declared the judge. "That's what Ialways say.""This is the worst yet," continued Mrs. Penniman.She liked the suspense she had created. With an unerring gift for oralnarrative, she toyed with this. She must first tell how she got it."You know that georgette waist Mrs. Ed Seaver is having?""Have they done something awful?" Winona demanded. "I perfectly wellknow it wasn't Merle's fault.""Well, Mrs. Seaver came in about four o'clock for her final fitting,and what do you think?""For mercy's sake!" pleaded Winona."And Ed Seaver had been to the barber shop to have his hair cut--healways gets it cut the fifteenth of each month--well, he found out allabout it from Don Paley, that they'd had to send for to come to theWhipple New Place to cut it neatly off after the way it had been sawedoff rough, and she told me word for word. Well, it's unbelievable, andevery one saying something ought to be done about it--you just neverwould be able to guess!"Winona snapped shut the volume so rich in promise and leaned forward toface her mother desperately. Mrs. Penniman here coughed in a refined andartificial manner as a final preliminary. The parrot instantly coughedin the same manner, and--seeming to like it--again became Mrs. Pennimanin a series of mild, throaty preliminary coughs, as if it wouldpresently begin to tell something almost too good. The real tale had tobe suspended again for this."Well," resumed Mrs. Penniman, feeling that the last value had beenextracted from mere suspense, "anyway, it seems that this morning poorlittle Patricia Whipple was going by the old graveyard, and the twinsjumped out and knocked her down and dragged her in there away from theroad and simply tore every stitch of clothes off her back and made herdress up in Wilbur's clothes----""There!" gasped the horrified Winona. "Didn't I say it would be Wilbur?""And then what did they do but cut off her braid with a knife!""Wilbur's knife--Merle hasn't any.""And the Lord knows what the little fiends would have done next, butJuliana Whipple happened to be passing, and heard the poor child'sscreams and took her away from them.""That dreadful, dreadful Wilbur!" cried Winona."Reform school," spoke the judge, as if he uttered it from the bench."But something queer," went on Mrs. Penniman. "Juliana took the twinshome in the pony cart, with Wilbur wearing Patricia's dress--it's aplaid gingham I made myself--and someone gave him a lot of money and lethim go, and they didn't give Merle any because Ed Seaver saw them onRiver Street, and Wilbur had it all. And what did Patricia Whipple sayto Don Paley but that she was going to have one of the twins for herbrother, because no one else would get her a brother, and so she must.But what would she want one of those little cutthroats for? That's whatpuzzles me.""Merle is not a cutthroat," said Winona with tightening lips. "He neverwill be a cutthroat." She left all manner of permissible suspicionsabout his brother."Well, it just beat me!" confessed her mother. "Maybe they've beenreading Wild West stories.""Wilbur, perhaps," insisted Winona. "Merle is already very choice in hisreading.""A puzzle, anyway--why, there they come!"And the manner of their coming brought more bewilderment to the house ofPenniman. For the criminal Wilbur did not come shamed and slinking, butwith rather an uplift. Behind him gloomily trod the Merle twin. Even ata distance he was disapproving, accusatory, put upon. It was to be seenthat he washed his hands of the evil."Whatever in the world--" began Mrs. Penniman, for Wilbur in the hollowof his arm bore a forked branch upon which seemed to perch in allconfidence a free bird of the wilds."A stuffed bird!" said the peering Winona, and dispelled this illusion.The twins entered the gate. Midway up the gravelled walk Wilbur Cowanbegan a gurgling oration."I bet nobody can guess what I brought! Yes, sir--a beautiful presentfor every one--that will make a new man of poor old Judge Penniman, andthis lovely orange--that's for Mrs. Penniman--and I bet Winona can'tguess what's wrapped up in this box for her--it's the most beautifulalbum, and this first-class animal for my father, and it'll last alifetime if he takes care of it good; and I got me a dog to watch thehouse." Breathless he paused."Spent all his money!" intoned Merle. "And he bought me this knife,too."He displayed it, but merely as a count in the indictment for criminalextravagance. He had gone to the hammock to sit by Winona. He neededher. He had been too long unconsidered.The sputtering gift-bringer bestowed the orange upon Mrs. Penniman, thealbum upon Winona, and the invigorator upon the now embarrassed judge."Thank you, Wilbur, dear!" Mrs. Penniman was first to recover her poise."Thanks ever so much," echoed Winona, doubtfully.She must first know that he had come by this money righteously. Thejudge adjusted spectacles to read the label on his gift."Thank you, my boy. The stuff may give me temporary relief."He had felt affronted that any one could suppose one bottle of anythingwould make a new man of him; and--inconsistently enough--affronted thatany one should suppose he needed to be made a new man of. He had notliked the phrase at all."And now perhaps you will tell us----" began Winona, her lips againtightening. But the Wilbur twin could not yet be brought down to merehistory."This is an awful fighting dog," he was saying. "He's called Frank, andhe eats them up. Yes, sir, he nearly et up that old Boodles dog justnow. He would of if I hadn't stopped him. He minds awful well.""Spent all _our_ money!" declaimed Merle in a public-school voice, using"our" for the first time since his defeat of the morning. Certain ofWinona's support, it had again become their money. "And cursing,swearing, fighting, smoking!""Oh, Wilbur!" exclaimed the shocked Winona; yet there was dismay morethan rebuke in her tone, for she had brought the album to view. "Ifyou've been a bad boy perhaps I should not accept this lovely gift fromyou. Remember--we don't yet know how you obtained all this money.""Ho! I earned that money good! That old fat Mr. Whipple said I earned itgood. He said he wouldn't of done what I done----""Did, dear!""--wouldn't of did what I did for twice the money.""And what was it you did?"Winona spoke gently, as a friend. But Wilbur rubbed one bare footagainst and over the other. He was not going to tell that shamefulthing, even to these people."Oh, I didn't do much of anything," he muttered."But what was it?"The judge interrupted."It says half a wineglassful before meals. Daughter, will you bring methe wineglass?"The Pennimans kept a wineglass. The judge found a corkscrew attached tothe bottle, and sipped his draft under the absorbed regard of the group."It feels like it might give some temporary relief," he admitted,savoring the last drops."You go right down to the drug store and look at that picture; you'llsee then what it'll do for you," urged the donor."What else did the Whipples say to you?" wheedled Winona.The Wilbur twin again hung embarrassed."Well--well, there's a cruel stepmother, but now she wasn't cruel to me.She said I was a nice boy, and gave me back my pants.""Gave you back--"Winona enacted surprise."I had to have my pants, didn't I? I couldn't go out without any, couldI? And she took me to a pantry and give me a big hunk of cake withraisins in it, and a big slice of apple pie, and a big glass of milk.""I must say! And she never gave me a thing!" Merle's bitterness grew."And she kissed me twice, and--and said I was a nice boy.""You already said that," reminded the injured brother."And she didn't act cruel to me once, even if she is a stepmother.""But how did you come to be without your----"Wilbur was again reprieved from her grilling. The Penniman cat, Mouser,a tawny, tigerish beast, had leaped to the porch. With set eyes andquivering tail it advanced crouchingly, one slow step at a time,noiseless, sinister. Only when poised for its final spring upon thehelpless prey was it seen that Mouser stalked the blue jay on its perch.Wilbur, with a cry of alarm, snatched the treasure from peril. Mouserleaped to the porch railing to lick her lips in an evil manner."You will, will you?" Wilbur stormed at her. Yet he was pleased, too,for Mouser's attempt was testimony to the bird's merit. "She thought itwas real," he said, proudly."But how did you come to have your clothes----" began Winona sweetlyonce more, and again the twin was saved from shuffling answers.The dog, Frank, sniffing up timidly at Mouser on the porch rail,displeased her. From her perch she leaned down to curse him hissingly,with arched back and swollen tail, a potent forearm with drawn clawscurving forward in menace."You will, will you?" demanded Wilbur again, freeing his legs from theleash in which the dismayed dog had entwined them.Frank now fell on his back with limp paws in air and simpered girlishlyup at his envenomed critic on the railing."We got to keep that old cat out the way. He eats 'em up--that's all hedoes, eats 'em! It's a good thing I was here to make him mind me.""But how did you come to have your clothes----" resumed Winona.This time it was Dave Cowan who thwarted her with a blithe hail fromthe gate. Winona gave it up. Merle had been striving to tell her whatshe wished to know. Later she would let him.       *       *       *       *       *Dave swaggered up the walk, a gay and gallant figure in his blue cutawaycoat, his waistcoat of most legible plaid, fit ground for the watchchain of heavy golden links. He wore a derby hat and a fuming calabashpipe, removing both for a courtly bow to the ladies. His yellow hair hadbeen plastered low on his brow, to be swept back each side of the partin a gracious curve; his thick yellow moustache curled jauntily upward,to show white teeth as he smiled. At first glance he was smartlyapparelled, but below the waist Dave always diminished rapidly inelegance. His trousers were of another pattern from the coat, not tooaccurate of fit, and could have been pressed to advantage, while theonce superb yellow shoes were tarnished and sadly worn. The man wasrichly and variously scented. There were the basic and permanent aromasof printer's ink and pipe tobacco; above these like a mist were the rareunguents lately applied by Don Paley, the barber, and a spicy odour ofstrong drink. As was not unusual on a Saturday night, Dave would havepassed some relaxing moments at the liquor saloon of Herman Vielhaber."I hope I see you well, duchess!"This was for Mrs. Penniman, and caused her to bridle as she fancied asaluted duchess might. It was the humour of Dave to suppose this lady apeeress of the old regime, one who had led far too gay a life and, comenow to a dishonoured old age, was yet cynical and unrepentant. Winonaalso he affected to believe an ornament of the old noblesse, a creatureof maddening beauty, but without heart, so that despairing suitors slewthemselves for her. His debased fancy would at times further have itthat Judge Penniman was Louis XVIII, though at this moment, observingthat the ladies were preoccupied with one of his sons, he paused by theinvalid and expertly from a corner of his mouth whispered the coarsewords, "Hello, Old Flapdoodle!" From some remnant of sex loyalty hewould not address the sufferer thus when his womenfolk could overhear,but the judge could never be sure of the jester's discretion. Besides,Dave was from day to day earnestly tutoring the parrot to say the basewords, and the judge knew that Polly, once master of them, would use nodiscretion whatever. He glared at Dave Cowan in hearty but silent rage.Dave turned from him to kneel at the feet of Winona."'A book of verses underneath the bow--'" he began.Winona shuddered. She knew what was coming; dreadful, licentious stufffrom a so-called poet--far, far different from dear Tennyson, thoughtWinona--who sang the joys of profligacy. Winona turned from therecitationist."What? Repulsed again? Ah, well, there's always the river! Duchess, bearwitness, 'twas her coldness drove me to the rash act--she with herbeauty that maddens all be-holders!"Winona was shocked, yet not unpleasantly, at these monstrousimplications. She dreaded to have him begin--and yet she would have him.She tried to sign to him now that matters were to the fore too grave forclumsy fooling, but he only took the book from her hand to read itstitle."'Matthew Arnold--How to Know Him,'" he read. "Ah, yes! Ah, yes! But ishe worth knowing?""Oh!" exclaimed Winona, wincing."No respect for God or man," mumbled the judge, meaning that a creaturecapable of calling him Old Flapdoodle could be expected to ask ifMatthew Arnold were worth knowing.The Wilbur twin here thrust the blue jay upon his father with cordialwords. Dave professed to be entranced with the gift. It appeared that hehad always longed for a stuffed blue jay. He curled a finger to it andcalled, "Tweet! Tweet!" a bit of comedy poignantly relished by the donorof the bird.His father now ceremoniously conducted Mrs. Penniman to what he spokeof as the banqueting hall. He made almost a minuet of their progress.Under one arm he carried his bird to place it on the table, where laterduring the meal he would convulse the Wilbur twin by affecting to feedit bits of bread. Winona still hungered for details of the day'stragedy, but Dave must talk of other things. He talked far too much, thejudge believed. He had just made the invalid uncomfortable by disclosingthat the Ajax Invigorator had an alcoholic content of at leastfifty-five per cent. He said that for this reason it would affordtemporary relief to almost any one. He added that it would be cheapstuff, and harmful, and that if a man wished to drink he ought to gostraight to Vielhaber's, where they kept an excellent line of AjaxInvigorators and sold them under their right names. The judge said"Stuff and nonsense" to this, but the ladies believed, for despite hislevity Dave Cowan knew things. He read books and saw the world. Only theWilbur twin still had faith in the invigorator. He had seen the picture.You couldn't get round that picture.Having made the judge uncomfortable, Dave rendered Winona so by a brieflecture upon organic evolution, with the blue jay as his text. He saidit had taken four hundred and fifty million years for man to progressthus far from the blue-jay stage--if you could call it progress, thesuperiority of man's brain to the jay's being still inconsiderable.Winona was uncomfortable, because she had never been able to persuadeherself that we had come up from the animals, and in any event it wasnot talk for the ears of innocent children. She was relieved when thespeaker strayed into the comparatively blameless field of astronomy,telling of suns so vast that our own sun became to them but a pin pointof light, and of other worlds out in space peopled with beings like Mrs.Penniman and Winona and the judge, though even here Winona felt that thelecturer was too daring. The Bible said nothing about these other worldsout in space. But then Dave had once, in the post office, argued againstreligion itself in the most daring manner, with none other than theReverend Mallett.It was not until the meal ended and they were again on the porch in thesummer dusk that Winona made any progress in her criminalinvestigations. There, while Dave Cowan played his guitar and sangsentimental ballads to Mrs. Penniman--these being among the supposedinfirmities of the profligate duchess--Winona drew the twins aside andmanaged to gain a blurred impression of the day's tremendous events. Shenever did have the thing clearly. The Merle twin was eager to tell toomuch, the other determined to tell too little. But the affair hadplainly been less nefarious than reported by Don Paley to Ed Seaver. Thetwins persisted in ignoring the social aspects of their adventure. Tothem it was a thing of pure finance.Winona had to give it up at last, for Lyman Teaford came with his flutein its black case. Dave Cowan finished "In the Gloaming," brazenly,though it was not thought music by either Lyman or Winona, who wouldpresently dash into the "Poet and Peasant" overture. The twins begged tobe let to see Lyman assemble his flute, and Dave overlooked the processwith them. Lyman deftly joined the various sections of shining metal."He looks like a plumber," said Dave. The twins giggled, but Winonafrowned."No respect for God or man," mumbled the judge from his wicker chair.CHAPTER IVIn the Penniman home it was not merely Sunday morning; it was Sabbathmorning. Throughout the house a subdued bustling, decorous and solemn; ahushed, religious hurry of preparation for church. In the bathroom JudgePenniman shaved his marbled countenance with tender solicitude, fittinghimself to adorn a sanctuary. In other rooms Mrs. Penniman and Winonaarrayed themselves in choice raiment for behoof of the godly; in eachwere hurried steppings, as from closet to mirror; shrill whisperings ofsilken drapery as it fell into place. In the parlour the Merle twin satreading an instructive book. With unfailing rectitude he had been thefirst to don Sabbath garments, and now lacked merely his shoes, whichwere being burnished by his brother in the more informal atmosphere ofthe woodshed, to which the Sabbath strain of preparation did notpenetrate.It was the Wilbur twin's weekly task to do the shoes of himself andbrother and those of the judge. No one could have told precisely why thetask fell to him, and he had never thought to question. The thing simplywas. Probably Winona, asked to wrestle with the problem, would haveurged that Merle was always the first one dressed, and should not beexpected to submit his Sunday suit to the hazards of this toil. Shewould have added, perhaps, that anyway it was more suitable work forWilbur, the latter being of a rougher spiritual texture. Also, Merlecould be trusted to behave himself in the Penniman parlour, not touchingthe many bibelots there displayed, or disarranging the furniture, whilethe Wilbur twin would not only touch and disarrange, but pry into andhandle and climb and altogether demoralize. In all the parlour therewas but one object for which he had a seemly respect--the vast paintingof a recumbent lion behind bars. It was not an ordinary picture, such asmay be seen in galleries, for the bars guarding the fierce beast werereal bars set into the frame, a splendid conceit that the Wilbur twinnever tired of regarding. If you were alone in the sacred room you couldgo right up to the frame and feel the actual bars and put your handthrillingly through them to touch the painted king of the jungle. Butthe Merle twin could sit alone in the presence of this prized arttreasure and never think of touching it. He would sit quietly and readhis instructive book and not occasion the absent Winona any anxiety.Wherefore the Wilbur twin each Sabbath morning in the woodshed polishedthree pairs of shoes, and not uncheerfully. He would, in truth, muchrather be there at his task than compelled to sit in the parlour withhis brother present to tell if he put inquiring fingers into the lion'scage.He had finished the shoes of his brother and himself, not taking toomuch pains about the heels, and now laboured at the more considerablefootgear of the judge. The judge's shoes were not only broad, but of asurface abounding in hills and valleys. As Dave Cowan said, the judge'sfeet were lumpy. But the Wilbur twin was conscientious here, and thejudge's heels would be as resplendent as the undulating toes. The taskhad been appreciably delayed by Frank, the dog, who, with a quaintrelish for shoe blacking, had licked a superb polish from one shoe whilethe other was under treatment. His new owner did not rebuke him. Heconceived that Frank had intelligently wished to aid in the work, andapplauded him even while securing the shined shoes from his furtherassistance.But one pagan marred this chastened Sabbath harmony of preparation. Inthe little house Dave Cowan lolled lordly in a disordered bed, smokedhis calabash pipe beside a disordered breakfast tray, fetched him by theWilbur twin, and luxuriated in the merely Sunday--and notSabbath--edition of a city paper shrieking with black headlines andspectacular with coloured pictures; a pleasing record of crimes anddisasters and secrets of the boudoir, the festal diversions of theopulent, the minor secrets of astronomy, woman's attire, baseball, highart, and facial creams. As a high priest of the most liberal of allarts, Dave scanned the noisy pages with a cynical and professional eye,knowing that none of the stuff had acquired any dignity or power tocoerce human belief until mere typesetters like himself had crystallizedit. Not for Dave Cowan was the printed word of sacred authority. He hadset up too much copy. But he was pleased, nevertheless, thus to whileand doze away a beautiful Sabbath morning that other people made rathera trial of.Having finished the last of the judge's shoes, the Wilbur twin took themand the shoes of Merle to their owners, then hastened with his own tothe little house where he must dress in his own Sunday clothes, wash hishands with due care--they would be doubtingly inspected by Winona--andput soap on his hair to make it lie down. Merle's hair would liepolitely as combed, but his own hair owned no master but soap. Lackingthis, it stood out and up in wicked disorder--like the hair of a rowdy,Winona said.The rebellious stuff was at last plastered deceitfully to his skull asif a mere brush had smoothed it, and with a final survey, to assurehimself that he had forgotten none of those niceties of the toilet thatWinona would insist upon, he took his new straw hat and went again tothe Penniman house. For the moment he was in flawless order, as neat, ascompactly and accurately accoutred as the Merle twin, to whom thiseffect came without effort. But it would be so only for a few fleetingmoments. He mournfully knew this, and so did Winona. Within five blocksfrom home and still five blocks from the edifice of worship, while Merleappeared as one born to Sunday clothes and shined shoes and a new hat,the Wilbur twin would be one to whom Sabbath finery was exotic andunwelcome. The flawless lustre of his shoes would be dulled, even thoughhe walked sedately the safe sidewalk; his broad collar and bluepolka-dotted cravat would be awry, one stocking would be down, hisjacket yawning, all his magnificence seeming unconquerably alien. Winonadid him the justice to recognize that this disarray was due to nowilfulness of its victim. He was helpless against a malign current ofhis being.He held himself stiff in the parlour until the Pennimans came rustlingdown the stairway. He could exult in a long look at the benignant lionback of real bars, but, of course, he could not now reach up to touchthe bars. It would do something to his clothes, even if the watchful andupright Merle had not been there to report a transgression of the rules.Merle also stood waiting, his hat nicely in one hand.The judge descended the stairs, monumental in black frock coat, graytrousers, and the lately polished shoes that were like shining reliefmaps of a hill country. He carried a lustrous silk hat, which he nowpaused to make more lustrous, his fingers clutching a sleeve of his coatand pulling it down to make a brush. The hat was the only item of thejudge's regal attire of which the Wilbur twin was honestly envious--itwas so beautiful, so splendid, so remote. He had never even dared totouch it. He could have been left alone in the room with it, and stillwould have surveyed it in all respect from a proper distance.Mrs. Penniman came next, rustling in black silk and under a flowered hatthat Winona secretly felt to be quite too girlish. Then Winona from thedoor of her room above called to the twins, and they ascended thestairway for a last rite before the start for church, the bestowal ofperfume upon each. Winona stood in the door of her room, as each Sundayshe stood at this crisis, the cut-glass perfume bottle in hand. Thetwins solemnly approached her, and upon the white handkerchief of eachshe briefly inverted the bottle. The scent enveloped them delectably asthe handkerchiefs were replaced in the upper left pockets, foldedcorners protruding correctly. As Wilbur turned away Winona swiftlymoistened a finger tip in the precious stuff and drew it across thepale brow of Merle. It was a furtive tribute to his inherent socialsuperiority.Winona, in her own silk--not black, but hardly less severe--and in a hatless girlish than her mother's, rustled down the stairs after them.Speech was brief and low-toned among the elders, as befitted the highmoment. The twins were solemnly silent. Amid the funereal gloom, brokenonly by a hushed word or two from Winona or her mother, the judgecompleted his fond stroking of the luminous hat, raised it slowly, andwith both hands adjusted it to his pale curls. Then he took up hisgold-headed ebony cane and stepped from the dusk of the parlour into thelight of day, walking uprightly in the pride of fine raiment andconscious dignity. Mrs. Penniman walked at his side, not unconsciousherself of the impressive mien of her consort.Followed Winona and Merle, the latter bearing her hymn book and at somepains keeping step with his companion. Behind them trailed the Wilburtwin, resolving, as was his weekly rule, to keep himself neat throughchurch and Sunday-school--yet knowing in his heart it could not be done.Already he could feel his hair stiffening as the coating of soap driedupon it. Pretty soon the shining surface would crack and disorder ensue.What was the use? As he walked carefully now he inhaled rich scent fromthe group--Winona's perfume combining but somehow not blending with apungent, almost vivid, aroma of moth balls from the judge's frock coat.They met or passed other family groups, stiffly armoured for the weeklypenance to a bewildering puzzle of mortality. Ceremonious greetings wereexchanged with these. The day was bright and the world all fair, butthere could be no levity, no social small talk, while this grim businesswas on. They reached the white house of worship, impressive under itsheaven-pointing steeple, and passed within its portals, stepping softlyto the accompaniment of those silken whisperings, with now and again thehigh squeak of new boots whose wearers, profaning the stillness, wouldappear self-conscious and annoyed, though as if silently protestingthat they were blameless.Thus began an hour of acute mental distress for the Wilbur twin. He sattightly between Mrs. Penniman and the judge. There was no free movementpossible. He couldn't even juggle one foot backward and forward withoutcorrection. The nervous energy thus suppressed rushed to all the surfaceof his body and made his skin tingle maddeningly. He felt each hair onhis head as it broke away from the confining soap. Something was insidehis collar, and he couldn't reach for it; there was a poignant itchingbetween his shoulder blades, and this could receive no proper treatment.He boiled with dumb, helpless rage, having to fight this wicked unrest.He never doubted its wickedness, and considered himself forever shut outfrom those rewards that would fall to the righteous who loved church andcould sit still there without jiggling or writhing or twisting orscratching.He was a little diverted from his tortures by the arrival of theWhipples. From the Penniman pew he could glance across to a side pew andobserve a line of repeated Whipple noses, upon which for some moments hewas enabled to speculate forgetfully. Once--years ago, it seemed tohim--he had heard talk of the Whipple nose. This one had the Whipplenose, or that one did not have the Whipple nose; and it had then beenhis understanding that the Whipple family possessed but one nose incommon; sometimes one Whipple had it; then another Whipple would haveit. At the time this had seemed curious, but in no way anomalous. He hadreadily pictured a Whipple nose being worn now by one and now by anotherof this family. He had visualized it as something that could be handedabout. Later had come the disappointing realization that each Whipplehad a complete nose at all times for his very own; that the phrase bywhich he had been misled denoted merely the possession of a certainbuild of nose by Whipples.But even this simple phenomenon offered some distraction from hispresent miseries. He could glance along the line of Whipple noses andobserve that they were, indeed, of a markedly similar pattern. It was,as one might say, a standardized nose, raised by careful selectionthrough past generations of Whipples to the highest point of efficiency;for ages yet to come the demands of environment, howsoever capricious,would probably dictate no change in its structural details. It sufficed.It was, moreover, a nose of good lines, according to conventionalcanons. It was shapely, and from its high bridge jutted forward withrather a noble sweep of line to the thin, curved nostrils. The highbridge was perhaps the detail that distinguished it from most goodnoses. It seemed to begin to be a nose almost from the base of the brow.In a world of all Whipple noses this family would have been remarked forits beauty. In one of less than Whipple noses--with other less claimantdesigns widely popularized--it might be said that the Whipple face wouldbe noted rather for distinction than beauty.In oblique profile the Wilbur twin could glance across the fronts inturn of Harvey D. Whipple, of Gideon Whipple, his father; of SharonWhipple, his uncle; and of Juliana Whipple, sole offspring of Sharon.The noses were alike. One had but to look at Miss Juliana to know thatin simple justice this should have been otherwise. She might have kept aWhipple nose--Whipple in all essentials--without too pressing aninsistence upon bulk. But it had not been so. Her nose was as utterlyWhipple as any. They might have been interchanged without detection.The Wilbur twin stared and speculated upon and mildly enjoyed thisdisplay, until a species of hypnotism overtook him, a mercifullydeadening inertia that made him slumberous and almost happy. He couldkeep still at last, and be free from the correcting hand of Mrs.Penniman or the warning prod of the judge's elbow. He dozed in a smotherof applied godliness. He was delighted presently to note with anawakening start that the sermon was well under way. He heard no word ofthis. He knew only that a frowning old gentleman stood in a high placeand scolded about something. The Wilbur twin had no notion what hisgrievance might be; was sensible only of his heated aspect, his activityin gesture, and the rhythm of his phrases.This influence again benumbed him to forgetfulness, so that during thefinal prayer he was dramatizing a scene in which three large and savagedogs leaped upon Frank and Frank destroyed them--ate them up. And whenhe stood at last for the doxology one of his feet had veritably gone tosleep, the one that had been cramped back under the seat, so that hestumbled and drew unwelcome attention to himself while the foot tingledto wakefulness.The ever-tractable Merle had been attentive to the sermon, had sungbeautifully, and was still immaculate of garb, while the Wilbur twinemerged from the ordeal in rank disorder, seeming to have survived ascuffle in which efforts had been made to wrench away his Sunday clothesand to choke him with his collar and cravat. And the coating of soap hadplayed his hair false. It stood out behind and stood up in front, notwith any system, but merely here and there."You are a perfect sight," muttered Winona to him. "I don't see how youdo it." But neither did the offender.With a graciously relaxed tension the freed congregation made aleisurely progress to the doors of the church; many lingered here ingroups for greetings and light exchanges. It was here that the Pennimangroup coalesced with the Whipple group, a circumstance that the trailingWilbur noted with alarm. The families did not commonly affiliate, andthe circumstance boded ominously. It could surely not be withoutpurpose. The Wilbur twin's alarm was that the Whipple family hadregretted its prodigality of the day before and was about to demand itsmoney back. He lurked in the shadowy doorway.The Whipples were surrounding Merle with every sign of interest. Theyshook hands with him. They seemed to appraise him as if he weresomething choice on exhibition at a fair. Harvey D. was showing the mostinterest, bending above the exhibit in apparently light converse. Butthe Wilbur twin knew all about Harvey D. He was the banker and wore abeard. He was to be seen on week days as one passed the First NationalBank, looking out through slender bars--exactly as the Penniman liondid--upon a world that wanted money, but couldn't have it without somegood reason. He had not been present when the Whipple money was sothoughtlessly loosened, and he would be just the man to make a fussabout it now. He would want to take it back and put it behind those barsin the bank where no one could get it. But he couldn't ever have itback, because it was spent. Still, he might do something with thespender.The Wilbur twin slunk farther into friendly shadows, and not until thegroups separated and the four Whipples were in their waiting carriagedid he venture into the revealing sunlight. But no one paid him anyattention. The judge and Mrs. Penniman walked up the shaded street, forthe Sunday dinner must be prepared. Winona and the Merle twin, bothflushed from the recent social episode, turned back to the church tomeet and ignore him."Fortune knocks once at every one's door," Winona was mysteriouslysaying.The Wilbur twin knew this well enough. The day before it had knocked athis door and found him in.There was still Sunday-school to be endured, but he did not regard thisas altogether odious. It was not so smothering. The atmosphere was lessstrained. One's personality could come a bit to the front withoutincurring penalties, and one met one's own kind on a socialplane--subject to discipline, it was true, but still mildly enjoyable.It was his custom to linger here until the classes gathered, but to-daythe Whipple pony cart was driven up by the Whipple stepmother and thegirl with her hair cut off. Apparently no one made these two go tochurch, but they had come to Sunday-school. And the Wilbur twin fledwithin at sight of them. The pony cart, vehicle in which he had beenmade a public mock, was now a sickening sight to him.Sunday-school was even less of a trial to him than usual. The twinswere in the class of Winona, and Winona taught her class to-day withunwonted unction; but the Wilbur twin was pestered with few questionsabout the lesson. She rather singled Merle out and made him aninstructive example to the rest of the class, asking Wilbur but twice,and then in sheerly perfunctory routine: "And what great lesson shouldwe learn from this?"Neither time did he know what great lesson we should learn from this,and stammered his ignorance pitiably, but Winona, in the throes of somemysterious prepossession, forgot to reprove him, and merely allowed themore gifted Merle to purvey the desired information. So the Wilbur twinwas practically free to wriggle on his hard chair, to exchange noiselessgreetings with acquaintances in other classes, and to watch LymanTeaford, the superintendent, draw a pleasing cartoon of the lesson withcoloured chalk on a black-board, consisting chiefly of a rising yellowsun with red rays, which was the sun of divine forgiveness Once theWilbur twin caught the eye of the Whipple girl--whose bonnet hid hercropped hair--and she surprisingly winked at him. He did not wink back.Even to his liberal mind, it did not seem right to wink in aSunday-school.When at last they all sang "Bringing in the Sheaves," and were ablydismissed by Lyman Teaford, who could be as solemn here as he was gay ina parlour with his flute, Winona took the Merle twin across the room togreet the Whipple stepmother and the Whipple girl. Wilbur regarded thescene from afar. Winona seemed to be showing off the Merle twin, causinghim to display all his perfect manners, including a bow lately acquired.The Wilbur twin felt no slight in this. He was glad enough to be leftout of Winona's manoeuvres, for he saw that they were manoeuvres andthat Winona was acting from some large purpose. Unless it wanted itsmoney back, the Whipple family had no meaning for him; it was merelypeople with the Whipple nose, though, of course, the stepmother did nothave this. He paused only to wonder if the girl would have it when shegrew up--she now boasted but the rudiments of any nose whatsoever--anddismissed the tribe from his mind.He waited for Winona and Merle a block up the street from the church.Winona was silent with importance, preoccupied, grave, and yet uplifted.Not until they reached the Penniman gate did she issue from thisabstraction to ask the Wilbur twin rather severely what lesson he hadlearned from the morning sermon. The Wilbur twin, with immensedifficulty, brought her to believe that he had not heard a word of thesermon. This was especially incredible, because it had dealt with theparable of the prodigal son who spent all his substance in riotousliving. One would have thought, said Winona, that this lesson would havecome home to one who had so lately followed the same bad course, and shesought now to enlighten the offender."And he had to eat with the pigs when his money was all gone," Merlesubmitted in an effort to aid Winona.But the Wilbur twin's perverse mind merely ran to the picture of fattedcalf, though without relish--he did not like fat meat.It was good to be back in a human atmosphere once more, where he couldhear his father's quips. The Penniman Sunday dinner was based notably onchicken, as were all other Sunday dinners in Newbern, and his father,when he entered the house, was already beginning the gayety by pledgingMrs. Penniman in a wineglass of the Ajax Invigorator. He called it rubyliquor and said that, taken in moderation, it would harm no one, thoughhe estimated that as few as three glasses would cause people to climbtrees like a monkey.The Wilbur twin was puzzled by this and would have preferred that hispresent be devoted solely to making a new man of Judge Penniman, but helaughed loyally with his father, and rejoiced when Mrs. Penniman, in thecharacter of the abandoned duchess, put her own lips to the glass at hisfather's urging. The judge did not enter into this spirit of foolery,resenting, indeed, that a sound medicinal compound should be thusimpugned. And Winona was even more severe. Not for her to-day were jestsabout Madame la Marquise and her heart of adamant. Dave Cowan tried afew of these without result.Winona was still silent with importance, or spoke cryptically, and shelavished upon the Merle twin such attention as she could give from herown mysterious calculations. One might have gathered that she wasbeholding the Merle twin in some high new light. The Wilbur twin atesilently and as unobtrusively as he could, for table manners wereespecially watched by Winona on Sunday. Not until the blackberry pie didhe break into speech, and even then, it appeared, not with the utmostfelicity. His information that these here blackberries had been pickedoff the grave of some old Jonas Whipple up in the burying ground causedhim to be regarded coldly by more than one of those about the table; andWinona wished to be told how many times she had asked him not to say"these here." Of course he couldn't tell her.Dinner over, it appeared that Winona would take Merle with her to callupon poor old Mrs. Dodwell, who had been bedridden for twenty years, butwas so patient with it all. She loved to have Merle sit by her bedsideof a Sunday and tell of the morning's sermon. They would also take her acustard. The Wilbur twin was not invited upon this excursion, but hisfather winked at him when it was mentioned and he was happy. He could inno manner have edified the afflicted Mrs. Dodwell, and the wink meantthat he would go with his father for a walk over the hills--perhaps tothe gypsy camp. So he winked back at his father, being no longer inSunday-school, and was impatient to be off.In the little house he watched from a window until Winona and Merle hadgone on their errand of mercy--Merle carrying nicely the bowl of custardswathed in a napkin--and thereupon heartily divested himself of shoesand stockings. Winona, for some reason she could never make apparent tohim, believed that boys could not decently go barefoot on the Lord'sDay. He did not wish to affront her, but neither would he wear shoesand stockings with no one to make him. His bare feet rejoiced at thecool touch of the grass as he waited in the front yard for his father.He would have liked to change his Sunday clothes for the old ones of abetter feel, but this even he felt would be going too far. You had todraw the line somewhere.His father came out, lighting his calabash pipe. He wore a tweed cap nowin place of the formal derby, but he was otherwise attired as on theprevious evening, in the blue coal and vivid waistcoat, the inferiortrousers, and the undesirable shoes. As they went down the street undershading elms the dog, Frank, capered at the end of his taut leash.They went up Fair Street to reach the wooded hills beyond the town. Thestreet was still and vacant. The neat white houses with green blinds setback in their flowered yards would be at this hour sheltering people whohad eaten heavily of chicken for dinner and now dozed away its benigneffects. Even song birds had stilled their pipings, and made but briefflights through the sultry air.Dave Cowan sauntered through the silence in a glow of genial tolerancefor the small town, for Dave knew cities. In Newbern he was but a merrytransient; indeed, in all those strange cities he went off to he was buta transient. So frequent his flittings, none could claim him for itsown. He had the air of being in the world itself, but a transient, acheerful and observant explorer finding entertainment in the manners andcustoms of a curious tribe, its foibles, conceits, and quaint standardsof value--since the most of them curiously adhered to one spot eventhough the round earth invited them to wander.Sometimes Dave lingered in Newbern--to the benefit of the _WeeklyAdvance_--for as long as three months. Sometimes he declared he wouldstay but a day and stayed long; sometimes he declared he would stay along time and stayed but a day. He was a creature happily pliant to therule of all his whims. He never bothered to know why he dropped intoNewbern, nor bothered to know why he left. On some morning like othermornings, without plan, he would know he was going and go, stirred bysome vagrant longing for a strange city--and it was so easy to go. Hewas unencumbered with belongings. He had no troublesome packing to do,and took not even the smallest of bags in his farings forth. Unlike thetwins, Dave had no Sunday clothes. What clothes he had he wore, verysensibly, it seemed to him. He had but to go on and on, equipped withhis union card and his printer's steel rule, the sole machinery of histrade, and where he would linger he was welcome, for as long as he choseand at a wage ample for his few needs, to embalm the doings of a queerworld in type. Little wonder he should always obey the wander-bidding.They passed a place where the head of the clan, having dined, had beenovertaken with lethargy and in a hammock on his porch was asleep in apublic and noisy manner."Small-town stuff!" murmured Dave, amiably contemptuous.The Wilbur twin could never understand why his father called Newbern asmall town. They came to the end of Fair Street, where the white housesdwindled into open country. The road led away from the river and climbedthe gentle slope of West Hill. The Wilbur twin had climbed that slopethe day before under auspices that he now recalled with disgust. Beyond,at the top of the hill, its chimneys lifted above the trees and its redwalls showing warmly through the cool green of its shading foliage, wasthe Whipple New Place. To the left, across the western end of the littletown and capping another hill, was the Whipple Old Place, where dweltSharon Whipple and his daughter, Juliana. The walls of the Whipple OldPlace were more weathered, of a duller red. The two places looked downupon the town quite as castles of old looked down upon theirfeudatories."I was right inside that house yesterday," said the Wilbur twin,pointing to the Whipple New Place and boasting a little--he would nothave to reveal the dreadful details of his entry. "Right inside of it,"he added to make sure that his father would get all his importance. Butthe father seemed not enough impressed."You'll probably go into better houses than that some day," he merelysaid, and added: "You learn a good trade like mine and you can always goanywhere; always make your good money and be more independent thanWhipples or even kings in their palaces. Remember that, Sputterboy.""Yes, sir," said Wilbur.His father never addressed the Merle twin by any but his rightful name,nor did he ever address the other by the one the dead mother had affixedto him, miscalling him by a number of titles, among which wereSputterboy, Gig, Doctor, and Bill.Before ascending quite to the Whipple New Place they left the dusty roadfor a path that led over a lawnlike stretch of upland, starred withbuttercups and tiny anemones, and inhabited by a colony of gophers thatinstantly engaged Frank, the dog, now free of his leash, in futiledashes. They stood erect, with languidly drooped paws, until he was toonear; then they were inexplicably not there. Frank at length divinedthat they unfairly achieved these disappearances by descending intocaverns beneath the surface of the earth. At first, with frantic clawsand eager squeals, he tore at the entrances to these until the preyappeared at exits farther on, only to repeat the disappearance whendashed at. Frank presently saw the chase to be hopeless. It was no gooddigging for something that wouldn't be there."There's life for you, Doctor," said Dave Cowan. "Life has to live onlife, humans same as dogs. Life is something that keeps tearing itselfdown and building itself up again; everybody killing something else andeating it. Do you understand that?""Yes, sir," said Wilbur, believing he did. Dogs killed gophers if theycaught them, and human beings killed chickens for Sunday dinners."Humans are the best killers of all," said Dave. "That's the reasonthey came up from monkeys, and got civilized so they wear neckties andhave religion and post offices and all such.""Yes, sir," said Wilbur.They climbed to a green height and reclined on the cool sward in theshade of a beech tree. Here they could pick out the winding of the quicklittle river between its green banks far below, and look across theroofs of slumbrous Newbern. The Wilbur twin could almost pick out thePenniman house. Then he looked up, and low in the sky he surprisinglybeheld the moon, an orb of pale bronze dulled from its night shine.Never before had he seen the moon by day. He had supposed it was in thesky only at night. So his father lectured now on astronomy and thecosmos. It seemed that the moon was always there, or about there, alonesome old thing, because there was no life on it. Dave spokelearnedly, for his Sunday paper had devoted a page to something of thissort."Everything is electricity or something," said Dave, "and it cracklesand works on itself until it makes star dust, and it shakes thistogether till it makes lumps, and they float round, and pretty soonthey're big lumps like the moon and like this little ball of star dustwe're riding on--and there are millions of them out there all round andabout, some a million times bigger than this little one, and they allwhirl and whirl, the little ones whirling round the big ones and the bigones whirling round still bigger ones, dancing and swinging and goingoff to some place that no one knows anything about; and some are old andhave lost their people; and some are too young to have any people yet;but millions like this one have people, and on some they are a millionyears older than we are, and know everything that it'll take us amillion years to find out; but even they haven't begun to really knowanything--compared with what they don't know. They'll have to go onforever finding out things about what it all means. Do you understandthat, Bill?""Yes, sir," said Wilbur."Do you understand how people like us get on these whirling lumps?""Yes, sir," said Wilbur."How do they?""No, sir," said Wilbur."Well, it's simple enough. This star dust shakes together, and prettysoon some of it gets to be one chemical and some of it gets to beanother, like water and salt and lime and phosphorus and stuff likethat, and it gets together in little combinations and it makes littleanimals, so little you couldn't see them, and they get together and makebigger animals, and pretty soon they have brains and stomachs--and thereyou are. This electricity or something that shook the star dust togetherand made the chemicals, and shook the chemicals together and made theanimals--well, it's fierce stuff. It wants to find out all about itself.It keeps making animals with bigger brains all the time, so it canexamine itself and write books about itself--but the animals have to begood killers, or something else kills them. This electricity that makes'em don't care which kills which. It knows the best killer will have thebest brain in the long run; that's all it cares about. It's a goodsporty scheme, all right. Do you understand that, Doctor?""Yes, sir," said Wilbur."Everything's got a fair chance to kill; this power shows no favours toanything. If gophers could kill dogs it would rather have gophers; whenmicrobes kill us it will rather have microbes than people. It just wantsa winner and don't care a snap which it is.""Yes, sir.""Of course, now, you hear human people swell and brag and strut roundabout how they are different from the animals and have something theycall a soul that the animals haven't got, but that's just the naturalconceit of this electricity or something before it has found out muchabout itself. Not different from the animals, you ain't. This tree I'mleaning against is your second or third cousin. Only difference, youcan walk and talk and see. Understand?""Yes, sir," said Wilbur. "Couldn't we go up to the gypsy camp now?"Dave refilled the calabash pipe, lighted it, and held the match while itburned out."That fire came from the sun," he said. "We're only burning matchesourselves--burning with a little fire from the sun. Pretty soon itflickers out.""It's just over this next hill, and they got circus wagons and a firewhere they cook their dinners, right outdoors, and fighting roosters,and tell your fortune."Dave rose."Of course I don't say I know it all yet. There's a catch in it Ihaven't figured out. But I'm right as far as I've gone. You can't gowrong if you take the facts and stay by 'em and don't read books thatleave the facts to one side, like most books do.""Yes, sir," said Wilbur, "and they sleep inside their wagons and I wishwe had a wagon like that and drove round the country and lived in it.""All right," said his father. "Stir your stumps."They followed the path that led up over another little hill windingthrough clumps of hazel brush and a sparse growth of oak and beech. Fromthe summit of this they could see the gypsy camp below them, in an openglade by the roadside. It was as the Wilbur twin had said: there weregayly-painted wagons--houses on wheels--and a campfire and tetheredhorses and the lolling gypsies themselves. About the outskirts loafed adozen or so of the less socially eligible of Newbern. Above a fire atthe camp centre a kettle simmered on its pothook, being stirred at thismoment by a brown and aged crone in frivolous-patterned calico, who woregold hoops in her ears and bangles at her neck and bracelets of silveron her arms--bejewelled, indeed, most unbecomingly for a person of heryears.The Wilbur twin would have lingered on the edge of the glade with otherlocal visitors, a mere silent observer of this delightful life; he hadnot dreamed of being accepted as a social equal by such exalted beings.But his father stalked boldly through the outer ring of spectators tothe camp's centre and genially hailed the aged woman, who, on firstlooking up from her cookery, held out a withered palm for the silverthat should buy him secrets of his future.But Dave Cowan merely preened his beautiful yellow moustache at her andsaid, "How's business, Mother?" Whereupon she saw that Dave was not avillager to be wheedled by her patter. She recognized him, indeed, asbelonging like herself to the freemasonry of them that know men andcities, and she spoke to him as one human to another."Business been pretty rotten here," she said as she stirred the kettle'scontents. "Oh, we made two-three pretty good horse trades--nothing much.We go on to a bigger town to-morrow."A male gypsy in corduroy trousers and scarlet sash and calico shirt openon his brown throat came to the fire now, and the Wilbur twin admiringlynoted that his father greeted this rare being, too, as an equal. Thegypsy held beneath an arm a trim young gamecock feathered in rich brownsand reds, with a hint of black, and armed with needle-pointed spurs. Hestroked the neck of the bird and sat on his haunches with Dave beforethe fire to discuss affairs of the road; for he, too, divined at aglance that Dave was here but a gypsy transient, even though he spoke adifferent lingo.The Wilbur twin sat also on his haunches before the fire, and thrilledwith pride as his father spoke easily of distant strange cities that thegypsies also knew; cities of the North where summer found them, andcities of the South to which they fared in winter. He had always beenproud of his father, but never so proud as now, when he sat theretalking to real gypsies as if they were no greater than any one. He wasquite ashamed when the gypsies' dog, a gaunt, hungry-looking beast,narrowly escaped being eaten up by his own dog. But Frank, at the sheerverge of a deplorable offense, implicitly obeyed his master's commandand forbore to destroy the gypsy mongrel. Again he flopped to his backat the interested approach of the other dog, held four limp paws aloft,and simpered at the stranger.Other gypsies, male and female, came to the group about the fire, andlively chatter ensued, a continuous flashing of white teeth and shakingof golden ear hoops and rattling of silver bracelets. The Wilbur twinfondly noted that his father knew every city the gypsies knew, and eventold them the advantages of some to which they had not penetrated. Hegathered this much of the talk, though much was beyond him. He keptclose to his father's side when the latter took his leave of these newfriends. He wanted these people to realize that he belonged to theimportant strange gentleman who had for a moment come so knowingly amongthem.As they climbed out of the sheltering glade he was alive with a newdesign. Gypsies notoriously carried off desirable children; this wascommon knowledge in Newbern Center. So why wouldn't they carry off him,especially if he were right round there where they could find himeasily? He saw himself and his dog forcibly conveyed away with thecaravan--though he would not really resist--to a strange and charminglife beyond the very farthest hills. He did not confide this to hisfather, but he looked back often. They followed a path and were soon ona bare ridge above the camp.Dave Cowan was already talking of other things, seeming not to have beenever so little impressed with his reception by these wondrous people,but he had won a new measure of his son's respect. Wilbur would havelingered here where they could still observe through the lower trees thegroup about the campfire, but Dave Cowan seemed to have had enough ofgypsies for the moment, and sauntered on up the ridge, across an alderswale and out on a parklike space to rest against a fence that bounded apasture belonging to the Whipple New Place. Across this pasture, inwhich the fat sorrel pony grazed and from which it regarded them fromtime to time, there was another grove of beech and walnut and hickory,and beyond this dimly loomed the red bulk of the Whipple house andoutbuildings. There was a stile through the fence at the point wherethey reached it, and Dave Cowan idly lolled by this while the Wilburtwin sprawled in the scented grass at his feet. He well knew he shouldnot be on the ground in his Sunday clothes. On the other hand, if thegypsies stole him they would not be so fussy as Winona about hisclothes. None of them seemed to have Sunday clothes.He again broached the suggestion about a gypsy wagon for himself and hisfather--and Frank, the dog--in which they could go far away, seeing allthose strange cities and cooking their dinner over campfires. His fatherseemed to consider this not wholly impracticable, but there were certaindisadvantages of the life, and there were really better ways. It seemsyou could be a gypsy in all essentials, and still live in houses likeless adventurous people."Trouble with them, they got no trade," said the wise Dave, "and out inall kinds of weather, and small-town constables telling them to move on,and all such. You learn a good loose trade, then you can go where youwant to." A loose trade seemed to be one that you could work at anyplace; they always wanted you if you knew a loose trade like theprinter's--or, "Now you take barbering," said Dave. "There's a goodloose trade. A barber never has to look for work; he can go into any newtown and always find his job. I don't know but what I'd just as soon bea barber as a printer. Some ways I might like it better. You don't haveas much time to yourself, of course, but you meet a lot of men youwouldn't meet otherwise; most of 'em fools to be sure, but some of 'emwise that you can get new thoughts from. It's a cleaner trade thantypesetting and fussing round a small-town print shop. Maybe you'lllearn to be a good barber; then you can have just as good a time asthose gypsies, going about from time to time and seeing the world.""Yes, sir," said the Wilbur twin, "and cutting people's hair withclippers like Don Paley clipped mine with.""New York, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Omaha, Kansas City, Denver, SanAntone," murmured Dave, and there was unction in his tone as he recitedthese advantages of a loose trade--"any place you like the looks of, orplaces you've read about that sound good--just going along with yourlittle kit of razors, and not having to small-town it except when youwant a bit of quiet."They heard voices back of them. Dave turned about and Wilbur rose fromthe grass. Across the pasture came the girl, Patricia Whipple, followedat a little distance by Juliana. The latter was no longer in churchgarb, but in a gray tweed skirt, white blouse, and a soft straw hat witha flopping brim. There was a black ribbon about the hat and her stoutshoes were of tan leather. The girl was bare-headed, and Don Paley'srepair of yesterday's damage was noticeable. She came at a quickeningpace, while Juliana followed slowly. Juliana looked severe andformidable. Never had her nose looked more the Whipple nose then whenshe observed Dave Cowan and his son at the stile. Yet she smiledhumorously when she recognized the boy, and allowed the humour to reachhis father when she glanced at him. Dave and Miss Juliana had never beenformally presented. Dave had seen Juliana, but Juliana had had untilthis moment no sight of Dave, for though there was in Newbern no socialprejudice against a craftsman, and Dave might have moved in its highestcircles, he had chosen to consort with the frankly ineligible. He liftedhis cap in a flourishing salute as Juliana and Patricia came through thestile."And how are you to-day, my young friend?" asked Juliana of Wilbur inher calm, deep voice.The Wilbur twin said, "Very well, I thank you," striving instinctivelyto make his own voice as deep as Juliana's.The girl winked at him brazenly as they passed on."Gypsies!" she called, exultantly, and Juliana swept him with a tolerantsmile.Dave Cowan watched them along the path to the ridge above the camp. Herethey paused in most intelligible pantomime. Patricia Whipple wished todescend to the very heart of the camp, while Juliana could be seeninforming the child that they were near enough. To make this definiteshe sat upon the bole of a felled oak beside the path while Patriciajiggled up and down in eloquent objection to the untimely halt. Daveread the scene and caressed his thick moustache with practiced thumb andfinger. His glance was sympathetic."The poor old maid!" he murmured. "All that Whipple money, and she hasto be just a small-towner! Say, I bet no one has ever kissed that oldgirl since her mother died! None of these small-town hicks would everhave the nerve to. Yes, sir; any one's got a right to be sorry for thatdame. If she had a little enterprise she'd branch out from here and meeta few people.""Yes, sir," said Wilbur. "But that girl wants to go down to the camp."This was plain. Patricia still danced, while Juliana remained firmlyseated."I could go take her down," he continued."Why don't you?" said his father, again stroking the golden moustache insympathy for the unconscious Juliana.So it befell that the Wilbur twin shyly approached the group by thefelled tree, and the watching father saw the two children, after amoment's hesitancy on the part of Juliana, disappear from view over thecrest of the ridge. Dave continued to loll by the stile and to watch thewaiting Juliana, thinking of gypsies and the pure joy of wandering. Hebegan to repeat some verses he had lately happened upon, murmuring themto a little mass of white clouds far off against the blue of the summersky, where the pale bronze moon lonesomely hung. He liked the words andthe moon and gypsies joyously foot-loose, and he again grew sympatheticfor Juliana's small-town plight. He felt a large pagan tolerance forthose warped souls pent in small towns.After twenty minutes of this he faintly heard a call from Juliana, sentafter the children below her. He saw her stand to beckon commandinglyand watch to see if she were obeyed. Then she turned and came slowlyback up the path that would lead to the stile. Again Dave absentlymurmured his verses. Juliana approached the stile, walking briskly now.She was halted by surprising speech from this rather cheaply debonaircreature who looked so nearly like a gentleman and yet so plainly wasnot."Wanted to be off with 'em, didn't you?" Dave was saying brightly; "offand over the edge of the world, all foot-loose and free as wind, goingover strange roads and lying by night under the stars.""What?" demanded Juliana sharply.She studied the fellow's face for the first time. He was preening hisyellow moustache and flashing a challenge to her from half-shut eyes."Small-towners bound to feel it," he continued, unconscious of anysharpness in Juliana's "What!" "They want to be off and over the edge ofthings, but they don't dare--haven't the nerve. You'd like to, but youdon't dare. You know you don't!"Juliana almost smiled. The fellow's face, as she paused beside him atthe stile, was set with sheer impudence, yet this was not whollyunattractive. And amazingly he now broke into verse:    We, too, shall steal upon the spring      With amber sails flown wide;    Shall drop, some day, behind the moon,      Borne on a star-blue tide.He indicated the present moon with flourishing grace as he named it.Juliana did not gasp, but it might have been a gasp in one less than aWhipple. But the troubadour was not to be daunted. Juliana didn't knowDave Cowan as cities knew him.    Enchanted ports we, too, shall touch;      Cadiz or Cameroon;    Nor other pilot need beside      A magic wisp of moon.Again he gracefully indicated our lunar satellite, and again Juliananearly gasped."Of course, you felt it all, watching those people. I don't blame youfor feeling wild."Juliana lifted one of her stout tan boots toward the stile, and Davewith doffed cap extended a hand to assist her through. Juliana, dazedbeyond a Whipple calm for almost the first time in her thirty years,found her own hand perforce upon his."You poor thing!" concluded Dave with a swift glance to the ridge wherethe children had not yet appeared.Then amazingly he enfolded the figure of the woman in his arms and uponher cold, appalled lips he imprinted a swift but accurate kiss."There, poor thing!" he murmured.He lavished one look upon the still frozen Juliana, replaced the capupon his yellow hair, once more preened his moustache at her, and turnedaway to meet the oncoming children. And in his glance Juliana retainedstill the wit to read a gay, cherishing pity. As he turned away she sanklimply against the fence, her first sensation being all of wonder thatshe had not cried out at this monstrous assault. And very clearly sheknew at once that she had not cried out or made any protest because,though monstrous, it was even more absurd. A seasoned sense of humourhad not failed.The guilty man swaggered on to meet the children, not looking back. Forhim the incident was closed. Juliana, a hand supporting her capablechin, steadily regarded his swaying shoulders and the yellow hairbeneath his cap. In her nostrils was the scent of printer's ink and pipetobacco. She reflectively rubbed her chin, for it had been stung with aday-old beard that pricked like a nettle. Now she was recalling anotherwoodland adventure of a dozen years before here in this same forest.Dave Cowan had been wrong when he said that no one had kissed her sinceher mother died. Once on a winter's day, when she was sixteen, she hadcrossed here, bundled in a red cloak and hood, and a woodchopper, amerry, laughing foreigner who spoke no English, had hailed her gayly,and she had stopped and gayly tried to understand him, and knew onlythat he was telling her she was beautiful. She at least had thought itwas that, and was certain of it when he had seized and kissed her,laughing joyously the while. She had not told any one of that, but shehad never forgotten. And now this curious creature, whom she had notsupposed to be gallantly inclined--unshaven, smelling of printer's inkand tobacco!"I'm coming on!" said Juliana aloud, and laughed rather grimly.She watched her prankling blade meet the children and go off down theridge with his son, still not looking back. She thought it queer he didnot look back at her just once. She soothed her chin again, sniffing theair.Patricia Whipple came leaping up the path, excited with an imminentquestion. She halted before the still-reflective Juliana and went atonce to the root of her matter."Cousin Juliana, what did that funny man kiss you for?"This time Juliana in truth did gasp. There was no suppressing it."Patricia Whipple--and did that boy see it, too?""No, he was too far behind me. But I did. I saw it. I was looking rightat you, and that funny man--all at once he grabbed you round your waistand he--""Patricia, dear, listen! We must promise never to say anything aboutit--never to anybody in the world--won't we, dear?""Oh, I won't tell if you don't want me to, but what----""You promise me--never to tell a soul!""Of course! I promise--cross my heart and hope to die--but what did hedo it for?"Juliana tried humorous evasion."Men, my dear, are often tempted by women to such lengths--temptedbeyond their strength. Your question isn't worded with all the tact inthe world. Is it so strange that a man should want to kiss me?""Well, I don't know"--Patricia became judicial, scanning the now flushedcountenance of Juliana--"I don't see why not. But what did he do itfor?""My dear, you'll be honest with me, and never tell; so I'll be honestwith you. I don't know--I really don't know. But I have an awfulsuspicion that the creature meant to be kind to me.""He looks like a kind man. And he's the father of the boy that I worehis clothes yesterday when I was running away, and the father of thatother boy that was with him and that I'm going to have one of for myvery own brother, because Harvey D. and grandpa said something of thatkind would have to be done, so what relation will that make us to thisman that was so kind to you?""None whatever," said Juliana, shortly. "And never forget your promisenot to tell. Come, we must go back."They went on through the pasture. The shadows had lengthened and themoon already glowed a warmer bronze. Juliana glanced at it and murmuredindistinctly."What is it?" asked Patricia."Nothing," said Juliana. But she had been asking herself: "I wonderwhere he gets his verses?"Her hand went again to her chin.CHAPTER VDave Cowan went down the ridge to the road, disregarding his gypsyfriends. He trod the earth with a ruffling bravado. The Wilbur twinlingered as far behind as he dared, loitering provocatively in the sightof the child stealers. If they meant to do anything about it now wastheir chance. But no violence was offered him, and presently, far beyondthe camp where the fire still burned, he was forced to conclude thatthey could not mean to carry him off. Certainly they were neglecting aprize who had persistently flaunted himself at them. They notably lackedenterprise.Down over the grassy slope of West Hill they went, the boy still well inthe rear; you never could tell what might happen; and so came to FairStreet across shadows that lay long to the east. Newbern was stillslumberous. Smoke issued from a chimney here and there, but mostly thetown would partake of a cold supper. The boy came beside his father,with Frank, the dog, again on his leash of frayed rope. Dave Cowan wasreciting to himself:    Enchanted ports we, too, shall touch;    Cadiz or Cameroon--Then he became conscious of the silent boy at his side, steppingnoiselessly with bare feet."Life is funny," said Dave."Yes, sir," said Wilbur."Of course there's a catch in it somewhere.""Yes, sir.""That old girl back there, that old maid, she'll have to small-town itall her life. I feel sorry for her, I do.""Yes, sir."But the sorrowing father now began to whistle cheerfully. His grief hadnot overborne him. A man who would call Judge Penniman Old Flapdoodleand question the worth of Matthew Arnold's acquaintance was not to belong downcast at the plight of one woman. And he had done what man couldfor her.They came to River Street, the street of shops, deserted and sleepingback of drawn curtains. Only the shop of Solly Gumble seemed to be openfor trade. This was but seeming, however, for another establishment nearby, though sealed and curtained as to front, suffered its rear portal toyawn most hospitably. This was the place of business of HermanVielhaber, and its street sign concisely said, "Lager Bier Saloon."Dave Cowan turned into the alley just beyond Solly Gumble's, then upanother alley that led back of the closed shops, and so came to the backdoor of this refectory. It stood open, and from the cool and shadowyinterior came a sourish smell of malt liquors and the hum of voices.They entered and were in Herman Vielhaber's pleasant back room, withsanded floor and a few round tables, at which sat half a dozen menconsuming beer from stone mugs or the pale wine of Herman's country fromtall glasses.Herman was a law-abiding citizen. Out of deference to a sacred andlong-established American custom he sealed the front of his saloon onthe Sabbath; out of deference to another American custom, equally longestablished, equally sacred, he received his Sabbath clientele at therear--except for a brief morning interval when he and Minna, his wife,attended service at the Lutheran church. Herman's perhaps not too subtlemind had never solved this problem of American morals--why his beveragesshould be seemly to drink on all days of the week, yet on one of themseemly but if taken behind shut doors and shielding curtains. But headhered conscientiously to the American rule. His Lutheran pastor hadonce, in an effort to clear up the puzzle, explained to him that theContinental Sunday would never do at all in this land of his choice; butit left Herman still muddled, because fixed unalterably in his mind wasa conviction that the Continental Sunday was the best of all Sundays.Nor was there anything the least clandestine in this backdoor trade ofHerman's on the Sabbath. One had but to know the path to his door, andat this moment Newbern's mayor, old Doctor Purdy, sat at one of Herman'stables and sipped from a stone mug of beer and played a game of pinochlewith stout, red-bearded Herman himself, overlooked by Minna, who hadbrought them their drink.This was another thing about Herman's place that Newbern understood intime. When he had begun business some dozen years before, and it wasknown that Minna came downstairs from their living rooms above thesaloon and helped to serve his patrons, the scandal was high. It wassupposed that only a woman without character could, for any purposewhatever, enter a saloon. But Herman had made it plain that into thesort of saloon he conducted any woman, however exalted, could freelyenter. If they chose not to, that was their affair. And Minna had intime recovered a reputation so nearly lost at first news of her servicehere.Herman, indeed, ran a place of distinction, or at least of tone. He didsell the stronger drinks, it is true, but he sold them judiciously, andmuch preferred to sell the milder ones. He knew his patrons, and wouldstubbornly not sell drink, even beer or wine, to one he suspected ofabusing the stuff. As for rowdyism, it was known far and wide aboutNewbern that if you wanted to get thrown out of Herman's quick you hadonly to start some rough stuff, or even talk raw. It was said he juggledyou out the door like you were an empty beer keg. Down by the riversidewas another saloon for that sort of thing, kept by Pegleg McCarron, whowould sell whisky to any one that could buy, liked rough stuff and withhis crutch would participate in it.When Herman decided that a customer was spending too much money fordrink, that customer had to go to Pegleg's if he bought more. And nowthe mayor at the little table connived at a flagrant breach of the lawhe had sworn to uphold, quaffing beer from his mug and melding a hundredaces as casually as if it were a week-day.The other men at the little tables were also of the substantialcitizenry of Newbern, including the postmaster, the editor of the_Advance_, and Rapp, Senior, of Rapp Brothers, Jewellery. The last twowere arguing politics and the country's welfare. Rapp, Senior, believedand said that the country was going to the dogs, because the rich weregetting richer and the poor were getting poorer. The editor of the_Advance_ disputed this, and the postmaster intervened to ask if Rapp,Senior, had seen what our exports of wheat and cotton were lately. Rapp,Senior, said he didn't care anything about that--it was the interests hewas down on. Herman Vielhaber, melding eighty kings, said it was a goodrich-man's country, but also a good poor-man's country, because wherecould you find one half as good--not in all Europe--and he now laid downforty jacks, which he huskily called "yacks."Dave Cowan greeted the company and seated himself at a vacant table."Pull up a chair, Buzzer, and we'll drink to the life force--oldelectricity or something.""Yes, sir," said Wilbur, and seated himself.Minna left the pinochle game to attend upon them. She was plump andpink-faced, with thick yellow hair neatly done. A broad white apronprotected her dress of light blue."A stein of Pilsener, Minna," said Dave, "and for the boy, let's see.How would you like, a nice cold bottle of pop, Doctor?""Yes, sir," said Wilbur. "Strawberry pop."Herman looked up from his game, though in the midst of warm utterance inhis native tongue at the immediate perverse fall of the cards."I guess you git the young one a big glass milk, mamma--yes? Better thanpop for young ones. Pop is belly wash.""Yes, ma'am," said Wilbur to Minna, though he would have preferred thepop by reason of its colour and its vivacious prickling; and you couldhave milk at home."And I tell you, Minna," said Dave. "Bread and butter and cheese, lotsof it, rye bread and pumpernickel and Schweitzerkase and some picklesand radishes, _nicht wahr_?""Yes," said Minna, "all!" and moved on to the bar. But Dave detainedher."Minna!"She stopped and turned back to him."You will?""_Sprechen sie Deutsch_, Minna?""_Ja_--yes--why not? I should think I do. I always could. Why couldn'tI?"She went on her mission, grumbling pettishly. Why shouldn't she speakher own language? What did the man think? He must be a joker!"Mamma!" Herman called again. "Git also the young one some that _apfelkuchen_. You make it awful good.""Yes," called Minna from the bar. "I git it. For why wouldn't I speak myown language, I like to know?"Dave Cowan's jest was smouldering faintly within her. She returnedpresently with the stein of beer and a glass of milk, and went, stillmuttering, for the food that had been commanded. She returned with this,setting bread and butter and cheese before them, and a blue plate whoseextensive area was all but covered with apple cake, but now she nolonger muttered in bewilderment. She confronted the jester, hands uponhips, her doll eyes shining with triumph."Hah! Now, mister, I ask you something good like you ask me. You gitready! _Sprechen sie English_?"Dave Cowan affected to be overcome with confusion, while Minna laughedloud and long at her sally. Herman laughed with her, his head back andhuge red beard lifted from his chest."She got you that time, mister!" he called to Dave. "Mamma's a brightone, give her a minute so she gits herself on the spot!""_Ja! Sprechen sie English_?" taunted Minna again, for a second relishof her repartee. Effusively, in her triumph, she patted the cheek of theWilbur twin. "_Ja_! I could easy enough give your poppa as good like hesent, yes? _Sprechen sie English, nicht wahr_?"Again her bulk trembled with honest mirth, and while this endured shewent to the ice box and brought a bone for Frank, the dog. Frank fellupon it with noisy gurgles.Dave Cowan affected further confusion at each repetition of Minna'sstinging retort; acted it so convincingly that the victor at lengthrelented and brought a plate of cookies to the table."I show you who is it should be foolish in the head!" she told himtriumphantly."You got me, Minna--I admit it."The victim pretended to be downcast, and ate his bread and cheesedejectedly. Minna went to another table to tell over the choice bit.The Wilbur twin ate bread and cheese and looked with interest about theroom. The tables and woodwork were dark, the walls and ceiling also lowin tone. But there were some fine decorative notes that stood brightlyout. On one wall was a lovely gold-framed picture in which a young womanof great beauty held back a sumptuous curtain revealing a castle on theRhine set above a sunny terrace of grapevines. On the opposite wall wasa richly coloured picture of a superb brewery. It was many stories inheight; smoke issued from its chimneys, and before it stood a largetruck to which were hitched two splendid horses. The truck was beingloaded with the brewery's enlivening product. The brewery was red, thetruck yellow, the horses gray, and the workmen were clad in blue, andabove all was a flawless sky of blue. It was a spirited picture, and theWilbur twin was instantly enamoured of it. He wished he might have seenthis yesterday, when he was rich. Maybe Mr. Vielhaber would have soldit. He thought regretfully of Winona's delight at receiving thebeautiful thing to hang on the wall of the parlour, a fit companionpiece to the lion picture. But he had spent his money, and this lovelything could never be Winona's.Discussion of world affairs still went forward between Rapp, Senior, andthe _Advance_ editor. Even in that day the cost of living was said to beexcessive, and Rapp, Senior, though accounting for its rise by theiniquity of the interests, submitted that the cost of women's finery waswhat kept the world poor."It's women's tomfool dressing keeps us all down. Look what they pay fortheir silks and satins and kickshaws and silly furbelows! That's wherethe bulk of our money goes: bonnets and high-heeled slippers and fancycloaks. Take the money spent for women's foolish truck and see whatyou'd have!" Rapp, Senior, gazed about him, looking for contradiction."He's right," said Dave Cowan. "He's got the truth of it. But, my Lord!Did you ever think what women would be without all that stuff? Look whatit does for 'em! Would you have 'em look like us? Would you have abeautiful woman wear a cheap suit of clothes like Rapp's got on, and ahat bought two years ago? Not in a thousand years! We dress 'em up thatway because we like 'em that way."Rapp, Senior, dusted the lapel of his coat, tugged at his waistcoat tostraighten it, and closely regarded a hat that he had supposed beyondcriticism."That's all right," he said, "but look where it gets us!"Presently the discussion ended--Rapp, Senior, still on the note ofpessimism and in the fell clutch of the interests--for the debaters mustgo blamelessly home to their suppers. Only the mayor remained at hisgame with Herman, his gray, shaven old face bent above his cards whilehe muttered at them resentfully. Dave Cowan ate his bread and cheesewith relish and invoked another stein of beer from Minna, whovindictively flung her jest at him again as she brought it.The Wilbur twin had eaten his apple cake and was now eating the cookies,taking care to drop no crumbs on the sanded floor. After many cookiesdusk fell and he heard the church bells ring for evening worship. But noone heeded them. The game drew to an excited finish, while Dave Cowan,his pipe lighted, mused absently and from time to time quoted bits ofverse softly to himself:    Enchanted ports we, too, shall touch;    Cadiz or Cameroon--The game ended with an explosion of rage from the mayor. The cards hadcontinued perverse for him. He pushed his soft black hat back from hisrumpled crest of gray hair and commanded Minna Vielhaber to break amunicipal ordinance which had received his official sanction. Hermancheerily combed his red beard and scoffed at his late opponent."It makes dark," Minna reminded him. "You should have light."Herman lighted two lamps suspended above the tables. Then he addressedthe Wilbur twin, now skillfully prolonging the last of his cookies."Well, young one, you like your bread and cheese and milk and cookiesand apfel kuchen, so? Well, I tell you--come here. I show you somethingfine."He went to the front room, where the bar was, and the Wilbur twinexpectantly followed. He had learned that these good people produced allmanner of delights. But this was nothing to eat. The light from thelamps shone over the partition between back room and front, and there ina spacious cage beside the wall was a monkey, a small, sad-eyed creaturewith an aged, wrinkled face all but human. He crouched in a corner andhad been piling wisps of straw upon his reverend head."Gee, gosh!" exclaimed the Wilbur twin, for he had expected nothing sorare as this.The monkey at sight of Herman became animated, leaping again and againthe length of the cage and thrusting between its bars a hairy forearmand a little, pinkish, human hand."You like him, hey?" said Herman."Gee, gosh!" again exclaimed the Wilbur twin in sheer delight."It's Emil his name is," said Herman. "You want out, Emil, hey?"He unclasped the catch of a door, and Emil leaped to the crook of hisarm, where he nestled, one hand securely grasping a fold of Herman'sbeard."Ouch, now, don't pull them whiskers!" warned Herman. "See how he knowshis good friend! But he shake hands like a gentleman. Emil, shake handsnicely with this young one." The monkey timidly extended a paw and theentranced Wilbur shook it. "Come," said Herman. "I let you give himsomething."They went to the back room, Emil still stoutly grasping the beard of hisprotector."Now," said Herman, "you give him a nice fat banana. Mamma, give theyoung one a banana to give to Emil."The banana was brought and the Wilbur twin cautiously extended it. Emil,at sight of the fruit, chattered madly and tried to leap for it. Heappeared to believe that this strange being meant to deprive him of it.He snatched it when it was thrust nearer, still regarding the boy withdark suspicion. Then he deftly peeled the fruit and hurriedly ate it, asif one could not be--with strangers about--too sure of one's supper.The monkey moved Dave Cowan to lecture again upon the mysteries oforganic evolution."About three hundred million years difference between those two," hesaid, indicating Herman and his pet with a wave of the calabash. "Andit's no good asking whether it's worth while, because we have to go onand on. That little beast is your second cousin, Herman.""I got a Cousin Emil in the old country," said Minna, "but he ain'tlookin' like this last time I seen him. I guess you're foolish in thehead again.""He came out of the forest and learned to stand up, to walk withoutusing his hands, and he got a thumb, and pretty soon he was able to be asmall-town mayor or run a nice decent saloon and argue about politics.""Hah, that's a good one!" said Herman. "You hear what he says, Emil?"The beast looked up from his banana, regarding them from eyesunutterably sad."See?" said Dave. "That's the life force, and for a minute it'sconscious that it's only a monkey."They became silent under Emil's gaze of acute pathos--human life awareof its present frustration. Then suddenly Emil became once more ananimated and hungry monkey with no care but for his food."There," said Dave. "I ask you, isn't that the way we do? Don't we stopto think sometimes and get way down, and then don't we feel hungry andforget it all and go to eating?""Sure, Emil is sensible just like us," said Minna."But there's some catch about the whole thing," said Dave. "Say, Doc,what do you think life is, anyway?"Purdy scanned the monkey with shrewd eyes, and grinned."I only know what it is physiologically," he said. "Physiologically,life is a constant force rhythmically overcoming a constant resistance.""Pretty good," said Dave, treasuring the phrase. "The catch must beright there--it always does overcome the constant resistance.""When it can't in one plant," said Purdy, "it dismantles it and buildsanother, making improvements from time to time.""Think what it's had to do," said Dave, "to build Herman from a simple,unimproved plant like Emil! Herman's a great improvement on Emil.""My Herman has got a soul," said Minna, stoutly--"monkeys ain't."Dave Cowan and Purdy exchanged a tolerant smile. They were above arguingthat outworn thesis. Dave turned to his son."Anyway, Buzzer, if you ever get discouraged, remember we were all likethat once, and cheer up. Remember your ancestry goes straight back toone of those, and still back of that--""To the single cell of protoplasm," said Purdy."Beyond that," said Dave, "to star dust.""Yes, sir," said Wilbur."Foolish in the head," said Minna. "You think you know things betterthan the reverent what preaches at the Lutheran church! He could easyenough tell you what you come from. My family was in Bavaria more thantwo hundred years, and was not any monkeys.""Maybe Emil he got a soul, too, like a human," remarked Herman."You bet he has," said Dave Cowan, firmly--"just like a human.""You put him to bed," directed Minna. "He listen to such talk and gofoolish also in the head."The Wilbur twin watched Emil put to bed, then followed his father outinto the quiet, starlit streets. He was living over again an eventfulafternoon. They reached the Penniman porch without further talk. DaveCowan sat with his guitar in the judge's chair and lazily sounded chordsand little fragments of melody. After a time the Pennimans and the Merletwin came from church. The Wilbur twin excitedly sought Winona, havingmuch to tell her. He drew her beside him into the hammock, and was tooeager for more than a moment's dismay when she discovered his bare feet,though he had meant to put on shoes and stockings again before she sawhim."Barefooted on Sunday!" said Winona in tones of prim horror."It was so hot," he pleaded; "but listen," and he rushed headlong intohis narrative.His father knew gypsies, and had been to Chicago and Omaha and--andCadiz and Cameroon--and he was sorry for Miss Juliana Whipple becauseshe was a small-towner and no one had ever kissed her since her motherdied; and if ever gypsies did carry him off he didn't want any one toworry about him or try to get him back; and the Vielhabers were verynice people that kept a nice saloon; and Mrs. Vielhaber had given himlots of apple cake that was almost like an apple pie, but without anytop on it; and they had a lovely picture that would look well beside thelion picture, but it would probably cost too much money; and they had amonkey, a German monkey, that was just like a little old man; and once,thousands of years ago, when the Bible was going on, we were all monkeysand lived in trees, but a constant force made us stand and walk likepeople.To Winona this was a shocking narrative, and she wished to tell DaveCowan that he was having a wretched influence upon the boy, but Dave wasnow singing "In the Gloaming," and she knew he would merely call herMadame la Marquise, the toast of all the court, or something elseunsuitable to a Sabbath evening. She tried to convey to the Wilbur twinthat sitting in a low drinking saloon at any time was an evil thing."Anyway," said he, protestingly, "you say I should always learnsomething, and I learned about us coming up from the monkeys.""Why, Wilbur Cowan! How awful! Have you forgotten everything you everlearned at Sunday-school?""But I saw the monkey," he persisted, "and my father said so, and DoctorPurdy said so."Winona considered."Even so," she warned him, "even if we did come up from the lowerorders, the less said about it the better."He had regarded his putative descent without prejudice; he was sorrythat Winona should find scandal in it."Well," he remarked to relieve her, "anyway, there's some catch in it.My father said so."CHAPTER VIWilber Cowan went off to bed, only a little concerned by this new-foundflaw in his ancestry. He would have thought it more important could hehave known that this same Cowan ancestry was under analysis at theWhipple New Place.There the three existing male Whipples sat about a long,magazine-littered table in the library and smoked and thought and atlong intervals favoured one another with fragmentary speech. Gideon saterect in his chair or stood before the fireplace, now banked with ferns;black-clad, tall and thin and straight in the comely pleasance of hissixty years, his face smoothly shaven, his cheekbones jutting abovedepressed cheeks that fell to his narrow, pointed chin, his blue eyescrackling far under the brow, high and narrow and shaded with rufflinggray hair, still plenteous. His ordinary aspect was severe, almostsaturnine; but he was wont to destroy this effect with his thin-lippedsmile that broke winningly over small white teeth and surprisinglyhinted an alert young man behind these flickering shadows of age. Whenhe sat he sat gracefully erect; when he stood to face the other two, orpaced the length of the table, he stood straight or moved with supplejoints. He was smoking a cigar with fastidious relish, and seemed tocommune more with it than with his son or his brother. Beside SharonWhipple his dress seemed foppish.Sharon, the round, stout man, two years younger than Gideon, had thesame blue eyes, but they looked from a face plump, florid, vivacious.There was a hint of the choleric in his glance. His hair had beenlighter than Gideon's, and though now not so plentiful, had grayed lessnoticeably. His fairer skin was bedizened with freckles; and when witha blunt thumb he pushed up the outer ends of his heavy eye-brows orcocked the thumb at a speaker whose views he did not share, it could beseen that he was the most aggressive of the three men. Sharonnotoriously lost his temper. Gideon had never been known to lose his.Sharon smoked and lolled carelessly in a Morris chair, one short, stoutarm laid along its side, the other carelessly wielding the cigar,heedless of falling ashes. Beside the careful Gideon he looked rustic.Harvey D., son of Gideon, worriedly paced the length of the room. Hiseyes were large behind thick glasses. He smoked a cigarette gingerly,not inhaling its smoke, but ridding himself of it in little puffs ofdistaste. His brown beard was neatly trimmed, and above it shone hisforehead, pale and beautifully modelled under the carefully parted,already thinning, hair that was arranged in something almost likeringlets on either side. He was neat-faced. Of the three men he carriedthe Whipple nose most gracefully. His figure was slight, not so tall ashis father's, and he was garbed in a more dapper fashion. He wore anexpertly fitted frock coat of black, gray trousers faintly striped, apearl-gray cravat skewered by a pear-headed pin, and his small feet wereincased in shoes of patent leather. He was arrayed as befitted a Whipplewho had become a banker.Gideon, his father, achieved something of a dapper effect in anold-fashioned manner, but no observer would have read him for a banker;while Sharon, even on a Sunday evening, in loose tweeds and stout boots,was but a country gentleman who thought little about dress, so that onewould not have guessed him a banker--rather the sort that makes bankinga career of profit.Careful Harvey D., holding a cigarette carefully between slender whitefingers, dressed with studious attention, neatly bearded, with shininghair curled flatly above his pale, wide forehead, was the one to lookout from behind a grille and appraise credits. He never acted hastily,and was finding more worry in this moment than ever his years of bankinghad cost him. He walked now to an ash tray and fastidiously trimmed theend of his cigarette. With the look of worry he regarded his father, nowbefore the fireplace after the manner of one enjoying its warmth, andhis Uncle Sharon, who was brushing cigar ash from his rumpled waistcoatto the rug below."It's no light thing to do," said Harvey D. in his precise syllables.The others smoked as if unhearing. Harvey D. walked to the opposite walland straightened a picture, The Reading of Homer, shifting its frameprecisely one half an inch."It is overchancy." This from Gideon after a long silence.Harvey D. paused in his walk, regarded the floor in front of himcritically, and stooped to pick up a tiny scrap of paper, which hebrought to the table and laid ceremoniously in the ash tray."Overchancy," he repeated."Everything overchancy," said Sharon Whipple after another silence,waving his cigar largely at life. "She's a self-headed little tike," headded a moment later."Self-headed!"Harvey D. here made loose-wristed gestures meaning despair, after whichhe detected and put in its proper place a burned match beside Sharon'schair."A bright boy enough!" said Gideon after another silence, during whichHarvey D. had twice paced the length of the room, taking care to bringeach of his patent-leather toes precisely across the repeated pattern inthe carpet."Other one got the gumption, though," said Sharon."Oh, gumption!" said Harvey D., as if this were no rare gift. All threesmoked again for a pregnant interval."Has good points," offered Gideon. "Got all the points, in fact. Goodbuild, good skin, good teeth, good eyes and wide between; nice manners,polite, lively mind.""Other one got the gumption," mumbled Sharon, stubbornly. They ignoredhim."Head on him for affairs, too," said Harvey D. He went to a far cornerof the room and changed the position of an immense upholstered chair sothat it was equidistant from each wall. "Other one--hear he took all hissilver and spent it foolishly--must have been eight or ninedollars--this one wanted to save it. Got some idea about the value ofmoney.""Don't like to see it show too young," submitted Sharon."Can't show too young," declared Harvey D."Can't it?" asked Sharon, mildly."Bright little chap--no denying that," said Gideon. "Bright as a newpenny, smart as a whip. Talks right. Other chap mumbles.""Got the gumption, though." Thus Sharon once more.Long silences intervened after each speech in this dialogue."Head's good," said Harvey D. "One of those long heads like father's.Other one's head is round.""My own head is round." This was Sharon. His tone was plaintive."Of course neither of them has a nose," said Gideon.He meant that neither of the twins had a nose in the Whipple sense, butno comment on this lack seemed to be required. It would be unfair toexpect a true nose in any but born Whipples.Gideon Whipple from before the fireplace swayed forward on his toes andwaved his half-smoked cigar."The long and short of it is--the Whipple stock has run low. We're dyingout.""Got to have new blood, that's sure," said Sharon. "Build it up again.""I'd often thought of adopting," said Harvey D., "in the last twoyears," he carefully added."This youngster," said Gideon; "of course we should never have heard ofhim but for Pat's mad adventure, starting off with God only knows whatvisions in her little head.""She'd have gone, too," said Sharon, dusting ashes from his waistcoat tothe rug. "Self-headed!""She demands a brother," resumed Gideon, "and the family sorely needsshe should have one, and this youngster seems eligible, and so--" Hewaved his cigar."There really doesn't seem any other way," said Harvey D. at the table,putting a disordered pile of magazines into neat alignment."What about pedigree?" demanded Sharon. "Any one traced him back?""I believe _his_ father is here," said Harvey D."I know him," said Sharon. "A mad, swearing, confident fellow, reckless,vagrant-like. A printer by trade. Looks healthy enough. Don't seemblemished. But what about his father?""Is the boy's mother known?" asked Harvey D."Easy to find out," said Gideon. "Ask Sarah Marwick," and he went to thewall and pushed a button. "Sarah knows the history of every one,scandalous and otherwise."Sarah Marwick came presently to the door, an austere spinster in blackgown and white apron. Her nose, though not Whipple in any degree, wasstill eminent in a way of its own, and her lips shut beneath it in astraight line. She waited."Sarah," said Gideon, "do you know a person named Cowan? David Cowan, Ibelieve it is."Sarah's mien of professional reserve melted."Do I know Dave Cowan?" she challenged. "Do I know him? I'd know hishide in a tanyard.""That would seem sufficient," remarked Gideon."A harum-scarum good-for-nothing--no harm in him. A great talker--makeyou think black is white if you listen. Don't stay here much--in andout, no one knows where to. Says the Center is slow. What do you thinkof that? I guess we're fast enough for most folks.""What about his father?" said the stock-breeding Sharon. "Know anythingabout who he was?""Lord, yes! Everybody round here used to know old Matthew Cowan. Livedup in Geneseo, where Dave was born, but used to come round herepreaching. Queer old customer with a big head. He wasn't a regularpreacher; he just took it up, being a carpenter by trade--like our LordJesus, he used to say in his preaching. He had some outlandish kind ofreligion that didn't take much. He said the world was coming to an endon a certain day, and folks had better prepare for it, but it didn't endwhen he said it would; and he went back to carpentering week-days andpreaching on the Lord's Day; and one time he fell off a roof and hit onhis head, and after that he was outlandisher than ever, and they had tolook after him. He never did get right again. They said he died writinga telegram to our Lord on the wall of his room. This Dave Cowan, heargued about religion with the Reverend Mallet right up in the postoffice one day. He'll argue about anything! He's audacious!""But the father was all right till he had the fall?" asked Harvey D. "Imean he was healthy and all that?""Oh, healthy enough--big, strong old codger. He used to say he couldcradle four acres of grain in a day when he was a boy on a farm, orsplit and lay up three hundred and fifty rails. Strong enough.""And this David Cowan, his son--he married someone from here?""Her that was Effie Freeman and her mother was a Penniman, cousin to oldJudge Penniman. A sweet, lovely little thing, Effie was, too, just asnice as you'd want to meet, and so--""Healthy?" demanded Sharon."Healthy enough till she had them twins. Always puny after that. Took toher bed and passed on when they was four. Dropped off the tree of lifelike an overfruited branch, you might say. Winona and Mis' Penniman beenmothers to the twins ever since.""The record seems to be fairly clear," said Gideon."If he hasn't inherited that queer streak for religion," said Harvey D.,foreseeing a possible inharmony with what Rapp, Senior, would havecalled the interests."Thank you, Sarah--we were just asking," said Gideon."You're welcome," said Sarah, withdrawing. She threw them a last bitover her shoulder. "That Dave Cowan's an awful reader--reads librarybooks and everything. Some say he knows more than the editor of the_Advance_ himself."They waited until they heard a door swing to upon Sarah."Other has the gumption," said Sharon. But this was going in a circle.Gideon and Harvey D. ignored it as having already been answered."Well," said Harvey D., "I suppose we should call it settled.""Overchancy," said Gideon, "but so would any boy be. This one is anexcellent prospect, sound as a nut, bright, well-mannered.""He made an excellent impression on me after church to-day," said HarveyD. "Quite refined.""Re-fined," said Sharon, "is something any one can get to be. It'smanners you learn." But again he was ignored."Something clean and manly about him," said Harvey D. "I should likehim--like him for my son.""Has it occurred to either of you," asked Gideon, "that this absurdfather will have to be consulted in such a matter?""But naturally!" said Harvey D. "An arrangement would have to be madewith him.""But has it occurred to you," persisted Gideon, "that he might be absurdenough not to want one of his children taken over by strangers?""Strangers?" said Harvey D. in mild surprise, as if Whipples could withany justice be thus described.Gideon, however, was able to reason upon this."He might seem both at first, I dare say; but we can make plain to himthe advantages the boy would enjoy. I imagine they would appeal to him.I imagine he would consent readily.""Oh, but of course," said Harvey D. "The father is a nobody, and theboy, left to himself, would probably become another nobody, withouttraining, without education, without advantages. The father would knowall this."[Illustration: "'I CAN ALWAYS FIND A LITTLE TIME FOR BANKERS. I NEVERKEPT ONE WAITING YET AND I WON'T BEGIN NOW.'"]"Perhaps he doesn't even know he is a nobody," suggested Sharon."I think we can persuade him," said Harvey D., for once not meaningprecisely what his words would seem to mean."I hope so," said Gideon, "Pat will be pleased.""I shall like to have a son," said Harvey D., frankly wistful."Other one has the gumption," said Sharon, casting a final rain of cigarash upon the abused rug at his feet."The sands of the Whipple family were running out--we renew them," saidGideon, cheerily.CHAPTER VIIThe ensuing week was marked for the Cowan-Penniman household bysensational developments. To Dave Cowan on Monday morning, standing athis case in the _Advance_ office, nimbly filling his stick with type,following the loosely written copy turned in by Sam Pickering, theeditor, had portentously come a messenger from the First National Bankto know if Mr. Cowan could find it convenient that day to give Harvey D.Whipple a few moments of his time. Dave's business life had hitherto notincluded any contact with bankers; he had simply never been in a bank.The message left him not a little disturbed.The messenger, Julius Farrow, a bookkeeper, could answer no questions.He knew only that Harvey D. had been very polite about it, and if Davecouldn't find it convenient to-day he was to say when he might find itconvenient to have a conference. Dave felt relieved at hearing the word"conference." A mere summons to a strange place like a bank might besinister, but a polite invitation to a conference at his convenience wasdifferent. He put down his half-filled stick. He had been at work on the_Advance_ locals for the Wednesday paper, two and three-line items totell of the trivial going and coming of nobodies which he was wont toset up with an accompaniment of satirical comment on small-townactivities. He had broken off in the midst of perpetuating in breviertype the circumstance that Adelia May Simsbury was home from normalschool over Sunday to visit her parents, Rufus G. Simsbury and wife,north of town."I'll go with you," Dave told Julius Farrow. "I can always find a littletime for bankers. I never kept one waiting yet, and I won't begin now.Ask any of em--they'll tell you I come when called."Julius looked puzzled, but offered no comment. Dave doffed his greeneye-shade and his apron of striped ticking, hastily dampened his handsin the tin washbasin and wiped them on a roller towel rich in historicassociations. He spent a moment upon his hair before a small, wavy, anddiagonally cracked mirror, put on his blue cutaway coat and his derbyhat and called, "Back in five minutes, Sam," casually into the open doorof another room, where Sam Pickering wrestled with a fearless editorialon the need of better street lighting. It seemed to Dave that fiveminutes would amply suffice for any talk a banker might be needing withhim.In the back office of the First National Bank he was presently ensconcedat a shining table of mahogany across from Harvey D. Whipple and hisfather--the dubious trousers and worn shoes hidden beneath the table sothat visibly he was all but well dressed."Smoke?" asked Gideon, and proffered an open cigar case."Thanks," said Dave, "I'll smoke it later."He placed a cigar in the upper left-hand pocket of the eminently plaidwaistcoat from whence already protruded the handle of a toothbrush and afountain pen. He preened his moustache, smoothed his hair, waited.Harvey D. coughed in a promising manner, set a wire basket of paperssquare with the corners of the table, and began."We have been thinking, Mr. Cowan, my father and I--you see--"He talked on, but without appeasing Dave's curiosity. Something aboutDave's having boys, he gathered, and about the Whipples not having them;but it occurred to Dave again and again as Harvey wandered on that thiswas a discrepancy not in his power to correct. Once a monstroussuspicion startled him--this conference, so called, was shaping intonothing less than a proposal on behalf of the person he had socarelessly saluted the day before. It was terrifying; he grew cold withpure fright. But that was like some women--once show them a littleattention, they expected everything!Gideon Whipple mercifully broke in while Harvey D. floundered upon aninconclusive period. Gideon was not nervous, and saw little need forstrategy with this rather vagabondish fellow."In short, Mr. Cowan, my son offers to adopt that boy of yours--make himhis own son in name--and opportunities and advantages--his own son."So it was only that! Dave drew a long, pleasant breath and wiped hisbrow. Then he took a pencil from the table and began to draw squares andtriangles and diamond patterns upon a pad of soft paper that lay athand."Well--I don't know." His eyes followed the pencil point. Nor did heknow until it presently developed that the desired adoption was of theMerle twin. He had supposed, without debate, that they would be meaningthe other. "You mean Merle," he said at last on some leading ofGideon's."To be sure!" said Harvey D., as if there could have been no question ofanother."Oh, him!" said Dave--there was relief in his tone. "You're sure youmean him?""But of course!" said Harvey D., brightening."All right," said Dave. He felt they were taking the wrong twin, but hefelt also that he must not let them see this--they might then want theother. "All right, I'll agree to that. He's a bright boy; it ought to bea good thing for him.""Ought to be!" quoted Harvey D. with humorous warmth. "But, of course,it will be! You realize what it will mean for him--advantages,opportunities, education, travel, family, a future!--the Whippleestate--but, of course, we feel that under our training he will be acredit to us. He will be one of us--a Whipple in name and in fact."Dave Cowan ceased to draw angled designs on his pad; he now drewcircles, ovals, ellipses, things fluent with curves."All right," he said, "I'm willing, I want to do the best I can for theboy. I'm glad you feel he's the right one for you. Of course the otherboy--well, they're twins, but he's different.""We are certain you will never regret it," said Harvey D., warmly."We feel that you are wise to agree," said Gideon. "So then--""Papers to sign?" said Dave."Our lawyer will have them to-morrow," said Harvey D."Good!" said Dave.He was presently back at his case, embalming for posterity the knowledgethat Grandma Milledge was able to be out again these sunny days after ahard tussle with her old enemy sciatica. But before passing to the nextitem he took Gideon's choice cigar from the upper waistcoat pocket,crumpled it, rubbed it to fine bits between the palms of his hands, andfilled the calabash pipe with its debris. As he smoked he looked out thewindow that gave on River Street. Across the way was the yellow brickstructure of the bank he had just left. He was seeing a future presidentof that sound institution, Merle Whipple, born Cowan. He was glad theyhadn't wanted the other one. The other one would want to be somethingmore interesting surely than a small-town bank president. Have him learna good loose trade and see the world--get into real life! But they'd hadhim going for a minute--when the only meaning he could get from HarveyD.'s roundabout talk was that the old girl of yesterday hadmisunderstood his attentions. That would have been a nice fix to findhimself in! But Merle was off his mind; he would become a real Whippleand some day be the head of the family. Funny thing for a Cowan to fallinto! He turned to his dusty case and set up the next item on his yellowcopy paper."Rumour hath it that Sandy Seaver's Sunday trips out of town meanbusiness, and that a certain bright resident of Geneseo will shortlybecome Mrs. Sandy."He paused again. All at once it seemed to him that the Whipples had beenhasty. They would get to thinking the thing over and drop it; nevermention it to him again. Well, he was willing to let it drop. Hewouldn't mention it again if they didn't. He would tell no one.       *       *       *       *       *Nor did he speak of it until the following evening, after the Whippleshad surprisingly not only mentioned it again but had operated in thelittle bank office, under the supervision of Squire Culbreth, a simplemechanism of the law which left him the legal father of but one son.Then he went to astonish the Pennimans with his news, only to find thatWinona had secretively nursed it even longer than he had. Mrs. Pennimanhad also been told of the probability of this great event, but,nevertheless, wept gently when Dave certified to her its irrevocableconsummation. Only Judge Penniman remained to be startled; and he, beingirritated that others had enjoyed a foreknowledge guiltily withheld fromhim, chose to pretend that he, too, had been mysteriously enlightened.He had, he said, seen the thing coming. He became at the supper table acreature of gnawing and baffled curiosity which he must hide by boastingan intimate acquaintance with Whipple motives and intentions. Heintimated that but for his advice and counsel the great event might nothave come about. The initiative had been his, though certain otherpeople might claim the credit. Of course he hadn't wanted to talk aboutit before. He guessed he could keep a close mouth as well as the nextone.The Merle twin at this momentous meal sat as one enthroned, receivingtribute from fawning subjects. His name was already Merle Whipple, andhe was going to have a pony to ride, and he would come sometimes to seethem. His cordial tolerance of them quite overcame Mrs. Penniman again.She had to feign an errand to the kitchen stove, and came back droppingthe edge of her apron from her eyes. Winona was exalted; she felt thather careful training of the child had raised him to this eminence, andshe rejoiced in it as a tribute to her capacity. Her labours had beenrichly rewarded. Dave Cowan alone seemed not to be enough impressed bythe honours heaped upon his son. He jestingly spoke of him as a crownprince. He said if you really had to stay in a small town you might aswell be adopted by the Whipples as any one else.The Wilbur twin was abashed and puzzled. The detail most impressing himseemed to be that, having no longer a brother, he would cease to be atwin. His life long he had been made intensely conscious of being atwin--he was one of a pair--and now suddenly, he gathered, he wassomething whole and complete in himself. He demanded assurance on thispoint."Then I'm not going to be a twin any longer? I mean, I'm not going to beone of a twins? It won't change my name, too, will it?"His father enlightened him."No, there's still a couple of Cowans left to keep the name going. Wewon't have to be small-towners unless we want to," he added.He suspected that the Wilbur twin felt slighted and hurt at being passedover, and would be needing comfort. But it appeared that the severedtwin felt nothing of that sort. He was merely curious--not wounded orenvious."I wouldn't want to change to a new name," he declared. "I'd forget andgo back to the old one."He wanted to add that maybe his new dog would not know him under anothername, but he was afraid of being laughed at for that."Merle never forgets," said Winona. "He will be a shining credit to hisnew name." She helped the chosen one to more jelly, which he acceptedamiably. "And he will be a lovely little brother to Patricia Whipple,"she fondly added.This left the Wilbur twin cold. He would like to have a pony, but hewould not wish to be Patricia Whipple's brother. He now recalled herunpleasantly. She was a difficult person."Give Merle another bit of the steak, Mother," urged Judge Penniman.The judge had begun to dwell upon his own new importance. This thingmade him by law a connection of the Whipple family, didn't it? He, RufusTyler Penniman, had become at least a partial Whipple. He reflectedpleasantly upon the consequences."Will he go home to-night?" suddenly demanded the Wilbur twin, pointingat his brother so there should be no mistake. The Merle twin seemedalready a stranger to him."Not to-night, dear, but in a few days, I would suppose." It sent Mrs.Penniman to the stove again."I don't just know when I will go," said the Merle twin, surveying areplenished plate. "But I guess I'll give you back that knife you boughtme; I probably won't need it up there. I'll probably have plenty ofbetter knives than that knife."The Wilbur twin questioned this, but hid his doubt. Surely there couldbe few better knives in the whole world than one with a thing to digstones out of horses' feet. Anyway, he would be glad to have it, and wasglad the promise had been made before witnesses.After supper on the porch Dave Cowan in the hammock picked chords andscraps of melody from his guitar, quite as if nothing had happened.Judge Penniman, in his wicker chair, continued to muse upon certainpleasant contingencies of this new situation. It had occurred to himthat Dave Cowan himself would be even more a Whipple than any Penniman,and would enjoy superior advantages inevitably rising from thiscircumstance."That family will naturally want to do something for you, too, Dave," hesaid at last."Do something for me?" Dave's fingers hung waiting above the strings."Why not? You're the boy's father, ain't you? Facts is facts, no matterwhat the law says. You're his absolute progenitor, ain't you? Well, youliving here in the same town, they'll naturally want you to be somebody,won't they?""Oh!" Dave struck the waiting chord. "Well, I am somebody, ain't I?"The judge waved this aside with a fat, deprecating hand."Oh, in that way! Of course, everybody's somebody--every living,breathing soul. But what I'm getting at--they'll naturally try to makesomething out of you, instead of just being kind of a no-account trampprinter.""Ha! Is that so, old small-towner?""Shouldn't wonder if they'd want to take you into the bank,mebbe--cashier or something, or manage one of the farms or factories, orset you up in business of some kind. You might git to be president ofthe First National.""They might make you a director, too, I suppose.""Well, you can snicker, but stranger things have happened."The judge reflected, seeing himself truly a bank director, wearing hissilk hat and frock coat every day--perhaps playing checkers with HarveyD. in the back office at quiet moments. Bank directing would surely be asuitable occupation for an invalid. Dave muted the vibrant strings witha hand."Listen, Old Flapdoodle! I wouldn't tie myself up in this one-horsebunch of hovels, not if they'd give me the bank and all the money in itand all the Whipple farms and throw in the post office and the jail andthe depot. Get that?""Ho! Sour grapes!" returned the judge, stung to a biting wit by thecoarse form of address. But Dave played music above the taunt.       *       *       *       *       *Nevertheless, he was not wholly surprised the following day when,politely invited to another conference at the bank, old Gideon Whipple,alone there, put the matter of his future somewhat after the manner ofJudge Penniman, though far less crudely. Old Gideon sat across thetable from him, and after Dave had put a cigar in his upper left-handwaistcoat pocket he became considerate but pointed."My son and I have been talking, Mr. Cowan, and we agree that somethingis due you as the boy's father. We want to show you everyconsideration--show it liberally. You seem to have led rather an--shallwe say an unsettled life up to this time? Not that it's anything to becriticised; you follow your own tastes, as every man should. But itoccurred to us that you might care to feel more settled in some stableoccupation where you could look forward to a solid future--all that sortof thing."Dave nodded, waiting, trying to word the talk the old man and his sonwould have had about him. Harvey Whipple would have been troubled at thenear presence of the father of his new son as a mere journeyman printer.Undoubtedly the two would have used the phrase the judge had used--theywould want him to make something of himself."So we've felt," went on Gideon, "that you might care to engage in somebusiness here in Newbern--establish yourself, soundly and prosperously,as it were, so that your son, though maturing under differentcircumstances, would yet feel a pride in your standing in the community.Of course, this is tentative--I'm sounding you, only. You may have quiteother ideas. You may have laid out an entirely different future foryourself in some other field. But I wanted to let you know that we standready to finance liberally any business you would care to engage in,either here or elsewhere. It isn't that we are crudely offering youmoney. I wish you to understand that. But we offer you help, both inmoney and counsel and influence. In the event of your caring toestablish yourself here, we would see that your foundation wassubstantial. I think that says what I wanted to say."During much of this Dave Cowan had been musing in a lively manner uponthe other's supposition that he should have laid out a future forhimself. He was amused at the notion. Of course he had laid out afuture, but not the sort a Whipple would lay out. He was already livinghis future and found it good. Yet he felt the genuine good will of theold man, and sought words to reject his offer gracefully. He must notput it so bluntly as he had to Judge Penniman. The old man would not beable to understand that no bribe within human reach would tempt him toremain in Newbern Center; nor did he wish to be established on a soundbasis anywhere else. He did not wish to be established at all."I'm much obliged," he said at last, "but I guess I won't trouble youand your son in any way. You see, I kind of like to live round and seethings and go places--I don't know that I can explain it exactly.""We have even thought you might like to acquire the journal on which youare now employed," said Gideon. "We understand it can be bought; westand ready to purchase it and make it over to you.""Any country newspaper can always be bought any time," said Dave. "Theirowners always want to sell, and it's mighty kind of you and your son,but--well, I just couldn't settle down to be a country editor. I'd gocrazy," he confessed in a sudden burst of frankness, and beaming uponGideon; "I'd as soon be shut in jail.""Or anything else you might think of," said Gideon, cordially, "notnecessarily in this town.""Well, I'd rather not; I guess I'm not one to have responsibilities; Iwouldn't have an easy minute spending your money. I wouldn't ever beable to feel free with it, not the way I feel with my own. I guess Ijust better kind of go my own way; I like to work when I want to andstop when I want to, and no one having any right to ask me what I quitfor and why don't I keep on and make something of myself. I guess it'sno good your trying to help me in any way. Of course I appreciate it andall that. It was kindly thought of by you. But--I hope my boy will be acredit to you just the same."The conference closed upon this. Dave left it feeling that he had easedhis refusal into soft, ambiguous phrases; but old Gideon, reporting toHarvey D., said: "That chap hates a small town. What he really wanted totell me was that he wouldn't settle down here for all the money in theworld. He really laughed at me inside for offering him the chance. Hepities us for having to stay here, I do believe. And he wouldn't talk oftaking money for any enterprise elsewhere, either. He's eitherindependent or shiftless--both, maybe. He said," Gideon laughednoiselessly, "he said he wouldn't ever be able to feel free with ourmoney the way he does with his own."       *       *       *       *       *The Whipples, it proved, would be in no indecent haste to remove theirnew member from his humbler environment. On Wednesday it was conveyed toWinona that they would come for Merle in a few days, which left thePenniman household and the twins variously concerned as to the precisemeaning of this phrase. It sounded elastic. But on Thursday Winona wasable to announce that the day would be Saturday. They would come forMerle Saturday afternoon. She had been told this distinctly by Mrs.Harvey D. Though her informant had set no hour, Winona thought it wouldbe three o'clock. She believed the importance of the affair demanded thesetting of an exact hour, and there was something about three o'clockthat commended itself to her. From this moment the atmosphere of thePenniman house was increasingly strained. There were preparations. Theslender wardrobe of the crown prince of the Whipple dynasty was put inperfect order, and two items newly added to it by the direction of DaveCowan. The boy must have a new hat and new shoes. The judge pointed outto the prodigal father that these purchases should rightly be made withWhipple money. Dave needn't buy shoes and hats for Merle Whipple anymore than he need buy them for any other Whipple, but Dave hadstubbornly squandered his own money. His boy wasn't going up to the bighouse like a ragamuffin.It came to the Wilbur twin that these days until Saturday were like thedays intervening in a house of death until the funeral. He becameincreasingly shy and uncomfortable. It seemed to him that his brotherhad passed on, as they said, his mortal remains to be disposed of onSaturday at three o'clock. Having led a good life he would go to heaven,where he would have a pony and a thousand knives if he wanted them. Thestrain in the house, the excitement of Winona, the periodic, furtiveweeping of Mrs. Penniman, the detached, uplifted manner of the chieffigure, all confirmed him in this impression. Even Judge Penniman, whohad been wont to speak of "them twins," now spoke of "that boy," meaningbut the Wilbur twin.By two o'clock of the momentous Saturday afternoon the tension was atits highest. Merle, dressed in his Sunday clothes, trod squeakily in thenew shoes, which were button shoes surpassing in elegance any he hadhitherto worn. As Dave Cowan had remarked, they were as good shoes asWhipple money would ever buy him. And the new hat, firm of line and richin texture, a hat such as no boy could possibly wear except on Sunday,unless he were a very rich boy, reposed on the centre table in theparlour. Winona, flushed and tightly dressed, nervously altered thearrangement of chairs in the parlour, or remembered some belonging ofthe deceased that should go into the suitcase containing his freshlystarched blouses. Mrs. Penniman, also flushed and tightly dressed,affected to busy herself likewise with minor preparations for thedeparture, but this chiefly afforded her opportunities for quiet weepingin secluded corners. After these moments of relief she would becomeelaborately cheerful, as if the occasion were festal. Even the judgegrew nervous with anticipation. In his frock coat and striped graytrousers he walked heavily from room to room, comparing the clock withhis watch, forgetting that he was not supposed to walk freely exceptwith acute suffering. Merle chattered blithely about how he would comeback to see them, with unfortunate effects upon Mrs. Penniman.The Wilbur twin knew this atmosphere. When little Georgie Finkboner haddied a few months before, had he not been taken to the house of mourningand compelled to stay through a distressing funeral? It was like thatnow, and he was uncomfortable beyond endurance. Twice Winona hadreminded him that he must go and put on his own Sunday clothes--nothingless than this would be thought suitable. He had said he would, but haddawdled skillfully and was still unfitly in bare feet and the shabbygarments of a weekday. He knew definitely now that he was not going tobe present at this terrible ceremony.He had no doubt there would be a ceremony--all the Whipples arriving intheir own Sunday clothes, maybe the preacher coming with them; and theywould sit silently in the parlour the way they did at the Finkbonerhouse, and maybe the preacher would talk, and maybe they would sing orpray or something, and then they would take Merle away. He was not to beblamed for this happily inaccurate picture; he was justified by thebehaviour of Winona and her mother. And he was not going to be there! Hewouldn't exactly run away; he felt a morbid wish to watch the thing ifhe could be apart from it; but he was going to be apart. He rememberedtoo well the scene at the Finkboner house--and the smell of tuberoses.Winona had unaccustomed flowers in the parlour now--not tuberoses, butalmost as bad. Until a quarter to three he expertly shuffled and dawdledand evaded. Then Winona took a stand with him."Wilbur Cowan, go at once and dress yourself properly! Do you expect toappear before the Whipples that way?"He vanished in a flurry of seeming obedience. He went openly through thefront door of the little house into the side yard, but paused not untilhe reached its back door, where he stood waiting. When he guessed he hadbeen there fifteen minutes he prepared to change his lurking place.Winona would be coming for him. He stepped out and looked round thecorner of the little house, feeling inconsequently the thrill of ascout among hostile red Indians as described in a favoured romance.The lawn between the little house and the big house was free ofsearchers. He drew a long breath and made a swift dash to furtherobscurity in the lee of the Penniman woodshed. He skirted the end ofthis structure and peered about its corner, estimating the distance tothe side door. But this was risky; it would bring him in view of akitchen window whence some busybody might observe him. But there was anopen window above him giving entrance to the woodshed. He leaped tocatch its sill and clambered up to look in. The woodshed was vacant ofPennimans, and its shadowy silence promised security. He dropped fromthe window ledge. There was no floor beneath, so that the drop wasgreater than he had counted on. He fell among loose kindling wood withmore noise than he would have desired, quickly rose, stumbled in thedusk against a bucket half filled with whitewash, and sprawled againinto a pile of soft coal."Gee, gosh!" he muttered, heartily, as he rose a second time.Both the well-spread pallor of the whitewash and the sable sprinkling ofcoal dust put him beyond any chance of a felicitous public appearance.But he was safe in a dusky corner. He remained there, breathing heavily.At last he heard Winona call him from the Penniman porch. Twice shecalled; then he knew she would be crossing to the little house to knowwhat detained him. He heard her call again--knew that she would besearching the four rooms over there. She wouldn't think of the woodshed.He sat there a long while, steadily regarding the closed screen doorthat led to the kitchen, ready to mingle deceptively with the coalshould any one appear.At last he heard a bustle within the house. There were hurried steppingsto and fro by Winona and her mother, the heavy tread of the judge, amurmur of high voices. The Whipples must have come, and every one wouldbe at the front of the house. He crept from his corner, climbed to thefloor from where it had been opened for wood and coal, and went softlyto the kitchen door. He listened a moment through the screen, thenentered and went noiselessly up the back stairs. Coming to the head ofthe front stairway, he listened again. There were other voices in front,and he shrank to the wall. He gathered that only the Whipple stepmotherand Patricia had come--no other Whipples, no preacher. It might not havebeen so bad. Still he didn't want to be there.They were at the front door now, headed for the parlour. Someone pausedat the foot of the stairs, and in quick alarm he darted along the halland into an open door. He was in the neat bedroom of Winona,shortbreathed, made doubly nervous by boards that had creaked under histread. He stood listening. They were in the parlour, a babble of voicescoming up to him; excited voices, but not funeral voices. His eyes rovedthe chamber of Winona, where everything was precisely in its place. Hemapped out a dive under her bed if steps came up the stairs. He heardnow the piping voice of Patricia Whipple."It's like in the book about Ben Blunt that was adopted by a kind oldgentleman and went up from rags to riches."This for some reason seemed to cause laughter below.He heard, from Winona: "Do try a piece of Mother's cake. Merle, dear,give Mrs. Whipple a plate and napkin."Cake! Certainly nothing like cake for this occasion had been intimatedto him! They hadn't had cake at the Finkboners. Things might have beendifferent, but they had kept still about cake. He listened intently,hearing laughing references to Merle in his new home. Then once moreWinona came to the front door and called him."Wilbur--Wil-bur-r-r! Where can that child be!" he heard her demand. Shewent to the back of the house and more faintly he heard her again callhis name--"Wilbur, Wil-bur-r-r!" Then, with discernible impatience, moreshortly, "Wilbur Cowan!" He was intently regarding a printed placardthat hung on the wall beside Winona's bureau. It read:     A gentleman makes no noise; a lady is serene.--Emerson.He remained silent. He was not going to make any noise. At length hecould hear preparations for departure."Merle, dear, your hat is on the piano--Mother, hand him his hat--I'llbring his suitcase.""Well, I'll be sure to come back to see you all some day.""Yes, now don't forget us--no, we mustn't let him do that."They were out on the porch, going down the walk. The listener steppedlightly to a window and became also a watcher. Ahead walked PatriciaWhipple and her new brother. The stepmother and Mrs. Penniman followed.Then came Winona with the suitcase, which was of wicker. Judge Pennimanlumbered ponderously behind. At the hitching post in front was the ponycart and the fat pony of sickening memory. Merle was politely helpingthe step-mother to the driver's seat. It was over. But the watchersuddenly recalled something.In swift silence, descending the stairs, he entered the parlour. On astand beneath the powerful picture of the lion behind real bars was afrosted cake of rare beauty. Three pieces were gone and two more werecut. On top of each piece was the half of a walnut meat. He tenderlyseized one of these and stole through the deserted house, throughkitchen and woodshed, out to the free air again. Back of the woodshed hesat down on the hard bare ground, his back to its wall, looking into thegarden where Judge Penniman, in the intervals of his suffering, raised afew vegetables. It was safe seclusion for the pleasant task in hand. Hegloated rapturously over the cake, eating first the half of the walnutmeat, which he carefully removed. But he thought it didn't taste right.He now regarded the cake itself uncertainly. It was surely perfectcake. He broke a fragment from the thin edge and tasted it almostfearfully. It wasn't going right. He persisted with a larger fragment,but upon this he was like to choke; his mouth was dry and curiously noplace for even the choicest cake. He wondered about it in something likepanic, staring at it in puzzled consternation. There was the choicething and he couldn't eat it. Then he became aware that his eyes werehot, the lids burning; and there came a choking, even though he nolonger had any cake in his mouth. Suddenly he knew that he couldn't eatthe cake because he had lost his brother--his brother who had passed on.He gulped alarmingly as the full knowledge overwhelmed him. He waswishing that Merle had kept the knife, even if it wasn't such a goodknife, so he would have something to remember him by. Now he would havenothing. He, Wilbur, would always remember Merle, even if he was nolonger a twin, but Merle would surely forget him. He had passed on.Over by the little house he heard the bark of Frank, the dog. Frank'svoice was changing, and his bark was now a promising baritone. His ownertried to whistle, but made poor work of this, so he called, "Here,Frank! Here, Frank!" reckless of betraying his own whereabouts. Hisvoice was not clear, it still choked, but it carried; Frank camebounding to him. He had a dog left, anyway--a good fighting dog. Hiseyes still burned, but they were no longer dry, and his gulps wereperiodic, threatening a catastrophe of the most dreadful sort.Frank, the dog, swallowed the cake hungrily, eating it with a terribleease, as he was wont to eat enemy dogs.CHAPTER VIIIMidsummer faded into late summer, and Dave Cowan was still small-towningit. To the uninformed he might have seemed a staff, fixed and permanent,to Sam Pickering and the Newbern Center _Advance_. But Sam was notuninformed. He was wise in Dave's ways; he knew the longer Dave stayedthe more casually would he flit; an hour's warning and the _Advance_would be needing a printer. So Sam became aware on a day in earlySeptember that he would be wise to have a substitute ready. He knew thesigns. Dave would become abstracted, stand longer and oftener at thewindow overlooking the slow life of Newbern. His mind would already beoff and away. Then on an afternoon he would tell Sam that he must see aman in Seattle, and if Sam had taken forethought there would be a newprinter at the case next day. The present sojourn of Dave's had beenlonger than any Sam Pickering could remember, for the reason, it seemed,that Dave had been interested in teaching his remaining son a good loosetrade.Directly after the apotheosis of Merle his brother had been taken to the_Advance_ office where, perched upon a high stool, his bare legsintricately entwined among its rungs, he had been taught the surfacemysteries of typesetting. At first he was merely let to set up quads inhis stick, though putting leads between the lines and learning the useof his steel rule. Then he was taught the location of the boxes in thecase and was allowed to set real type. By the time Sam Pickering notedthe moving signs in Dave the boy was struggling with copy and winninghis father's praise for his aptitude. True, he too often neglected toreach to the upper case for capital letters, and the galley proofs ofhis takes were not as clean as they should have been, but he waslearning. His father said so.Every Wednesday he earned a real quarter by sitting against the wallback of the hand press and inking the forms while his father ran off theedition. This was better fun than typesetting. Before you was a longroller on two other long rollers, and at your right hand was a smallroller with which you picked up ink from a stone, rolling it across andacross with a spirited crackle; then you ran the small roller the lengthof the long roller; then you turned a crank that revolved the two lowerrollers, thus distributing the ink evenly over the upper one. After thatyou ran the upper roller out over the two forms of type on the pressbed.Dave Cowan, across the press, the sleeves of his pink-striped shirtrolled to his elbows, then let down a frame in which he had fixed avirgin sheet of paper, ran the bed of the press back under a weightedshelf, and pulled a mighty lever to make the imprint. Wilbur had heardthe phrase "power of the press." He conceived that this was what thephrase meant--this pulling of the lever. Surmounting the framework ofthe press was a bronze eagle with wings out-spread for flight. Hisfather told him, the first day of his service, that this bird would flapits wings and scream three times when the last paper was run off. Thiswould be the signal for Terry Stamper, the devil, to go across toVielhaber's and fetch a pail of beer. Wilbur had waited for thisphenomenon, only to believe, after repeated disappointments, that it wasone of his father's jokes, though it was true that Terry Stamper broughtthe beer, which was drunk by Dave and Terry and Sam Pickering. Sam hadbeen folding the printed papers, while Terry Stamper operated a machinethat left upon each the name of a subscriber, dropping them into aclothes basket, which he later conveyed to the post office. Wilburenjoyed this work, running the long roller across the forms after eachimpression, spotting himself and his clothes with ink. After he hadlearned some more he would be a printer's devil like Terry, and fetchthe beer and run the job press and do other interesting things. Therewas a little thrill for him in knowing you could say devil in thisconnection without having people think you were using a bad word.But Dave's time had come. He "yearned over the skyline, where thestrange roads go down," though he put it more sharply to Sam Pickeringone late afternoon:"Well, Sam, I feel itchy-footed.""I knew it," said Sam. "When are you leaving?""No train out till the six-fifty-eight."And Sam knew he would be meaning the six-fifty-eight of that same day.He never meant the day after, or the day after that.That evening Dave sauntered down to the depot, accompanied by his son.There was no strained air of expectancy about him, and no tediousmanagement of bags. He might have been seeking merely the refreshment ofwatching the six-fifty-eight come in and go out, as did a dozen or so ofthe more leisured class of Newbern. When the train came he greeted theconductor by his Christian name, and chatted with his son until itstarted. Then he stepped casually aboard and surrendered himself to itswill. He had wanted suddenly to go somewhere on a train, and now he wasgoing. "Got to see a man in San Diego," he had told the boy. "I'll dropback some of these days.""Maybe you'll see the gypsies again," said Wilbur a bit wistfully.But he was not cast down by his father's going; that was a thing thathappened or not, like bad weather. He had learned this about his father.And pretty soon, after he went to school a little more and learned tospell better, to use punctuation marks the way the copy said, andcapital letters even if you did have to reach for them, he, too, couldswing onto the smoking car of the six-fifty-eight--after she had reallystarted--and go off where gypsies went, and people that had learned goodloose trades.There was a new printer at the case in the _Advance_ office thefollowing morning, one of those who constantly drifted in and out ofthat exciting nowhere into which they so lightly disappeared by whim; agaunt, silent man, almost wholly deaf, who stood in Dave Cowan's placeand set type with machine-like accuracy or distributed it withloose-fingered nimbleness, seizing many types at a time and scatteringthem to their boxes with the apparent abandon of a sower strewing seed.He, too, was but a transient, wherever he might be found, but he had notalk of the outland where gypsies were, and to Wilbur he proved to be ofno human interest, so that the boy neglected the dusty office for themore attractive out-of-doors, though still inking the forms for theWednesday edition, because a quarter is a good thing to have.When Terry Stamper brought the pail of beer now the new printer drankabundantly of the frothy stuff, and for a time glowed gently with asuggestive radiance, as if he, too, were almost moved to tell of strangecities; but he never did. Nor did he talk instructively about thebeginnings of life and how humans were but slightly advanced simians. Hewould continue to set type, silent and detached, until an evening whenhe would want to go somewhere on a train--and go. He did not smoke, buthe chewed tobacco; and Wilbur, the apprentice, desiring to do all thingsthat printers did, strove to emulate him in this interesting vice; butit proved to offer only the weakest of appeals, so he presentlyabandoned the effort--especially after Winona had detected him with thestuff in his mouth, striving to spit like an elderly printer. Winona washorrified. Smoking was bad enough!Winona was even opposed to his becoming a printer. Those advantages ofthe craft extolled by Dave Cowan were precisely what Winona deemedundesirable. A boy should rather be studious and of good habits andlearn to write a good hand so that he could become a bookkeeper, perhapseven in the First National Bank itself--and always stay in one place.Winona disapproved of gypsies and all their ways. Gypsies were rollingstones. She strove to entice the better nature of Wilbur with moralplacards bearing printed bits from the best authors. She gave him anentire calendar with an uplifting sentiment on each leaf. One payingproper attention could scarcely have lived the year of that calendarwithout being improved. Unfortunately, Wilbur Cowan never in the leastcared to know what day in the month it was, and whole weeks of thesehomilies went unread. Winona was watchful, however, and fertile ofresource. Aforetime she had devoted her efforts chiefly to Merle asbeing the better worth saving. Now that she had indeed saved him, madeand uplifted him beyond human expectation, she redoubled her attentionsto his less responsive, less plastic brother. Almost fiercely she wasbent upon making him the moral perfectionist she had made Merle.As one of the means to this end she regaled him often with tales of hisbrother's social and moral refulgence under his new name. The severanceof Merle from his former environment had been complete. Not yet had hecome back to see them. But Winona from church and Sunday-school broughtweekly reports of his progress in the esteem of the family which he nowadorned. Harvey D. Whipple was proud of his new son; had already come tofeel a real fatherhood for him, and could deny him nothing. He was sucha son as Harvey D. had hoped to have. Old Gideon Whipple, too, was proudof his new grandson. The stepmother, for whom Fate had been circumventedby this device of adoption, looked up to the boy and rejoiced in herroundabout motherhood, and Miss Murtree declared that he was a perfectlittle gentleman. Also, by her account, he was studious, with a naturalfondness for the best in literature, and betrayed signs of an intellectsuch as, in her confidentially imparted opinion, the Whipple family,neither in root nor branch, had yet revealed. Patricia, the sister, hadabandoned all intention of running away from home to obtain the rightsort of companionship.Winona meant to pique and inspire Wilbur to new endeavour with thesetales, which, for a good purpose, she took the liberty of embellishingwhere they seemed to invite it--as how the Whipples were often heard towish that the other twin had been as good and well-mannered a boy asMerle--who did not use tobacco in any form--so they might have adoptedhim, too. Winona was perhaps never to understand that Wilbur could notpicture himself as despised and rejected. His assertion that he had notwished to be adopted by any Whipples she put down to envious bravado.Had he not from afar on more than one occasion beheld his brother ridingthe prophesied pony? But he would have felt embarrassed at meeting hisbrother now face to face. He liked to see him at a distance, on thewonderful pony, or being driven in the cart with other Whipples, and hefelt a great pride that he should have been thus exalted. But he wasshyly determined to have no contact with this splendid being.When school began in the fall he was again constrained to the halls oflearning. He would have preferred not to go to school, finding the freeouter life of superior interest; but he couldn't learn the good loosetrade without improving his knowledge of the printed word--though he hadnot been warned that printers must be informed about fractions, or evenlong division--but Winona being his teacher it was impracticable to beabsent on private affairs even for a day without annoying consequences.During the long summer every day but Sunday had been a Saturday in allessentials; now, though the hillsides blazed with autumn colour, ripenuts were dropping, the mornings sparkled a frosty invitation, and therewas a provocative tang of brush fires in the keen air, he must earn hisSaturdays, and might even of these earn but one in a long week. Sunday,to be sure, had the advantage of no school, but it had the disadvantageof church attendance, where one fell sleepy while the minister scolded;and Sunday afternoon, even if one might fare abroad, was clouded byreminders of the imminent Monday morning. It was rather a relief whensnow came to shroud the affable woods, bringing such cold that one mightas well be in a schoolroom as any place; when, as Winona put down inher journal, the vale of Newbern was "locked in winter's icy embrace,"and poor old Judge Penniman was compelled to while away the longforenoons with his feet on a stock of wood in the kitchen oven.From Dave Cowan came picture postcards addressed to his son,gay-coloured scenes of street life or public buildings, and on theseDave had written, "Having a good time, hope you are the same." One ofthem portrayed a scene of revelry by night, and was entitled Sans SouciDance Hall, Denver, Colorado. Winona bribed this away from the recipientwith money. She wished Dave would use better judgment--choose thepicture of some good church or a public library.The Whipple family, including its latest recruit, continued remote.Wilbur would happily observe his one-time brother, muffled in robes offur, glide swiftly past in a sleigh of curved beauty, drawn by horsesthat showered music along the roadway from a hundred golden bells, butthere were no direct encounters save with old Sharon Whipple. Sharon,even before winter came, had formed a habit of stopping to speak toWilbur, pulling up the long-striding, gaunt roan horse and the buggywhich his weight caused to sag on one side to ask the boy idlequestions. Throughout the winter he continued these attentions, andonce, on a day sparkling with new snow, he took the rejected twin into acutter, enveloped him in the buffalo robe, and gave him a joyous rideout over West Hill along the icy road that wound through the sleeping,still woods. They were silent for the most of this drive."You don't talk much," said Sharon when the roan slowed for the ascentof West Hill and the music of the bells became only a silver murmur ofchords. The boy was silent, even at this, for while he was trying tothink of a suitable answer, trying to think what Winona would have himreply, Sharon flicked the roan and the music came loud again. There wasno more talk until Sharon pulled up in the village, the boy being tooshy to volunteer any speech while this splendid hospitality endured."Have a good time?" demanded Sharon at parting.Wilbur tried earnestly to remember that he should reply in Winona'sformula, "I have had a delightful time and thank you so much for askingme," but he stared at Sharon, muffled in a great fur coat and cap,holding the taut lines with enormous driving gloves, and could only say"Fine!" after which he stopped, merely looking his thanks."Good!" said Sharon, and touching the outer tips of his frosted eyebrowswith a huge gloved thumb he clicked to the roan and was off to asprinkle of bell chimes.Wilbur resolved not to tell Winona of this ride, because he would haveto confess that he had awkwardly forgotten to say the proper words atthe end. Merle would not have forgotten. Probably Mr. Sharon Whipple,having found him wanting in polish, would never speak to him again. ButSharon did, for a week later, when Wilbur passed him where he hadstopped the cutter in River Street, the old man not only hailed him, butcalled him Buck. From his hearty manner of calling, "Hello, there,Buck!" it seemed that he had decided to overlook the past.       *       *       *       *       *The advent of the following summer was marked by two events ofimportance; Mouser, the Penniman cat, after being repeatedly foiledthroughout the winter, had gained access to the little house on a daywhen windows and doors were open for cleaning, stalked the immobile bluejay, and falling upon his prey had rent the choice bird limb from limb,scattering over a wide space wings, feathers, cotton, and twisted wire.Mouser had apparently found it beyond belief that so beautiful a birdshould not be toothsome in any single part. But the discoverer of thissacrilege was not horrified as he would have been a year before. He hadeven the breadth of mind to feel an honest sympathy for poor Mouser, whohad come upon arsenic where it could not by any known law of Nature havebeen apprehended, and who for two days remained beneath the woodshedsick unto death, and was not his old self for weeks thereafter. Wilburwas growing up.Soon after this the other notable event transpired. Frank, the dog,became the proud but worried mother of five puppies, all multicolouredlike himself. It is these ordeals that mature the soul, and it was anolder Wilbur who went again to the _Advance_ office to learn the loosetrade, as his father had written him from New Orleans that he must besure to do. He had increased his knowledge of convention in the use ofcapital letters, and that summer, as a day's work, he set up a column ofleaded long primer which won him the difficult praise of Sam Pickering.Sam wrote a notice of the performance and printed it in the_Advance_--the budding craftsman feeling a double glow when he sat thisup, too. The item predicted that Wilbur Cowan, son of our fellowtownsman, Dave Cowan, would soon become one of the swiftest ofcompositors.This summer he not only inked the forms on Wednesday, but he waspermitted to operate the job press. You stood before this and turned alarge wheel at the left to start it, after which you kept it going withone foot on a treadle. Then rhythmically the press opened wide its mawand you took out the printed card or small bill and put in anotherbefore the jaws closed down. It was especially thrilling, because if youshould keep your hand in there until the jaws closed you wouldn't haveit any longer.But there was disquieting news about the loose trade he intended tofollow. A new printer brought this. He was the second since the deaf oneof the year before, the latter on an hour's notice having taken thesix-fifty-eight for Florida one night in early winter--like one of theidle rich, Sam Pickering said. The new printer, a sour, bald one ofmiddle age, reported bitterly that hand composition was getting to be nogood nowadays; you had to learn the linotype, a machine that was takingthe bread out of the mouths of honest typesetters. He had beheld one ofthese heinous mechanisms operated in a city office--by a slip of a girlthat wouldn't know how to hold a real stick in her hand--and things hadcome to a pretty pass. It was an intricate machine, with thousands ofparts, far more than seemed at all necessary. If you weren't right aboutmachinery, and too old to learn new tricks, what were you going to do?Get sent to the printer's home, that was all! The new printer drankheavily to assuage his gloom, even to a degree that caused HermanVielhaber to decline his custom, so that he must lean the gloomy hoursaway on the bar of Pegleg McCarron, where they didn't mind such things.Sam Pickering warned him that if this kept on there would no longer bejobs for hand compositors, even in country printing offices; that he,for one, would probably solve his own labour problem by installing amachine and running it himself. But the sad printer refused to be warnedand went from bad to worse.Wilbur Cowan partook of this pessimism about the craft, and wondered ifhis father had heard the news. If it had ceased to be important that abright boy should set up a column of long primer, leaded, in a day, hemight as well learn some other loose trade in which they couldn't inventa machine to take the bread out of your mouth. It was that summer hespent many forenoons on the steps of the ice wagon driven by his goodfriend, Bill Bardin. Bill said you made good-enough money deliveringice, and it was pleasant on a hot morning to rumble along the streets onthe back steps of the covered wagon, cooled by the great blocks of icestill in its sawdust.When they came to a house that took only twenty-five pounds Bill wouldlet him carry it in with the tongs--unless it was one where Bill, aknightly person, chanced to sustain more or less social relations withthe bondmaid. And you could chip off pieces of ice to hold in yourmouth, or cool your bare feet in the cold wet sawdust; and you didn'thave to be anywhere at a certain hour, but could just loaf along, givingpeople their ice when you happened to get there. He wondered, indeed, ifdelivering ice were not as loose a trade as typesetting had been, andwhether his father would approve of it. It was pleasanter than sittingin a dusty printing office, and the smells were less obtrusive. Also,Bill Bardin went about bareheaded and clad above the waist only in asleeveless jersey that was tight across his broad chest and gave his bigarms free play. He chewed tobacco, too, like a printer, but cautionedhis young helper against this habit in early youth. He said if indulgedin at too tender an age it turned your blood to water and you died ingreat suffering. Wilbur longed for the return of his father, so he couldtell him about the typesetting machine and about this other good loosetrade that had opened so opportunely.And there were other trades--seemingly loose enough--in which one drovethe most delightful wagons, and which endured the year round and not, aswith the ice trade, merely for the summer. There was, for example,driving an express wagon. Afternoons, when the ice chests of Newbern hadbeen replenished and Bill Bardin disappeared in the more obscureinterests of his craft, Wilbur would often ride with Rufus Paulding,Newbern's express agent. Rufus drove one excellent horse to a smartgreen wagon, and brought packages from the depot, which he deliveredabout the town. Being a companionable sort, he was not averse to WilburCowan's company on his cushioned seat. It was not as cool work asdelivering ice, and lacked a certain dash of romance present in theother trade, but it was lively and interesting in its own way,especially when Rufus would remain on his seat and let him carrypackages in to people with a book for them to sign.And there was the dray, driven by Trimble Cushman, drawn by two proudblack horses of great strength. This trade was a sort of elder, heavierbrother of the express trade, conveying huge cases of merchandise fromthe freight depot to the shops of the town. Progress was slower herethan with the express wagon, or even the ice wagon; you had to do lotsof backing, with much stern calling to the big horses, and often it tooka long time to ease the big boxes to the sidewalk--time and gruntingexclamations. Still it was not unattractive to the dilettante, and herode beside Trimble with profit to his knowledge of men and affairs.But better than all, for a good loose trade involving the direction ofhorses, was driving the bus from the Mansion House to the depot. Themajestic yellow vehicle with its cushioned, lavishly decorated interior,its thronelike seat above the world, was an exciting affair, even whenit rested in the stable yard. When the horses were hitched to it, andStarling Tucker from the high seat with whip and reins directed itsswift progress, with rattles and rumbles like a real circus wagon, itwas thrilling indeed. This summer marked the first admission of Wilburto an intimacy with the privileged driver which entitled him to mountdizzily to the high seat and rattle off to trains. He had patientlycourted Starling Tucker in the office of the Mansion House liverystable, sitting by him in silent admiration while he discoursedlearnedly of men and horses, helping to hitch up the dappled grays tothe bus, fetching his whip, holding his gloves, until it became a matterof course that he should mount to the high seat with him.This seemed really to be the best of all loose trades. On that highseat, one hand grasping an iron railing at the side, sitting bygrim-faced Starling Tucker in his battered hat, who drove carelesslywith one hand and tugged at his long red moustache with the other, itwas pleasantly appalling to reflect that he might be at any momentdashed to pieces on the road below; to remember that Starling himself,the daily associate of horses and a man of high adventure, had oncefallen from this very seat and broken bones--the most natural kind ofaccident, Starling averred, though gossip had blamed it on PeglegMcCarron's whisky. Not only was it delectable to ride in the high place,to watch trains come and go, to carry your load of travellers back tothe Mansion House, but there were interludes of relaxation when youcould sit about in the office of the stables and listen to agreeabletalk from the choice spirits of abundant leisure, with whom work seemedto be a tribal taboo, daily assembled there. The flow of anecdote wasoften of a pungent quality, and the amateur learned some words andphrases that would have caused Winona acute distress; but he learnedabout men and horses and dogs, and enlarged his knowledge of Newbern'sinner life, having peculiar angles of his own upon it from his othercontacts with its needs for ice and express packages and crates ofbulkier merchandise.His father had once said barbering was a good loose trade that enabledone to go freely about the world, but the boy had definitely eliminatedthis from the list of possible crafts, owing to unfortunate experienceswith none other than Judge Penniman, for the judge cut his hair. Atspaced intervals through the year Winona would give the order and thejudge would complainingly make his preparations. The victim was taken tothe woodshed and perched on a box which was set on a chair. The judgeswathed him with one of Mrs. Penniman's aprons, crowding folds of itinside his neckband. Then with stern orders to hold his head still therite was consummated with a pair of shears commandeered from plain andfancy dressmaking. Loath himself to begin the work, the judge alwayscame to feel, as it progressed, a fussy pride in his artistry; a pridenever in the least justified by results. To Wilbur, after these ordeals,his own mirrored head was a strange and fearsome apparition, the earsappearing to have been too carelessly affixed and the scanty remainderof his hair left in furrows, with pallid scalp showing through. Andthere were always hairs down his neck, despite the apron. Barbering wasnot for him--not when you could drive a bus to all trains, or even adray.There were also street encounters that summer with old Sharon Whipple,who called the boy Buck and jocularly asked him what he was doing tomake a man of himself, and whom he would vote for at the next election.One sunny morning, while Wilbur on River Street weighed the possibleattractions of the livery-stable office against the immediate certaintyof some pleasant hours with Rufus Paulding, off to the depot to get aload of express packages for people, Sharon in his sagging buggy pulledup to the curb before him and told him to jump in if he wanted a ride.So he had jumped in without further debate.Sharon's plump figure was loosely clad in gray, and his whimsical eyestwinkled under a wide-brimmed hat of soft straw. He paused to light acigar after the boy was at his side--the buggy continuing to sag asbefore--then he pushed up the ends of his eyebrows with the blunt thumb,clicked to the long-striding roan, and they were off at a telling trot.Out over West Hill they went, leaving a thick fog of summer dust intheir wake, and on through cool woods to a ridge from which the valleyopened, revealing a broad checker-board of ripening grain fields."Got to make three of my farms," volunteered Sharon after a silenthour's drive."Yes, sir," said Wilbur, which seemed enough for them both until thefirst of the farms was reached.Sharon there descended, passing the reins to a proud Wilbur, for talkwith his tenant on the steps of the yellow frame farmhouse. Sharon benthis thick round leg to raise a foot to a rustic seat, and upon thecushion thus provided made figures in a notebook. After a time of this,while Wilbur excitingly held the roan horse, made nervous by a hive ofbees against the whitewashed fence, he came back to the buggy--whichsagged from habit even when disburdened of its owner--and they drove toanother farm--a red brick farmhouse, this time, with yellow rosesclimbing its front. Here Sharon tarried longer in consultation. Wilburstaunchly held the roan, listened to the high-keyed drone of a reaper ina neighbouring field, and watched the old man make more figures in hisblack notebook. He liked this one of the Whipples pretty well. He wasless talkative than Bill Bardin, and his speech was less picturesquethan Starling Tucker's or even Trimble Cushman's, who would oftenthreaten to do interesting and horrible things to his big dray horseswhen they didn't back properly; but Wilbur felt at ease with Sharon,even if he didn't say much or say it in startling words.When Sharon had done his business the farmer came to lead the roan tothe barn, and Sharon, taking a pasteboard box from the back of thebuggy, beckoned Wilbur to follow him. They went round the red farmhouse,along a grassy path carelessly bordered with flowers that grew as theywould, and at the back came to a little white spring house in which weremany pans of milk on shelves, and a big churn. The interior was cool anddim, and a stream of clear water trickled along a passage in the cementfloor. They sat on a bench, and Sharon opened his box to produce anastonishing number of sandwiches wrapped in tissue paper, a generousoblong of yellow cheese, and some segments of brown cake splendidlyenriched with raisins."Pitch in!" said Sharon."Yes, sir," said Wilbur, and did so with an admirable restraint, such asWinona would have applauded, nibbling politely at one of the sandwiches."Ain't you got your health?" demanded the observant Sharon, capablyengulfing half a sandwich."Yes, sir," said Wilbur."Eat like it then."So the boy became less conscious of his manners, and ate like it, toSharon's apparent satisfaction. Midway in the destruction of thesandwiches the old man drew from the churn a tin cup of what proved tobe buttermilk. His guest had not learned to like this, so for him heprocured another cup, and brought it brimming with sweet milk which hehad daringly taken from one of the many pans, quite as if he were athome in the place."Milk's good for you," said Sharon."Yes, sir," said Wilbur."A regular food, as much as anything you want to name.""Yes, sir." The boy agreed wholly, without wishing to name anything indisparagement of milk.They ate the sandwiches and cheese, and upon the guest was conferred thecake. There were three pieces, and he managed the first swiftly, but wascompelled to linger on the second, even with the lubricating help ofanother cup of milk."Bring it along," directed the host. So it was brought along to thebuggy, one piece in course of consumption and one carried to be eaten atsuperb leisure as the fed roan carried them down the hot road to stillanother farm.They drove back to Newbern in the late afternoon, still largely silent,though there was a little talk at the close on stretches of hill wherethe roan would consent to slacken his pace."What you think of him?" Sharon demanded, nodding obliquely at the roan."He's got good hocks and feet--good head and shoulders, too," said theboy."He has that," affirmed Sharon. "Know horses?""Well, I--"He faltered, but suddenly warmed to talk and betrayed an intimateknowledge of every prominent horse in Newbern. He knew Charley and Dick,the big dray horses; and Dexter, who drew the express wagon; he knew Boband George, who hauled the ice wagon; he knew the driving horses in theMansion stables by name and point, and especially the two dapple graysthat drew the bus. Not for nothing had he listened to the wise talk inthe stable office, or sat at the feet of Starling Tucker, who knewhorses so well he called them hawses. It was the first time he hadtalked to Sharon forgetfully. Sharon nodded his head from time to time,and the boy presently became shy at the consciousness that he had talkeda great deal.Then Sharon spoke of rumours that the new horseless carriage would soondo away with horses. He didn't believe the rumours, and he spokescornfully of the new machines as contraptions. Still he had seen somespecimens in Buffalo, and they might have something in them. They mightbe used in time in place of horse-drawn busses and ice wagons and drays.Wilbur was chilled by this prediction. He had more than half meant todrive horses to one of these useful affairs, but what if they were to berun by machinery? Linotypes to spoil typesetting by hand, and nowhorseless carriages to stop driving horses! He wondered if it would beany use to learn any trade. He would have liked to ask Sharon, buthardly dared."Well, it's an age of progress," said Sharon at last. "We got to expectchanges."Wilbur was at home on this topic. He became what Winona would havecalled informative."We can't stop change," he said in his father's manner. "First, therewas star dust, and electricity or something made it into the earth; andsome water and chemicals made life out of this electricity orsomething----""Hey?" said the startled Sharon, but the story of creation continued."And there was just little animals first, but they got to be bigger,because they had to change; and pretty soon they become monkeys, andthen they changed some more, and stood up on their hind feet, and sothey got to be human beings like us--because--because they had tochange," he concluded, lucidly."My shining stars!" breathed Sharon."And they lost their tails and got so they would wear neckties and havepost offices and depots and religions," added the historian in a finalflash of memory."Well, I'll be switched!" said Sharon."It's electricity or something," explained the lecturer. "My father saidso.""Oh!" said Sharon."But he says there's a catch in it somewhere.""I should think there was," said Sharon. "By gracious goodness, I shouldthink there was a catch in it somewhere! But you understand the wholething as easy as crack a nut, don't you?""Yes, sir," said Wilbur."Giddap there!" said Sharon.Wilbur did not tell Winona of this day's encounter with an authenticWhipple. He would have done so but for the dollar that Sharon absentlybestowed upon him from a crumple of bills when he left the buggy at theentrance to Whipple Old Place. Winona, he instantly knew, would counselhim to save the dollar, and he did not wish to save it. As fast as hisbare feet--with a stone bruise on one heel--would carry him he sped toSolly Gumble's. Yet not with wholly selfish intent. A section of plugtobacco, charmingly named Peach and Honey, was purchased for a quarteras a gift to Bill Bardin of the ice wagon. Another quarter secured threepale-brown cigars, with gay bands about their middles, to be lavishedupon the hero, Starling Tucker.CHAPTER IXThe colourful years sped. At fifteen Wilbur Cowan, suddenly alive tothis quick way of time, was looking back to the days of his heedlessyouth. That long aisle of years seemed unending, but it narrowed inperspective until earlier experiences were but queerly dissolvingshapes, wavering of outline, dimly discerned, piquant or sad in themind, but elusive when he would try to fix them.On a shining, full-starred night he stood before the little house in thePenniman side yard and bade farewell to this youth. A long time he gazedinto the arched splendour above. He had never noticed that the starswere so many and so bright; and they were always there, by day as wellas by night, so his father said. Many of them, on the same veraciousauthority, were peopled; some with people who were yet but monkeys likethe Vielhaber's Emil; some with people now come to be human likehimself; others with ineffable beings who had progressed in measurelessperiods of time beyond any human development that even Dave Cowan couldsurmise.The aging boy felt suddenly friendly with all those distant worlds, gladthey were there, so almost sociably near. On more than one of them,perhaps far off in that white streak they called the Milky Way, theremust be boys like himself, learning useful things about life, to readgood books and all about machinery, and have good habits, and so forth.Surely on one of those far worlds there was at least one boy likehimself, who was being a boy for the last time and would to-morrow be aman. For Wilbur Cowan, beneath this starry welter of creation--of worldsto be or in being, or lifeless hulks that had been worlds and wereoutworn--was on this June night uplifted to face the parting of theways. His last day had been lived as a boy with publicly bare feet.No more would he feel the soft run of new grass beneath his soles, orlonger need beware the chance nail or sharp stone in the way. On themorrow, presumably to be a day inviting to bare feet as had all theother days of his summers, remembered and forgotten, he would, when herose, put on stockings and stout shoes; and he would put them on worldwithout end through all the new mornings of his life, howsoever urgentlywith their clement airs they might solicit the older mode. It was asolemn thing to reflect upon, under a glittering heaven that held, ornot, those who might feel with him the bigness of the moment. Hesuffered a vision of the new shoes, stiffly formidable, side by side atthe foot of his bed in the little house. It left him feeling all hisyears.And he would wear long trousers! With tolerant amusement he saw himselfas of old, barefoot, bare-legged, the knee pants buttoned to the calicoblouse. It was all over. He scanned the stars a last time, dimly feelingthat the least curious of their inhabitants would be aware of thiscrisis.Perhaps on one of those blinking orbs people with a proper concern forother world events would be saying to one another: "Yes, he's grown upnow. Didn't you hear the big news? Why, to-morrow he's going to begindriving a truck for Trimble Cushman--got a job for the whole summer."If the announcement startled less than great news should, the speakercould surely produce a sensation by adding: "The first automobile truckin Newbern Center."And how had this immature being, capable out-of-doors boy though he was,come to be so exalted above his fellows? Sam Pickering's linotype hadfirst revealed his gift for machinery. For Sam had installed a linotype,and Wilbur Cowan had patiently mastered its distracting intricacies.Dave Cowan had informally reappeared one day, still attired withdecreasing elegance below the waist--his cloth-topped shoes but littlemore than distressing memories--and announced that he was now an ableoperator of this wondrous machine; and the harried editor of the_Advance_, stung to enterprise by flitting wastrels who tarried at hiscase only long enough to learn the name of the next town, had soughtrelief in machinery, even if it did take bread from the mouths of honesttypesetters. Their lack of preference as to where they earned therebread, their insouciant flights from town to town without notice, hadmade Sam brutal. He had ceased to care whether they had bread or not. SoDave for a summer had brought him surcease from help worries.The cynical journeyman printer of the moment, on a day when Dave triedout the new machine, had stood by and said she might set type but shecertainly couldn't justify it, because it took a human to do that, andhow would a paper look with unevenly ending lines? When Dave, seatedbefore the thing, proved that she uncannily could justify the lines oftype before casting them in metal, the dismayed printer had shuddered atthe mystery of it.Dave Cowan seized the moment to point out to his admiring son and otherbystanders that it was all the working of evolution. If you couldn'tchange when your environment demanded it Nature scrapped you. Handcompositors would have to learn to set type by machinery or go down inthe struggle for existence. Survival of the fittest--that was it. Thedoubting printer was not there to profit by this lecture. Though it wasbut five o'clock, he was down on the depot platform moodily waiting forthe six-fifty-eight.The next number of the _Advance_ was set by linotype, a circumstance ofwhich one of its columns spoke feelingly, and set, moreover, in thepresence of as many curious persons as could crowd about the operator.Among these none was so fascinated as Wilbur Cowan. He hung lovinglyabout the machine, his fingers itching to be at its parts. When work forthe day was over he stayed by it until the light grew dim in thelow-ceilinged, dusty office. He took liberties with its delicatestructure that would have alarmed its proud owner, playing upon it withwrench and screw driver, detaching parts from the whole for the purepleasure of putting them back. He thus came to an intimate knowledge ofthe contrivance. He knew what made it go. He early mastered its mereoperation. Sam Pickering felt fortified against the future.Then it developed that though Dave Cowan could perform ably upon theinstrument while it retained its health he was at a loss when itdeveloped ailments; and to these it was prone, being a machine oftemperament and airs, inclined to lose spirit, to sulk, even irritablyto refuse all response to Dave's fingering of the keyboard. Dave wassincerely startled when his son one day skillfully restored tone to thething after it had disconcertingly rebelled. Sam Pickering, on the pointof wiring for the mechanic who had installed his treasure, looked uponthe boy with awe as his sure hands wrought knowingly among the weirdestof its vitals. Dave was impressed to utter lack of speech, and resumedwork upon the again compliant affair without comment. Perhaps hereflected that the stern processes of his favourite evolution demandedmore knowledge of this machine than even he had acquired.       *       *       *       *       *There ensued further profitable education for the young mechanic fromthe remarkable case of Sharon Whipple's first motor car. Sharon, thesummer before, after stoutly affirming for two years that he would neverhave one of the noisy things on the place, even though the Whipple NewPlace now boasted two--boasting likewise of their speed andconvenience--and even though Gideon Whipple jestingly called him afossilized barnacle on the ship of progress, had secretly bought a motorcar and secretly for three days taken instructions in its running fromthe city salesman who delivered it. His intention was to become daringlyexpert in its handling and flash upon the view of the discomfitedGideon, who had not yet driven a car. He would wheel carelessly up thedrive to the Whipple New Place in apparently contemptuous mastery of thething, and he would specifically deny ever having received any drivinglessons whatever, thus by falsehood overwhelming his brother withconfusion.In the stable, therefore, one afternoon he had taken his place at thewheel. Affecting a jovial ease of mind, he commanded the company of hisstableman, Elihu Titus, on the seat beside him. He wished a little toshow off to Elihu, but he wished even more to be not alone if somethinghappened. With set jaws and a tight grip of the wheel he had backed fromthe stable, and was rendered nervous in the very beginning by theapparent mad resolve of the car to continue backing long after it waswished not to. Elihu Titus was also rendered nervous, and was safely onthe ground before the car yielded to the invincible mass of a boxwoodhedge that had been forty years in growing. Sharon pointed his eyebrows."It makes you feel like a helpless fool," he confided to his hireling."She's all right on this side," said Elihu Titus, cannily peering at thenether mechanism in pretense that he had left his seat to do just that.The next start was happier in results. Down the broad driveway Sharonhad piloted the monster, and through the wide gate, though in a suddenshuddering wonder if it were really wide enough for his mount; then hehad driven acceptably if jerkily along back streets for an excitinghour. It wasn't so bad, except once when he met a load of hay andemerged with frayed nerves from the ordeal of passing it; and he hadbeen compelled to drive a long way until he could find space in which toturn round. The smarty that had sold the thing to him had turned in anarrow road, but not again that day would Sharon employ the whimsicallytreacherous gear of the retrograde.He came at last to a stretch of common that permitted a wide circle, andtook this without mishap. A block farther along he had picked up theCowan boy. He was not above prizing the admiration of this child for hismechanical genius. Wilbur exclaimed his delight at the car and lolledgingerly upon its luxurious back seat. He was taken full into thegrounds of the Whipple Old Place, because Sharon had suddenly conceivedthat he could not start the car again if he stopped it to let down hisguest. The car entered the wide gateway, which again seemed dangerouslynarrow to its driver, and purred on up the gravelled drive. When halfthe distance to the haven of the stable had been covered it betrayedsymptoms of some obscure distress, coughing poignantly. Sharon pretendednot to notice this. A dozen yards beyond it coughed again, feebly,plaintively, then it expired. There could be no doubt of its utterextinction. All was over. The end had come suddenly, almost painlessly.They got out and blankly eyed the lifeless hulk. After a moment of this,which was fruitless, Sharon spoke his mind concerning the car. For allthe trepidation it had caused him, the doubts and fears and panics, hetook his revenge in words of biting acidity--and he was through with thething."Let's get it out of sight," he said at last, and the three of thempushed it on along the drive to the shelter of the stable.Elihu Titus then breathed a long sigh and went silently to curry a horsein a neighbouring box stall. He knew when to talk and when not to. ButWilbur Cowan, wishing motor cars were in build more like linotypes,fearlessly opened the hood."My shining stars!" murmured Sharon at this his first view of his car'smore intimate devices. "She's got innards like a human, ain't she?" Heinstantly beheld a vision of the man in the front of the almanac whoseenvelope is neatly drawn back to reveal his complicated structure inbehalf of the zodiacal symbols. "It's downright gruesome," he added. Buthis guest was viewing the neat complexities of metal with real pleasureand with what seemed to the car's owner a practiced and knowing eye."Understand 'em?" demanded Sharon.The boy hesitated. What he wished more than anything was freedom totake the thing apart, all that charming assemblage of still warm metaland pipes and wires. He wanted to know what was inside of things, whatmade them go, and--to be sure--what had made them stop."Well, I could if I had a chance," he said at last."You got it," said Sharon. "Spend all your born days on the old cadaverif you're so minded." Already to Sharon it was an old car. He turnedaway from the ghastly sight, but stopped for a final warning: "But don'tyou ever tell anybody. I ain't wanting this to get out on me.""No, sir," said Wilbur."Maybe we ought to----" began Sharon, but broke off his speech with ahearty cough. He was embarrassed, because he had been on the point ofsuggesting that they call Doc Mumford. Doc Mumford was the veterinary.The old man withdrew. Elihu Titus appeared dimly in the background."Ain't she one gosh-awful crazy hellion?" he called softly to Wilbur,and returned to the horse, whose mechanism was understandable.The boy was left sole physician to the ailing monster. He drew a longbreath of gloating and fell upon it. For three days he lived in grimed,greased, and oiled ecstasy, appeasing that sharp curiosity to know whatwas inside of things. The first day he took down the engine bit by bit.The clean-swept floor about the dismantled hulk was a spreading turmoilof parts. Sharon, on cool afterthought, had conceived that his purchasemight not have suffered beyond repair, but returning to survey thewreck, had thrown up his fat hands in a gesture of hopeless finality."That does settle it," he murmured. He pointed to the scattered members."How in time did you ever find all them fiddlements in that littlespace?" Of course no one could ever put them back.He picked up the book that had come with the car, a book falselypretending to elucidate its mechanism, even to minor intelligences. Thebook was profuse in diagrams, and each diagram was profuse in lettersof the alphabet, but these he found uninforming. For the maker of thecar had unaccountably neglected to put A, B, or C on the partsthemselves, which rendered the diagrams but maddening puzzles. He threwdown the book, to watch the absorbed young mechanic who was franklypuzzled but still hopeful."It's an autopsy," said Sharon. He fled again, in the buggy drawn by theroan. "A fool and his money!" he called from the sagging seat.The second day passed with the parts still spread about the floor. ElihuTitus told Sharon the boy was only playing with them. Sharon said he wasglad they could furnish amusement, and mentally composed the beginningof what would be a letter of withering denunciation to the car's maker.But the third day the parts were unaccountably reassembled. Elihu Titusadmitted that every one of them was put back, though he hinted they wereprobably by no means where they had been. But Sharon, coming again tothe dissecting room at the day's end, was stricken with awe for theastounding genius that had put back all those parts. He felt a gleam ofhope."She'd ought to go now," said the proud mechanic."You ought to know," said Sharon. "You been plumb into her gizzard.""Only other thing I can think of," continued the mechanic, "mebbe sheneeds more of that gasoline stuff." He raised the cushion of the frontseat and unscrewed a cap. "We might try that," he suggested, brightly."This tank looks like she's empty.""Try it," said Sharon, and the incredulous Elihu Titus was dispatched tothe village for a five-gallon tin of the gasoline stuff. Elihu wasincredulous, because in Newbern gasoline was until now something thatwomen cleaned white gloves with. But when the tank was replenished thecar came again to life, throbbing buoyantly."I'll be switched!" said Sharon.A day later he was telling that his new car had broke down on him, butBuck Cowan had taken her all apart and found out the trouble in no time,and put her gizzard and lights and liver back as good as new. And BuckCowan himself came to feel quite unjustifiably a creator's pride in thecar. It was only his due that Sharon should let him operate it; perhapsnatural that Sharon should prefer him to. Sharon himself was never tobecome an accomplished chauffeur. He couldn't learn to relax at thewheel.So it was that the boy was tossed to public eminence on a day whenStarling Tucker, accomplished horseman, descended into the vale ofignominy by means of the Mansion House's new motor bus. Starling hadpermitted the selling agents to instruct him briefly in the operation ofthe new bus, though with lordly condescension, for it was his convictionthat a man who could tame wild horses and drive anything that wore haircould by no means fail to guide a bit of machinery that wouldn't r'arand run even if a newspaper blew across its face. He mounted the seat,on his first essay alone, with the jauntiness becoming a master ofvehicular propulsion. There may have been in his secret heart a bit oftrepidation, now that the instructor was not there. In fact, one of theassembled villagers who closely observed his demeanour related afterwardthat Star's face was froze and that he had hooked onto the wheel like hewas choking it to death. But the shining structure had glided off towardthe depot, its driver's head rigid, his glance strained upon the road'scentre. As it moved away Wilbur Cowan leaped to the rear steps and wascarried with it. He had almost asked Starling Tucker for the privilegeof a seat beside him, but the occasion was really too great.Five blocks down Geneseo Street Starling had turned out to permit thepassing of Trimble Cushman's loaded dray--and he had inexplicably,terribly, kept on turning out when there was no longer need for it.Frozen with horror, helpless in the fell clutch of circumstance, he satinert and beheld himself guide the new bus over the sidewalk and throughthe neat white picket fence of the Dodwell place. It demolished oneentire panel of this, made deep progress over a stretch of soft lawn,and came at last--after threatening a lawless invasion of the sanctityof domicile--to a grinding stop in a circular bed of pansies that wouldnever be the same again. There was commotion within the bus. Wild-eyedfaces peered from the polished windows. A second later, in the speech ofa bystander, "she was sweating passengers at every pore!"Then came a full-throated scream of terror from the menaced house, andthere in the doorway, clad in a bed gown, but erect and defiant, was theperson of long-bedridden Grandma Dodwell herself. She brandished herlace cap at Starling Tucker and threatened to have him in jail if therewas any law left in the land. Excited citizens gathered to the scene,for the picket fence had not succumbed without protest, and the crashhad carried well. Even more than at the plight of Starling, theymarvelled at the miracle that had been wrought upon the agedsufferer--her that hadn't put foot to floor in twenty years. There wereoutcries of alarm and amazement, hasty suggestions, orders to StarlingTucker to do many things he was beyond doing; but above them all roseclear-toned, vigorous denunciation from the outraged owner of the latepansy bed, who now issued from the doorway, walked unsupported down theneat steps, and started with firm strides for the offender. StarlingTucker beheld her approach, and to him, as to others there assembled, itwas as if the dead walked. He climbed swiftly down upon the oppositeside of his juggernaut, pushed a silent way through the crowd, andstrode rapidly back to town. Starling's walk had commonly been aloose-jointed swagger, his head up in challenge, as befitted a hero ofmanifold adventure with wild horses. He now walked head down with noswagger.But the crowd ceased to regard him, for now a slight boyish figure--noneother than that of Wilbur Cowan--leaped to the seat, performed swiftmotions, grasped the fateful wheel, and made the bus roar. The smell ofburned gasoline affronted the pretty garden. Wheels revolved savagelyamong the bruised roots of innocent pansies. Grandma Dodwell screamedanew. Then slowly, implacably hesitant, ponderous but determined, thehuge bus backed along the track it had so cruelly worn in the sward--outthrough the gap in the fair fence, over the side-walk and into the road,rocking perilously, but settling level at last. Thereupon the young herohad done something else with mysterious handles, and the bus glidedswiftly on to the depot, making the twelve-two in ample time.Great moments are vouchsafed only to those souls fortified to survivethem. To one who had tamed the proud spirit of Sharon Whipple's hellionit was but lightsome child's play to guide this honest and amiable newbus. To the Mansion he returned in triumph with a load of passengers,driving with zest, and there receiving from villagers inflamed by talesof his prowess an ovation that embarrassed him with its heartiness. Hehastened to remove the refulgent edifice, steering it prudently to itsstation in the stable yard. Then he went to find the defeated StarlingTucker. That stricken veteran sat alone amid the ruins of his toppledempire in the little office, slumped and torpid before the cold, rustystove. He refused to be comforted by his devotee. He said he would nevertouch one of them things again, not for no man's money. The Darwinianhypothesis allows for no petty tact in the process of evolution.Starling Tucker was unfit to survive into the new age. Unable to adapthimself, he would see the Mansion's stable become a noisome garage,while he performed humble and gradually dwindling service to a fewremaining horses.Wilbur Cowan guided the Mansion's bus for two days. He longed for it asa life work, but school was on and he was not permitted to abandon this,even for a glorious life at the wheel. There came a youth in neatuniform to perform this service--described by Starling Tucker as a youngsquirt that wouldn't know one end of a hawse from the other. Only onSaturdays--on Saturdays openly and clandestinely on Sundays--was therepresent on the driver's seat a knowing amateur who could have sat thereevery day but for having unreasonably to learn about compound fractionsand geography.CHAPTER XNow school was over for another summer and Trimble Cushman's dray couldbe driven at a good wage--by a boy overnight become a man. There werestill carpers who would regard him as a menace to life and limb. JudgePenniman was among these. A large truck in sole charge of a boy--stillin his teens, as the judge put it--was not conducive to publictranquillity. But this element was speedily silenced. The immatureWilbur drove the thing acceptably, though requiring help on the largerboxes of merchandise, and Trimble Cushman, still driving horses on hisother truck, was proud of his employee. Moreover, the boy became in highrepute for his knowledge of the inner mysteries of these new mechanisms.New cars appeared in Newbern every day now, and many of them, developingailments of a character more or less alarming to their purchasers, werebrought to his distinguished notice with results almost uniformlygratifying. He was looked up to, consulted as a specialist, sent for tominister to distant roadside failures, called in the night, respectedand rewarded.It was a new Newbern through whose thoroughfares the new motor truck ofTrimble Cushman was so expertly propelled. Farm horses still professedthe utmost dismay at sight of vehicles drawn by invisible horses, andtheir owners often sought to block industrial progress by agitation fora law against these things, but progress was triumphant. The chamber ofcommerce recorded immense gains in population. New factories and millshad gone up beside the little river. New people were on the streets orliving in their new houses. New merchants came to meet the new demandfor goods.The homy little town was putting on airs of a great city. There wasalready a Better Newbern club. The view down River Street from itsjunction with State, Masonic Hall on the left and the new five-storyWhipple block on the right, as preserved on the picture postcards soldby the Cut-Rate Pharmacy, impressed all purchasers with the town'svitality. The _Advance_ appeared twice a week, outdoing its rival, the_Star_, by one issue; and Sam Pickering, ever in the van of progress,was busy with plans for making his journal a daily.Newbern was coming on, even as boys were coming on from bare feet toshoes on week-days. Ever and again there were traffic jams on RiverStreet, a weaving turmoil of farmers' wagons, buggies, delivery carts,about a noisy, fuming centre of motor vehicles. High in the centre wouldbe the motor truck of Trimble Cushman, loaded with cases and nursedthrough the muddle by a cool, clear-eyed youth, who sat with delicate,sure hands on a potent wheel. Never did he kill or maim either citizenor child, to the secret chagrin of Judge Penniman. Traffic jams to himwere a part of the day's work.When he had performed for a little time this skilled labour for TrimbleCushman it was brought to him one day that he was old indeed. For heobserved, delivering a box to Rapp Brothers, jewellery, that from thesidewalk before that establishment he was being courted by a small boy;a shy boy with bare feet and freckles who permanently exposed two frontteeth, and who followed the truck to the next place of delivery. Here,when certain boxes had been left, he seated himself, as ifabsentmindedly, upon the remote rear of the truck and was borne toanother stopping place. The truck's driver glanced back savagely at him,but not too savagely; then pretended to ignore him.The newcomer for an hour hung to the truck leechlike, without winningfurther recognition. Then by insensible gradations, by standing on thetruck bed as it moved, by edging forward toward the high seat, bysilently helping with a weighty box, it seemed he had acquired the rightto mount to the high seat of honour itself. He did this without spokenwords, yet with an ingratiating manner. It was a manner that had beenused, ages back, by the lordly driver of the present truck, when he hadformed alliances with drivers of horse-drawn vehicles. He recognized itas such and turned to regard the courtier with feigned austerity."Hello, kid!" he said, with permitting severity. But secretly herejoiced. Now he was really old.       *       *       *       *       *Winona viewed the latest avocation of her charge with little enthusiasm.It compelled a certain measure of her difficult respect, especially whenshe beheld him worm his truck through crowded River Street with asupreme disregard for the imminent catastrophe--which somehow neverensued. But it lacked gentility. At twenty-eight Winona was not onlyperfected in the grammar of morals, more than ever alert for infractionsof the merely social code, but her ideals of refinement and elegance hadbecome more demanding. She would have had the boy engage in a pursuitthat would require clean hands and smart apparel and bring him incontact with people of the right sort. She stubbornly held out to himthe shining possibility that he might one day rise to the pinnacle of aclerical post in the First National Bank.True, he had never betrayed the faintest promise of qualifying for thiseminence, and his freely voiced preferences sweepingly excluded it fromthe catalogue of occupations in which he might consent to engage. ButWinona was now studying doctrines that put all power in the heart'sdesire. Out of the infinite your own would come to you if you held thethought, and she serenely held the better thought for Wilbur, even inthe moment of mechanical triumphs that brimmed his own cup of desire.She willed him to prefer choicer characters than the roughs he consortedwith, to aspire to genteel occupation that would not send him back atthe day's end grimed, reeking with low odours, and far too hungry.His exigent appetite, indeed, alarmed her beyond measure, because hecried out for meat, whereas Winona's new books said that meat eaterscould hope for little reward of the spirit. A few simple vegetables,fruits, and nuts--these permitted the soul to expand, to attain harmonywith the infinite, until one came to choose only the best among idealsand human associates. But she learned that she must in this casecompromise, for a boy demanding meat would get it in one place if notanother. If not at the guarded Penniman table, then at the low resortnext to Pegleg McCarron's of one T-bone Tommy, where they commonlydevoured the carcasses of murdered beasts and made no secret of it.He even rebelled at fabrications, highly extolled in the gospel of cleaneating, which were meant to placate the baser minded by theirresemblances to meat--things like nut turkey and mock veal loaf andleguminous chicken and synthetic beefsteak cooked in pure vegetableoils. These he scorned the more bitterly for their false pretense,demanding plain meat and a lot of it. The nations cited by Winona thathad thrived and grown strong on the produce of the fields left himunimpressed. He merely said, goaded to harshness, that he was not goingto be a Chinese laundryman for any one.Of what avail to read the lyrics of a great Hindu vegetarian poet tothis undeveloped being? Still Winona laboured unceasingly to bring lightto the dark place. Teaching a public school for eight years haddeveloped a substratum of granite determination in her character. Shewould never quit. She was still to the outer eye the slight, brownWinona of twenty--perky, birdlike, with the quick trimness of a wingingswallow, a little sharper featured perhaps, but superior in acuteness ofdesire and persistence, and with some furtive, irresponsible girlishnesslurking timorously back in her bright glance.She still secretly relished the jesting address of Dave Cowan, when atlong intervals he lingered in Newbern from cross-country flights. Itthrilled her naughtily to be addressed as La Marquise, to be accused ofgoings-on at the court of Louis XVIII, about which the less said thebetter. She had never brought herself to wear the tan silk stockings ofinvidious allure, and she still confined herself to her mother'splainest dressmaking, yearning secretly for the fancy kind, but neverwith enough daring. Lyman Teaford still came of an evening to play hisflute acceptably, while Winona accompanied him in many an amorousmorceau. Lyman, in the speech of Newbern, had for eight years been goingwith Winona. But as the romantically impatient and sometimes a bitsnappish Mrs. Penniman would say, he had never gone far.       *       *       *       *       *Winona rejoiced a year later when golf promised, at least for a summer,to snatch Wilbur Cowan from the grimy indistinction of a mechanic'scareer. For thriving and aspiring Newbern had eased one of its growingpains with a veritable golf course, and the whilom machinery enthusiastbecame smitten with this strange new sport. Winona rejoiced, because itwould bring him into contact with people of the better sort, for ofcourse only these played the game. Her charge, it is true, engaged inthe sport as a business, and not as one seeking recreation, but thedesired social contact was indubitable. To carry over the course a bagor two of clubs for the elect of Newbern was bound to be improving.And it was true that he now consorted daily through a profitable summerwith people who had heretofore been but names to him. But Winona hadneglected to observe that he would meet them not as a social equal butas a hireling. This was excusable in her, because she had only thevaguest notions of golf or of the interrelations between caddie andplayer. One informed in the ways of the sport could have warned her thatcaddies inevitably become cynical toward all people of the sort onecares to meet. Compelled by a rigid etiquette to silent, unemotionalformality, they boil interiorly with contempt for people of the bettersort, not only because their golf is usually atrocious--such as everycaddie brilliantly surpasses in his leisure moments--but because thespeech provoked by their inveterate failures is commonly all too human.So the results of Wilbur Cowan's contact with people Winona wouldapprove, enduring for a mercifully brief summer and autumn, were notwhat Winona had fondly preconceived. He had first been attracted to thecourse--a sweet course, said the golf-architect who had laid it out overthe rolling land south of town--by the personality of one John KnoxMcTavish, an earnest Scotchman of youngish middle age, procured fromafar to tell the beginning golfers of Newbern to keep their heads downand follow through and not to press the ball. As John spoke, it was"Don't pr-r-r-r-ess th' ball." He had been chosen from among othercandidates because of his accent. He richly endowed his words with r's,making more than one grow where only one had grown before. It was thisvocal burriness that drew the facile notice of Wilbur. He delighted tohear John McTavish talk, and hung about the new clubhouse, apparentlywithout purpose, until John not only sanctioned but besought hispresence, calling him Laddie and luring him with tales of the monstrousgains amassed by competent caddies.The boy lingered, though from motives other than mercenary. His cup wasfull when he could hear John's masterful voice addressed to Mrs. Rapp,Junior, or another aspirant."R-r-remember, mum, th' ar-r-r-um close, th' head down--and don'tpr-r-r-ress th' ball."Yet he was presently allured by a charm even more imperious, the charmof the game itself. For John at odd moments would teach him the use ofthose strange weapons, so that he had the double thrill of standingunder the torrential r's addressed to himself and of feeling the sharp,clean impact of the club head upon a ball that flew a surprisingdistance. His obedient young muscles soon conformed to the few masterlaws of the game. He kept down, followed through and forebore, againstall human instinct, to press the ball.By the end of Newbern's golfing season he was able to do almostunerringly what so many of Newbern's better sort did erratically and atintervals. And the talk of John Knox McTavish about the wealth accruingto alert caddies had proved to be not all fanciful. In addition to thestipend earned for conventional work, there were lost balls in abundanceto be salvaged and resold."Laddie," said John McTavish, "if I but had the lost-ball pur-r-rivilegeof yon sweet courr-r-se and could insu-r-r-e deliver-r-r-y!"For the better sort of Newbern, despite conscientious warnings for whichthey paid John McTavish huge sums, would insist upon pressing the ballin the face of constant proof that thus treated it would slice into therough to cuddle obscurely at the roots of tall grass.Wilbur Cowan became a shrewd hunter and a successful merchandiser ofgolf balls but slightly used. Newbern's better sort denounced thescandal of this, but bought of him clandestinely, for even in that farday, when golf balls in price were yet within reach of the commonpeople, few of them liked to buy a new ball and watch it vanish foreverafter one brilliant drive that would have taken it far down the fairwayexcept for the unaccountable slice.       *       *       *       *       *On the whole his season was more profitable than that of the yearbefore, when he had nursed the truck of Trimble Cushman through thetraffic jams of River Street, and he was learning more about the worldof men if less about gas engines. Especially did the new sport put himinto closer contact with old Sharon Whipple. Having first denounced thegolf project as a criminal waste of one hundred and seventy-five acresof prime arable land, Sharon had loitered about the scene of the crimeto watch the offenders make a certain kind of fools of themselves. Fromthe white bench back of the first tee this cynic would rejoicemirthfully at topped or sliced drives or the wild swing that spends allits vicious intent upon the imponderable air. His presence came to be atrial to beginning players, who took no real pleasure in the game untilthey reached the second tee, beyond the ken of the scoffer.But this was perilous sport for Sharon Whipple. Day after day, lookinginto the whirlpool, he was--in a moment of madness--himself to leap overthe brink. On an afternoon had come his brother Gideon and Rapp, Senior,elated pupils of John McTavish, to play sportingly for half a ball ahole. They ignored certain preliminary and all-too-pointed comments ofthe watcher. They strode gallantly to the tee in turn and exhibited theadmirable form taught them by John. They took perfect practice swings.They addressed the ball ceremoniously, waggled the club at it, firstsoothingly, then with distinct menace, looked up to frown at a spot fardown the fairway, looked back, exhaled the breath, and drove. Rapp,Senior, sliced into the rough. Gideon Whipple hooked into the rough.Sharon Whipple mocked them injuriously. His ironic shouts attracted thenotice of arriving players. Gideon Whipple stayed placid, smilinggrimly, but Rapp, Senior, was nettled to retort."Mebbe you could do a whole lot better!" he called to Sharon in tonesunnecessarily loud.Sharon's reply, in a voice eminently soothing and by that calculatedfurther to irritate the novice, was in effect that Rapp, Senior, mightsafely wager his available assets that Sharon Whipple could do better."Well, come on and do it then if you're so smart!" urged Rapp, Senior."Come on, once--I dare you!"Sharon scorned--but rather weakly--the invitation. Secretly, through hishostile study of the game, he had convinced himself that he by divineright could do perfectly what these people did so clumsily. Again andagain his hands had itched for the club as he watched futile drives. Heknew he could hit the ball. He couldn't help hitting it, stuck up theway it was on a pinch of sand--stuck up like a sore thumb. How did theymiss it time after time? He had meant to test his conviction insolitude, but why not put it to trial now, and shame this doubting andinept Rapp, Senior?"Oh, well, I don't mind," he said, and waddled negligently to the tee.Rapp, Senior, voiced loud delight. Gideon Whipple merely stood safelyback without comment, though there was a malicious waiting gleam in hiseyes."You folks make something out of nothing," scolded Sharon, fussily.Grasping the proffered club he severely threatened with it the new ballwhich Rapp, Senior, had obligingly teed up for him. In that moment hefelt a quick strange fear, little twinges of doubt, a suspicion that allwas not well. Perhaps the sudden hush of those about him conduced tothis. Even newly arrived players in the background waited in silence.Then he recovered his confidence. There was the ball and there was theclub--it was easy, wasn't it? Make a mountain out of a mole hill, wouldthey? He'd show them!Amid the hanging silence--like a portent it overhung him--he raised thestrange weapon and brought it gruntingly down with all the strength ofhis stout muscles.       *       *       *       *       *In the fading light of seven o'clock on that fair summer's evening JohnMcTavish for the hundredth time seized the heavy arms of Sharon Whippleand bent them back and up in the right line. Then Sharon did the thingfaithfully in his own way, which was still, after an hour's trial, notthe way of John McTavish."Mon, what have I told ye?" expostulated John. He had quit callingSharon Sir-r-r. Perhaps his r's were tired, and anyway, Sharon calledhim Sandy, being unable to believe that any Scotchman would not havethis for one or another of his names. "Again I tell ye, th' body mustbend between th' hips an' th' neck, but ye keep jer-r-rkin' the head tolook up.""But, Sandy, I've sprained my back trying to bend from the hips,"protested the plaintive Sharon."Yer-r-r old car-r-r-cass is musclebound, to be sur-r-e," concededJohn. "You can't hope to bend it the way yon laddie does." He pointed toWilbur Cowan, who had been retrieving balls--from no great distance--hitout by the neophyte."Can he do it?" questioned Sharon."Show 'um!" ordered John.And Wilbur Cowan, coming up for the driver, lithely bent to send threeballs successively where good golf players should always send them.Sharon blinked at this performance, admiring, envious, and againhopeful. If a child could do this thing----"Well, I ain't giving up," he declared. "I'll show some people beforeI'm through."He paused, hearing again in his shamed ears the ironic laughter of Rapp,Senior, at the three wild swings he had made before--in an excess ofcaution--he had struck the ground back of the immune ball and raked it apitiful five feet to one side. He heard, too, the pleased laughter inthe background, high, musical peals of tactless women and thefull-throated roars of brutal men. He felt again the hot flush on hischeeks as he had slunk from the dreadful scene with a shamed effort tobrazen it out, followed by the amused stare of Gideon Whipple. And hehad slunk back when the course was cleared, to be told the simple secretof hitting a golf ball. He would condescend to that for the sake, on anear day, of publicly humiliating a certain vainglorious jewellerydealer. But apparently now, while the secret was simple enough totell--it took John McTavish hardly a score of burry words to tell itall--it was less simple to demonstrate. It might take him three or evenfour days."Ye've done gr-r-rand f'r-r a beginnerr-r," said John McTavish, wearily,perfunctorily."I'll tell you," said Sharon. "I ain't wanting this to get out on me,that I come sneaking back here to have you teach me the silly game.""Mon, mon!" protested the hurt McTavish."So why can't Buck here come up and teach me in private? There's openspace back of the stables.""Ye cud do wor-r-rse," said John. "And yer-r-r full hour-r-'s lesson nowwill be two dollar-r-rs.""Certainly, McTavish," said Sharon, concealing his amazement. He couldno longer address as Sandy one who earned two dollars as lightly asthis.There was a spacious opening back of the stable on the Whipple OldPlace--space and the seclusion which Sharon Whipple consideredimperative. Even Elihu Titus was sent about his business when he came toobserve; threatened with an instant place in the ranks of the unemployedif he so much as breathed of the secret lessons to a town now said to becomposed of snickering busybodies. The open space immediately back ofthe stable gave on wider spaces of pasture and wood lot.CHAPTER XIArchaeologists of a future age will doubtless, in their minuteexplorations of this region, come upon the petrified remains of golfballs in such number as will occasion learned dispute. Found soprofusely and yet so far from any known course, they will perhaps giverise to wholly erroneous surmises. Prefacing his paper with a referenceto lost secrets once possessed by other ancients, citing without doubtthat the old Egyptians knew how to temper the soft metal of copper, acertain scientist will profoundly deduce from this deposit of balls, farfrom the vestiges of the nearest course, that people of this remote daypossessed the secret of driving a golf ball three and a half miles, andhe will perhaps moralize upon the degeneracy of his own times, when thelongest drive will doubtless not exceed a scant mile.For three days Sharon sprayed out over the landscape, into idealgolf-ball covert, where many forever eluded even the keen eyes of WilburCowan, one hundred balls originally purchased by the selecter golfingset of Newbern. Hereupon he refused longer to regard the wooden driveras a possible instrument of precision, and forever renounced it. ElihuTitus heard him renounce it balefully in the harness room one lateafternoon, and later entering that apartment found the fragments of ashattered driver.It remained for Wilbur Cowan to bring Sharon into the game by anotheravenue. A new campaign was entered upon, doubtfully at first by Sharon,at length with dawning confidence. He was never to touch a wooden club.He was to drive with an iron, not far, but truly; to stay always in thecentre of the fairway and especially to cultivate the shorter approachshots and the use of the putter. The boy laboured patiently with hispupil, striving to persuade him that golf was more than a trial ofstrength. From secret lessons back of the stable they came at length tofurtive lessons over the course at hours when it was least played. JohnKnox McTavish figured at these times as consulting expert."It's th' shor-r-t game that tells th' stor-r-r-y," said John; andSharon, making his whole game a short game, was presently telling thestory understandably, to the vast pride of the middle man who providedendless balls for his lessons.It was a day of thrills for them both when Rapp, Senior, publiclychallenged and accepting with dreams of an easy conquest, bent downbefore the craft of Sharon Whipple. Sharon, with his competent iron in ashort half-arm swing--he could not, he said, trust the utensil beyondthe tail of his eye--sent the ball eighteen times not far but straight,and with other iron shots coaxed it to the green, where he sank it withquite respectable putting. Rapp, Senior, sliced his long drivesbrilliantly into shaded grassy dells and scented forest glades, where hetrampled scores of pretty wild flowers as he chopped his way out again.Rapp, Senior, made the course excitingly in one hundred andthirty-eight; Sharon Whipple, playing along safe and sane lines, camethrough with one hundred and thirty-five, and was a proud man, andlooked it, and was still so much prouder than he looked that heshuddered lest it get out on him. Later he vanquished, by the sametactics, other men who used the wooden driver with perfect form inpractice swings.Contests in which he engaged, however, were likely to be marred byregrettable asperities rising from Sharon's inability to grasp the nicersubtleties of golf. It seemed silly to him not to lift his ball out ofsome slight depression into which it had rolled quite by accident; notto amend an unhappy lie in a sand trap; and he never came to believethat a wild swing leaving the ball untouched should be counted as astroke. People who pettishly insisted upon these extremes of the game hesneeringly called golf lawyers. When he said that he made a hole innine, he meant nine or thereabouts--approximately nine; nice people, hethought, should let it go at that. So he became feared on the course,not only for his actual prowess but for his matchless optimism incasting up his score. He was a pleased man, and considered golf a goodgame; and he never forgot that Wilbur Cowan had made him the golfer hewas. More than ever was he believing that Harvey D. Whipple had chosenwrongly from available Cowans. On the day when he first made the Newberncourse in, approximately, one hundred and twenty--those short-arm ironshots were beginning to lengthen down the centre of the fairway--he wassure of it.       *       *       *       *       *It must be said that Sharon was alone in this conviction. The othersmost concerned, had he allowed it to be known, would have been amazed byit--Winona Penniman most of all. Winona's conviction was that therejected Cowan twin conspicuously lacked those qualities that would makehim desirable for adoption by any family of note, certainly not byWhipples. He had gone from bad to worse. Driving a truck had been bad.There had been something to say in its favour in the early stages of hiscareer, until the neophyte had actually chosen to wear overalls like anycommon driver. In overalls he could not be mistaken for a gentlemanamateur moved by a keen love for the sport of truck driving--and golfwas worse. Glad at first of this change in his life work, Winona hadbeen shocked to learn that golf kept people from the churches. And theclothes, even if they did not include overalls, were not genteel. Wilburwore belted trousers of no distinction, rubber-soled sneakers of aneutral tint, and a sweater now so low in tone that the preciseintention of its original shade was no longer to be divined. A rowdyishcap completed the uniform. No competent bank president, surveying theensemble, would have for a moment considered making a bookkeeper out ofthe wearer. He was farther than ever before, Winona thought, from acareer of Christian gentility in which garments of a Sabbath grandeurare worn every day and proper care may be taken of the hands.It was late in this summer that she enforced briefly a demand forgenteel raiment, and kept the boy up until ten-thirty of a sleepyevening to manicure his nails. The occasion was nothing less than thesixteenth birthday of Merle Whipple, to be celebrated by an afternoonfestivity on the grounds of his home. The brothers had met briefly andcasually during Merle's years as a Whipple; but this was to be an affairof ceremony, and Winona was determined that the unworthy twin should--atleast briefly--appear as one not socially impossible.She browbeat him into buying a suit such as those that are worn byjaunty youths in advertisements, including haberdashery of supremeelegance, the first patent-leather shoes worn by this particular Cowan,and a hat of class. He murmured at the outlay upon useless finery. Itmaterially depleted his capital--stored with other treasure in a tin boxlabelled "Cake" across its front. But Winona was tenacious. He murmured,too, at the ordeal of manicuring, but Winona was insistent, and labouredto leave him with the finger tips of one who did not habitually engagein a low calling.He fell asleep at the final polishing, even after trying to fix his gazeupon the glittering nails of the hand Winona had relinquished, and whileshe sought to impress him with the importance of the approachingfunction. There would be present not only the Whipples, but theirguests, two girl friends of Patricia from afar and a school friend ofMerle's; there would be games and refreshment and social converse, andWinona hoped he would remember not to say "darn it" any time in such ofthe social converse as he provided; or forget to say, on leaving, what acharming time it was and how nice every one had been to ask him. Hedozed through much of this instruction.Yet Winona, the next day, felt repaid for her pains. Arrayed in the newsuit, with the modish collar and cravat, the luminous shoes and the hatof merit, the boy looked entirely like those careless youths in thepictures who so proudly proclaim the make of their garments. No oneregarding him would have dreamed that he was at heart but a golf caddieor a driver of trucks for hire. Winona insisted upon a final polish ofhis nails, leaving them with a dazzling pinkish glitter, and she sprayedand anointed him with precious unguents, taking especial pains that hisunruly brown hair should lie back close to his head, to show the wave.When he installed her beside him in Sharon Whipple's newest car, pressedupon the youth by its owner for this occasion, she almost wished thatshe had been a bit more daring in her own dress. It was white and neat,but not fancy dressmaking in any sense of the word. She regretted for amoment her decision against pink rosebuds for the hat, so warmly urgedby her mother, who kept saying nowadays that she would be a girl butonce. Winona was beginning to doubt this. At least you seemed to be agirl a long time. She had been a little daring, though. Her stockingswere white and of a material widely heralded as silkona. Still her skirtwas of a decent length, so that she apprehended no scandal from thisrecklessness.When her genteel escort started the car and guided it by an apparentlycareless winding of the wheel she felt a glow that was almost pride inhis appearance and nonchalant mastery of this abstruse mechanism. Shewas frightened at the speed and at the narrow margin by which he missedother vehicles and obtruding corners. When he flourished to animpressive halt under the Whipple porte-cochere she felt a new respectfor him. If only he could do such things at odd moments as a gentlemanshould, and not continuously for money, in clothes unlike those of theexpensive advertisements!She descended from the car in a flutter of pretense that she habituallydescended from cars, and a moment later was overjoyed to note that herescort sustained the greetings of the assembled Whipples and theirguests with a practiced coolness, or what looked like it. He shook handswarmly with his brother and Patricia Whipple; was calm under the ordealof introductions to the little friends Winona had warned him of--twogirls of peerless beauty and a fair-haired, sleepy-looking boy with longeyelashes and dimples.[Illustration: "THE GIRL WAS ALREADY READING WILBUR'S PALM, DISCLOSINGTO HIM THAT HE HAD A DEEP VEIN OF CRUELTY IN HIS NATURE. PATRICIAWHIPPLE LISTENED IMPATIENTLY TO THIS AND OTHER SINISTER REVELATIONS."]These young people were dressed rather less formally than Winona hadexpected, being mostly in flannels and ducks and tennis shoes not toolately cleaned. She was instantly glad she had been particular as toWilbur's outfit. He looked ever so much more distinguished than eitherMerle or his friend. She watched him as he stood unconcerned under thechatter of the three girls. They had begun at once to employ upon himthe oldest arts known to woman, and he was not flustered or "gauche"--aword Winona had lately learned. Beyond her divining was the truth that hewould much rather have been talking to Starling Tucker. She thought he wasmerely trying to look bored, and was doing it very well.The little friends of Patricia, and Patricia herself, could have toldher better. They knew he was genuinely bored, and redoubled theirefforts to enslave him. Merle chatted brightly with Winona, with such aman-of-the-world air that she herself became flustered at the memorythat she had once been as a mother to him and drenched his handkerchiefwith perfume on a Sabbath morning. The little male friend of Merle stoodby in silent relief. Patricia and her little guests had for three daysbeen doing to him what they now tried doing to the new boy; he was gladthe new boy had come. He had grown sulky under the incessant onslaughts.The girl with black hair and the turquoise necklace was already readingWilbur's palm, disclosing to him that he had a deep vein of cruelty inhis nature. Patricia Whipple listened impatiently to this and othersinister revelations. She had not learned palm reading, but now resolvedto. Meantime, she could and did stem the flood of character portrayal bya suggestion of tennis. Patricia was still freckled, though not soobtrusively as in the days of her lawlessness. Her skirt and her hairwere longer, the latter being what Wilbur Cowan later called rusty. Shewas still active and still determined, however. No girl in her presencewas going to read interminably the palm of one upon whom she had, in away of speaking, a family claim, especially one of such distinguishedappearance and manners--apparently being bored to death by the attentionof mere girls.Tennis resulted in a set of doubles, Merle and his little friend playingPatricia and one of her little friends--the one with the necklace andthe dark eyes. The desirable new man was not dressed for tennis, andcould not have played it in any clothes whatever, and so had to watchfrom the back line, where he also retrieved balls. Both girls hadinsisted upon being at his end of the court. Their gentlemen opponentswere irritated by this arrangement, because the girls paid far moreattention to the new man than to the game itself. They delayed theirservice to catch his last remark; delayed the game seriously by pausingto chat with him. He retrieved balls for them, which also impededprogress.When he brought the balls to the dark-eyed girl she acknowledged hiscourtesy with a pretty little "Thanks a lot!" Patricia varied this. Shesaid "Thanks a heap!" And they both rather glared at the other girl--amere pinkish, big-eyed girl whose name was Florrie--who lingeredstanchly by the new man and often kept him in talk when he should havebeen watchful. Still this third girl had but little initiative. She didinsinuatingly ask Wilbur what his favourite flower was, but this got hernowhere, because it proved that he did not know.The gentlemen across the net presently became unruly, and would play nomore at a game which was merely intended, it seemed, to provide theiropponents with talk of a coquettish character. Wilbur ardently wishedthat Winona could have been there to hear this talk, because thepeerless young things freely used the expletive "Darn!" after ineptstrokes. Still they bored him. He would rather have been on the links.He confessed at last to his little court that he much preferred golf totennis. Patricia said that she had taken up golf, and that he must coachher over the Newbern course. The dark-eyed girl at once said that shewas about to take up golf, and would need even more coaching thanPatricia. Once they both searched him--while the game waited--for classpins, which they meant to appropriate. They found him singularly devoidof these. He never even knew definitely what they were looking for.He was glad when refreshments were served on the lawn, and atesandwiches in a wholehearted manner that disturbed Winona, who felt thatat these affairs one should eat daintily, absently, as if elevatedconverse were the sole object and food but an incident. Wilbur ate as ifhe were hungry--had come there for food. Even now he was not free fromthe annoying attentions of Patricia and her little friends. They notonly brought him other sandwiches and other cake and other lemonade,which he could have condoned, but they chattered so incessantly at himwhile he ate that only by an effort of concentration could he ignorethem for the food. Florrie said that he was brutal to women. She wasalso heard to say--Winona heard it--that he was an awfully stunningchap. Harvey D. Whipple was now a member of the party, beaming proudlyupon his son. And Sharon Whipple came presently to survey the group. Hewinked at Wilbur, who winked in return.After refreshments the young gentlemen withdrew to smoke. They withdrewunostentatiously, through a pergola, round a clump of shrubbery, and onto the stables, where Merle revealed a silver cigarette case, from whichhe bestowed cigarettes upon them. They lighted these and talked as menof the world."Those chickens make me sick," said the little friend of Merle quitefrankly."Me, too!" said Wilbur.They talked of horses, Merle displaying his new thoroughbred in the boxstall, and of dogs and motor boats; and Merle and the other boy spokein a strange jargon of their prep school, where you could smoke if youhad the consent of your parents. Merle talked largely of his possessionsand gay plans.They were presently interrupted by the ladies, who, having withdrawnbeyond the shrubbery clump to powder their noses from Florrie's goldvanity box, had discovered the smokers, and now threatened to tell ifthe gentlemen did not instantly return. So Merle's little friend saidwearily that they must go back to the women, he supposed. And there wasmore tennis of a sort, more chatter. As Mrs. Harvey D. said, everythingmoved off splendidly.Winona, when they left, felt that her charge had produced a favourableimpression, and was amazed that he professed to be unmoved by thiscircumstance, even after being told, as the noble car wheeled themhomeward, what the girl, Florrie, had said of him; and that Mrs. HarveyD. Whipple had said she had always known he was a sweet boy. He merelysniffed at the term and went on to disparage the little friends ofPatricia."You told me not to say 'darn,'" he protested, "but those girls all saidit about every other word.""Not really?" said Winona, aghast."Darn this and darn that! And darn that ball! And darned old thing!"insisted the witness, imitatively."Oh, dear!" sighed Winona.She wondered if Patricia could be getting in with a fast set. She wasfurther worried about Patricia, because Miss Murtree, over the icecream, had confided to her that the girl was a brainless coquette; thather highest ambition, freely stated, was to have a black velvet eveninggown, a black picture hat, and a rope of pearls. Winona did not impartthis item to Wilbur. He was already too little impressed with theWhipple state. Nor did she confide to him the singular remark of SharonWhipple, delivered to her in hoarsely whispered confidence as Merlespoke at length to the group about his new horse."Ain't he the most languageous critter!" had been Sharon's words.And Winona had thought Merle spoke so prettily and with such easyconfidence. Instead of regaling Wilbur with this gossip she insinuatedhis need for flannel trousers, sport shirts with rolling collars, tennisshoes of white. She found him adamant in his resolve to buy no furtherclothes which could have but a spectacular value.To no one that day, except to Wilbur Cowan himself, had it occurred thatMerle Whipple's birthday would also be the birthday of his twin brother.       *       *       *       *       *Winona hoped that some trace of the day's new elegance would surviveinto Wilbur's professional life, but in this she suffereddisappointment. He refused to wear, save on state occasions, any of thebeautiful new garments, and again went forth in the cap and dingysneakers, the trousers without character, and the indeterminate sweaterwhich would persist in looking soiled even after relentless washing.Not even for golf with Patricia Whipple would he sound a higher note inapparel. Patricia came to the course, accompanied by the dark girl, whosaid she was mad about golf, and over the eighteen holes each strove forhis exclusive attention. They bored him vastly. He became mad about golfhimself, because they talked noisily of other subjects and forgot hisdirections, especially the dark girl, who was mad about a great manythings. She proved to be a trial. She was still so hopeless at the sportthat at each shot she had to have her hands placed for her in thecorrect grip. The other two were glad when she was called home, so thatPatricia could enjoy the undivided attention of the coach. The coach wasglad, but only because his boredom was diminished by half; and Patricia,after two mornings alone with him, decided that she knew all of golfthat was desirable.The coach was too stubbornly businesslike; regarded her, she detected,merely as someone who had a lot to learn about the game. And the goingof her little friend had taken a zest from the pursuit of thisdeterminedly golfing and unresponsive male. He was relieved when sheabandoned the sport and when he knew she had gone back to school.Sometimes on the course when he watched her wild swings a trick ofmemory brought her back to him as the bony little girl in his ownclothes--she was still bony, though longer--with her chopped-off hairand boyish swagger. Then for a moment he would feel friendly, and smileat her in comradeship, but she always spoiled this when she spoke in hergrand new manner of a grown-up lady.Only Winona grieved when these golf sessions were no more. She wonderedif Patricia had not been shocked by some unguarded expression fromWilbur. She had heard that speech becomes regrettably loose in the heatof this sport. He sought to reassure her."I never said the least wrong thing," he insisted. "But she did, youbet! 'Darn' and 'gosh' and everything like that, and you ought to haveheard her once when she missed an easy putt. She said worse than 'darn!'She blazed out and said--""Don't tell me!" protested shuddering Winona. She wondered if Patricia'speople shouldn't be warned. She was now persuaded that golf endangeredthe morals of the young. It had been bad enough when it seemed merely toencourage the wearing of nondescript clothes. But if it led tolanguage--?Yet she was fated to discover that the world offered worse than golf,for Wilbur Cowan had not yet completed, in the process of his desultoryeducation, the out-of-doors curriculum offered by even the little worldof Newbern. He was to take up an entirely new study, with thewhole-hearted enthusiasm that had made him an adept at linotypes, gasengines, and the sport of kings. Not yet, in Winona's view, had heactually gone down into the depths of social obliquity; but she soonknew he had made the joyous descent.The dreadful secret was revealed when he appeared for his supper oneevening with a black eye. That is, it would have been known technicallyas a black eye--even Winona knew what to call it. Actually it was an eyeof many colours, shading delicately from pale yellow at the edge torichest variegated purple at the centre. The eye itself--it was theright--was all but closed by the gorgeously puffed tissue surroundingit, and of no practical use to its owner. The still capable left eye,instead of revealing concern for this ignominy, gleamed a lively pridein its overwhelming completeness. The malign eye was worn proudly as abadge of honour, so proudly that the wearer, after Winona's first outcryof horror, bubbled vaingloriously of how he had achieved the stigma bystepping into one of Spike Brennon's straight lefts. Nothing less thanthat!Winona, conceiving that this talk was meant to describe an accident ofthe most innocent character, demanded further details; wishing to betold what a straight left was; why a person named Spike Brennon keptsuch things about; and how Wilbur had been so careless as to step intoone. She instinctively pictured a straight left to be something like anopen door into which the victim had stepped in the dark. Herenlightenment was appalling. When the boy had zestfully pictured withpantomime of the most informing sort she not only knew what a straightleft was, but she knew that Wilbur Cowan, in stepping into one--inplacing himself where by any chance he could step into one--had flungoff the ultimate restraint of decency.It amounted to nothing less, she gathered, than that her charge hadformed a sinister alliance with a degraded prize-fighter, a low bullywho for hire and amid the foulest surroundings pandered to the basestinstincts of his fellowmen by disgusting exhibitions of brute force. Asif that were not enough, this low creature had fallen lower in thesocial scale, if that were possible, by tending bar in the unspeakableden of Pegleg McCarron. It was of no use for Wilbur to explain to herthat his new hero chose this humble avocation because it afforded himleisure for training between his fights; that he didn't drink or smoke,but kept himself in good condition; that it was a fine chance to learnhow to box, because Spike needed sparring partners."Oh, it's terrible!" cried Winona. "A debased creature like that!""You ought to see him stripped!" rejoined the boy in quick pride.This closed the interview. Later she refused more than a swift glance ofdismay at the photograph of the bully proudly displayed to her by therecipient. With one eye widened in admiration, he thrust it withoutwarning full into her gaze, whereupon she had gaspingly fled, not evennoting the inscription of which the boy was especially proud: "To myfriend, Mr. Wilbur Cowan, from his friend, Eddie--Spike--Brennon, 133lbs. ringside." It was a spirited likeness of the hero, though takensome years before, when he was in the prime of a ring career now, alas,tapering to obscurity.Spike stood with the left shoulder slightly raised, the left footadvanced, the slightly bent left arm with its clenched fist suggestivelyextended. His head was slanted to bring his chin down and in. The rightshoulder was depressed, and the praiseworthy right arm lay in watchfulrepose across his chest. The tense gaze expressed absolute singleness ofpurpose--a hostile purpose. These details were lost upon Winona. She hadnoted only that the creature's costume consisted of the flags of theUnited States and Ireland tastefully combined to form a simple loincloth. Had she raised the boy for this?       *       *       *       *       *The deplored intimacy had begun on a morning when Wilbur was earlyabroad salvaging golf balls from certain obscure nooks of the coursewhere Newbern's minor players were too likely to abandon the search forthem on account of tall grass, snakes, poison ivy, and other deterrents.Along the course at a brisk trot had come a sweatered figure, with cappulled low, a man of lined and battered visage, who seemed to trot witha purpose, and yet with a purpose not to be discerned, for nonepursued him and he appeared to pursue no one.[Illustration: "THE MALIGN EYE WAS WORN SO PROUDLY THAT THE WEARERBUBBLED VAINGLORIOUSLY OF HOW HE HAD ACHIEVED THE STIGMA BY STEPPINGINTO ONE OF SPIKE BRENNON'S STRAIGHT LEFTS."]He had stopped amiably to chat with the boy. He was sweating profusely,and chewed gum. It may be said that he was not the proud young SpikeBrennon of the photograph. He was all of twenty-five, and his lateryears had told. Where once had been the bridge of his nose was now asharp indentation. One ear was weirdly enlarged; and his mouth, thoughhe spoke through narrowly opened lips, glittered in the morning sun withthe sheen of purest gold. Wilbur Cowan was instantly enmeshed by thisnew personality.The runner wished to know what he was looking for. Being told golfballs, he demanded "What for?" It seemed never to have occurred to himthat there would be an object in looking for golf balls. He curiouslyhandled and weighed a ball in his brown and hairy hand."So that's the little joker, is it? I often seen 'em knockin' up flieswith it, but I ain't never been close to one. Say, that pill could hurtyou if it come right!"He was instructed briefly in the capacity of moving balls to inflictpain, and more particularly as to their market value. As the boy talkedthe sweating man looked him over with shrewd, half-shut eyes."Ever had the gloves on, kid?" he demanded at last.It appeared in a moment that he meant boxing gloves; not gloves in whichto play golf."No, sir," said Wilbur."You look good. Come down to the store at three o'clock. Mebbe you cangive me a work-out."Quite astonishingly it appeared then that when he said the store he wasmeaning the low saloon of Pegleg McCarron; that he did road work everymorning and wanted quick young lads to give him a work-out with thegloves in the afternoon, because even dubs was better than shadow boxingor just punching the bag all the time. If they couldn't box-fight theycould wrestle.So Wilbur had gone to the store that afternoon, and for many succeedingafternoons, to learn the fascinating new game in a shed that servedMcCarron as storeroom. The new hero had here certain paraphernalia ofhis delightful calling--a punching bag, small dumb-bells, a skippingrope, boxing gloves. Here the neophyte had been taught the niceties offeint and guard and lead, of the right cross, the uppercut, the straightleft, to duck, to side-step, to shift lightly on his feet, to stopprotruding his jaw in cordial invitation, to keep his stomach covered.He proved attentive and willing and quick. He was soon chewing gum asSpike Brennon chewed it, and had his hair clipped in Brennon manner. Helived his days and his nights in dreams of delivering or evading blows.Often while dressing of a morning he would stop to punish an invisibleopponent, doing an elaborate dance the while. It was better thanlinotypes or motor busses.In the early days of this new study he had been fearful of hurting SpikeBrennon. He felt that his blows were too powerful, especially that fromthe right fist when it should curve over Spike's left shoulder to stopon his jaw. But he learned that when his glove reached the right placeSpike's jaw had for some time not been there. Spike scorned his efforts."Stop it, kid! You might as well send me a pitcher postcard that it'scomin'. You got to hit from where you are--you can't stop to draw back.Use your left more. G'wan now, mix it! Mix it!"They would mix it until the boy was panting. Then while he sat on a beerkeg until he should be in breath again the unwinded Spike would skip therope--a girl's skipping rope--or shadow-box about the room withintricate dance steps, raining quick blows upon a ghostly boxer who wasinvariably beaten; or with smaller gloves he would cause the inflatedbag to play lively tunes upon the ceiling of its support. After an hourof this, when both were sweating, they would go to a sheltered spotbeyond the shed to play cold water upon each other's soaped forms.There had been six weeks of this before the boy's dreadful secret wasrevealed to Winona; six weeks before he appeared to startle her with oneeye radiating the rich hues of a ripened eggplant. It had been simpleenough. He had seen his chance to step in and punish Spike, and he hadstepped--and Spike's straight left had been there."You handed yourself that one, kid," Spike had said, applying raw beefto it after their rubdown.Wilbur had removed the beef after leaving the store. He didn't want thething to go down too soon. It was an honourable mark, wasn't it? Nothingto make the fuss about that Winona had made. Of course you had to go toPegleg McCarron's to do the boxing, but Spike had warned him never todrink if he expected to get anywhere in this particular trade; not evento smoke. That he had entirely abandoned the use of tobacco at Spike'scommand should--he considered--have commended his hero to Winona'sfavourable notice. He wore the eye proudly in the public gaze; regrettedits passing as it began to pale into merely rainbow tints.But Winona took steps. She was not going to see him die, perish morally,without an effort to save him. She decided that Sharon Whipple would bethe one to consult. Sharon liked the boy--had taken an interest in him.Perhaps words in time from him might avert the calamity, especiallyafter her father had refused to be concerned."Prize fighting!" said the judge, scornfully. "What'll he be doing next?Never settles down to anything. Jack-of-all-trades and good at none."It was no use hoping for help from a man who thought fighting wasfoolish for the boy merely because he would not earnestly apply himselfto it.She went to Sharon Whipple, and Sharon listened even moresympathetically than she had hoped he would. He seemed genuinely shockedthat such things had been secretly going on in the life of his youngfriend. He clicked deprecatingly with his tongue as Winona becamedetailed in her narrative."My great glory!" he exclaimed at last. "You mean to say they mix itdown there every afternoon?""Every single day," confirmed Winona. "He's been going to that low divefor weeks and weeks. Think of the debasing associations!""Just think of it!" said Sharon, impatiently. "Every afternoon--and menot hearing a word of it!""If you could only say a word to him," besought Winona. "Coming from youit might have an influence for good.""I will, I will!" promised Sharon, fervently, and there was a gleam ofhonest determination in his quick old eyes.That very afternoon, in Pegleg McCarron's shed, he said words to Wilburthat might have an influence for good."Quit sticking your jaw out that way or he'll knock it off!" had beenhis first advice. And again: "Cover up that stomach--you want to getkilled?" He was sitting at one end of the arena, on a plank supported bythe ends of two beer kegs, and he held open a large, thick, respectablegold watch. "Time!" he called.Beside him sat the red-eyed and disreputable Pegleg McCarron, whowhacked the floor with the end of his crutch from time to time intestimony of his low pleasure.The round closed with one of Wilbur Cowan's right crosses--started fromnot too far back--landing upon the jaw of Spike Brennon with what seemedto be a shattering impact. Sharon Whipple yelled and Pegleg McCarronpounded the floor in applause. Spike merely shook his head once."The kid's showing speed," he admitted, cordially. "If he just hadsomething back of them punches!""It was a daisy!" exclaimed Sharon. "My suffering stars, what a daisy!""'Twas neatly placed!" said Pegleg."I'm surprised at you!" said Sharon later to the panting apprentice."I'm surprised and grieved! You boys mixing it here every day for weeksand never letting on!""I never thought you'd like it," said Wilbur."Like it!" said Sharon. He said it unctuously. "And say, don't you leton to Miss Penniman that I set here and held the watch for you. I ain'twanting that to get out on me.""No, sir," said Wilbur.Later Sharon tried to avoid Winona one day on River Street, but when hesaw that she would not be avoided he met her like a man."I've reasoned with the boy from time to time," he confessed, gloomily,"but he's self-headed, talking huge high about being a good lightweightand all that. I don't know--mebbe I haven't taken just the right tackwith him yet."Winona thought him curiously evasive in manner. She believed that hefeared the worst for the boy, but was concealing it from her."His eye is almost well where that cowardly bully struck him," she toldSharon. "If only we could get him into something where he could hold hishead up.""He does that too much now," began Sharon, impulsively, but stopped,floundering. "I mean he ain't enough ashamed," he concluded feebly, andfeigned that someone had called him imperatively from the door of theFirst National Bank.From time to time Spike's boxing manner grew tense for a period of days.He tightened up, as Sharon put it, and left a sore and batteredapprentice while he went off to some distant larger town to fight,stepping nonchalantly aboard the six-fifty-eight with his fightingtrunks and shoes wrapped in a copy of the Newbern _Advance_, andshifting his gum as he said good-bye to Wilbur, who would come down tosee him off.Sometimes Spike returned from these sorties unscathed and with money.Oftener he came back without money and with a face--from abrasivethrusts--looking as if a careless golfer had gone over him and neglectedto replace the divots. After these times there were likely to followcomplicated episodes of dentistry at the office of Doctor Patten. Thesewould render the invincible smile of Spike more refulgent than ever.The next birthday of Merle Whipple was celebrated at a time when Spikehad been particularly painstaking in view of an approaching combat. Notonly did he leave his young friend with an eye that compelled thenotice, an eye lavishly displaying all the tints yet revealed byspectroscopic analysis, and which by itself would have rendered himsocially undesirable, but he bore a swollen nose and a split and puffylip; bore them proudly, it should be said, and was not enough cast down,in Winona's opinion, that his shameful wounds would deter him frommingling with decent folk. Indeed, Winona had to be outspoken before sheconvinced him that a birthday party was now no place for him. He wouldhave gone without misgiving, and would have pridefully recounted thesickening details of that last round in which Spike Brennon hadpermitted himself to fancy he faced a veritable antagonist. Still hecared little for the festivity.He saw Patricia from a distance in River Street, but pulled the dingycap lower and avoided her notice. She was still bony and animated andlooked quite capable of commanding his attendance over eighteen holes ofthe most utterly futile golf in all the world. His only real regret inthe matter of his facial blemishes was that Spike came back with themere loser's end of an inconsiderable purse, and had to suffer anotherinfliction of the most intricate bridge work at the hands of DoctorPatten before he could properly enjoy at the board of T-bone Tommy thatdiet so essential to active men of affairs.CHAPTER XIIOnce more the aging Wilbur Cowan stood alone by night thrillingly towatch the arched splendour of stars above and muse upon the fleetingyears that carried off his youth. The moment marked another tremendousepoch, for he was done with school. Now for all the years to come hecould hear the bell sound its warning and feel no qualm; never againneed sit confined in a stuffy room, breathing chalk dust, and compel hiserrant mind to bookish abstractions. He had graduated from the NewbernHigh School, respectably if not with distinguished honour, and thesuperintendent had said, in conferring his rolled and neatly tieddiploma, that he was facing the battle of life and must acquit himselfwith credit to Newbern.The superintendent had seemed to believe it was a great moment; therehad been a tremor in his voice as he addressed the class, each in turn.He was a small, nervous, intent man whose daily worries showed plainlythrough the uplift of the moment, and Wilbur had wondered what he foundto be so thrilled about. His own battle with life--he must have gone outto the fight years ago under much the same circumstances--had apparentlybrought him none of the glory he was now urging his young charges tostrive for. He had to stay in a schoolroom and breathe chalk dust.Whatever the battle of life might be, he was going to fight itout-of-doors; not like imprisoned school-teachers and clerks andbookkeepers in First National banks. Only when alone under that splatterof stars did he feel the moment big with more than a mere release fromtextbooks. Then at last he knew that he had become a man and must putaway childish things, and his mind floated on the thought, off to thosedistant stars where other boys had that night, perhaps unwittingly,become men.He wished that people would not pester him with solemn questions aboutwhat he now meant to make of himself. They seemed to believe that heshould be concerned about this. Winona was especially insistent. Shesaid he stood at the parting of the ways; that all his future hung uponhis making a seemly choice; and she said it gloomily, with frankforeboding, as one more than half expecting him to choose amiss.Judge Penniman was another who warned him heavily that it was time toquit being a Jack-of-all-trades. The judge spoke as from a topless towerof achievement, relating anecdotes of his own persistence underdifficulties at the beginning of a career which he allowed his hearer toinfer had been of shining merit, hampered, it is true, by the mosttrying ill health. Even Mrs. Penniman said that they were expectinggreat things of him, now that he had become a man.The boy dimly felt that there was something false in all this urgency.The superintendent of schools and Winona and the judge and Mrs. Pennimanseemed to be tightly wound up with expectancy about him, yet lived theirown lives not too tensely. The superintendent of schools was notinspiring as a model; the judge, for all his talk, lived a life of fatidleness, with convenient maladies when the Penniman lawn needed mowing.Mrs. Penniman, it is true, fought the battle of life steadily with herplain and fancy dressmaking, but with no visible glory; and Winonaherself was becoming a drab, sedate spinster, troubled about manythings. He wondered why they should all conceive him to be meant for somuch more than they had achieved. Why couldn't he relax into a life suchas they led, without all this talk of effort and planning? It seemed tohim that people pretty much allowed life to make itself for them, andlived it as it came. He was not going to bother about it. Let it come.He would find a way to live it. People managed. Judge Penniman was neverso ailing that he couldn't reach the harness shop for his game ofcheckers. The only person he knew who had really worked hard to makesomething of himself was Spike Brennon.       *       *       *       *       *So he resorted to the golf links that summer, heedless and happy."Without ideals so far as one can read him," wrote Winona in herjournal, underlining the indictment and closing it with three boldexclamation points. He was welcomed effusively to the golf course byJohn Knox McTavish."Good!" said John on the morning of his appearance, which was effusivefor any McTavish.He liked the boy, not only because he drove a sweet ball, but becauseyou could talk to him in a way you couldn't to par-r-r-rties you wasteaching to hold a club proper-r-r-r and to quit callin' it a stick.He caddied that summer only for golfers of the better sort, and forSharon Whipple, choosing his employ with nice discrimination. John hadsaid golf was a grand game, because more than any other game it showedhow many kinds of fool a man could be betwixt his mind and his muscles.His apprentice was already sensitive to the grosser kinds. In additionto caddying he taught the secrets of the game when pupils came tooplenteously for John. But he lacked John's tried patience, and for theideal teacher was too likely to utter brutal truths instead of politeand meandering diplomacies. He had caught perhaps a bit too much ofSpike Brennon's manner of instruction, a certain strained brusquerie,out of pace with people who are willing to pay largely for instructionwhich they ignore in spite of its monotonous repetition. John warned himthat he must soften his clients--butter-r-r 'em up with nice words--orthey wouldn't come back. He must say they was doing gr-r-rand. He didsay it now and then, but with no ring of conviction.Still it was a good summer. Especially good, because all the time heknew he was waiting for that morning in early September when the schoolbell would ring and he would laugh carelessly at what had once been theimperious summons. He thought that after this high moment he might beable to plan his life at least a little--not too minutely.       *       *       *       *       *Late that summer Merle and Patricia Whipple came by appointment to playthe course with him. Merle, too, had become a man--he would entercollege that fall. Apparently no one was bothering about the plan of hislife. And Patricia had become, if not a woman, at least less of a girl,though she was still bony and utterly freckled. They drove off, Patricianot far but straight, and Merle, after impressive preliminaries thatshould have intimidated any golf ball, far but not straight. After hisshot he lectured instructively upon its faults. When he had done theyknew why he had sliced into the miry fen on the right. Then with anexpert eye he studied his brother's stance and swing. The ball of Wilburwent low and straight and far, but the shot was prefaced, apparently, byno nice adjustment of the feet or by any preliminary waggles of theclub."No form," said Merle. "You ought to have form by this time, but youdon't show any; and you put no force into your swing. Now let me showyou just one little thing about your stance."With generous enthusiasm he showed his brother not only one littlething, but two or three that should be a buckler to him in time of need;and his brother thanked him, and so authoritative was the platformmanner of Merle that he nearly said "Yes, sir." After which Patriciaplayed a brassy shot, and they all went to find Merle's ball among theoaks. After that they went on to Wilbur's ball, which--still without atrace of form--he dropped on the green with a mashie, in spite ofMerle's warning that he would need a mid-iron to reach it.They drove, and again Merle lectured upon the three reasons why his ballcame to rest in a sand trap that flanked the fairway. He seemed to feelthis information was expected from him, nor did he neglect a generousexposition of his brother's failure to exhibit form commensurate withhis far, straight drive. His brother was this time less effusive in histhanks, and in no danger whatever of replying "Yes, sir!" He merelyretorted, "Don't lunge--keep down!" advice which the lecturer receivedwith a frowning, "I know--I know!" as if he had lunged intentionally,with a secret purpose that would some day become known, to the confusionof so-called golf experts. Wilbur and Patricia waited while Merle wentto retrieve his ball. They saw repeated sand showers rise over the topof a bunker. From where they stood the player seemed to be inventing anew kind of golf, to be played without a ball. A pale mist hung over thescene."I know just what he's saying," Patricia told Wilbur."Shame on you!" said he, and they both laughed, after which Patriciaglanced at him oftener.It should be said that he was now arrayed as Winona would have him, insummer sports attire of careless but expensive appearance, including asilk shirt alleged by the maker to be snappy, and a cap of realcharacter. The instinct of the male for noticeable plumage had at lastworked the reform that not all of Winona's pleading had sufficed for.Wilbur Cowan at the moment might, but for his excellent golf, have beenmistaken for a genuine Whipple.Merle's homilies continued after each shot. He subjected his own drivesto a masterly analysis, and strove to incite his brother to correctform, illustrating this for his instruction with practice swings thatwere marvels of nicety, and learnedly quoting Braid and Vardon.It was after one of these informative intervals, succeeding abrilliantly topped drive by the lecturer, that Patricia Whipple, full inthe flooding current of Merle's discourse, turned her speckled faceaside and flagrantly winked a greenish eye at Wilbur Cowan; whereuponWilbur Cowan winked his own left eye, that one being farthest from thespeaker. The latter, having concluded his remarks for the moment, wentto find his ball, and the two walked on."He just ought to be taken down," suggested Patricia, malevolently."Think so?" demanded Wilbur."Know so!" declared the girl. "'Tisn't only golf. He's that way abouteverything--telling people things--how to do it and everything. Only noone at our house dares come down on him. Harvey D. and Ella and evengrandfather--they all jump through hoops for him, the cowards! I givehim a jolt now and then, but I get talked to for it.""The boy needs some golf talk--he certainly does," conceded the other."Too bad you're afraid to do it," Patricia said, resignedly.She looked sadly away, then quickly back at him to see if it had taken.She thought it hadn't. He was merely looking as if he also considered ittoo bad. But on the next tee he astonishingly asserted himselfas---comparatively--a golfing expert. He wasn't going to have thissplendid brother, truly his brother for all the change of name, making afool of himself before a girl. Full in the tide of Merle's jauntydiscourse he blazed out with an authority of his own, and in tones soarrogant that the importance of the other oozed almost pitiably fromhim."Quit that! Listen! We've played ten holes, and you haven't made oneclean drive, and I've got off every one clean. I make this course inseventy-three, and you'd never make it in one hundred and twenty the wayyou're going. But every time you stand there and tell me things aboutyour drive and about mine as if you could really play golf.""Well, but my dear chap--" Merle paused, trying to regain some lostspiritual value--"I'm merely telling you some little things about form.""Forget it!" commanded the other. "You haven't any form yourself; youdon't have form until you can play the game, and then you don't thinkabout it. Maybe my form doesn't stick out, but you bet it must be tuckedin there somewhere or I couldn't hit the ball. You don't want to thinkI haven't any just because I don't stand there and make a long speech tothe ball before swatting it.""Well, I was only saying----" Merle began again, but in meekness such asPatricia had never observed in him.Hearing a sound in the background Wilbur turned. She was staging apantomime of excessive delight, noiselessly clapping her thin brownhands. He frowned at her--he was not going to have any girl laughing athis brother--and returned his attention to the late exponent of Braidand Vardon."Here"--he teed a ball--"you do about every wrong thing you could. Youdon't overlook a single one. Now I'll show you. Take your stance,address the ball!"He had forgotten, in the heat of his real affection, all the differencein their stations. He was talking crisply to this Whipple as if he weremerely a Cowan twin. Merle, silent, dazed, meek, did as he was directed."Now take your back swing slower. You've been going up too quick--go upslow--stay there! Wait--bend that left wrist under your club--not outbut under--here"--he adjusted the limp wrist. "Now keep your weight onthe left foot and come down easy. Don't try to knock the ball a mile--itcan't be done. Now up again and swing--easy!"Merle swung and the topped ball went a dozen feet."There, now I suppose you're satisfied!" he said, sulkily, but hisinstructor was not, it seemed, satisfied."Don't be silly! You lifted your head. You have to do more than onething right to hit that ball. You have to stay down to it. Here"--heteed another ball--"take your stance and see if you can't keep down.I'll hold you down." In front of the player he grasped his own driverand rested it lightly upon the other's head. "Just think that clubweighs a hundred pounds, and you couldn't lift your head if you wantedto. Now swing again, turn the left wrist under, swing easy--there!"They watched the ball go high and straight, even if not far."A Texas leaguer," said Wilbur, "but it's all right. It's the firsttime this afternoon you've stayed in the fairway. Now again!"He teed another ball, and the threesomes had become a mere golf lesson,plus a clash of personalities. Wilbur Cowan did all the talking; he wasgrim, steely eyed, imperious. His splendid brother was mute andsubmissive, after a few feeble essays at assertion that were brutallystifled. Patricia danced disrespectfully in the background when neitherbrother observed her. She had no wish to incur again the tightly drawnscowl of Wilbur. The venom of that had made her uncomfortable."See now how you hit 'em out when you do what I tell you!" said theinstructor at last, when Merle had a dozen clean drives to his credit.But the sun had fallen low and the lesson must end."Awfully obliged, old chap--thanks a heap!" said Merle, recoveringslightly from his abjectness. "I dare say I shall be able to smack thelittle pill after this."The old chap hurled a last grenade."You won't if you keep thinking about form," he warned. "Best way toforget that--quit talking so much about it. After you make a shot, keepstill, or talk to yourself.""Awfully good of you," Merle responded, graciously, for he was no longerswinging at a ball, but merely walking back to the clubhouse, where oneman was as good as another. "There may be something in what you say.""There is," said Wilbur.He waved them a curt farewell as they entered the latest Whipple car."But, you know, the poor kid after all hasn't any form," theconvalescent Merle announced to Patricia when they were seated."He has nice hair and teeth," said the girl, looking far ahead as thecar moved off."Oh, hair--teeth!" murmured Merle, loftily careless, as one possessinghair and teeth of his own. "I'm talking about golf.""He lines 'em out," said Patricia, cattishly."Too much like a professional." Merle lifted a hand from the wheel towave deprecation. "That's what the poor kid gets for hanging about thatclubhouse all the time.""The poor kid!" murmured Patricia. "I never noticed him much before.""Beastly overbearing sort of chap," said Merle."Isn't he?" said Patricia. "I couldn't help but notice that." Sheshifted her eyes sidewise at Merle. "I do wish some of the folks couldhave been there," she added, listlessly."Is that so?" he demanded, remembering then that this girl was never tobe trusted, even in moods seemingly honeyed. He spurted the new roadsterin rank defiance of Newbern's lately enacted ordinance regulating thespeed of motor vehicles.Yet the night must have brought him counsel, for he appeared the nextafternoon--though without Patricia--to beseech further instruction fromthe competent brother. He did this rather humbly for one of his station."I know my game must be pretty rotten," he said. "Maybe you can show meone or two more little things.""I'll show you the same old things over again," said Wilbur, overjoyedat this friendly advance, and forthwith he did.For a week they played the course together, not only to the bettermentof Merle's technic, but to the promotion of a real friendliness betweenthis Whipple and a mere Cowan. They became as brothers again, seeming tohave leaped the span of years during which they had been alien. Duringthose years Wilbur had kept secret his pride in his brother, hisexultation that Merle should have been called for this high eminence andnot found wanting. There had been no one to whom he could reveal it,except to Winona, perhaps in little flashes. Now that they were alone ina curious renewal of their old intimacy, he permitted it to shine forthin all its fullness, and Merle became pleasantly aware that thissharp-speaking brother--where golf was concerned--felt for him somethingmuch like worship. The glow warmed them both as they loitered over thecourse, stopping at leisure to recall ancient happenings of theirboyhood together. Far apart now in their points of view, the expensivelynurtured Merle, and Wilbur, who had grown as he would, whose educationwas of the street and the open, they found a common ground and rejoicedin their contact."I don't understand why we haven't seen more of each other all theseyears," said Merle on a late day of this renewed companionship. "Ofcourse I've been away a lot--school and trips and all that.""And I'm still a small-towner," said Wilbur, though delightedly. It wasworth being a small-towner to have a brother so splendid."We must see a lot of each other from now on," insisted Merle. "We mustget together this way every time I come back.""We must," said Wilbur. "I hope we do, anyway," he added, reflectingthat this would be one of those things too good to come true."What I don't understand," went on Merle, "you haven't had theadvantages I have, not gone off to school or met lots of people, as I'malways doing, not seen the world, you know, but you seem so much olderthan I am. I guess you seem at least ten years older.""Well, I don't know." Wilbur pondered this. "You do seem younger someway. Maybe a small town makes people old quicker, knocking round one theway I have, bumping up against things here and there. I don't know atall. Sharon Whipple says the whole world is made up mostly of smalltowns; if you know one through and through you come pretty near knowingthe world. Maybe that's just his talk.""Surly old beggar. Somehow I never hit it off well with him. Toosarcastic, thinking he's funny all the time; uncouth, too.""Well, perhaps so." Wilbur was willing to let this go. He did notconsider Sharon Whipple surly or uncouth or sarcastic, but he was notgoing to dispute with this curiously restored brother. "Try a brassy onthat," he suggested, to drop the character of Sharon Whipple.Merle tried the brassy, and they played out the hole. Merle made aneight."I should have had a six at most," he protested, "after that lovely longbrassy shot."Wilbur grinned."John McTavish says the should-have-had score for this course is amar-r-rvel. He says if these people could count their should-have-hadsthey'd all be playing under par. He's got a wicked tongue, that John.""Well, anyway," insisted Merle, "you should have had a four, because youwere talking to me when you flubbed that approach shot; that cost you acouple.""John says the cards should have another column added to write inexcuses; after each hole you could put down just why you didn't get itin two less. He says that would be gr-r-r-and f'r th' dubs.""The hole is four hundred and eighty yards, and you were thirty yardsfrom the green in two," said Merle. "You should have had--""I guess I should have had what I got. Sharon Whipple says that's theway with a lot of people in this life--make fine starts, and then flubtheir short game, fall down on easy putts and all that, after they geton the lawn. He calls the fair greens lawns.""Awful old liar when he counts his own score," said Merle. "I playedwith him just once."Wilbur grinned again. He would cheerfully permit this one slander of hisfriend."You certainly can't trust him out of sight in a sand trap," heconceded. "You'll say, 'How many, Mr. Whipple?' and he'll say, 'Well,let me see--eight and a short tote--that's it, eight and a tote.' Hemeans that he made eight, or about eight, by lifting it from the roughabout ten feet on to the fairway.""Rotten sportsmanship," declared Merle."No, no, he's a good sport, all right! He'd expect you to do the same,or tee up a little bit for a mid-iron shot. He says he won't read therules, because they're too fine print. I like the old boy a lot," heconcluded, firmly. He wanted no misunderstanding about that, even ifMerle should esteem him less for it.They drove from the next tee. One hundred and fifty yards ahead thefairway was intersected by a ditch. It was deep, and its cruel mawyawned hungrily for golf balls. These it was fed in abundance daily."Rottenly placed, that ditch!" complained Merle as he prepared to drive."Only because you think so," replied his brother. "Forget it's there,and you'll carry it every time. That's what Sharon Whipple does. It'swhat they call psychology. It's a mental hazard. Sharon Whipple saysthat's another thing about golf that's like real life. He says most allthings that scare us are just mental hazards.""Stuff!" said Merle. "Stuffy stuffness! The ditch is there, isn't it,psychology or no psychology? You might ignore a hungry tiger, butcalling him a mental hazard wouldn't stop him from eating you, would it?Sharon Whipple makes me tired." He placed a drive neatly in the ditch."There!" he exploded, triumphantly. "I guess that shows you what the oldgas bag knows about it.""Oh, you'll soon learn to carry that hole!" his brother soothed. "Nowlet's see what you can do with that niblick." He grinned again as theywent on to the ditch. "Sharon Whipple calls his niblick his 'gitter'."Merle, however, would not join in the grin. Sharon Whipple still madehim tired.In the course of their desultory playing they discussed the otherWhipples."Of course they're awfully fond of me," said Merle."Of course," said Wilbur."I guess Harvey D.--Father--would give me anything in the world I askedfor, ever since I was a kid. Horses, dogs, guns, motor cars--notice theswell little roadster I'm driving? Birthday! You'd almost think he looksup to me. Says he expects great things of me.""Why wouldn't he?" demanded the other."Oh, of course, of course!" Merle waved this aside. "And GrandfatherGideon, he's an old brick. College man himself--class of sixty-five.Think of that, way back in the last century! Sharon Whipple never got tocollege. Ran off to fight in the Civil War or something. That's why he'sso countrified, I s'pose. You take Gideon now--he's a gentleman. Any onecould see that. Not like Sharon. Polished old boy you'd meet in a club.And Mrs. Harvey D.--Mother--say, she can't do enough for me! Bores mestiff lots of times about whether I'm not going to be sick or something.And money--Lord! I'm supposed to have an allowance, but they all hand memoney and tell me not to say anything about it to the others. Of courseI don't. And Harvey D. himself--he tries to let on he's very strictabout the allowance, then he'll pretend he didn't pay me the lastquarter and hand me two quarters at once. He knows he's a liar, and heknows I know it, too. I guess I couldn't have fallen in with a nicerbunch. Even that funny daughter of Sharon's, Cousin Juliana, she warmsup now and then--slips me a couple of twenties or so. You should haveseen the hit I made at prep! Fellows there owe me money now that I bet Inever do get paid back. But no matter, of course.""That Juliana always makes me kind of shiver," admitted Wilbur. "Shelooks so kind of--well, kind of lemonish.""She's all of that, that old girl. She's the only one I never do getclose to. Soured old maid, I guess. Looks at you a lot, but doesn't saymuch, like she was sizing you up. That nose of hers certainly does standout like a peak or something. You wouldn't think it, either, but shereads poetry--mushiest kind--awful stuff. Say, I looked into a book ofhers one day over at the Old Place--Something-or-Other Love Lyrics wasthe title--murder! I caught two or three things--talk about rawstuff--you know, fellows and girls and all that! What she gets out ofit beats me, with that frozen face of hers."A little later he portrayed the character of Patricia Whipple in termsthat would have incensed her but that moved Wilbur to little but mildinterest."You never know when you got your thumb on that kid," he said. "She'sthe shifty one, all right. Talk along to you sweet as honey, but all thetime she's watching for some chance to throw the harpoon into you.Venomous--regular vixen. No sense of humour--laughs at almost anything afellow says or does. Trim you in a minute with that tongue of hers. Andmushy! Reads stories about a young girl falling in love with strange menthat come along when her car busts down on a lonely road. Got that bugnow. Drives round a whole lot all alone looking for the car to go blooeyand a lovely stranger to happen along and fix it for her that turns outto be a duke or something in disguise. Sickening!"Two years ago she got confidential one night and told me she was goingto Italy some day and get carried off to a cave by a handsome bandit inspite of her struggles. Yes, she would struggle--not! Talk about mentalhazards, she's one, all right! She'll make it lively for that familysome day. With Harvey D. depending on me a lot, I'm expecting to have noend of trouble with her when she gets to going good. Of course she'sonly a kid now, but you can plot her curve easy. One of these kindthat'll say one thing and mean another. And wild? Like that time whenshe started to run off and found us in the graveyard---remember?"They laughed about this, rehearsing that far-off day with itsvicissitudes and sudden fall of wealth."That was the first day the Whipples noticed me," said Merle. "I madesuch a good impression on them they decided to take me."At another time they talked of their future. Wilbur was hazy about hisown. He was going to wait and see. Merle was happily definite."I'll tell you," said he when they had played out the last hole oneday, "it's like this. I feel the need to express my best thoughts inwriting, so I've decided to become a great writer--you know, take upliterature. I don't mean poetry or muck of that sort--seriousliterature. Of course Harvey D. talks about my taking charge of theWhipple interests, but I'll work him round. Big writers aresomebody--not bankers and things like that. You could be the biggestkind of a banker, and people would never know it or think much about it.Writers are different. They get all kinds of notice. I don't know justwhat branch of writing I'll take up first, but I'll find out at college.Anyway, not mucky stories about a handsome stranger coming along justbecause a girl's car busts down. I'll pick out something dignified, youbet!""I bet you will," said his admiring brother. "I bet you'll get a lot ofnotice.""Oh"--Merle waved an assenting hand--"naturally, after I get startedgood."CHAPTER XIIIOn a certain morning in early September Wilbur Cowan idled on RiverStreet, awaiting a summons. The day was sunny and spacious, yet hardly,he thought, could it contain his new freedom. Despairing groups ofhalf-grown humans, still in slavery, hastened by him to their hatefultasks. He watched them pityingly, and when the dread bell rang, causingstragglers to bound forward in a saving burst of speed, he haltedleisurely in sheer exultation. The ecstasy endured a full five minutes,until a last tap of the bell tolled the knell of the tardy. It had beenworth waiting for. This much of his future he had found worth planning.He pictured the unfortunates back in the old room, breathing chalk dust,vexed with foolish problems, tormented by discipline. He was never againto pass a public school save with a sensation of shuddering relief. Hehad escaped into his future, and felt no concern about what it shouldoffer him. It was enough to have escaped.Having savoured freedom another ten minutes, he sauntered over to the_Advance_ office as a favour to Sam Pickering. A wastrel printer had thenight before been stricken with the wanderlust, deciding at five-thirtyto take the six-fifty-eight for other fields of endeavour, and WilburCowan had graciously consented to bridge a possible gap.He strolled into the dusty, disordered office and eased the worry fromSam Pickering's furrowed brow by attacking the linotype in spiritedfashion. That week he ran off the two editions of the paper. A spottedsmall boy sat across the press bed from him to ink the forms. Heconfided impressively to this boy that when the last paper was printedthe bronze eagle would flap its wings three times and scream as asignal for beer to be brought from Vielhaber's. The boy widened eyes ofutter belief upon him, and Wilbur Cowan once more felt all his years.But he was still lamentably indecisive about his future, and when a newprinter looked in upon the _Advance_ he stepped aside. Whatever he wasgoing to make of himself it wouldn't be someone who had to sit downindoors. He would be slave to no linotype until they were kept in theopen. He told Sam Pickering this in so many words.The former Mansion's stable at length engaged his wandering fancy. Thestable's old swinging sign--a carefully painted fop with flowing sidewhiskers and yellow topcoat swiftly driving a spirited horse to a neatred-wheeled run-about--had been replaced by First-Class Garage. Of itsformer activities remained only three or four sedate horses to be drivenby conservatives; and Starling Tucker, who lived, but lived in the past,dazed and unbelieving--becoming vivacious only in speech, beginning, "Iremember when--"These memories dealt with a remote time, when a hawse was a hawse, andyou couldn't have it put all over you by a lot of slick young smartiesthat could do a few things with a monkey wrench. Starling, when he thusdiscoursed, sat chiefly in the little office before the rusty stove,idly flicking his memory with a buggy whip from the rack above his head,where reposed a dozen choice whips soon to become mere museum pieces.Wilbur's connection with this thriving establishment was both profitableand entertaining. Judge Penniman divined the truth of it."He don't work--he just plays!"He played with disordered motors and unerringly put them right. But heseemed to lack steadiness of purpose. He would leave an ailing car tohelp out Sam Pickering, or he would leave for a round of golf withSharon Whipple, Sharon complaining that other people were nothing butdoggoned golf lawyers; and he would insist upon time off at threeo'clock each afternoon to give Spike Brennon his work-out. Spike hadlaboured to develop other talent in Newbern, but with ill success. Whenyou got 'em learned a little about the game they acted like a lot ofsissies over a broken nose or a couple of front teeth out or something.What he wanted was lads that would get the beak straightened, prettynear as good as new, or proper gold ones put in, and come back lookingfor more trouble. Wilbur Cowan alone he had found dependable.Even so, the monotony of mere car repairing began to irk him. It wasthen he formed a pleasant alliance with old Porter Howgill, whose repairshop was across the street from the First-Class Garage. Porter'sswinging sign, weathered and ancient like that of the Mansion's stable,said in bold challenge, "Ask me! I do everything!" And once Porter haddone everything. Now there were a number of things he couldn't do, evenwhen asked. He was aging and knotted with rheumatism, and his failingeyes did not now suffice for many of the nicer jobs.Wilbur Cowan came to him and, even as had Porter in the days when thesign was bright, did everything. It was a distinct relief to puzzle overa sewing machine after labouring with too easily diagnosed motortroubles, or to restore a bit of marquetry in a table, or play at a featof locksmithing. The First-Class Garage urged him to quit fiddling roundand become its foreman, but this glittering offer he refused. It was toomuch like settling down to your future."Got his father's vagabond blood in his veins," declared Judge Penniman."Crazy, too, like his father. You can't tell me Dave Cowan was in hisright mind when the Whipples offered, in so many words, to set him up inany business he wanted to name, and pay all expenses, and he spurned 'emlike so much dirt beneath his heel. Acted like a crazy loon is what Isay, and this Jack-of-all-trades is showing the strain. Mark my words,they'll both end their days in a madhouse!"No one did mark his words. Not even Winona, to whom they were utteredwith the air of owlish, head-snapping wisdom which marked so many of theinvalid's best things. She was concerned only with the failure of Wilburto select a seemly occupation. His working dress was again careless; hereeked with oil, and his hands--hard, knotty hands--seemed to bepermanently grimed. Even Lyman Teaford managed his thriving flour andfeed business, with a butter and eggs and farm produce department, inthe garments of a gentleman. True, he often worked with his coat off,but he removed his cuffs and carefully protected the sleeves of hiswhite shirt with calico oversleeves held in place by neat elastics. Onceaway from the store he might have been anybody--even a banker.Winona sought to enlist Lyman's help in the matter of Wilbur's future.Lyman was flaccid in the matter. The boy had once stolen into thePenniman parlour while Lyman and Winona were out rifling the ice box ofdelicacies, and enticed by the glitter of Lyman's flute had thrillinglytaken it into his hands to see what made it go, dropping it in hispanic, from the centre table to the floor, when he heard their returningsteps. Lyman had never felt the same toward Wilbur after that. Now, evenunder the blandishments of Winona, he was none too certain that he wouldmake a capable flour and feed merchant. Wilbur himself, to whom thepossibility was broached, proved all too certain that he would engage inno mercantile pursuit whatever; surely none in which he might beassociated ever so remotely with Lyman Teaford, whom for no reason hehad always viewed with profound dislike. This incident closed almostbefore it opened.Winona again approached Sharon Whipple in Wilbur's behalf. But Sharonwas not enough depressed by the circumstance that Wilbur's work was hardon clothes, or that tasks were chosen at random and irregularly toiledat."Let him alone," advised Sharon. "Pretty soon he'll harden and settle.Besides, he's getting his education. He ain't educated yet.""Education?" demanded Winona, incredulous. "But he's left school!""He'll get it out of school. Only kind ever I got. He's educatinghimself every day. Never mind his clothes. Right clothes are only rightwhen they fit your job. Give the boy a chance to find himself. He'sstill young, Buck is--still in the gristle."Winona winced at "gristle." It seemed so physiological--almost coarse.       *       *       *       *       *A year went by in which Wilbur was perforce left to his self-education,working for Porter Howgill or at the garage or for Sam Pickering as helisted. "I'm making good money," was his steady rejoinder to Winona'shectoring."As if money were everything," wrote Winona in her journal, where sheput the case against him.Then when she had ceased to hope better things for him Wilbur Cowanseemed to waken. There were signs and symptoms Winona thus construed. Hebecame careful in his attire, bought splendid new garments. His lean,bold jaw was almost daily smoothed by the razor of Don Paley, and Winonadiscovered a flask of perfume on his bureau in the little house. Thelabel was Heart of Flowers. It was perhaps a more florid essence thanWinona would have chosen, having a downright vigour of assertion thatleft one in no doubt of its presence; but it was infinitely superior tothe scent of machine oil or printer's ink which had far too oftenbetrayed the boy's vicinity.Now, too, he wore his young years with a new seriousness; was morerestrained of speech, with intervals of apparently lofty meditation.Winona rejoiced at these evidences of an awakening soul. The boy mightafter all some day become one of the better sort. She felt sure of thiswhen he sought her of his own free will and awkwardly invited her tobeautify his nails. He who had aforetime submitted to the ordeal underprotest; who had sworn she should never again so torture him! Surely hewas striving at last to be someone people would care to meet.Poor Winona did not dream that a great love had come into Wilbur Cowan'slife; a deep and abiding love that bathed all his world in colourfulradiance and moved him to those surface elegances for which all her ownpleading had been in vain. Not even when he asked her one night--whileshe worked with buffer and orange-wood stick--if she believed in love atfirst sight did she suspect the underlying dynamics, the trueinebriating factor of this reform. He put the query with elaborate anddeceiving casualness, having cleared a road to it with remarks upon acircumspect historical romance that Winona had read to him; and she hadmerely said that she supposed it often did happen that way, though itwere far better that true love come gently into one's life, based upon aprofound mutual respect and esteem which would endure through long yearsof wedded life.Wilbur had questioned this, but so cautiously and quite impersonallythat Winona could not suspect his interest in the theme to be more thanacademic. She believed she had convinced him that love at first sight,so-called, is not the love one reads about in the better sort ofliterature. She was not alarmed--not even curious. In her very presencethe boy had trifled with his great secret and she had not known!So continuously had Winona dwelt in the loftier realms of social andspiritual endeavour, it is doubtful if she knew that an organizationknown as the Friday Night Social Club was doing a lot to make lifebrighter for those of Newbern's citizens who were young and sportive andyet not precisely people of the better sort. In the older days of thetown, when Winona was twenty, there was but one social set. Now she wasthirty, and there were two sets. She knew the town had grown; onenowadays saw strange people that one did not know, even many one wouldnot care to know. If she had been told that the Friday Night Social Clubmet weekly in Knights of Pythias Hall to dance those sinister new dancesthat the city papers were so outspoken about she would have consideredit an affair of the underworld, about which the less said the letter.Had it been disclosed to her that Wilbur Cowan, under the chaperonage ofEdward--Spike--Brennon, 133 lbs., ringside, had become an addict ofthese affairs, a determined and efficient exponent of the weird newsteps--"a good thing for y'r footwork," Spike had said--she would haveconsidered he had plumbed the profoundest depths of social ignominy. Yetso it was. Each Friday night he danced. He liked it, and while hedisported himself from the lightest of social motives love came to him;the world was suddenly a place of fixed rainbows, and dancing--withher--no longer a gladsome capering, but a holy rite.On a certain Friday evening unstarred by any portent she had burst uponhis yielding eyes. Instantly he could have told Winona more than shewould ever know about love at first sight. A creature of rounded beauty,peerlessly blonde, her mass of hair elaborately coifed and bound abouther pale brow with a fillet of sable velvet. He saw her first in thedance, sumptuously gowned, regal, yet blithe, yielding as might agoddess to the mortal embrace of Bill Bardin as they fox-trotted to theviol's surge. He was stricken dumb until the dance ended. Then hegripped an arm of Spike Brennon, who had stood by him against the wall,"looking 'em over," as Spike had put it."Look!" he urged in tones hushed to the wonder of her. Spike had looked."Gee!" breathed the stricken one mechanically. He would not have chosenthe word, but it formed a vent for his emotion."Bleached blonde," said Spike after a sharper scrutiny of the fair one,who now coquetted with a circle of gallants."Isn't she?" exclaimed the new lover, admiringly.With so golden a result to dazzle him, was he to quarrel pettishly withthe way it had been wrought?"Do you suppose I could be introduced to her?" demanded Wilbur, timidly.This marked the depth of his passion. He was too good a dancer to talksuch nonsense ordinarily."Surest thing you know," said Spike. "Could you be introduced to her?In a split second! Come on!""But you don't know her yourself?" Wilbur hung back."Stop your kiddin'!"Spike half dragged his fearful charge across the floor, not too subtlyshouldered a way between Bill Bardin and Terry Stamper, bowed gracefullyto the strange beauty, and said, "Hello, sister! Shake hands with myfriend, Kid Cowan.""Pleased to meet you!" She smiled graciously upon Wilbur and extended arichly jewelled hand, which he timidly pressed. Then she turned to SpikeBrennon. "I know your name, all right," she declared. "You're thatMister Fresh we hear so much about--giving introductions to parties youain't met yourself."Wilbur Cowan blushed for Spike's _faux pas_, looking to see him slinkoff abashed, but there were things he had yet to learn about his friend."Just for that," said Spike, "I'll take this dance with you." Andbrazenly he encircled her waist as the music came anew."It's hot to-night," said Wilbur very simply to Terry Stamper and BillBardin as they moved off the floor to an open window.His dancing eyes followed Beauty in the dance, and he was at her sidewhen the music ceased. Until it came again he fanned by an open windowher flushed and lovely face. Her name was Pearl."I wish this night would last forever," he murmured to her."Tut, tut!" said Pearl in humorous dismay, "and me having to be atbusiness at seven A.M.!"Only then did he learn that she was not a mere social butterfly, but oneof the proletariat; that, in truth, she waited on table at the Mansion.Instantly he constructed their future together. He would free her fromthat life of toil."You're too beautiful for work like that," he told her.Pearl eyed him with sudden approval."You're all right, kid. I often said the same thing myself, but no one'sfell for it up to date."They danced, and again they danced."You're the nicest boy in the bunch," murmured Pearl."I never saw any one so beautiful," said Wilbur.Pearl smiled graciously. "I love the sound of your voice," she said.She was wrested from him by Bill Bardin. When he would have retrievedher Terry Stamper had secured her notice. So through another dance hestood aloof against the wall, moody now. It might be only social finessein Pearl but she was showing to others the same pleased vivacity she hadshown to him. Could it be she did not yet understand? Had she possiblynot divined that they two were now forever apart from the trivial world?They danced again."Don't you feel as if we'd always known each other?" he demanded."Sure, kid!" breathed Pearl.It was after still another dance--she had meantime floated in the armsof a mere mill foreman. This time he led her into the dusky hallway,where open windows brought the cool night to other low-voiced couples.He led her to the farthest window, where the shadow was deepest, andthey looked out-above the roof of Rapp Brothers, Jewellery-to a sky ofpale stars and a blond moon."Ain't it great?" said Pearl.He stood close to her, trembling from the faintest contact with herloveliness. He wished to kiss her-he must kiss her. But he was afraid.Pearl was sympathetic. She divined his trouble, and in the deep shadowshe adroitly did it herself. Then she rebuked his boldness."Say, but you're the quick little worker, seems to me!"For a moment he was incapable of speech, standing mute, her warm hand inhis."It's been a dream," he managed at last. "Just like a dream! Now youbelong to me, don't you?""Sure, if you want to put it that way," said Pearl "Come on! there's themusic again."At the door she was taken from him by the audacious mill foreman.Wilbur was chilled. Pearl had instantly recovered her public, orballroom, manner. Could it be that she had not been rightly uplifted bythe greatness of their moment? Did she realize all it would mean tothem? But she was meltingly tender when at last they swayed in the waltzto "Home, Sweet Home." And it was he who bore her off under the witchingmoon to the side entrance of the Mansion. They lingered a moment in theprotecting shadows. Pearl was chatty--not sufficiently impressed, itseemed to him, with the sweet gravity of this crisis."We're engaged now," he reminded her. Pearl laughed lightly."Have it your own way, kid! Wha'd you say your name was?"She kissed him again. Then he wandered off in the mystic night, far overa world reeling through golden moonshine, to reach his dark but glowinglittle room at an hour that would have disquieted Winona. It was thefollowing day that he cheered her by displaying a new attention to hisapparel, and it was before the ensuing Friday night dance that he hadsubmitted his hands to her for embellishment--talking casually of loveat first sight.There followed for him a time of fearful delight, not unmarred by spellsof troubled wonder. Pearl was not exclusively enough his. She dancedwith other men; she chatted with them as with her peers. She seemed evento encourage their advances. He would have preferred that she foundthese repulsive, but she continued gay, even hard, under his chiding."Tut, tut! I been told I got an awfully feminine nature. A girl of mytype is bound to have gentleman friends," she protested.He aged under this strain. He saw now that he must abandon his easy viewabout his future. He must, indeed, plan his life. He must choose hisvocation, follow it grimly, with one end in view. Pearl must become hisin the sight abandon his easy view about his future. He must, indeed,plan his life. He must choose his vocation, follow it grimly, with oneend in view. Pearl must become his in the sight of God andman--especially man--with the least delay. He delighted Sam Pickering bycontinuing steadily at the linotype for five consecutive weeks, whilebusiness piled up at the First-Class Garage and old Porter Howgill wasasked vainly to do everything.Then on a fateful night Lyman Teaford assumed a new and disquietingvalue in his life. Lyman Teaford, who for a dozen years had gone withWinona Penniman faithfully if not spectacularly; Lyman Teaford,dignified and genteel, who belonged to Newbern's better set, had onenight appeared at an affair of the Friday Night Social Club. Perhapsbecause he had reached the perilous forties he had suddenly determinedto abandon the safe highway and seek adventure in miry bypaths. Perhapshe felt that he had austerely played the flute too long. At any rate, hecame and danced with the lower element of Newbern, not oftener withPearl than with others that first night. But he came again and dancedmuch oftener with Pearl. There was no quick, hot alarm in the breast ofWilbur Cowan. Lyman Teaford was an old man, chiefly notable, in Wilbur'sopinion, for the remarkable fluency of his Adam's apple while--with chinaloft--he played high notes on his silver flute.Yet dimly at last he felt discomfort at Lyman's crude persistence withPearl. He danced with others now only when Pearl was firm in refusals.Wilbur to her jested with venomous sarcasm at the expense of Lyman.Women were difficult to understand, he thought. What could her motivebe?The drama, Greek in its severity, culminated with a hideous, a sickeningvelocity. On a Monday morning, in but moderate torment at Pearl'sinconsistency, Wilbur Cowan sat at the linotype in the _Advance_ office,swiftly causing type metal to become communicative about the week'sdoings in Newbern. He hung a finished sheet of Sam Pickering's pencilledcopy on a hook, and casually surveyed the sheet beneath. It was a socialitem, he saw--the notice of a marriage. Then names amazingly leaped fromit to sear his defenseless eyes. Lyman Teaford--Miss Pearl King! Hegasped and looked about him. The familiar routine of the office wasunder way. In his little room beyond he could see Sam Pickeringscribbling other items. He constrained himself to read the monstrousslander before him."Lyman N. Teaford, one of our best-known business men, was last eveningunited in the bonds of holy wedlock to Miss Pearl King, for some monthsemployed at the Mansion House. The marriage service was performed by theReverend Mallett at the parsonage, and was attended by only a few chosenfriends. The happy pair left on the six-fifty-eight for a briefhoneymoon at Niagara Falls, and on their return will occupy the Latimermansion on North Oak Street, recently purchased by the groom in view ofhis approaching nuptials. A wide circle of friends wish them allhappiness."Wilbur Cowan again surveyed the office, and again peered sharply in atSam Pickering. His first wild thought was that Sam had descended to apractical joke. If so it was a tasteless proceeding. But he must begame. It was surely a joke, and Sam and the others in the office wouldbe watching him for signs of anguish. His machine steadily clicked offthe item. He struck not one wrong letter. He hung the sheet of copy onits hook and waited for the explosion of crude humour. He felt that hisimpassive demeanour had foiled the mean intention. But no one regardedhim. Sam Pickering wrote on. Terry Stamper stolidly ran off cards on thejob press. They were all indifferent. Something told him it was not ajoke.He finished the next sheet of copy. Then, when he was certain he had notbeen jested with, he rose from the torturing machine, put on his coat,and told Sam Pickering he had an engagement. Sam hoped it wouldn't keephim from work that afternoon.Wilbur said "Possibly not," though he knew he would now loathe thelinotype forever."By the way"--he managed it jauntily, as Sam bent again over his pad ofyellow copy paper--"I see Lyme Teaford's name is going to be in printthis week."Sam paused in his labour and chuckled."Yes, the old hard-shell is landed. That blonde hasn't been bringing himhis three meals a day all this time for nothing.""She must have married him for his money," Wilbur heard himself sayingin cold, cynical tones. The illumining thought had just come. Thatexplained it."Sure," agreed Sam. "Why wouldn't she?"       *       *       *       *       *Late that afternoon, in the humble gymnasium at the rear of PeglegMcCarron's, Spike Brennon emerged from a rally in which Wilbur Cowan haddisplayed unaccustomed spirit. Spike tenderly caressed his nose with aglove and tried to look down upon it. The swelling already showed to hisoblique gaze."Say, kid," he demanded, irritably, "what's the big idea? Is this murderor jest a friendly bout? You better behave or I'll stop pullin' mypunches."It could not be explained to the aggrieved Spike that his opponent hadfor the moment convinced himself that he faced one of Newbern'sbest-known business men.Later he contented himself with observing Lyman Teaford at NiagaraFalls. The fatuous groom stood heedlessly at the cataract's verge. Therewas a simple push, and the world was suddenly a better place to live in.As for his bereaved mate--he meditated her destruction, also, but thiswas too summary. It came to him that she had been a lovely and helplessvictim of circumstances. For he had stayed on with Spike through theevening, and in a dearth of custom Spike, back of the bar, had sung in awhining tenor, "For she's only a bird in a gilded cage----"That was it. She had discarded him because he was penniless--had soldherself to be a rich man's toy. She would pay for it in bitter anguish."Only a bird in a gilded cage," sang Spike again. An encore had beenurged.At noon the following day Winona Penniman, a copy of the _Advance_before her, sat at the Penniman luncheon table staring dully into a dishof cold rice pudding. She had read again and again the unbelievableitem. At length she snapped her head, as Spike Brennon would when nowand again a clean blow reached his jaw, pushed the untouched dessertfrom her with a gesture of repugnance, and went aloft to her own littleroom. Here she sat at her neat desk of bird's eye maple, opened herjournal, and across a blank page wrote in her fine, firm hand, "WhatLife Means to Me."It had seemed to her that it meant much. She would fill many pages. Thename of Lyman Teaford would not there appear, yet his influence would becontinuously present. She was not stricken as had been another reader ofthat fateful bit of news. But she was startled, feeling herselfperilously cast afloat from old moorings. She began bravely and easily,with a choice literary flavour."My sensations may be more readily imagined than described."This she found true. She could imagine them readily, but could not, intruth, describe them. She was shocked to discern that for the first timein her correct life there were distinctly imagined sensations which shecould not bring herself to word, even in a volume forever sacred to herown eyes. A long time she sat imagining. At last she wrote, but thewords seemed so petty.All apparently that life meant to her was "How did she do it?"She stared long at this. Then followed, as if the fruit of her furthermeditation: "There is a horrid bit of slang I hear from time totime--can it be that I need more pepper?"After this she took from the bottom drawer of her bureau thatlong-forgotten gift from the facetious Dave Cowan. She held thestockings of tan silk before her, testing their fineness, theirsheerness. She was still meditating. She snapped her dark head, perkedit as might a puzzled wren."Certainly, more pepper!" she murmured.CHAPTER XIVA world once considered of enduring stability had crashed fearsomelyabout the ears of Winona Penniman and Wilbur Cowan. After this nosupport was to be trusted, however seemingly stout. Old foundations hadcrumbled, old institutions perished, the walls of Time itself laywrecked. They stared across the appalling desolation with frightenedeyes. What next? In a world to be ruined at a touch, like a house ofcards, what vaster ruin would ensue?It did not shock Wilbur Cowan that nations should plunge into anothermadness the very day after a certain fair one, mentioned in hismeditations as "My Pearl--My Pearl of great price," and eke--from theperfume label--"My Heart of Flowers," had revealed herself but a mortalwoman with an eye for the good provider. It occasioned Winona not evenmild surprise that the world should abandon itself to hideous war on thevery day after Lyman Teaford had wed beyond the purple. It was awful,yet somehow fitting. Anything less than a World War would have appearedinconsequent, anti-climactic, to these two so closely concerned in thepreliminary catastrophe, and yet so reticent that neither ever knew theother's wound. Wilbur Cowan may have supposed that the entire Pennimanfamily, Winona included, would rejoice that no more forever were they tohear the flute of Lyman Teaford. Certainly Winona never suspected that amere boy had been desolated by woman's perfidy and Lyman's madabandonment of all that people of the better sort most prize.Other people, close observers of world events, declared that no real warwould ensue; it would be done in a few days--a few weeks at most. ButWinona and Wilbur knew better. Now anything could happen--and would. Ofall Newbern's wise folk these two alone foresaw the malign dimensions ofthe inevitably approaching cataclysm. They would fall grimly silent inthe presence of conventional optimists. They knew the war was to beunparalleled for blood and tears, but they allowed themselves no morethan sinister, vague prophecies, for they could not tell how they knew.And they saw themselves active in war. They lost no time in doing that.The drama of each drew to a splendid climax with the arrival in Newbernof a French officer--probably a general--bound upon a grave mission.Wilbur's general came to seek out the wife of Lyman Teaford.To her he said in choice English: "Madame, I bring you sad news. Thisyoung man died gallantly on the field of battle--the flag of my countrywas about to be captured by the enemy when he leaped bravely forward,where no other would dare the storm of shot and shell, and brought theprecious emblem safely back to our battle line. But even as the cheersof his comrades rang in his ears an enemy bullet laid him low. I sprangto his side and raised his head. His voice was already weak, for thebullet had found rest in his noble heart."'Tell her,' he breathed, 'that she sent me to my death so that shemight become only a bird in a gilded cage. But tell her also that I wishher happiness in her new life.' Madame, he died there, while weepingsoldiers clustered about with hats off and heads bowed--died with yourname on his pale lips---'My Pearl of great price,' he whispered, and allwas over. I bring you this photograph, which to the last he wore abovehis heart. Observe the bullet hole and those dark stains that discolouryour proud features."Whereupon Mrs. Lyman Teaford would fall fainting to the floor and neveragain be the same woman, bearing to her grave a look of unutterablesadness, even amid the splendours of the newly furnished Latimerresidence on North Oak Street.Winona's drama was less depressing. Possibly Winona at thirty-two haddeveloped a resilience not yet achieved by Wilbur at twenty. She was notgoing to die upon a field of battle for any Lyman Teaford. She wouldbrave dangers, however. She saw herself in a neat uniform, searching abattlefield strewn with the dead and wounded. To the latter sheadministered reviving cordial from a minute cask suspended at her trimwaist by a cord. Shells burst about her, but to these she paid no heed.It was thus the French officer--a mere lieutenant, later promoted forgallantry under fire--first observed her. He called her an angel ofmercy, and his soldiers--rough chaps, but hearty and outspoken--cheeredher as La Belle Americaine.So much for the war. But the French officer--a general now, perhaps withone arm off--came to Newbern to claim his bride. He had been one of theimpetuous sort that simply would not take no for an answer. The weddingwas in the Methodist church, and was a glittering public function. Thegroom was not only splendidly handsome in a French way, but wore ashining uniform, and upon his breast sparkled a profusion of medals. Avast crowd outside the church waited to cheer the happy couple, andslinking at the rear of this was a drab Lyman Teaford--without medals,without uniform, dull, prosaic, enduring at this moment pangs of thekeenest remorse for his hasty act of a year before. He, too, would neverbe the same man again.In truth, the beginning Teaford menage lay under the most unfavourableportents. Things looked dark for it.Yet despite the forebodings of Wilbur and Winona, it began to besuspected, even by them, that the war would wear itself out, as oldDoctor Purdy said, by first intention. And in spite of affectingindividual dramas they began to feel that it must wear itself out withno help from them. It seemed to have settled into a quarrel amongforeign nations with which we could rightfully have no concern. Winonalearned, too, that her picture of the nurse on a battlefieldadministering cordial to wounded combatants from the small keg at herwaist was based upon an ancient and doubtless always fanciful print.Wilbur, too, gathered from the newspapers that, though he might die upona battlefield, there was little chance that a French general would becommissioned to repeat his last words to Mrs. Lyman Teaford of NewbernCenter. He almost decided that he would not become a soldier. Some yearsbefore, it is true, he had been drawn to the life by a governmentposter, designed by one who must himself have been a capable dramatist."Join the Army and See the World," urged the large-lettered legend abovethe picture.The latter revealed an entrancing tropical scene with graceful palmsadorning the marge of a pinkly sun-kissed sea. At a table in thebackground two officers consulted with a private above animportant-looking map, while another pleased-looking private stood atattention near by. At the left foreground a rather obsequious-lookingold colonel seemed to be entreating a couple of spruce young privates todrop round for tea that afternoon and meet the ladies.Had Wilbur happened upon this poster in conjunction with the resolve ofMiss Pearl King to be sensible, it is possible his history might havebeen different. But its promise had faded from his memory ere his lifewas wrecked. He felt now merely that he ought to settle down tosomething. Even Sharon Whipple plainly told him so. He said it was allright to knock about from one thing to another while you were still inthe gristle. Up to twenty a boy's years were kind of yeasty anduncertain, and if he was any way self-headed he ought to be left to run.But after twenty he lost his pinfeathers and should begin to think aboutthings.So Wilbur began to think about things. He continued to do everythingthat old Porter Howgill was asked to do, to repair cars for the Mansiongarage, and to be a shield and buckler to Sam Pickering in time of need.The _Advance_ office became freshly attractive at this time, because Samhad installed a wonderful new power press to print the paper daily; forthe _Advance_, as Sam put it, could be found ever in the van ofprogress.The new press had innermost secrets of structure that were presentlybest known to Wilbur Cowan. No smeared small boy was required to ink itsforms and no surmounting bronze eagle was reported to scream for beerwhen the last paper was run off. Even Dave Cowan, drifting in from outof the nowhere--in shoes properly describable as only memories ofshoes--said she was a snappy little machine, and applauded his son'seasy mastery of it.So the days of Wilbur were busy days, even if he had not settled farenough down to suit either Sam Pickering, Porter Howgill--who dideverything, if asked--or the First-Class Garage. And the blight put uponhim by a creature as false as she was beautiful proved not to beenduring. He was able, indeed, to behold her without a tremor, save ofsympathy for one compelled to endure the daily proximity of LymanTeaford.But the war prolonged itself as only he and Winona had felt it would,and presently it began to be hinted that a great nation, apparentlyunconcerned with its beginning, might eventually be compelled to alivelier interest in it. Herman Vielhaber was a publicly exposedbarometer of this sentiment. At the beginning he beamed upon the worldand predicted the Fatherland's speedy triumph over all the treacherousfoes. When the triumph was unaccountably delayed he appeared mysterious,but not less confident. The Prussian system might involve delay, butPrussian might was none the less invincible. Herman would explain thePrussian system freely to all who cared to listen--and many didattentively--from high diplomacy to actual fighting. He left many of hishearers with a grateful relief that neutrality had been officiallyenjoined upon them.Later Herman beamed less brightly as he recounted tales of Germanprowess. He came to exhibit a sort of indignant pity for the Fatherland,into whose way so many obstacles were being inopportunely thrown. Hecompared Germany to a wounded deer that ravenous dogs were seeking tobring down, but his predictions of her ultimate victory were not lessconfident. Minna Vielhaber wept back of the bar at Herman's affectingpicture of the stricken deer with the arrow in her flank, and would becomforted only when he brought the war to a proper close.It was at this time that Winona wrote in her journal: "General Shermansaid that war is the bad place. He knew."It was also at this time that a certain phrase from a high sourcebriefly engaged the notice of Sharon Whipple."Guinea pigs," said he, "are also too proud to fight, but they ain'tever won the public respect on that account. They get treatedaccordingly."It was after this that Sharon was heard ominously to wish that he werethirty or forty years younger. And it was after this that Winona becameactive as a promoter of bazaars for ravaged Belgium and a pacifist whosewatchword was "Resist not evil!" She wrote again in her journal: "Ifonly someone would reason calmly with them!" She presently becameradiant with hope, for a whole boatload of earnest souls went over toreason calmly with the combatants.But the light she had seen proved deceiving. The earnest souls wentforward, but for some cause, never fully revealed to Winona, they hadbeen unable to reason calmly with those whose mad behaviour they hadmeant to correct. It was said that they had been unable to reason calmlyeven among themselves. It was merely a mark of Winona's earnestness thatshe felt things might have gone differently had the personnel of thisvaliant embassy been enlarged to include herself. Meantime, war wasbecoming more and more the bad place, just as General Sherman had said.She had little thought now for silk stockings or other abominations ofthe frivolous, for her own country seemed on the very verge ofcommitting a frightful error.Some time had elapsed since Wilbur Cowan definitely knew that he wouldnever go to war because of the mother of Lyman Teaford's infant son. Hebegan to believe, however, that he would relish a bit of fighting forits own sake. Winona reasoned with him as she would have reasoned withcertain high personages on the other side of the water, and perhaps withas little success. He replied cryptically that he was an out-and-outphagocyte, and getting more so every time he read a newspaper. Winonawinced at the term--it seemed to carry sinister implications. Where didthe boy hear such words?This one he had heard on a late Sunday afternoon when he sat, contraryto a municipal ordinance of Newbern, in the back room of HermanVielhaber, with certain officials sworn to uphold that ordinance, whodrank beer and talked largely about what we should do; for it had thenbecome shockingly apparent that the phrase about our being too proud tofight had been, in its essential meaning, misleading. Dave Cowan,citizen of the world and student of its structure, physical and social,had proved that war, however regrettable, was perhaps never to beavoided; that in any event one of the best means to avoid it was to beknown for your fighting ways. Anyway, war was but an incident in humanprogress.Dave's hair had thinned in the years of his wandering to see a man atSeattle or New Orleans, and he now wore spectacles, without which hecould no longer have enlarged his comprehension of cosmic values, forhis latest Library of Universal Knowledge was printed in very smalltype. Dave said that since the chemicals had got together to form lifeeverything had lived on something else, and the best livers had alwaysbeen the best killers. He did not pretend to justify the plan, but thereit was; and it worked the same whether it was one microscopic organismpreying on another or a bird devouring a beetle or Germany trying toswallow the world. Rapp, Senior, said that was all very well, but thesepacifists would keep us out of war yet. Doctor Purdy, with whom he hadfinished a game of pinochle--Herman Vielhaber had lately been unable tokeep his mind on the game--set down his beer stein in an authoritativemanner, having exploded with rage even while he swallowed some of thelast decent beer to come to Newbern Center. He wiped froth from hiswaistcoat."Pacifists!" he stormed. "Why don't they ever look into their ownbodies? They couldn't live a day on non-resistance to evil. Every one oftheir bodies is thronged with fighting soldiers. Every pacifist is aliving lie. Phagocytes, that's what they are--white corpuscles--and it'sall they're there for. They believe in preparedness hard enough. See 'emmarch up to fight when there's an invasion! And how they do fight! Thesepacifists belie their own construction. They're built on a fight fromthe cradle and before that."I wish more of their own phagocytes would begin to preachnon-resistance and try to teach great moral lessons to invading germs.We wouldn't have to listen to so many of 'em. But phagocytes don't actthat way. They keep in training. They don't say, like that poor oldmaunderer I read this morning, that there's no use preparing--that amillion phagocytes will spring to arms overnight if their country'sinvaded. They keep in trim. They fight quick. If they didn't we wouldn'tbe here.""These phagocytes--is infantry, yes?" demanded Herman Vielhaber. "Inever hear 'em named before like that.""Infantry, and all the other branches, in a healthy body--and our ownbody is healthy. Watch our phagocytes come forward now, just as thosetiny white corpuscles rush through the blood to an invaded spot. You'llsee 'em come quick. Herman, your country has licked Belgium andSerbia--you can rightly claim that much. But she'll never get anotherdecision. Too many phagocytes."Dave Cowan, who always listened attentively to Doctor Purdy for newwords, was thus enabled to enlighten Winona about her own and otherpeople's phagocytes; and Winona, overwhelmed by his mass of detail--forDave had supplemented Purdy's lecture with fuller information from hisencyclopedia--had sighed and said: "Oh, dear! We seem to be living overa volcano!"This had caused Dave to become more volubly instructive."Of course! Didn't you know that? How thick do you suppose the crust ofthe earth is, anyway? All we humans are--we're plants that have grownout of the cooled crust of a floating volcano; plants that can walk andtalk, but plants just the same. We float round the sun, which is onlyanother big volcano that hasn't cooled yet--good thing for us ithasn't--and the sun and us are floating round some other volcano that noone has discovered yet because the circle is too big, and that one isprobably circling round another one--and there you are. That's plain,isn't it?""Not very," said Winona."Well, I admit there's a catch in it I haven't figured out yet, but thefacts are right, as far as I've gone. Anyway, here we are, and we gothere by fighting, and we'll have to keep on fighting, one way oranother, if we're to get any place else.""I don't know anything about all that," said Winona; "but sometimes Ialmost think the Germans deserve a good beating."This was extreme for Winona, the arch pacifist."You almost think so, eh? Well, that's a good specimen of almostthinking. Because the Germans don't deserve any such thing unlesssomeone can give it to them. If the bird can swallow the worm the birddeserves the worm. The most of us merely almost think."It was much later--an age later, it seemed to Winona--for her country,as she wrote in her journal, had crossed the Rubicon--that she went toattend a meeting of protest in a larger city than Newbern; a meeting ofmothers and potential mothers who were persuaded that war was neverexcusable.She had listened to much impassioned oratory, with a sickening surprisethat it should leave her half-hearted in the cause of peace at anyprice; and she had gone to take her train for home, troubled with amonstrous indecision. Never before had she suffered an instant'sbewilderment in detecting right from wrong.As she waited she had observed on a siding a long, dingy train, from thewindows of which looked the faces of boys. She was smitten with a quickcuriosity. There were tall boys and short boys; and a few of them wereplump, but mostly they were lean, with thin, browned faces, and theywere all ominously uniformed. Their keen young faces crowded the openwindows of the cars, and they thronged upon the platforms to make noisypurchases from younger boys who offered them pitiful confections frombaskets and trays.Winona stared at them with a sickened wonder. They were all so alive, soalert, so smiling, so eager to be on with the great adventure. In one ofthe cars a band of them roared a stirring chorus. It stirred Winonabeyond the calm that should mark people of the better sort. She forgotthat a gentleman should make no noise and that a lady is serene; forgotutterly. She waved a hand--timidly at first--to a cluster of young headsat a car window, and was a little dismayed when they waved heartily inreturn. She recovered and waved at another group--less timidly thistime. Again the response was instant, and a malign power against whichshe strove in vain carried Winona to the train's side. Heads were thrustforth and greetings followed, some shy and low-toned, some with feignedman-of-the-world jauntiness.Winona was no longer Winona. A freckled young vender with a baskethalted beside her. Winona searched for her purse and emptied its hoardinto one gloved hand. Coins spilled from this and ran about theplatform. Hands sprang from the window above her to point out theirresting places, and half a dozen of the creatures issued from the car torecover them for her. Flustered, eager, pleasantly shocked at her owndaring, Winona distributed gifts from the basket, seeing only the handsthat came forth to receive them.Chewing gum, candy, popcorn, figs--even cigarettes--and Winona the firstvice-president and recording secretary of Newbern's anti-tobaccoleague! War was assuredly what Sherman had so pithily described it, forshe now sent the vender back to replenish his stock of cigarettes, andbought and bestowed them upon immature boys so long as her coin lasted.Their laughter was noisy, their banter of one another and of Winona wascontinuous, and Winona laughed, even bantered. That she should banterstrangers in a public place! She felt rowdy, but liked it.There was a call from the front of the train, and the group about hersprang to the platform as the cars began to move, waving her gracious,almost condescending adieus, as happy people who go upon a wondrousjourney will wave to poor stay-at-homes. Winona waved wildly now, beinglost to all decorum; waved to the crowded platform and then to the cloudof heads at the window above her.From this window a hand reached down to her--a lean, hard, brownhand--and the shy, smiling eyes of the boy who reached it sought hers insomething like appeal. Winona clutched the hand and gripped it as shehad never gripped a human hand before."Good-bye, sister!" said the boy, and Winona went a dozen steps with thetrain, still grasping the hand."Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye--all of you!" she called, and was holdingthe hand with both her own when the train gathered speed and took itfrom her grasp.She stood then watching other windows thronged with young heads as thetrain bore them on; she still waved and was waved at. Faint strains ofthe resumed chorus drifted back to her. Her face was hurting with a setsmile.She stumbled back across the platform, avoiding other groups who hadcheered the passing train, and found sanctuary by a baggage truck loadedwith crates of live chickens. Here she wept unnoticed, and wondered whyshe was weeping. Later, in her own train, she looked down and observedthe white-ribboned badge which she had valiantly pinned above her heartthat very morning. She had forgotten the badge--and those boys must haveseen it. Savagely she tore it from its mooring, to the detriment of anew georgette waist, and dropped it from the open window.That night she turned back in her journal to an early entry: "If onlysomeone would reason calmly with them. Resist not evil!" She stared atthis a long time, then she dipped a new pen in red ink and full acrossit she wrote "What rotten piffle!" That is, she nearly wrote thosewords. What she actually put down was "What r-tt-n piffle!"To Wilbur Cowan, in recounting her fall from the serene heights ofpacifism, she brazenly said: "Do you know--when that poor boy reacheddown to shake hands with me, if I could have got at him I just know Ishould have kissed him.""Gee whiz!" said Wilbur in amazed tribute."I don't care!" persisted Winona. "That's the way I felt--he was such anice boy. He looked like you, as if he'd come from a good home and hadgood habits, and I did want to kiss him, and I would have if I couldhave reached him--and I'm not going to tell a falsehood about it for anyone, and I'm--I'm hostile.""Well, I guess pretty soon I'll be going," said Wilbur.Winona gazed at him with strangely shining eyes."You wouldn't be any good if you didn't!" she said, suddenly.It was perhaps the least ornate sentence she had ever spoken."Gee whiz!" said Wilbur again. "You've changed!""Something came over me," said Winona.CHAPTER XVWilbur Cowen had hesitated in the matter of war. He wanted to be in abattle--had glowed at the thought of fighting--but if the war was goingto be stopped in its beginning, what would be the use of starting? Andhe was assured and more than half believed that it would be stopped.Merle Whipple was his informant--Merle had found himself. The war wasto be stopped by the _New Dawn_, a magazine of which Merle had beenassociate editor since shortly after his release from college.Merle, on that afternoon of golf with Wilbur, had accurately forecasthis own future. Confessing then that he meant to become a great writer,he was now not only a great writer but a thinker, in the true sense ofthe word. He had taken up literature--"not muck like poetry, but seriousliterature"--and Whipple money had lavishly provided a smart littlecraft in which to embark. The money had not come without some bewilderedquestioning on the part of those supplying it. As old Sharon said, theWhipple chicken coop had hatched a gosling that wanted to swim instrange waters; but it was eventually decided that goslings were meantto swim and would one way or another find a pond. Indeed, Harvey Whipplewas prouder of his son by adoption than he cared to have known, andlistened to him with secret respect, covered with perfunctory businesshints. He felt that Merle was above and beyond him. The youth, indeed,made him feel that he was a mere country banker.In the city of New York, after his graduation, Merle had comeinto his own, forming a staunch alliance with a small circle ofintellectuals--intelligentzia, Merle said--consecrated to the cause ofAmerican culture. He had brought to Newbern and to the amazed HarveyWhipple the strange news that America had no native culture; that it wasraw, spiritually impoverished, without national self-consciousness; withbut the faintest traces of art in any true sense of the word. HarveyWhipple would have been less shocked by this disclosure, momentousthough it was, had not Merle betrayed a conviction that his life workwould now be to uphold the wavering touch of civilization.This brought the thing home to Harvey D. Merle, heading his valiantlittle band of thinkers, would light a pure white flame to flushAmerica's spiritual darkness. He would be a vital influence, teachingmen and women to cultivate life for its own sake. For the cheap andtawdry extravagance of our national boasting he would substitute achastening knowledge of our spiritual inferiority to the older nations.America was uncreative; he would release and nurse its raw creativeintelligence till it should be free to function, breaking newintellectual paths, setting up lofty ideals, enriching our common lifewith a new, self-conscious art. Much of this puzzled Harvey D. and hisfather, old Gideon. It was new talk in their world. But it impressedthem. Their boy was earnest, with a fine intelligence; he left themstirred.Sharon Whipple was a silent, uneasy listener at many of these talks. Hedeclared, later and to others, for Merle was not his son, that the youngman was highly languageous and highly crazy; that his talk was thecrackling of thorns under a pot; that he was a vain canter--"forevercanting," said Sharon--"a buffle-headed fellow, talking, bragging." Hewas equally intolerant of certain of Merle's little band offorward-looking intellectuals who came to stay week-ends at the WhippleNew Place. There was Emmanuel Schilsky, who talked more pithily thanMerle and who would be the editor-in-chief of the projected _New Dawn_.Emmanuel, too, had come from his far-off home to flush America'sspiritual darkness with a new light. He had written much about ourshortage of genuine spiritual values; about "the continual frustrationsand aridities of American life." He was a member of various groups--theImagist group, the Egoist group, the Sphericists, other groups piquantlynamed; versed in the new psychology, playing upon the word "pragmatism"as upon a violin.Sharon Whipple, the Philistine, never quite knew whether pragmatism wasapproved or condemned by Schilsky, and once he asked the dark-facedyoung man what it meant. He was told that pragmatism was a method, andfelt obliged to pretend that this enlightened him. He felt a reluctantrespect for Schilsky, who could make him feel uncomfortable.And there was the colourful, youngish widow, Mrs. Truesdale, who wrotefree verse about the larger intimacies of life, and dressed noticeably.She would be a contributing editor of the _New Dawn_, having as herspecial department the release of woman from her age-long slavery tocertain restraints that now made her talked unpleasantly about if shedared give her soul free rein. This lady caused Sharon to wonder aboutthe departed Truesdale."Was he carried away by sorrowing friends," asked Sharon, "or did he gettired one day and move off under his own power?" No one ever enlightenedhim.Others of the younger intelligentzia came under his biased notice. Hespoke of them as "a rabble rout," who lived in a mad world--"and Godbless us out of it."But Sharon timed his criticism discreetly, and the _New Dawn_ lit itspure white flame--a magazine to refresh the elect. Placed superblybeyond the need of catering to advertisers, it would adhere to rigorousstandards of the true, the beautiful. It would tell the truth as noother magazine founded on gross commercialism would dare to do. It saidso in well-arranged words. The commercial magazines full well knew thehideous truth, but stifled it for hire. The _New Dawn_ would be honest.The sinister truth about America as revealed in the initial number ofthe brave new venture was that America was crude, blatant, boastful,vulgar, and money-grubbing. We were without ideals beyond the dollar;without desires save those to be glutted by material wealth. It was thehigh aim of the _New Dawn_--said the associate editor, Merle DaltonWhipple--to dethrone the dollar, to hasten and to celebrate the passingof American greed.Not until the second number was it revealed that the arch criminals wereto be found in the exploiting class, a sinister combination,all-powerful, working to the detriment of the common people; anindustrial oligarchy under whose rule the cowed wage slave toiled forhis crust of bread. This number unflinchingly indicted the capitalisticruling class; fearlessly called upon the exploited masses to rise andthrow off the yoke put upon them by this nefarious plunderbund. Theworker's plight was depicted with no sparing of detail--"the slavesgroaning and wailing in the dark the song of mastered men, the sullen,satanic music of lost and despairing humanity."Succeeding numbers made it plain that the very republic itself had beenfounded upon this infamy. Our Revolutionary War had marked the triumphof the capitalistic state--the state that made property sovereign. TheRevolutionary fathers had first freed themselves from English creditors,then bound down as their own debtors an increasing mass of the Americanpopulation. The document known as the Constitution of the United Stateshad been cunningly and knowingly contrived to that end, thus thrustingupon us the commercial oligarchy which persisted to this day. It hadplaced the moneyed classes securely in the saddle, though with finephrases that seemed not to mean this."A conscious minority of wealthy men and lawyers, guided by the geniusof Washington, Franklin, Hamilton, and Madison," had worked their fulldesign upon the small farmer and the nascent proletariat; we had sincebeen "under the cult and control of wealth."After this ringing indictment it surprised no Whipple to read that wehad become intolerant, materialistic, unaesthetic. Nor was it any wonderthat we were "in no mood to brook religious or social dissension." Withsuch a Constitution fraudulently foisted upon us by the money-lovingfathers of the Revolution, it was presumably not to be expected that weshould exhibit the religious tolerance of contemporary Spain or Italy orFrance."Immersed in a life of crass material endeavour," small wonder that theAmerican had remained in spiritual poverty of the most debasing sortuntil the _New Dawn_ should come to enrich him, to topple in ruins anexploiting social system.Now the keen eyes of young America, by aid of the magnifying lenssupplied by Emmanuel Schilsky, would detect the land of the free to bein fact a land of greedy and unscrupulous tyrants; the home of the bravea home of economic serfs. Young America, which fights for the sanctityof life, solid and alive with virile beauty, would revolt and destroythe walls of the capitalistic state, sweeping away the foul laws thatheld private property sacred. They would seek a cure for the falsehoodof modern life in a return to Nature, a return to the self where truthever is. They would war with the privilege and ascendancy of the groupover the individual conscience. Already the exploiting class, as itneared the term of its depleted life, was but a mass of purulence.Society was rotten, the state a pious criminal, the old truths tawdrylies. Everywhere the impotence of senility--except in young America. Wefaced the imminence of a vast breaking-up. The subtlest oligarchy ofmodern times was about to crumble. The revolution was at hand.       *       *       *       *       *A succeeding number of the _New Dawn_ let out the horrid truth about thewar, telling it in simple words that even Wilbur Cowan could understand.Having sold munitions to the warring nations, we must go in to save ourmoney. In short, as the _New Dawn_ put it: "The capitalistic rulingclasses tricked the people into war." It was to be a war waged forgreed. Young America, not yet perusing in large enough numbers the _NewDawn_, was to be sent to its death that capital might survive--thedollar be still enthroned. But the _New Dawn_ was going to see aboutthat. Young America would be told the truth.Two of the Whipples were vastly puzzled by these pronouncements, andnot a little disquieted. Old Gideon and Harvey D. began to wonder if byany chance their boy, with his fine intellect, had not been misled.Sharon was enraged by the scandalous assertions about George Washington,whom he had always considered a high-minded patriot. He had neversuspected and could not now be persuaded that Washington had baselytricked the soldiers of the Revolution into war so that the capitalisticclass might prevail in the new states. Nor would he believe that theframers of the Constitution had consciously worded that document with aview to enslaving the common people. He was a stubborn old man, and notaware of his country's darkness. Perhaps it was too much to expect thatone of his years and mental habit should be hospitable to these newlyfound truths.He was not young America. He had thought too long the other way. Beingof a choleric cast, he would at times be warmed into regrettableoutbursts of opinion that were reactionary in the extreme. Thus when hediscussed with Gideon and Harvey D. the latest number of themagazine--containing the fearless exposure of Washington's chicanery--hespoke in terms most slighting of Emmanuel Schilsky. He meant his wordsto lap over to Merle Whipple, but as the others were still proud--if ina troubled way--of the boy's new eminence, he did not distinguish himtoo pointedly. He pretended to take it all out on Emmanuel, whom hedeclared to be no fair judge of American history. The other Whippleswere beginning to suspect this but were not prepared to admit it eitherto Sharon or to each other. For the present they would defend Emmanuelagainst the hot-headed aspersions of the other."You said yourself, not a month ago," expostulated Harvey D., "that hewas a smart little Jew."Sharon considered briefly."Well," he replied, "I don't know as I'd change that--at least not much.I'd still say the same thing, or words to that effect.""Just how would you put it now?" demanded Gideon, suavely.Sharon brightened. He had hoped to be asked that."The way I'd put it now--having read a lot more of his new-dawning--I'dsay he was a little Jew smarty."The other Whipples had winced at this. The _New Dawn_ was assuredly notthe simple light-bringer to America's spiritual darkness that they hadsupposed it would be; but they were not yet prepared to believe theworst."If only they wouldn't be so extreme!" murmured the troubled Harvey D."If only they wouldn't say the country has been tricked into war bycapital.""That's a short horse and soon curried," said Sharon. "They can't say itif you quit paying for it.""There you are!" said Harvey D. "Merle would say that that's an exampleof capitalism suppressing the truth. Of course I don't know--maybe itis.""Sure! Anyway, it would be an example of capital suppressing something.Depends on what you call the truth. If you think the truth is thatGermany ought to rule the earth you got it right. That's what all thesepacifists and anti-militaries are arguing, though they don't let on tothat. Me, I don't think Germany ought to rule the earth. I think sheought to be soundly trounced, and my guess is she's goin' to be.Something tells me this _New Dawn_ ain't goin' to save her from hercome-uppance. I tell you both plain out, I ain't goin' to have amagazine under my roof that'll talk such stuff about George Washington,the Father of his Country. It's too scandalous."Thus the _New Dawn_ lost a subscriber, though not losing, it should besaid, a reader. For Sharon Whipple, having irately stopped hissubscription by a letter in which the editor was told he should beashamed of himself for calling George Washington a crook that way,thereafter bought the magazine hurriedly at the Cut-Rate Pharmacy andread every word of it in secret places not under his roof.Wilbur Cowan, though proud of the _New Dawn_ because his brother's nameadorned it, had nevertheless failed to profit by its teachings. He wasprepared to admit that America groped in spiritual darkness which the_New Dawn_ would flush with its pure white light; he could not havecontended with any authority that it was not a land of dollar hunters,basely materialistic, without ideals, artistically impoverished, anddevoid of national self-consciousness, whatever that meant. These thingswere choice words to him, nothing more; and he had no valid authority onwhich to deny that the country was being tricked into war by theInterests, something heinous that the _New Dawn_ spelled with a capitalletter. In a way he believed this, because his brother said so. Hisbrother had been educated. He even felt shame-faced and apologetic abouthis resolve to enter the fight.But this resolve was stanch; he wanted to fight, even if he had beentricked by Wall Street into feeling that way. The _New Dawn_ said he hadbeen tricked, and he supposed it was true, even if he couldn't clearlydetect how Wall Street had made Germany pursue the course that made himwant to fight. So far as his direct mental processes could inform him,the only trickery involved had been employed by Germany and SpikeBrennon. Germany's behaviour was more understandable than the _NewDawn_, and Spike Brennon was much simpler in his words. Spike said itwas a dandy chance to get into a real scrap, and all husky lads shouldbe there in a split second at the first call. Perhaps Wall Street hadtricked Spike into tricking Wilbur Cowan. Anyway, Spike was determined.Their decision was made one day after a brisk six rounds of mimicbattle. They soaped and bathed and dried their bodies. Then theyrested--sitting upon up-ended beer kegs in the storeroom of PeglegMcCarron--and talked a little of life. Spike for a week had beenlaconic, even for him, and had taken little trouble to pull his punches.To-day he revealed that the Interests had triumphed over his simplemind. He was going and going quick. He recovered a morsel of gum frombeneath the room's one chair, put it again into commission, and spokedecisively."I'm goin' quick," he said."When do we leave?" demanded Wilbur."I'm leavin' in two days.""We're leaving in two days."They chewed gum for an interval."Way it is," said Spike at length, "I'm nothing but about a fourth-raterin my game. I wasn't never a first-rater. I used to kid myself I was,but handier guys took it out of me. Never was better than a third-rater,I guess. But maybe in this other game I could git to be a first-rater.You can't tell. I still got the use of myself, ain't I? And I wouldn'tbe so much afraid as a guy who never fought no fights at all. It looksgood to me. Of course I don't know much about this here talk youread--makin' the world safe for Democrats, and so forth, but they'scertain parts of it had ought to be made unsafe for Germans. I got thatmuch straight.""Where do we go from here?" demanded Wilbur Cowan."N'York," said Spike. "Enlist there. I got a friend in Tamm'ny will seewe git treated right.""Treated right--how?""Sent over quick--not kept here. This guy is high up; he can get ussent.""Good!""Only thing worries me," said Spike--"sleepin' out of doors. It ain'thealthy. They tell me you sleep any old place--on the ground or in achicken coop--makes no matter. I never did sleep out of doors, and Ihate to begin now; but I s'pose I got to. Mebbe, time we git there,they'll have decent beds. I admit I'm afraid of sleepin' out on theground. It ain't no way to keep your health."He ruminated busily with the gum."Another thing, kid, you got to remember. In the box-fightin' gamesometimes even second money is good. I pulled down a few nice purses inmy time. But this here gun-fightin' stuff, it's winner take all everytime. In a gun fight second money is mud. Remember that. And we ain'tgot the education to be officers. We got to do plain fightin'.""Plain fighting!" echoed Wilbur. "And I'll tell you another thing. Fromwhat I hear they might put me to driving a car, but you bet I ain'tgoing to take that long trip and get seasick, probably, just to foolround with automobiles. I'm going to be out where you are--plainfighting. So remember this--I don't know a thing about cars or motors.Never saw one till I come into the Army.""You're on!" said Spike. "Now let's eat while we can. They tell me overin the war your meals is often late."They ate at T-bone Tommy's, consuming a vast quantity of red meat withbut a minor accompaniment of vegetables. They were already soldiers.They fought during the meal several sharp engagements, from which theyemerged without a scratch."We'll be takin' a lot of long chances, kid," cautioned Spike. "Firstthing we know--they might be saying it to us with flowers.""Let 'em talk!" said the buoyant Wilbur. "Of course we'll get intotrouble sooner or later.""Sure!" agreed Spike. "Way I look at it, I got about one good fight leftin me. All I hope is, it'll be a humdinger."Later they wandered along River Street, surveying the little town withnew eyes. They were far off---"over where the war was taking place," asSpike neatly put it--surveying at that long range the well-rememberedscene; revisiting it from some remote spot where perhaps it had beensaid to them with flowers."We'd ought to tell Herman Vielhaber," said Spike. "Herman's a Heinie,but he's a good scout at that.""Sure!" agreed Wilbur.They found Herman alone at one of his tables staring morosely at anuntouched glass of beer. The Vielhaber establishment was alreadysuffering under the stigma of pro-Germanism put upon it by certain ofthe watchful towns-people. Judge Penniman, that hale old invalid, hadeven declared that Herman was a spy, and signalled each night to otherspies by flapping a curtain of his lighted room above the saloon. Thejudge had found believers, though it was difficult to explain just whatinformation Herman would be signalling and why he didn't go out and tellit to his evil confederates by word of mouth. Herman often found tradedull of an evening now, since many of his old clients would patronizehis rival, Pegleg McCarron; for Pegleg was a fervent patriot whodeclared that all Germans ought to be in hell. Herman greeted thenewcomers with troubled cordiality."Sed down, you boys. What you have? Sasspriller? All right! Mamma, twosassprillers for these young men."Minna Vielhaber brought the drink from the bar. Minna had red eyes, andperformed her service in silence, after which she went moodily back toher post.They drank to Herman's health and to Minna's, and told of theirdecision."Right!" said Herman. "I give you right." He stared long at his beer. "Itell you, boys," he said at last, "mamma and me we got in a hard place,yes. Me? I'm good American--true blue. I got my last papers twenty-twoyears ago. I been good American since before that. Mamma, too. Bothgood. Then war comes, and I remember the Fatherland--we don't neverfurgit that, mind you, even so we are good Americans. But I guess mebbeI talk a lot of foolishness about Germany whipping everybody she fightwith. I guess I was too proud of that country that used to be mine. Youknow how it is, you boys; you remember your home and your people kind ofnice, mebbe.""Sure!" said Spike. "Me? I was raised down back of the tracks inBuffalo--one swell place fur a kid to grow up--but honest, sometimes Igit waked up in the night, and find m'self homesick fur that rottendump. Sure, I know how you feel, Herman."Herman, cheered by this sympathy, drank of his beer. Putting down theglass, he listened intently. Minna, at the bar, was heard to be weeping."Mamma," he called, gruffly, "you keep still once. None of that!"Minna audibly achieved the commanded silence. Herman listened untilsatisfied of this, then resumed:"Well, so fur, so good. Then Germany don't act right, so my own countrygot to fight her. She's got to fight her! I'd get me another country ifshe didn't. But now people don't understand how I feel so. They say:'Yes, he praise Germany to the sky; now I guess he talk the other sideof his mouth purty good.' They don't understand me. I want Germanyshould be punished good, and my country she's goin' to do it good. Thatis big in my heart. But shall I go out on the street and holler, 'Tohell with Germany?' Not! Because people would know I lied, and I wouldknow. I want Germany should be well whipped till all them sheep's headsis out of high places, but I can't hate Germans. I could punish someonegood and not hate 'em. I'm a German in my blood, but you bet I ain't apro-German."Mamma, again I tell you keep still once--and now you boys goin' tofight. That's good! Me, I would go if I was not too old; not a betterGerman fighter would they have than me. I kill 'em all what come till Ifall over myself. You boys remember and fight hard, so we make the worldnice again. I bet you fight good--strong, husky boys like you. And Ihope you come back strong and hearty and live a long time in a world youhelped to put it right. I hope some day you have children will be proudbecause you was good Americans, like mine would be if we had a littleone. I hope you teach 'em to fight quick for their own good country.Now--_prosit_!"They drank, and in the stillness Minna Vielhaber was again heard to belamenting. Herman addressed her harshly:"Mamma, now again I beg you shall keep still once."Minna appeared from back of the bar and became coherent."I wassn't cryin' no tears for Germans--wass cryin' fur them!" Shewaved a damp towel at Herman's guests. Herman soothed her."Now, now--them boys take care of themselves. Likely they have a littletrouble here and there or some place, but they come back sound--I tellyou that. Now you dry up--you make some other people feel that way. Hearme?" Minna subsided."You bet," resumed Herman, "we're Americans good. Mebbe I can't tellpeople so now, like they believe me; it's hard to believe I want Germanswhipped good if I don't hate 'em, but it's true--and lots others besidesme. They come in my place, Dagoes, Wops, Hunnyacks, Swedes, Jews, everybreed, and what you think--they keep talkin' about what us Americans hadought to do to lick Germany. It's funny, yes? To hear 'em say usAmericans, but when you know them foreigners mean it so hard--well, itain't funny! It's good!"And me? Say, I tell you something. If any one say I ain't good AmericanI tell you this: I stand by America like I was born here. I stand by herif she fight Germany just as if she fight France. I stand by her in war,and I do more than that. You listen! Now comes it they say the country'sgoin' to be dry and put me out of business. What you think of that, hey?So they will shut booze joints like that feller McCarron runs, and evena nice place like this. So you can't buy a glass beer or a schoppenRhine wine. What you think? Mebbe it's all talk, mebbe not. But listen!This is my country, no matter what she does; I stand by her if shefights Germany to death; and by God, I stand by her if she goes dry!Could I say more? _Prosit_!"CHAPTER XVIThe next day Wilbur Cowan sought Sharon Whipple with the news that hemeant to do a bit of plain fighting overseas. He found the old man inthe stable, in troubled controversy with a rebellious car. He satstonily at the wheel and at intervals pressed a determined heel upon aself-starter that would whir but an impotent protest. He glared up atWilbur as the latter came to rest beside the car."Well, what now?" He spoke impatiently."I'm going to enlist; I thought I would tell you."Sharon pointed the heavy brows at him with a thumb and uttered adisparaging "Humph!" Then he appeared to forget the announcement, andpressed again on the self-starter, listening above its shrill song forthe deeper rumble of the engine. This did not ensue, and he shifted hisheel, turning a plaintive eye upon the young man."She don't seem to excite," he said. "I've tried and tried, and I can'texcite her."It was an old, old story to Wilbur Cowan."Press her again," he directed. Sharon pressed and the other raptlylistened. "Ignition," he said.He lifted the hood on one side and with a pair of pliers manipulatedwhat Sharon was never to know as anything but her gizzard, though thesurgeon, as he delicately wrought, murmured something about platinumpoints."Try her!" Sharon tried her."Now she excites!" he exploded, gleefully, as the hum of the motor tookup the shrill whir of the self-starter. He stopped the thing and bent areproachful gaze upon Wilbur."Every one else leaving me--even that Elihu Titus. I never thought youwould, after the way we've stood together in this town. I had a right toexpect something better from you. I'd like to know how I'm goin' to getalong without you. You show a lot of gratitude, I must say.""Well, I thought--""Oh, I knew you'd go--I expected that!""Yes, sir," said Wilbur."You wouldn't been any good if you hadn't. Even that Elihu Titus went.""Yes, sir," said Wilbur. He had been waiting to ask Sharon's opinionabout the only troubling element in his decision. This seemed themoment. "You don't suppose--you don't think perhaps the war will bestopped or anything, just as I get over there?"Sharon laboured with a choice bit of sarcasm."No, I guess it'll take more'n you to stop it, even with that ElihuTitus going along. Of course, some spy may get the news to 'em thatyou've started, and they may say, 'Why keep up the struggle if thisCowan boy's goin' in against us?' But my guess is they'll brazen it outfor a month or so longer. Of course they'll be scared stiff."Wilbur grinned at him, then spoke gravely."You know what I mean--Merle. He says the plain people will never allowthis war to go on, because they've been tricked into it by Wall Streetor something. I read it in his magazine. They're working against the warnight and day, he says. Well, all I mean, I'd hate to go over there andbe seasick and everything and then find they had stopped it."Intently, grimly, Sharon climbed from his car. His short, fat leg wentback and he accurately kicked an empty sprinkling can across the floor.It was a satisfying object to kick; it made a good noise and came to aclattering rest on its dented side. It was so satisfying that withanother kick he sent the can bounding through an open door."Gave it the second barrel, didn't you?" said Wilbur. Sharon grinnednow."Just a letter to your brother," he explained. Then he became profanelyimpassioned. "Fudge! Fudge and double fudge! Scissors and white aprons!Prunes and apricots! No! That war won't be stopped by any magazine! Goon--fight your fool head off! Don't let any magazine keep you back!""Yes, sir," said Wilbur."They can't stop the war, because there are too many boys like you allover this land. Trick or no trick, that's what they're up against.You'll all fight--while they're writing their magazines. Your reactionsare different. That's a word I got from the dirty thing--and from thatbrother of yours. He gets a lot of use out of that word--always talkingabout his reactions. Just yesterday I said to him: 'Take care of youractions and your reactions will take care of themselves.' He don'tcotton to me. I guess I never buttered him up with praise any too much.His languageousness gets on me. He's got Gideon and Harvey D. on a hotgriddle, too, though they ain't lettin' on. Here the Whipples havealways gone to war for their country--Revolutionary War and 1812,Mexican War, Civil War, Spanish-American--Harvey D. was in that. Didn'tdo much fighting, but he was belligerent enough. And now this son of hissets back and talks about his reactions! What I say--he's a Whipple inname only.""He's educated," protested Wilbur, quick to defend this brother, evenshould he cheat him out of the good plain fighting he meant to do."Educated!" Sharon imitated a porpoise without knowing it. "Educated outof books! All any of that rabble rout of his knows is what they readsecondhand. They don't know people. Don't know capitalists. Don't evenknow these wage slaves they write about. That's why they can't stop thewar. They may be educated, but you're enlightened. They know more books,but you know more life in a minute than they'll ever know--you got abetter idea of the what-for in this world. Let 'em write! You fight! Ifit rests on that hairy bunch to stop the war you'll get a bellyful offighting. They're just a noisy fringe of buzzers round the real folks ofthis country.""Yes, sir," said Wilbur. "I thought I'd ask.""Well, now you know. Shove off!""Yes, sir." Sharon's tone changed to petulance."That's right, and leave me here to farm twenty-five hundred acres allby myself, just when I was going to put in tractors. That's the kind youare--just a fool country-town boy, with a head full of grand notions.Well, somebody's got to raise food for the world. She's goin' shortpretty soon or I miss my guess. Somebody's got to raise bread and meat.All right, leave me here to do the dirty work while you flourish roundover there seein' the world and havin' a good time. I'm sick of thesight of you and your airs. Get out!""Yes, sir.""When you leaving?""To-morrow night--six-fifty-eight.""Sooner the better!""Yes, sir."Sharon turned back to the car, grumbling incoherent phrases. He affectedto busy himself with the mechanism that had just been readjusted,looking at it wisely, thumbing a valve, though with a care to leavethings precisely as they were.       *       *       *       *       *That afternoon as Sharon made an absorbed progress along River Street hejostled Winona Penniman, who with even a surpassing absorption had beenstaring into the window of one of those smart shops marking Newbern'slater growth. Whereas boots and shoes had been purchased from anestablishment advertising simple Boots and Shoes, they were now soughtby people of the right sort from this new shop which was labelled theElite Bootery.Winona had halted with assumed carelessness before its attractivelydressed window displaying a colourful array of satin dancing slipperswith high heels and bejewelled toes. Winona's assumption of carelessnesshad been meant to deceive passers-by into believing that she looked uponthese gauds with a censorious eye, and not as one meaning flagrantly topurchase of them. Her actual dire intention was nothing to flaunt in thepublic gaze. Nor did she mean to voice her wishes before a shopful ofpeople who might consider them ambiguous.Four times she had passed the door of the shop, waiting for a dullmoment in its traffic. Now but two women were left, and they seemed tobe waiting only for change. Her resolution did not falter; she wasmerely practising a trained discretion. She was going to buy a pair ofsatin dancing slippers though the whole world should look upon her aslost. Too long, she felt, had she dwelt among the untrodden ways. As shehad confided to her journal, the placid serenity of her life had becomea sea of mad unrest. Old moorings had been wrenched loose; she floatedwith strange tides. And Wilbur Cowan, who was going to war, had invitedher to be present that evening at the opening of Newbern's new andgorgeous restaurant, where the diners, between courses and until lateafter dinner, would dance to the strains of exotic and jerky music,precisely as they did in the awful city.Winona had not even debated a refusal. The boy should be gratified. Nordid she try to convince herself that her motive was wholly altruistic.She had suddenly wished to mingle in what she was persuaded would be ascene of mad revelry. She had definitely abandoned the untrodden ways.She thought that reading about war might have unsettled her ideals.Anyway, they were unsettled. She was going to this place of the gaynight life--and she was going right!It was while she still waited, perturbed but outwardly cool, that theabsorbed Sharon Whipple brushed her shoulder. She wondered if her secretpurpose had been divined. But Sharon apparently was engrossed by othermatters than the descent into frivolity of one who had long beenaustere."Well," he said, beaming on her, "our boy is going over."Winona was relieved."Yes, he's off, but he'll come back safe.""Oh, I know that! Nothing could hurt him, but I'll miss the skeesicks."He ruminated, then said pridefully: "That boy is what my son would havebeen if I'd had one. You can't tell me any son of my get and raisingwould have talked about his reactions when this time come!"Winona winced ever so slightly at this way of putting it, but smiledvaliantly."Publishing magazines full of slander about George Washington, and thisnew kind of stubby-ended poetry!""It is very different from Tennyson," said Winona."The other one's a man," went on Sharon. "You remember when you wasworried because he wouldn't settle down to anything? Well, you watch himfrom now on! He hasn't got the book knowledge, but he's got a fineoutdoors education, and that's the kind we need most. Don't you see thatfine look in his eye--afraid of nothing, knowing how to do mostanything? His is the kind makes us a great country--outdoor boys fromthe little towns and farms. They're the real folks. I'm awful proud ofhim, though I ain't wanting that to get out on me. I been watching himsince he was in short pants. He's dependable--knows how. Say, I'm gladhe took to the outdoors and didn't want to dress up every day and be aclerk in a store or a bank or some place like that. Wasn't it good?""Wasn't it?" said Winona, bravely."We need this kind in war, and we'll need it even more when the war isover--when he comes back.""When he comes back," echoed Winona. And then with an irrelevance shecould not control: "I'm going to a dance with him to-night." Her owneyes were dancing strangely as she declared it."Good thing!" said Sharon. He looked her over shrewdly. "Seems to meyou're looking younger than you ought to," he said.Winona pouted consciously for the first time in her hitherto honestlife."You're looking almighty girlish," added Sharon with almost a leer, andWinona suffered a fearful apprehension that her ribs were menaced by hisalert thumb. She positively could not be nudged in public. She must drawthe line somewhere, even if she had led him on by pouting. She steppedquickly to the door of the Elite Bootery."He'll come back all right," said Sharon. "Say, did I ever tell you howhe got me to shootin' a good round of golf? I tried it first with thewooden bludgeons, and couldn't ever make the little round lawns underseven or eight--parties snickering their fool heads off at me. So I saysI can never make the bludgeons hit right. I don't seem to do more'nharass the ball into 'em, so he says try an iron all the way. So I triedthe iron utensils, and now I get on the lawn every time in good shape, Ican tell you. Parties soon begun to snicker sour all at once, I want youto know. It ain't anything for me to make that course in ninety-eightor"--Sharon's conscience called aloud--"or a hundred and ten or fifteenor thereabouts, in round numbers.""I'm so glad," said Winona."I give him all the credit. And"--he turned after starting on--"he'llcome back--he'll come back to us!"Winona drew a fortifying breath and plunged into the Elite Bootery. Shewas perhaps more tight-lipped than usual, but to the not-too-acuteobserver this would have betokened mere businesslike determinationinstead of the panic it was. She walked grimly to a long bench, seatedherself, and placed her right foot firmly upon a pedestal, full in thegaze of a clerk who was far too young, she instantly perceived, fornegotiations of this delicacy."I wish to purchase," she began through slightly relaxed lips, "a pairof satin dancing slippers like those in your window--high-heeled, onestrap, and possibly with those jewelled buckles." She here paused foranother breath, then continued tremendously: "Something in a shade togo with--with these!"With dainty brazenness the small hand at her knee obeyed an amazingcommand from her disordered brain and raised the neat brown skirt ofWinona a full two inches, to reveal a slim ankle between which and anogling world there gleamed but the thinnest veneer of tan silk.Winona waited breathless. She had tortured herself with the possibleconsequences of this adventure. She had even conceived a clerk offorbidding aspect who would now austerely reply: "Woman, how dare youcome in here and talk that way? You who have never worn anything butblack cotton stockings, or lisle at the worst, and whose most daringfootwear has been a neat Oxford tie with low heels, such as respectablewomen wear? Full well you know that a love for the sort of finery younow describe--and reveal--is why girls go wrong. And yet you comeshamelessly in here--no, it is too much! You forget yourself! Leave theplace at once!"Sometimes this improvisation had concluded with a homily in kinderwords, in which she would be entreated to go forth and try to be abetter woman. And sometimes, but not often, she had decided that a shoeclerk, no matter his age, would take her request as a mere incident inthe day's trade. Other women wore such things, and perforce must buythem in a public manner. She had steeled her nerve to the ordeal, andnow she flushed with a fine new confidence, for the clerk merely said,"Certainly, madam"--in the later shops of Newbern they briefly calledyou madam--and with a kind of weary, professional politeness fell to thework of equipping her. A joyous relief succeeded her panic. She not onlydeclared a moment later that her instep was far too high, but fitted atlast in a slipper of suitable shade she raised her skirt again as sheposed before a mirror that reached the floor. Winona was coming on. Hadcome!       *       *       *       *       *Late that afternoon, while a last bit of chiffon was being tacked to adancing frock which her mother had been told to make as fancy as shepleased, Winona hastily scribbled in her journal: "Am I of a gaydisposition? Too gay, too volatile? No matter! It is an agreeable defectwhere one retains discretion sufficient for its regulation. This verynight I am one of a party avowedly formed for pleasure, something myreflective mind would once have viewed with disapprobation. But again nomatter. Perhaps I have been too analytical, too introspective. Perhapsthe war has confused my sense of spiritual values. War is such amistake!"It was a flushed and sparkling Winona who later fluttered down the dullold stairs of the respectable Penniman home at the call of the waitingWilbur Cowan. Her dark hair was still plainly, though rathereffectively, drawn about her small head--she had definitely rebuffed thesuggestion of her mother that it be marcelled--but her wisp of a frockof bronze gossamer was revolutionary in the extreme. Mrs. Penniman hadat last been fancy in her dressmaking for her child, and now stood by toexclaim at her handiwork. Winona, with surprising _aplomb_, bore thescrutiny of the family while she pulled long white gloves along her barearms. A feathered fan dangled from one of them."Now, I guess you believe me," said Mrs. Penniman. "Haven't I alwayssaid what a few little touches would do for you?" Proudly she adjusted afilmy flounce to a better line. "And such lovely, lovely slippers!"The slippers were indeed to be observed by one and all. The shortdancing frock was in that year.Wilbur Cowan was appreciative."Some kid!" he cried; "an eyeful!"Winona pouted for the second time that day, instead of rebuking him forthese low phrases of the street. Only Judge Penniman caviled."Well, I'd like to know what we're coming to," he grumbled. "The idee ofa mere chit like her goin' out to a place that's no better than asaloon, even if you do guzzle your drinks at a table--and in a dug-outdress!"Winona, instead of feeling rebuked, was gratified to be called a merechit. She pouted at the invalid."Poor father!" she loftily murmured, and stood while her mother threwthe evening cloak about her acceptable shoulders.It was true that at the La Boheme alcoholic stimulant would be served tothose who desired it, but this was not compulsory, and the place was inno sense a common saloon. Her father was old-fashioned, as he had shownhimself to be about the lawless new dance steps that Wilbur had beenteaching her. He had declared that if people performed such antics inpublic without music they'd mighty soon find themselves in the lockup,and Winona had not even shuddered. Now, as he continued to grumble atthis degeneracy, she gracefully tapped his arm with her fan. She hadread of this device being effectively employed by certain conquerors ofmen, and coolly she tried it upon her father. She performed the triflegracefully, and it seemed of value audacious and yet nothing to bemisunderstood by a really clean-minded man. She tapped the judge againas they left, with a minor variation of the technic. The judge littleknew that he but served as a dummy at target practice.The car in which Wilbur conveyed his guest to the scene of revelry wasnot of an elegance commensurate with Winona's. It was a mongrel of manymakes, small, battered, and of a complaining habit. He had acquired itas a gift from one who considered that he bestowed trash, and hadtransformed it into a thing of noisy life, knowing, as a mother knows ofher infant, what each of its squeaks and rattles implied. It wasdistressing, in truth, to look upon, but it went. Indeed, the proudowner had won a race with it from a too-outspoken critic who drove amuch superior car. It was Wilbur Cowan who first in Newbern discoveredthat you could speed up a car by dropping a few moth balls into thegasoline tank. He called his car the Can, but, unreasonably, was not toocordial to others using the name.The Can bore the pair to a fretful halt under the newest electriclights on River Street. "The La Boheme" read the dazzling sign. AndWinona passed into her new life. She was feeling strangely young as sherelinquished her cloak to a uniformed maid. She stood amid exoticsplendour, and was no longer herself but some regal creature in theSunday supplement of a great city paper. She had always wanted to be agirl, but had not known how--and now at thirty-five how easy it seemed!She preceded Wilbur to a table for two, impressive with crystal anddamask, and was seated by an obsequious foreigner who brought to the acta manner that had never before in Newbern distinguished thisservice--when it had been performed at all.Other tables about them were already filled with Newbern's elect,thrilled as was Winona, concealing it as ably as she, with the town'snew distinction. Hardly had food been ordered when a hidden orchestrablared and the oblong polished space of which their own table formedpart of the border was thronged with dancing couples. Winona glowinglysurrendered to the evil spell. Wilbur merely looked an invitation andshe was dancing as one who had always danced. She tapped him with herfan as he led her back to the table where their first course hadarrived. She trifled daintily with strange food, composing a sentencefor her journal: "The whole scene was of a gayety hitherto unparalleledin the annals of our little town."There was more food, interspersed with more dancing. Later Winona, aftermany sidewise perkings of her brown head, discovered Merle and PatriciaWhipple at a neighbouring table. She nodded and smiled effusively tothem. Patricia returned her greeting gayly; Merle removed a shiningcigarette holder of remarkable length and bowed, but did not smile. Heseemed to be aloof and gloomy."He's got a lot on his mind," said Wilbur, studying his brotherrespectfully.Merle's plenteous hair, like his cigarette holder, was longer than iscommonly worn by his sex, and marked by a certain not infelicitousdisorder. He had trouble with a luxuriant lock of it that persistentlyfell across his pale brow. With a weary, world-worn gesture he absentlybrushed this back into place from moment to moment. His thick eyeglasseswere suspended by a narrow ribbon of black satin. His collar was low andhis loosely tied cravat was flowing of line."Out of condition," said Wilbur, expertly. "Looks pasty.""But very, very distinguished," supplemented Winona.Patricia Whipple now came to their table with something like a dancestep, though the music was stilled. She had been away from Newbern fortwo years."Europe and Washington," she hurriedly explained as Wilbur held a chairfor her, "and glad to get back--but I'm off again. Nurse! Begin thecourse next week in New York--learning how to soothe the bed of pain. Iknow I'm a rattlepate, but that's what I'm going to do. All of us madabout the war."Wilbur studied her as he had studied Merle. She was in better condition,he thought. She came only to his shoulder as he stood to seat her, butshe was no longer bony. Her bones were neatly submerged. Her hair wasstill rusty, the stain being deeper than he remembered, and the freckleswere but piquant memories. Here and there one shone faintly, like thefew faint stars showing widely apart through cloud crevices on a murkynight. Her nose, though no longer precisely trivial, would never be theWhipple nose. Its lines were now irrevocably set in a design far lessnoble. Her gown was shining, of an elusive shade that made Wilbur thinkof ripe fruits--chiefly apricots, he decided. She was unquestionablywhat she had confessed herself to be--a rattlepate. She rattled now,with a little waiting, half-tremulous smile to mark her pauses, as ifshe knew people would weigh and find her wanting, but hoped forjudgments tempered with mercy."Mad about the war? I should think so! Grandpa Gideon mad, and HarveyD.--that dear thing's going to do something at Washington for a dollar ayear. You'd think it was the only honest money he'd ever earned if youheard Merle talk about bankers sucking the life blood of the people.Juliana taking charge of something and Mother Ella mad aboutknitting--always tangled in yarn. She'll be found strangled in her ownwork some day. And Uncle Sharon mad about the war, and fifty timesmadder about Merle."D'you see Merle's picture in that New York paper yesterday?--all hairand eyeglasses, and leaning one temple on the two first fingers of theright hand--and guess what it said--'Young millionaire socialist whodenounces country's entrance into war!' Watch him--he's trying to looklike the picture now! Uncle Sharon read the 'millionaire socialist,' andbarked like a mad dog. He says: 'Yes, he'd be a millionaire socialist ifhe was going to be any kind, and if he was going to be a burglar he'dhave to be one of these dress-suit burglars you always read about.'"Of course he's awfully severe on Merle for not going to fight, but howcould he with his bad eyes? He couldn't see to shoot at people, poorthing; and besides, he's too clever to be wasted like a common soldier.He starts people to thinking--worth-while people. He says so himself.Mixed up with all sorts of clever things with the most wonderfulnames--garment workers and poet radicals and vorticists and new-artersand everything like that, who are working to lift us up so nobody willown anything and everybody can have what he wants. Of course I don'tunderstand everything they say, but it sounds good, so sympathetic,don't you think?"She had paused often with the little smile that implored pity for herrattlepatedness. Now it prolonged itself as the orchestra became wildlyalive.Winona had but half listened to Patricia's chatter. She had been staringinstead at the girl's hair--staring and wondering lawlessly. She hadseen advertisements. Might her own hair be like that--"like tarnishedgold," she put it? Of course you had to keep putting the stuff on at theroots as it grew out. But would her colour blend with that shade?Patricia's skin had the warm fairness of new milk, but Winona wasdusky. Perhaps a deeper tint of auburn----She was recalled from this perilous musing by Rapp, Senior, who camepressing his handkerchief to a brow damp from the last dance. He bowedto Winona."May I have this pleasure?" he said. Winona rose like a woman of theworld."We're on the map at last," said Rapp, Senior, referring to Newbern'snewest big-town feature."I know I'm on the map at last," said Winona, coyly, and tapped the armof Rapp, Senior, with her feathered trifle of a fan."Dance?" said Wilbur to Patricia."Thanks a heap! Merle won't. He says how can he dance when thinking offree Russia? But did you see those stunning Russian dancers? It doesn'tkeep them from dancing, does it? Poor old Merle is balmy--mice in hiswainscoting."They danced, and Patricia was still the rattlepate."You're going over, Uncle Sharon told us. Merle says you're a victim ofmob reaction--what does that mean? No matter. Pretty soon he said you'dbe only a private. Grandpa Gideon looked as if he had bitten into alemon. He says, 'I believe privates form a very important arm of theservice'--just like that. He's not so keen on Merle, but he won't admitit. With him it's once a Whipple always a Whipple! When he saw Merle'spicture, leaning the beautiful head on the two long fingers and the hairkind of scrambly, he just said, 'Ah, you young scamp of a socialist!' asif he were saying, 'Oh, fie on you!' Merle can talk the whole bunch downwhen he gets to shooting on all six--sounds good, but I've no doubt it'sjust wise twaddle."What a stunning dancer you are! Ask me quick again so I won't have togo back to free Russia. I'll promise to nurse you when you get woundedover there. I'll have learned to do everything by that time. Wouldn't itbe funny if you were brought in some day with a lot of wounds and I'dsay, 'Why, dear me, that's someone I know! You must let me nurse himback to health,' and of course they would. Anyway, the family's keenabout my going. They think I ought to do my bit, especially as Merlecan't, because of his eyes. Be sure you ask me again."He asked her again and yet again. He liked dancing with her. Sometimeswhen she talked her eyes were like green flames. But she talked ofnothing long and the flames would die and her little waiting smile comeentreating consideration for her infirmities."Now you be sure to come straight to me directly you're wounded," sheagain cautioned him as they parted.He shook hands warmly with her. He liked the girl, but he hoped therewould be other nurses at hand if this thing occurred; that is, if itproved to be anything serious."Anyway, I hope I'll see you," he said. "I guess home faces will bescarce over there."She looked him over approvingly."Be a good soldier," she said.Again they shook hands. Then she fluttered off under the gloomy chargeof Merle, who had remained austerely aloof from the night's gayety.Wilbur had had but a few words with him, for Patricia claimed his time."You seem a lot older than I do now," he said, and Merle, brushing backthe errant lock, had replied: "Poor chap, you're a victim of the mobreaction. Of course I'm older now. I'm face to face with age-longproblems that you've never divined the existence of. It does age one.""I suppose so," agreed Wilbur.He felt shamed, apologetic for his course. Still he would have someplain fighting, Wall Street or no Wall Street.He wrested a chattering Winona from Mrs. Henrietta Plunkett at the doorof the ladies' cloakroom. Mrs. Plunkett was Newbern's ablest exponent ofthe cause of woman, and she had been disquieted this night at observingsigns of an unaccustomed frivolity in one of her hitherto stanchestdisciples."I can't think what has come over you!" she had complained to Winona."You seem like a different girl!""I am a different girl!" boasted Winona."You do look different--your gown is wonderfully becoming, and whatlovely slippers!" Mrs. Plunkett inspected the aged debutante with kindlyeyes. "But remember, my dear, we mustn't let frivolities like thisdivert our attention from the cause. A bit more of the good fight and weshall have come into our own.""All this wonderful mad evening I have forgotten the cause," confessedWinona."Mercy!" said Mrs. Plunkett. "Forgotten the cause? One hardly does that,does one, without a reason?""I have reasons enough," said Winona, thinking of the new dancingslippers and the frock."Surely, my dear, you who are so free and independent are not thinkingof marriage?"Winona had not been thinking of marriage. But now she did."Well"--she began--"of course, I----""Mercy! Not really! Why, Winona Penniman, would you barter yourindependence for a union that must be demeaning, at least politically,until our cause is won?""Well, of course----" Winona again faltered, tapping one minute toe of adancing slipper on the floor."Do you actually wish," continued Henrietta Plunkett, rising to thefoothills of her platform manner, "to become a parasite, a man's bondslave, his creature? Do you wish to be his toy, his plaything?""I do!" said Winona low and fervently, as if she had spoken the wordsunder far more solemn auspices."Mercy me! Winona Penniman!"And Wilbur Cowan had then come to bear her off to her room, that echoedwith strange broken music and light voices and the rhythmic scuffing offeet on a floor--and to the privacy of her journal."I seem," she wrote, "to have flung wisdom and prudence to the winds.Though well I know the fading nature of all sublunary enjoyments, yetwhen I retire shortly it will be but to protract the fierce pleasure ofthis night by recollection. Full well I know that Morpheus will wave hisebon wand in vain."Morpheus did just that. Long after Winona had protracted the fierceenjoyment of the night to a vanishing point she lay wakeful, revolvingher now fixed determination to take the nursing course that PatriciaWhipple would take, and go far overseas, where she could do a woman'swork; or, as she phrased it again and again, be a girl of some use in avexed world.In the morning she learned for the first time that Wilbur was to go towar in company with a common prize fighter. It chilled her for themoment, but she sought to make the best of it."I hope," she told Wilbur, "that war will make a better man of yourfriend.""What do you mean--a better man?" he quickly wanted to know. "Let metell you, Spike's a pretty good man right now for his weight. You oughtto see him in action once! Don't let any one fool you about that boy!What do you expect at a hundred and thirty-three--a heavyweight?"After he had gone, late that afternoon, after she had said a solemnfarewell to him in the little room of the little house in the side yard,Winona became reckless. She picked up and scanned with shrewd eyes thephotograph of Spike that had been left: "To my friend Kid Cowan from hisfriend Eddie--Spike--Brennon, 133 lbs. ringside."She studied without wincing the crouched figure of hostile eye, eventhough the costume was not such as she would have selected for a youngman."After all, he's only a boy," she murmured. She studied again the intentface. "And he looks as if he had an abundance of pepper."She hoped she would be there to nurse them both if anything happened.She had told Wilbur this, but he had not been encouraging. He seemed tobelieve that nothing would happen to either of them."Of course we'll be shot at," he admitted, "but like as not they'll missus."Winona sighed and replaced the photograph. Now they would be a couple ofheads clustered with other heads at a car window; smiling, small-townboys going lightly out to their ordeal. She must hurry and be over!       *       *       *       *       *Wilbur, with his wicker suitcase, paused last to say goodbye to Frank,the dog. Frank was now a very old dog, having reached a stage of yappingsenility, where he found his sole comfort in following the sun about thehouse and dozing in it, sometimes noisily dreaming of past adventures.These had been exclusively of a sentimental character, for Frank hadnever been the fighting dog his first owner had promised he would be. Hewas an arch sentimentalist and had followed a career of determinedmotherhood, bringing into the world litter after litter of puppies,exhibiting all the strains then current in Newbern. He had surveyed eachnew family with pride--families revealing tinges of setter, Airedale,Newfoundland, pointer, collie--with the hopeful air of saying that a dognever knew what he could do until he tried. Now he could only dream ofpast conquests, and merely complained when his master roused him."I hope you'll be here when I get back--and I hope I'll be here, too,"said his master, and went on, sauntering up to the station a bit lateras nonchalantly as ever Dave Cowan himself had gone there to begin along journey on the six-fifty-eight. Spike Brennon lounged against abaggage truck. Spike's only token of departure was a small bundlecovered with that day's _Advance_. They waited in silence until thedingy way train rattled in. Then Sharon Whipple appeared from thefreight room of the station. He affected to be impatient with therailway company because of a delayed shipment which he took no troubleto specify definitely, and he affected to be surprised at the sight ofWilbur and Spike."Hello! I thought you two boys went on the noon train," he lied,carelessly. "Well, long as you're here you might as well take these--incase you get short." He pressed a bill into the hand of each. "Good-byeand good luck! I had to come down about that shipment should have beenhere last Monday--it beats time what these railroads do with stuffnowadays. Five days between here and Buffalo!"He continued to grumble as the train moved on, even as the two waved tohim from a platform."A hundred berries!" breathed Spike, examining his bill. "Say, he shedsit easy, don't he?"They watched him where he stood facing the train. He seemed to have quitgrumbling; his face was still."Well, kid, here we go! Now it's up to the guy what examines us. You'llbreeze through--not a nick in you. Me--well, they're fussy about teeth,I'm told, and, of course, I had to have a swift poke in the mush thatdented my beak. They may try to put the smother on me.""Cheer up! You'll make the grade," said Wilbur.Through the night he sat cramped and wakeful in the seat of a crowdedday coach, while Spike beside him slept noisily, perhaps owing to thedented beak. His head back, he looked out and up to a bow moon thatraced madly with the train, and to far, pale stars that were still. Hewondered if any one out there noted the big new adventure down here.CHAPTER XVIIWilbur Cowan's fear that his brother might untimely stop the war provedbaseless. The war went on despite the _New Dawn's_ monthly exposure ofits motive and sinister aims; despite its masterly paraphrase of acelebrated document declaring that this Government had been "conceivedin chicanery and dedicated to the industrial slavery of the masses." Noteven the new social democracy of Russia sufficed to inspire anynoticeable resistance. The common people of the United States hadrefused to follow the example of their brothers of Russia and destroy atyranny equally hateful, though the _New Dawn_ again and again set forththe advantages to accrue from such action. War prevailed. As theReverend Mallet said: "It gathered the vine of the earth and cast itinto the great wine press of the wrath of God."But the little cluster of intellectuals on the staff of the _New Dawn_persevered. Monthly it isolated the causative bacteria of unrest, to setthe results before those who could profit would they but read. Merle,the modernist, at the forefront of what was known as all the newmovements, tirelessly applied the new psychology to the mind of thecommon man and proved him a creature of mean submissions. He spoke of"our ranks" and "our brave comrades of Russia," but a selective drafthad its way and an army went forward.In Newbern, which Merle frequented between issues of the magazine, hereceived perhaps less appreciation than was his due. Sharon Whipple wasblindly disparaging. Even Gideon was becoming less attentive when themodernist expounded the new freedom. Gideon was still puzzled. Hequoted, as to war: "The sign of a mad world. God bless us out of it!"But he was beginning to wonder if perhaps this newest Whipple had not,with all his education, missed something that other Whipples hadlearned.Harvey D. had once or twice spoken with frank impatience of the _NewDawn's_ gospel. And one Kate Brophy, cook at the Whipple New Place, saidof its apostle that he was "a sahft piece of furniture." Merle wassensitive to these little winds of captiousness. He was now convincedthat Newbern would never be a cultural centre. There was a spirit ofintolerance abroad.Sharon Whipple, becoming less and less restrained as the months went on,spoke of the staff of the _New Dawn_ in Merle's hearing. He called it acage of every unclean and hateful bird. Merle smiled tolerantly, andcalled Sharon a besotted reactionary, warning him further that such ashe could never stem the tide of revolution now gathering for its fullsweep. Sharon retorted that it hadn't swept anything yet."Perhaps not yet--on the surface," said Merle. "But now we shall showour teeth."Sharon fell to a low sort of wit in his retort."Better not show your teeth to the Government!" he warned. "If you doyou want to have the address of a good dentist handy."And after another month--when the magazine of light urged resistance tothe draft--it became apparent not only that the _New Dawn_ would notstop the war, but that the war would incredibly stop the _New Dawn_. Thedespoilers of America actually plotted to destroy it, to smother itsmessage, to adjust new shackles about the limbs of labour.Sharon Whipple was the first of the privileged class to say thatsomething had got to be done by the family--unless they wanted to havethe police do it. Gideon was the second. These two despoilers of thepeople summoned Harvey D. from Washington, and the conspiracy againstspiritual and industrial liberty ripened late one night in the libraryof the Whipple New Place. It was agreed that the last number of the_New Dawn_ went pretty far--farther than any Whipple ought to go. But itwas not felt that the time had come for extreme measures. It wasbelieved that the newest Whipple should merely be reasoned with. To thisend they began to reason among themselves, and were presently wrangling.It developed that Sharon's idea of reasoning lacked subtlety. Itdeveloped that Gideon and Harvey D. reasoned themselves into sheerbewilderment in an effort to find reasons that would commend themselvesto Merle; so that this first meeting of the conspirators was about tobreak up fruitlessly, when Sharon Whipple was inspired to a suggestionthat repelled yet pricked the other two until they desperately yieldedto it. This was that none other than Dave Cowan be called intoconsultation."He'll know more about his own son than we do," urged Sharon.Harvey D.'s feeling of true fatherhood was irritated by this way ofputting it, but in the end he succumbed. He felt that his son was nowfar removed from the sphere of Dave Cowan, yet the man might retain someinfluence over the boy that would be of benefit to all concerned."He's in town," said Sharon. "He's a world romper, but he's here now. Iheard him to-day in the post office telling someone how many stars thereare in the sky--or something like that."The following afternoon Dave Cowan, busy at the typesetting machine ofthe Newbern _Advance_, Daily and Weekly, was again begged to meet a fewWhipples in the dingy little office of the First National. The officewas unchanged; it had kept through the years since Dave had lastillumined its gloom an air of subdued, moneyed discretion. Nor had theWhipples changed much. Harvey D. was still neat-faced and careful ofattire, still solicitous of many little things. Gideon, gaunt and dour,was still erect. His hair was white now, but the brows shot theirquestioning glance straight. Sharon was as he had been, round-chested,plump; perhaps a trifle readier to point the ends of the grizzled browsin choleric amaze. The Whipple nose on all three still jutted forwardboldly. It was a nose never to compromise with Time.Dave Cowan, at first glance, was much the same, even after he hadconcealed beneath the table that half of him which was never quite soscrupulously arrayed as the other. But a second glance revealed that theyellow hair was less abundant. It was now cunningly conserved from earto ear, above a forehead that had heightened. The face was thinner, andetched with new lines about the orator's mouth, but the eyes shone withthe same light as of old and the same willingness to shed its beamsthrough shadowed places such as first national banks. He no longeraccepted the cigar, to preserve in the upper left-hand waist coat pocketwith the fountain pen, the pencil, and the toothbrush. He craved ratherpermission to fill and light the calabash pipe. This was a mere bit ofform, for he was soon talking so continuously that the pipe was nolonger a going concern.Delay was occasioned at the beginning of the interview. It proved to bedifficult to convey to Dave exactly why he had been summoned. Itappeared that he did not expect a consultation--rather a lecture byDave Cowan upon life in its larger aspects. The Whipples, strangely,were all not a little embarrassed in his presence, and the mere mentionof his son caused him to be informative for ten minutes before any ofthem dared to confine the flow of his discourse within narrower banks.He dealt volubly with the doctrines espoused by Merle, whereas theywished to be told how to deal with Merle. As he talked he consulted fromtime to time a sheaf of clippings brought from a pocket."A joke," began Dave, "all this socialistic talk. Get this from theirplatform: They demand that the country and its wealth be redeemed fromthe control of private interests and turned over to the people to beadministered for the equal benefit of all. See what they mean? Going tohave a law that a short man can reach as high as a tall man. Good joke,yes? Here again: 'The Socialist Party desires the workers of America totake the economic and political power from the capitalistic class.'Going to pull themselves off the ground by their boot straps, yes? Havea law to make the weak strong and the strong weak. Reads good, don't it?And here's the prize joke--one big union: Socialist Party does notinterfere in the internal affairs of labour unions, but supports them inall their struggles. In order, however, that such struggles might attainthe maximum of efficiency the socialists favour the closest organiccooperation of all unions as one organized working body."Get that? Lovely, ain't it? And when we're all in one big union, whoare we going to strike against? Against ourselves, of course--like we donow. Bricklayers striking against shoemakers and both striking againstcarpenters, and all of 'em striking against the honest farmer and thefarmer striking back, because every one of 'em wants all he can get forhis labour and wants to pay as little as he has to for the otherfellow's labour. One big union, my eye! Socialists are jokes. You neversaw two of 'em yet that could agree on anything for ten minutes--exceptthat they want something for nothing."The speaker paused impressively. His listeners stirred with relief, butthe tide of his speech again washed in upon them."They lack," said he, pointing the calabash pipe at Gideon Whipple,sitting patiently across the table from him, "they lack the third eye ofwisdom." He paused again, but only as if to await applause. There was nointimation that he had done."Dear me!" murmured Gideon, politely. The other Whipples made littlesounds of amazement and approval."You want to know what the third eye of wisdom is?" continued Dave, asone who had read their secret thought. "Well, it's the simple gift ofbeing able to look at facts as they are instead of twisting 'em about asthey ain't. The most of us, savages, uneducated people, simples, andthat sort, got this third eye of wisdom without knowing it; we followthe main current without knowing or asking why. But professors andphilosophers and preachers and teachers and all holy rollers likesocialists ain't got it. They want to reduce the whole blamed cosmos toa system, and she won't reduce. I forget now just how many billion cellsin your body"--he pointed the pipe at Sharon Whipple, who stirreduneasily--"but no matter." Sharon looked relieved."Anyway, we fought our way up to be a fish with lungs, and then wefought on till we got legs, and here we are. And the only way we gothere was by competition--some of us always beating others. Holy rollerslike socialists would have us back to one cell and keep us there withequal rewards for all. But she don't work that way. The pot's stilla-boiling, and competition is the eternal fire under it."Look at all these imaginary Utopias they write about--good stories,too, about a man waking up three thousand years hence and findingeverything lovely. But every one of 'em, and I've read all, picture asociety that's froze into some certain condition--static. Nothing is!She won't freeze! They can spray the fire of competition with speechesall they like, but they can't put it out. Because why? Well, becausethis life thing is going on, and competition is the only way it can geton. Call it Nature if you want to. Nature built star dust out ofnothing, and built us out of star dust, but she ain't through; she'sstill building. Old Evolution is still evoluting, and her only tool iscompetition, the same under the earth and on the earth, the same out inthe sky as in these states."Of course there's bound to be flaws and injustice in any scheme ofgovernment because of this same competition you can't get away from anymore than the planets can. There's flaws in evolution itself, only theseholy rollers don't see it, because they haven't got the third eye ofwisdom; they can't see that the shoemaker is always going to want all hecan get for a pair of shoes and always going to pay as little as he canfor his suit of clothes, socialism or no socialism."What would their one big union be? Take these unions that are strikingnow all over the country. They think they're striking against somethingthey call capital. Well, they ain't. They're striking against eachother. Railroad men striking against bricklayers, shoemakers strikingagainst farmers, machinists striking against cabinetmakers, printersstriking against all of 'em--and the fools don't know it; think they'restriking against some common enemy, when all the time they're hittingagainst each other. Oh, she's a grand bit of cunning, this OldEvolution.""This is all very interesting, Mr. Cowan"--Harvey D. had become uneasyin his chair, and had twice risen to put straight a photograph of theWhipple block that hung on the opposite wall--"but what we would like toget at--""I know, I know"--Dave silenced him with a wave of the calabash--"youwant to know what it's all about--what it's coming to, what we're herefor. Well, I can tell you a little. There used to be a catch in it thatbothered me, but I figured her out. Old Evolution is producing anorganism that will find the right balance and perpetuate itselfeternally. It's trying every way it knows to get these cells ofprotoplasm into some form that will change without dying. Simple enough,only it takes time. Think how long it took to get us this far out ofsomething you can't see without glasses! But forget about time. Our timedon't mean anything out there in the real world. Say we been produced inone second from nothing; well, think what we'll become in another tenseconds. We'll have our balance by that time. This protoplasm does whatit's told to do--that's how it made eyes for us to see, and ears tohear, and brains to think with--so by that time we'll be really living;we'll have a form that's plastic, and can change round to meet anychange of environment, so we won't have to die if it gets too cold ortoo hot. We want to live--we all want to live; by that time we'll beable to go on living."Of course we won't be looking much like we are now, we're pretty clumsymachines so far. I suppose, for one thing, we'll be getting ournourishment straight from the elements instead of taking it throughplants and animals. We'll be as superior to what we are now as he is toa hoptoad." The speaker indicated Sharon Whipple with the calabash.Sharon wriggled self-consciously. "And pretty soon people will forgetthat any one ever died; they won't believe it when they read it in oldbooks; they won't understand it. This time is coming, as near as I canfigure it, in seven hundred and fifty thousand years. That is, in roundnumbers, it might be an odd hundred thousand years more or less. Ofcourse I can't be precise in such a matter.""Of course not," murmured Harvey D., sympathetically; "but what we werewanting to get at--""Of course," resumed the lecturer, "I know there's still a catch in it.You say, 'What does it mean after that?' Well, I'll be honest with you,I haven't been able to figure it out much farther. We'll go on and ontill this earth dries up, and then we'll move to another, or buildone--I can't tell which--and all the time we're moving round something,but I don't know what or why. I only know it's been going onforever--this life thing--and we're a little speck in the current, andit will keep going on forever."But you can bet this: It will always go on by competition. There won'tever be any Utopia, like these holy rollers can lay out for you in fiveminutes. I been watching union labour long enough to know that. Butshe's a grand scheme. I'm glad I got this little look at it. I wouldn'tchange it in any detail, not if you come to me with full power. Icouldn't think of any better way than competition, not if I took alife-time to it. It's a sporty proposition."The speaker beamed modestly upon his hearers. Gideon was quick to clutchthe moment's pause."What about this boy Merle?" he demanded before Dave could resume."Oh, him?" said Dave. "Him and his holy rolling? Is that all you want toknow? Why didn't you say so? That's easy! You've raised him to be ahouse cat. So shut off his cream.""A house cat!" echoed Harvey D., shocked."No education," resumed Dave. "No savvy about the world. Set him down inSpokane with three dollars in his jeans and needing to go to Atlanta.Would he know how? Would he know a simple thing like how to get thereand ride all the way in varnished cars?""Is it possible?" murmured Harvey D.The Whipples had been dazed by the cosmic torrent, but here wassomething specific;--and it was astounding. They regarded the speakerwith awe. They wanted to be told how one could perform the feat, butdreaded to incur a too-wordy exposition."Not practical enough, I dare say," ventured Harvey D."You said it!" replied Dave. "That's why he's took this scarlet rash ofsocialism and holy rolling that's going the rounds. Of course there areplenty that are holy rollers through and through, but not this boy. It'sonly a skin disease with him. I know him. Shut off his cream.""I said the same!" declared Sharon Whipple, feeling firm ground beneathhis feet for the first time."You said right!" approved Dave. "It would be a shock to him," saidHarvey D. "He's bound up in the magazine. What would he say? What wouldhe do?""Something pretty," explained Dave. "Something pretty and high-sounding.Like as not he'd cast you off.""Cast me off!" Harvey D. was startled."Tell you you are no longer a father of his. Don't I know that boy?He'll half mean it, too, but only half. The other half will be showingoff--showing off to himself and to you people. He likes to be noticed."Sharon Whipple now spoke."I always said he wouldn't be a socialist if he couldn't be amillionaire socialist.""You got him!" declared Dave."I shall hate to adopt extreme measures," protested Harvey D. "He'salways been so sensitive. But we must consider his welfare. In a timelike this he might be sent to prison for things printed in thatmagazine.""Trust him!" said Dave. "He wouldn't like it in prison. He might getclose enough to it to be photographed with the cell door back ofhim--but not in front of him.""He'll tell us we're suppressing free speech," said Harvey D."Well, you will be, won't you?" said Dave. "We ain't so fussy about freespeech here as they are in that free Russia that he writes about, butwe're beginning to take notice. Naturally it's a poor time for freespeech when the Government's got a boil on the back of its neck and isfeeling irritable. Besides, no one ever did believe in free speech, andno government on earth ever allowed it. Free speakers have always had touse judgment. Up to now we've let 'em be free-speakinger than any othercountry has, but now they better watch out until the boat quits rocking.They attack the machinery and try to take it apart, and then cry whenthey're smacked. Maybe they might get this boy the other side of a celldoor. Wouldn't hurt him any.""Of course," protested Harvey D., "we can hardly expect you to have afather's feeling for him.""Well, I have!" retorted Dave. "I got just as much father's feeling forhim as you have. But you people are small-towners, and I been about inthe world. I know the times and I know that boy. I'm telling you what'sbest for him. No more cream! If it had been that other boy of mine youtook, and he was believing what this one thinks he believes, I'd betelling you something different.""Always said he had the gumption," declared Sharon Whipple."He's got the third eye," said Dave Cowan."We want to thank you for this talk," interposed Gideon Whipple. "Muchof what you have said is very, very interesting. I think my son will nowknow what course to pursue.""Don't mention it!" said Dave, graciously. "Always glad to oblige."The consultation seemed about to end, but even at the door of thelittle room Dave paused to acquaint them with other interesting factsabout life. He informed them that we are all brothers of the earth,being composed of carbon and a few other elements, and grow from it asdo the trees; that we are but super-vegetables. He further instructedthem as to the constitution of a balanced diet--protein for building,starches or sugar for energy, and fats for heating and also for theirvitamine content.The Whipples, it is to be feared, were now inattentive. They appeared tolisten, but they were merely surveying with acute interest the nowrevealed lower half of Dave Cowan. The trousers were frayed, the shoeswere but wraiths of shoes. The speaker, quite unconscious of thisscrutiny, concluded by returning briefly to the problems of humanassociation."We'll have socialism when every man is like every other man. So farNature hasn't made even two alike. Anyway, most of us got the third eyeof wisdom too wide open to take any stock in it. We may like it when weread it in a book, but we wouldn't submit to it. We're too inquiring. Ifa god leaned out of a cloud of fire and spoke to us to-day we'd put thespectroscope on his cloud, get a moving picture of him, and take hisvoice on a phonograph record; and we wouldn't believe him if he talkedagainst experience."Dave surveyed the obscure small-towners with a last tolerant smile andwithdrew."My!" said Gideon, which for him was strong speech."Talks like an atheist," said Sharon."Mustn't judge him harshly," warned Harvey D.       *       *       *       *       *So it came that Merle Dalton Whipple, born Cowan, was ratherperemptorily summoned to meet these older Whipples at anotherconference. It was politely termed a conference by Harvey D., thoughSharon warmly urged a simpler description of the meeting, declaring thatMerle should be told he was to come home and behave himself. Harvey D.and Gideon, however, agreed upon the more tactful summons. Theydiscussed, indeed, the propriety of admitting Sharon to the conference.Each felt that he might heedlessly offend the young intellectual byputting things with a bluntness for which he had often been conspicuous.Yet they agreed at last that he might be present, for each secretlydistrusted his own firmness in the presence of one with so strong anappeal as their boy. They admonished Sharon to be gentle. But each hopedthat if the need rose he would cease to be gentle.Merle obeyed the call, and in the library of the Whipple New Place,where once he had been chosen to bear the name of the house, he listenedwith shocked amazement while Harvey D., with much worried straighteningof pictures, rugs, and chairs, told him why Whipple money could nolonger meet the monthly deficit of the _New Dawn_. The most cogentreason that Harvey D. could advance at first was that there were toomany Liberty Bonds to be bought.Merle, with his world-weary gesture, swept the impeding lock from hispale brow and set pained eyes upon his father by adoption. He was unableto believe this monstrous assertion. He stared his incredulity. HarveyD. winced. He felt that he had struck some defenseless child a cruelblow. Gideon shot the second gun in this unhuman warfare."My boy, it won't do. Harvey is glossing it a bit when he says the moneyis needed for bonds. You deserve the truth--we are not going to financeany longer a magazine that is against all our traditions and all oursincerest beliefs.""Ah, I see," said Merle. His tone was grim. Then he broke into a dry,bitter laugh. "The interests prevail!""Looks like it," said Sharon, and he, too, laughed dryly."If you would only try to get our point of view," broke in Harvey D. "Wefeel--"He was superbly silenced by Merle, who in his best _New Dawn_ mannerexposed the real truth. The dollar trembled on its throne, the fatbourgeoisie--he spared a withering glance for Sharon, who was the onlyfat Whipple in the world--would resort to brutal force to silence thosewho saw the truth and were brave enough to speak it out."It's the age-old story," he went on, again sweeping the lock of hairfrom before his flashing glance. "Privilege throttles truth where itcan. I should have expected nothing else; I have long known there was nosoil here that would nourish our ideals. I couldn't long hope forsympathy from mere exploiters of labour. But the die is cast. Godhelping me, I must follow the light."The last was purely rhetorical, for no one on the staff of the _NewDawn_ believed that God helped any one. Indeed, it was rather felt thatGod was on the side of privilege. But the speaker glowed as he achievedhis period."If you would only try to get our point of view," again suggested HarveyD., as he straightened the Reading From Homer."I cannot turn aside.""Meaning?" inquired Sharon Whipple."Meaning that we cannot accept another dollar of tainted money for ourgreat work," said Merle, crisply."Oh," said Sharon, "but that's what your pa just told you! You acceptedit till he shut off on you.""Against my better judgment and with many misgivings," returned theapostle of light. "Now we can go to the bitter end with no false senseof obligation.""But your magazine will have to stop, I fear," interposed Gideon gently.Merle smiled wanly, shaking his head the while as one who contradictsfrom superior knowledge."You little know us," he retorted when the full effect of the silent,head-shaking smile had been had. "The people are at last roused. Moneywill pour in upon us. Money is the last detail we need think of. Ourmovement is solidly grounded. We have at our back"--he glanced defiantlyat each of the three Whipples--"an awakened proletariat.""My!" said Gideon."You are out of the current here," explained Merle, kindly. "You don'tsuspect how close we are to revolution. Yet that glorious rising of ourcomrades in Russia might have warned you. But your class, of course,never is warned.""Dear me!" broke in Harvey D. "You don't mean to say that conditions areas bad here as they were in Russia?""Worse--a thousand times worse," replied Merle. "We have here anautocracy more hateful, more hideous in its injustices, than ever theRomanoffs dreamed of. And how much longer do you think these serfs ofours will suffer it? I tell you they are roused this instant! They awaitonly a word!""Are you going to speak it?" demanded Sharon."Now, now!" soothed Harvey D. as Merle turned heatedly upon Sharon, whothus escaped blasting."I am not here to be baited," protested Merle."Of course not, my boy," said the distressed Harvey D.Merle faced the latter."I need not say that this decision of yours--this abrupt withdrawal, ofyour cooperation--must make a profound difference in our relations. Ifeel the cause too deeply for it to be otherwise. You understand?""He's casting you off," said Sharon, "like the other one said he would.""_Ssh_!" It was Gideon."I shall stay no longer to listen to mere buffoonery," and for the lasttime that night Merle swept back the ever-falling lock. He paused at thedoor. "The old spirit of intolerance," he said. "You are the sort whowouldn't accept truth in France in 1789, or in Russia the other day."And so he left them."My!" exclaimed Gideon, forcefully."Dear me!" exclaimed Harvey D."Shucks!" exclaimed Sharon."But the boy is goaded to desperation!" protested Harvey D."Listen!" urged Sharon. "Remember what his own father said! He's onlyhalf goaded. The other half is showing off--to himself and us. That manknew his own flesh and blood. And listen again! You sit tight if youwant to get him back to reason!""Brother, I think you're right," said Gideon."Dear me!" said Harvey D. He straightened an etched cathedral, and thenwith a brush from the hearth swept cigar ashes deeper into the rug aboutthe chair of Sharon. "Dear me!" he sighed again.       *       *       *       *       *Early the following morning Merle Whipple halted before the show windowof Newbern's chief establishment purveying ready-made clothing for men.He was about to undergo a novel experience and one that would haveprofoundly shocked his New York tailors. There were suits in the window,fitted to forms with glovelike accuracy. He studied thesedisapprovingly, then entered the shop."I want," he told the salesman, "something in a rough, coarse,common-looking suit--something such as a day labourer might wear."The salesman was momentarily puzzled, yet seemed to see light."Yes, sir--right this way, sir," and he led his customer back betweenthe lines of tables piled high with garments. He halted and spanned thechest of the customer with a tape measure. From halfway down a stack ofcoats he pulled one of the proper size."Here's a snappy thing, sir, fitted in at the back--belted--cuffs onthe trousers, neat check----"But the customer waved it aside impatiently."No, no! I want something common--coarse cloth, roughly made, no style;it mustn't fit too well."The salesman deliberated sympathetically."Ah, I see--masquerade, sir?"The customer again manifested impatience."No, no! A suit such as a day labourer might wear--a factory worker, oneof the poorer class."The salesman heightened his manifestation of sympathy."Well, sir"--he deliberated, tapping his brow with a pencil, scanningthe long line of garments--"I'm afraid we're not stocked with what youwish. Best go to a costumer, sir, and rent one for the night perhaps."The customer firmly pushed back a pendent lock of hair and becameimpressive."I tell you it is not for a masquerade or any foolishness of that sort.I wish a plain, roughly made, common-looking suit of clothes, not toowell fitting--the sort of things working people wear, don't youunderstand?""But certainly, sir; I understand perfectly. This coat here is what theworking people are buying; sold a dozen suits myself this week to someof the mill workers--very natty, sir, and only sixty-five dollars. Ifyou'll look closely at the workers about town you'll see the samesuits--right dressy, you'll notice. I'm afraid the other sort of thinghas gone a little out of style; in fact, I don't believe you'll be ableto find a suit such as you describe. They're not being made. Workers arebuying this sort of garment." He picked up the snappy belted coat andfondled its nap affectionately. "Of course, for a fancy-dress party----""No, no, no! I tell you it isn't a masquerade!"The salesman seemed at a loss for further suggestions. The customer'seye lighted upon a pile of coats farther down the line."What are those?""Those? Corduroy, sir. Splendid garments--suitable for the woods,camping, hunting, fishing. We're well stocked with hunting equipment.Will you look at them?""I suppose so," said the customer, desperately.       *       *       *       *       *Late that afternoon the three older Whipples, on the piazza of theWhipple New Place, painfully discussed the scene of the previousevening. It was felt by two of them that some tragic event impended.Sharon alone was cheerful. From time to time he admonished the other twoto sit tight."He'll tell you you ain't any longer a father of his, or a grandfather,either, but sit tight!"He had said this when Merle appeared before them as a car drew up to thedoor. There was an immediate sensation from which even Sharon was notimmune. For Merle was garbed in corduroy, and the bagging trousers werestuffed into the tops of heavy, high-laced boots. The coat was beltedbut loose fitting. The exposed shirt was of brown flannel, and the grayfelt hat was low-crowned and broad of brim. The hat was firmly set onthe wearer's head, and about his neck was a wreath of colour--a knottedhandkerchief of flaming scarlet.The three men stared at him in silent stupefaction. He seemed about topass them on his way to the waiting car, but then paused and confrontedthem, his head back. He laughed his bitter laugh."Does it seem strange to see me in the dress of a common workingman?" hedemanded."Dress of a what?" demanded Sharon Whipple. The other ignored this."You have consigned me to the ranks," he continued, chiefly to Harvey D."I must work with my hands for the simple fare that my comrades are ableto gain with their own toil. I must dress as one of them. It's absurdlysimple.""My!" exclaimed Gideon.Harvey D. was suffering profoundly, but all at once his eyes flashedwith alarm."Haven't those boots nails in them?" he suddenly demanded."I dare say they have.""And you've been going across the hardwood floors?" demanded Harvey D.again."This is too absurd!" said Merle, grimly.Harvey D. hesitated, then smiled, his alarm vanishing."Of course I was absurd," he admitted, contritely. "I know you must havekept on the rugs.""Oh, oh!" Again came the dry, bitter laugh of Merle."Say," broke in Sharon, "you want to take a good long look at the nextworkingman you see."Merle swept him with a glance of scorn. He stepped into the waiting car."I could no longer brook this spirit of intolerance, but I'm takingnothing except the clothes I'm wearing," he reminded Harvey D. "I go tomy comrades barehanded." He adjusted the knot of crimson at his whitethroat. "But they will not be barehanded long, remember that!"Nathan Marwick started the car along the driveway. Merle was seen toorder a halt."Of course, for a time, at least, I shall keep the New York apartment.My address will be the same."The car went on."Did that father know his own flesh and blood--I ask you?" demandedSharon."Dear me, dear me!" sighed Harvey D."Poor young thing!" said Gideon.Merle, on his way to the train, thought of his hat. He had not been ableto feel confidence in that hat. There was a trimness about it, anassertive glamour, an air of success, that should not stamp one of theoppressed. He had gone to the purchase of it with vague notions that alabouring man, at least while actually labouring, wears a square cap ofpaper which he has made himself. So he was crowned in all cartoons. But,of course, this paper thing would not do for street wear, and the hat henow wore was the least wealth-suggesting he had been able to find. Henow decided that a cap would be better. He seemed to remember that thetoiling masses wore a lot of caps.CHAPTER XVIIIA week later one of the New York evening papers printed an inspiringview of Merle Dalton Whipple in what was said to be the rough garb ofthe workingman. He stanchly fronted the world in a corduroy suit andhigh-laced boots, a handkerchief knotted at his throat above a flannelshirt, and a somewhat proletarian cap set upon his well-posed head. Thecaption ran: "Young Millionaire Socialist Leaves Life of Luxury to beSimple Toiler."A copy of this enterprising sheet, addressed in an unknown hand, arrivedat the Whipple New Place, to further distress the bereft family. OnlySharon Whipple was not distressed. He remarked that the toiler was notso simple as some people might think, and he urged that an inquiry beset on foot to discover the precise nature of the toil now being engagedin by this recruit to the ranks of labour. He added that he himselfwould be glad to pay ninety dollars a month and board to any toilerworth his salt, because Juliana was now his only reliable helper, and itdid seem as if she would never learn to run a tractor, she having nogift for machinery. If Merle Whipple was bent on toil, why should he notcome to the Home Farm, where plenty of it could be had for the asking?Both Harvey D. and Gideon rebuked him for this levity, reminding himthat he did not take into account the extreme sensitiveness of Merle.Sharon merely said: "Mebbe so, mebbe not."There came another issue of the _New Dawn_. It was a live issue, andcontained a piece by the associate editor entitled, This Unpopular War,in which it was clearly shown that this war was unpopular. It wasunpopular with every one the writer had questioned; no one wanted it,every one condemned it, even those actually engaged in it at Washington.The marvel was that an army could continue to go forward with existingpublic sentiment as the _New Dawn_ revealed it. But a better day wassaid to be dawning. The time was at hand when an end would be put toorganized exploitation and murder, which was all that the world had thusfar been able to evolve in the way of a government.In a foreword to the readers of the _New Dawn_, however, a faintlyominous note was sounded. It appeared that the interests had heinouslyconspired to suppress the magazine because of its loyalty to the idealsof free thought and free speech. In short, its life was menaced. Supportwas withdrawn by those who had suddenly perceived that the _New Dawn_meant the death of privilege; that "this flowering of mature andseasoned personalities" threatened the supremacy of the old order ofindustrial slavery. The mature and seasoned personalities had soundedthe prelude to the revolution which "here bloodily, there peaceably, andbeginning with Russia, would sweep the earth." Capital, affrighted, haddrawn back. It was therefore now necessary that the readers of the _NewDawn_ bear their own burden. If they would send in money in such sums asthey could spare--and it was felt that these would flow in abundantlyupon a hint--the magazine would continue and the revolution be a matterof days. It was better, after all, that the cause should no longer lookto capital for favours. Contributors were to sign on the dotted line.There were no more _New Dawns_. The forces of privilege had momentarilyprevailed, or the proletariat had been insufficiently roused to itsplight. The _New Dawn_ stopped, and in consequence the war went on. Fora time, at least, America must continue in that spiritual darkness whichthe _New Dawn_ had sought to illumine.Later it became known in Newbern that the staff of the _New Dawn_ wouldnow deliver its message by word of mouth. Specifically, Merle Whipplewas said to be addressing throngs of despairing toilers not only in NewYork, but in places as remote as Chicago. Sharon Whipple now called hima crimson rambler.       *       *       *       *       *Meanwhile, news of the other Cowan twin trickled into Newbern throughletters from Winona Penniman, a nurse with the forces overseas. Duringher months of training in New York the epistolary style of Winona hadmaintained its old leisurely elegance, but early in the year of 1918 itsuffered severely under the strain of active service and became blunt tothe point of crudeness. The morale of her nice phrases had beenshattered seemingly beyond restoration."D--n this war!" began one letter to her mother. "We had influenzaaboard coming over and three nurses died and were buried at sea. Also,one of our convoy foundered in a storm; I saw men clinging to the wreckas she went down."Can it be that I once lived in that funny little town where they make afuss about dead people--flowers and a casket and a clergyman and carefulburial? With us it's something to get out of the way at once. And lifehas always been this, and I never knew it, even if we did take thepapers at home. Ha, ha! Yes, I can laugh, even in the face of it. 'Lifeis real, life is earnest'--how that line comes back to me with newforce!"A succeeding letter from a base hospital somewhere in France spelled infull certain words that had never before polluted Winona's pen. Brazenlyshe abandoned the seemly reticence of dashes."Damn all the war!" she wrote; and again: "War is surely more hellishthan hell could be!""Mercy! Can the child be using such words in actual talk?", demandedMrs. Penniman of the judge, to whom she read the letter."More'n likely," declared the judge. "War makes 'em forget their hometraining. Wouldn't surprise me if she went from bad to worse. It's justa life of profligacy she's leadin'--you can't tell me.""Nonsense!" snapped the mother."'And whom do you think I had a nice little visit with two days ago? Hewas on his way up to the front again, and it was our Wilbur. He's beenin hot fighting three times already, but so far unscathed. But oh, howold he looks, and so severe and grim and muddy! He says he is theworst-scared man in the whole Army, bar none. He thought at first hewould get over his fright, but each time he goes in he hates worse andworse to be shot at, and will positively never come to like it. He saysthe only way he can get over being frightened is to go on until hebecomes very, very angry, and then he can forget it for a time. You cantell by his face that it would be easy to anger him."'But do not think he is cowardly, even if habitually frightened,because I also talked with his captain, who is an outspoken man, and hetells me that Wilbur is a regular fighting so-and-so. These were hisvery words. They are army slang, and mean that he is a brave soldier. Ayoung man, a Mr. Edward Brennon from Newbern, a sort of athlete, cameover with him, and they have been constantly together. I did not seethis Mr. Brennon, but I hear that he, too, is gallantly great, and alsoa regular fighting so-and-so, as these rough men put it in their slang."'Wilbur spoke of Merle's writing about the war, and about America'sbeing rotten to the core because of capital that people want to keepfrom the workingman, and he says he now sees that Merle must have beenmisled; as he puts it in his crude, forceful way, this man's country hascome to stay. He says that is what he always says to himself when he hasto go over the top, while he is still scared and before he growsangry--"This man's country has come to stay." He says this big AmericanArmy would laugh at many of Merle's speeches about America and the war.He says the country is greater than any magazine, even the best. Now myrest hour is over, and I must go in where they are doing terrible thingsto these poor men. For a week I have been on my feet eighteen hours outof each twenty-four. I have just time for another tiny cigarette beforegoing into that awful smell.'"Mercy!" cried the amazed mother."There you are!" retorted the judge. "Let her go into the Army and shetakes up smoking. War leads to dissipation--ask any one.""I must send her some," declared Mrs. Penniman; "or I wonder if sherolls her own?""Yes, and pretty soon we'll have the whole house stenched up worse'nwhat Dave Cowan's pipe does it," grumbled the judge. "The idee of a girlof her years taking up cigarettes! A good thing the country's going dry.Them that smoke usually drink.""High time the girl had some fun," returned his wife, placidly."Needn't be shameless about it," grumbled the judge. "A good woman hasto draw the line somewhere."The unbending moralist later protested that Winona's letters should notbe read to her friends. But Mrs. Penniman proved stubborn. She softenedno word of Winona's strong language, and she betrayed something like aguilty pride in revealing that her child was now a hopeless tobaccoaddict.A month later Winona further harassed the judge."'I think only about life and death,'" read Mrs. Penniman, "'and I'mthinking now that the real plan of things is something greater thaneither of them. It is not rounded out by our dying in the right faith.Somehow it must go on and on, always in struggle and defeat. I used tothink, of course, that our religious faith was the only true one, butnow I must tell you I don't know what I am.'""My Lord!" groaned the horrified judge. "The girl's an atheist! That'swhat people are when they don't know what they are. First swearing, thensmoking cigarettes, now forsaking her religion. Mark my words, she'scoming home an abandoned woman!""Stuff!" said Mrs. Penniman, crisply. "She's having a great experience.Listen! 'You should see them die here, in all faiths--Jews, Catholics,Protestants, and very, very many who have never enjoyed the consolationof any religious teachings whatsoever. But they all die alike, and youmay think me dreadful for saying it, but I know their reward will beequal. I don't know if I will come out of it myself, but I don't thinkabout that, because it seems unimportant. The scheme--you remember DaveCowan always talking about the scheme--the scheme is so big, that dyingdoesn't matter one bit if you die trying for something. I couldn't argueabout this, but I know it and these wonderful boys must know it whenthey go smiling straight into death. They know it without any one everhaving told them. Sometimes I get to thinking of my own little setbeliefs about a hereafter--those I used to hold--and they seem funny tome!'""There!" The judge waved triumphantly. "Now she's makin' fun of thechurch! That's what comes of gittin' in with that fast Army set."Mrs. Penniman ignored this."'Patricia Whipple feels the same way I do about these matters; moreintensely if that were possible. I had a long talk with her yesterday.She has been doing a wonderful work in our section. She is one of usthat can stand anything, any sort of horrible operation, and neverfaint, as some of the nurses have done. She is apparently at such timesa thing of steel, a machine, but she feels intensely when it is over andshe lets down."'You wouldn't know her. Thin and drawn, but can work twenty hours at astretch and be ready for twenty more next day. She is on her way up to afirst-aid station, which I myself would not be equal to. It is terribleenough at this base hospital. For one who has been brought up as shehas, gently nurtured, looked after every moment, she is amazing. And, asI say, she feels as I do about life and death and the absurd littlecompartments into which we used to pack religion. She says she expectsnever to get back home, because the world is coming to an end. Youwould not be surprised at her thinking this if you could see what shehas to face. She is a different girl. We are both different. We won'tever be the same again.'""Wha'd I tell you?" demanded the judge."'The war increases in violence--dreadful sights, dreadful smells. I amso glad Merle's eyes kept him out of it. He would have been ill fittedfor this turmoil. Wilbur was the one for it. I saw him a few minutes theother day, on his way to some place I mustn't write down. He said: "Doyou know what I wish?" I said: "No; what do you wish?" He said: "I wishI was back in the front yard, squirting water on the lawn and flowerbeds, where no one would be shooting at me, and it was six o'clock andthere was going to be fried chicken for supper and one of thosedeep-dish apple pies without any bottom to it, that you turn upside downand pour maple sirup on. That's what I wish."'""Always thinking of his stomach!" muttered the judge."'But he has gone on, and I can't feel distressed, even though I know itis probable he will never come back. I know it won't make any differencein the real plan, and that it is only important that he keep on being afighting so-and-so, as they say in the Army. It is not that I amcallous, but I have come to get a larger view of death--mere death. Isaid good-bye to him for probably the last time with as little feelingas I would have said good-bye to Father on departing for a three-days'trip to the city.'""Naturally she'd forget her parents," said the judge. "That's what itleads to."       *       *       *       *       *Late in June of that year the shattered remains of a small townsomewhere in France, long peaceful with the peace of death, became noisywith a strange new life. Two opposing and frenzied lines of trafficclashed along the road that led through it and became a noisy jumble inthe little square at its centre, a disordered mass of camions,artillery, heavy supply wagons, field kitchens, ambulances, withmotorcycles at its edges like excited terriers, lending a staccatovivacity to its uproar.Artillery and soldiers went forward; supply wagons, empty, andambulances, not empty, poured back in unending succession; and only themarching men, gaunt shapes in the dust, were silent. They came from aroad to the south, an undulating double line of silent men indust-grayed khaki, bent under a burden of field equipment, steppingswiftly along the narrow, stone-paved street, heads down, unheeding thejagged ruin of small shops and dwellings that flanked the way. Reachingthe square, they turned to cross a makeshift bridge--beside one of stonethat had spanned the little river but now lay broken in its shallow bed.Beyond this stream they followed a white road that wound gently up asere hill between rows of blasted poplars. At the top of the rise twoshining lines of helmets undulated rhythmically below the view.At moments the undulations would cease and the lines dissolve. Theopposing streams of traffic would merge in a tangle beyond extricationuntil a halt enabled each to go its way. A sun-shot mist of fine dustsoftened all lines until from a little distance the figures of men andhorses and vehicles were but twisting, yellowish phantoms, strangelytroubled, strangely roaring.At these times the lines of marching men, halted by some clumsy clashingof war machines, instantly became mere huddles of fatigue by thewayside, falling to earth like rows of standing blocks sent over by achild's touch.Facing the square was a small stone church that had been mistreated. Itsfront was barred by tumbled masonry, but a well-placed shell had widelybreached its side wall. Through this timbered opening could be seen rowsof cots hovered over by nurses or white-clad surgeons. Their formsflashed with a subdued radiance far back in the shaded interior. Litterbearers came and went.From the opening now issued a red-faced private, bulky with fat. One ofhis eyes was hidden from the public by a bandage, but the othersurveyed the milling traffic with a humorous tolerance. Thoughpropelling himself with crutches, he had contrived to issue from theplace with an air of careless sauntering. Tenderly he eased his bulk toa flat stone, aforetime set in the church's facade, and dropped a crutchat either side. He now readjusted his hat, for the bandage going up overhis shock of reddish hair had affected its fit. Next he placed aninquiring but entirely respectful palm over the bandaged eye."Never was such a hell of a good eye, anyhow," he observed, and winkedthe unhidden eye in testimony of his wit. Then he plucked from back ofan ear a half-smoked cigarette, relighted this, and leered humorously atthe spreading tangle before him."Naughty, naughtykins!" he called to a driver of four mules who hadrisen finely to an emergency demanding sheer language. "First chance Ihad to get a good look at the war, what with one thing and another," heamiably explained to a sergeant of infantry who was passing.Neither of his sallies evoked a response, but he was not rebuffed. Hewished to engage in badinage, but he was one who could entertain himselfif need be. He looked about for other diversion.To the opening in the church wall came a nurse. She walked with short,uncertain steps and leaned against the ragged edge of the wall, with onearm along its stone for support. Her face was white and drawn, and for amoment she closed her eyes and breathed deeply of the dust-laden air.The fat private on the stone, a score of feet away, studied herapprovingly. She was slight of form and her hair beneath the cap was ofgold, a little tarnished. He waited for her eyes to open, then hailedher genially as he waved at a tangle of camions and ambulances nowblocking the bridge."Worse'n fair week back home on Main Street, hey, sister?"But she did not hear him, for a battered young second lieutenant withone arm in a sling had joined her from the dusk of the church."Done up, nurse?" he demanded."Only for a second. We just finished something pretty fierce."She pointed back of her, but without looking."Why not sit down on that stone?"He indicated a fallen slab at her feet. She looked at it with franklonging, but smiled a refusal."Dassent," she said. "I'd be asleep in no time.""Cheer up! We'll soon finish this man's job."The girl looked at him with eyes already freshened."No, it won't ever be finished. It's going on forever. Nothing but warand that inside."Again she pointed back without turning her head."Another jam!"The second lieutenant waved toward the makeshift bridge. The girlwatched the muddle of wheeled things and stiffened with indignation."That's why it'll last so long," she said. "Because these officers ofours can't learn anything. Look at that muddle--while men are dying onbeyond. You'd think they were a lot of schoolboys. Haven't they beentold to keep one road for their up traffic and another road for theirdown traffic? But they wouldn't do it, because it was the British whotold 'em. But the British had found out, hadn't they? Catch them havinga senseless mix-up like that! But our men won't listen. They won't evenlisten to me. I've told one general and six or seven colonels only thismorning. Told the general to keep certain roads for troops and wagonsgoing to the front, and other roads of traffic coming back to camps anddepots, and all he could say was that he hoped to God there wouldn't beanother war until the women could staff it.""Hooray, hooray!" squeaked the listening private in a subdued falsettonot meant to be overheard.Then he turned to stare up the street of broken shop fronts. One ofthese diverted his attention from the nurse. Above its door protruded abush, its leaves long since withered. He knew this for the sign of awine shop, and with much effort regained his feet to hobble toward it.He went far enough to note that the bush broke its promise ofrefreshment, for back of it was but dry desolation."_Napoo_!" he murmured in his best French, and turned to measure thedistance back to his stone seat. To this he again sauntered carelessly,as a gentleman walking abroad over his estate.The second lieutenant was leaving the nurse by the extemporized portalof the church, though she seemed not to have done with exposing theincompetence of certain staff officers. She still leaned wearily againstthe wall, vocal with irritation."Bawl 'em out, sister! I think anything you think," called the private.Then from his stone seat he turned to survey the double line of marchingmen that issued from the street into the square. They came now to ashuffling halt at a word of command relayed from some place beyond thebridge, where a new jumble of traffic could be dimly discerned. Thelines fell apart and the men sank to earth in the shade of the brokenbuildings across the square. The private waved them a careless hand,with the mild interest of one who has been permanently dissevered fromtheir activities.One of them slouched over, gave the private a new cigarette, andslouched back to his resting mates. In the act of lighting the cigarettethe fat private noted that another of these reclining figures had risenand was staring fixedly either at him or at something beyond him. Heturned and perceived that the nurse and not himself must be the objectof this regard.The risen private came on a dozen paces, halted hesitatingly, and staredonce more. The nurse, who had drooped again after the departure of thesecond lieutenant, now drew a long breath, threw up her shoulders, andhalf turned as if to reenter the church. The hesitating private,beholding the new angle of her face thus revealed to him, darted swiftlyforward with a cry that was formless but eloquent. The nurse stayedmotionless, but with eyes widened upon the approaching figure. Theadvancing private had risen wearily, and his first steps toward thechurch had been tired, dragging steps, but for the later distance hebecame agile and swift, running as one refreshed. The fat private on thestone observed the little play.The couple stood at last, tensely, face to face. The watcher beheld thegirl's eyes rest with wild wonder upon the newcomer, eyes that weresteady, questioning green flames. He saw her form stiffen, her shouldersgo back, her arms rise, her clenched hands spread apart in a gesturethat was something of fear but all of allure. The newcomer's own handswidened to meet hers, the girl's wrists writhed into his tightenedgrasp, her own hands clasped his arms and crept slowly, tightly alongthe dusty sleeves of his blouse. Still her eyes were eyes of wildwonder, searching his face. They had not spoken, but now the hands ofeach clutched the shoulders of the other for the briefest of seconds.Then came a swift enveloping manoeuvre, and the girl was held in a closeembrace.The watching private studied the mechanics of this engagement with anexpert eye. He saw the girl's arms run to tighten about the soldier'sneck. He saw her face lift. The soldier's helmet obscured much of whatensued, and the watcher called softly. "Hats off in front!" Thenfastidiously dusting the back of one hand, he kissed it audibly. Behindhim, across the square, a score of recumbent privates were roused toemulation. Dusting the backs of their hands they kissed them bothtenderly and audibly.The two by the church were oblivious of this applause. Their arms stillheld each other. Neither had spoken. The girl's face was set in wonder,in shining unbelief, yet a little persuaded. They were apart the reachof their arms."As you were!" ordered the fat private in low tones, and with a littlerush they became as they were. Again the girl's arms ran to tightenabout the soldier's neck. The watcher noticed their earnestconstrictions."I bet that lad never reads his dice wrong," he murmured, admiringly."Oh, lady, lady! Will you watch him June her!"He here became annoyed to observe that his cigarette had been burningwastefully. He snapped off its long ash and drew tremendously upon it.The two were still close, but now they talked. He heard sounds ofamazement, of dismay, from the girl."Put a comether on her before she knew it," explained the private tohimself.There followed swift, broken murmurs, incoherent, annoyingly, to thelistener, but the soldier's arms had not relaxed and the arms of thegirl were visibly compressed about his neck. Then they fell half apartonce more. The watcher saw that the girl was weeping, convulsed withlong, dry, shuddering sobs."As you were!" he again commanded, and the order was almost instantlyobeyed.Presently they talked again, quick, short speech, provokingly blurred tothe private's ears."Louder!" he commanded. "We can't hear at the back of the hall."The muffled talk went on, one hand of the girl ceaselessly patting theshoulder where it had rested.Now a real command came. The line of men rose, its head by the bridgecoming up first. The pair by the church drew apart, blended againmomentarily. The soldier sped back to his place, leaving the girl erect,head up, her shining eyes upon him. He did not look back. The line wasmarking time.The fat private saw his moment. He reached for his crutches andlaboriously came to his feet. Hands belled before his mouth, hetrumpeted ringingly abroad: "Let the war go on!"An officer, approaching from the bridge, seemed suddenly to be strickenwith blindness, deafness, and a curious facial paralysis.Once more the column undulated over the tawny crest of the hill. Thenurse stood watching, long after her soldier had becomeindistinguishable in the swinging, grayish-brown mass."Hey, nurse!" the fat private, again seated, called to her.To his dismay she came to stand beside him, refreshed, radiant."What you think of the war?" he asked.He was embarrassed by her nearness. He had proposed badinage at asuitable distance."This war is nothing," said the girl."No?" The private was entertained."Nothing! A bore, of course, but it will end in a minute.""Sure it will!" agreed the private. "Don't let no one tell youdifferent.""I should think not! This man's war won't bother me any more.""Not any more?" demanded the private with insinuating emphasis."Not any more."The private felt emboldened."Say, sister"--he grinned up at her--"that boy changed your view a lot,didn't he?""You mean to say you were here?" She flashed him a look of annoyance."Was I here? Sister, we was all here! The whole works was here!"She reflected, the upper lip drawn down."Who cares?" she retorted. She turned away, then paused, debating withherself. "You--you needn't let it go any farther, but I've got to tellsomeone. It was a surprise. I was never so bumped in my whole life."The private grinned again."Lady, that lad just naturally put a comether on you."She considered this, then shook her head."No, it was more like--we must have put one on each other. It--it wasfierce!""Happy days!" cheered the private. She lighted him with the effulgenceof a knowing smile."Thanks a lot," she said.The war went on.       *       *       *       *       *In her next letter Winona Penniman wrote: "We moved up to a stationnearer the front last Tuesday. I spent a night with Patricia Whipple.The child has come through it all wonderfully so far. A month ago shewas down and out; now she can't get enough work to do. Says the warbores her stiff. She means to stick it through, but all her talk is ofgoing home. By the way, she told me she had a little visit with WilburCowan the other day. She says she never saw him looking better."CHAPTER XIXTwo lines of helmeted men went over the crest of the hill. Private Cowanwas no longer conscious of aching feet and leaden legs or of the burdenthat bowed his shoulders. There was a pounding in his ears, and in hismind a verse of Scripture that had lingered inexplicably there sincetheir last billet at Comprey. His corporal, late a theological student,had read and expounded bits of the Bible to such as would listen.Forsaking beaten paths, he had one day explored Revelations. He hadexplained the giving unto seven angels of seven golden vials of thewrath of God, but later came upon a verse that gave him pause:"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with thesun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelvestars."It seemed that everything in Revelations had a hidden meaning, and theexpert found this obscure. There had been artless speculation among thelisteners. A private with dice had professed to solve the riddle of theNumber Seven, and had even alleged that twelve might be easier to throwif one kept repeating the verse, but this by his fellows was held to berank superstition. No really acceptable exposition had been offered ofthe woman clothed with the sun, and under her feet the moon, and uponher head a crown of twelve stars.Wilbur Cowan, marching up the hill, now sounded the words to himself;they went with that pounding in his ears. At last he knew what theymeant--a great wonder in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and underher feet the moon. Over and over he chanted the words.So much was plain to him. But how had it come about? They had looked,then enveloped each other, not thinking, blindly groping. They had beenout of themselves, not on guard, not held by a thousand bands of oldhabit that back in Newbern would have restrained them. Lacking these,they had rushed to that wild contact like two charged clouds, andeverything was changed by that moment's surrender to some force beyondtheir relaxed wills. Something between them had not been, now it was;something compelling; something that had, for its victory, needed onlythat they confront each other, not considering, not resisting, biddable.In his arms she had cried: "But how did we know--how did we know?"He had found no answer. Holding her fiercely as he did, it seemed enoughthat they did know. He had surrendered, but could not reason--was evenincurious.At the last she had said: "But if it shouldn't be true; if it's onlybecause we're both worn down and saw someone from home. Suppose it'smere--"She had broken off to thump his shoulder in reassurance, to cling moreabjectly. It was then she had wept, shakingly, in a vast impatience withherself for trying to reason."It is true! It is true--it's true, it's true!" she had told him withpiteous vehemence, then wilted again to his support, one hand strokinghis dusty cheek.When the command had come down the line she seemed about to fall, butbraced herself with new strength from some hidden source. When hereleased her she stood erect, regarding him with something of thetwisted, humorous quirk about her lips that for an instant brought herback to him as the little girl of long ago. Not until then had he beenable to picture her as Patricia Whipple. Then he saw. Her smile becamesurer."You've gone and spoiled the whole war for me!" she called to him.       *        *        *        *        *The war, too, had been spoiled for Private Cowan. He was unable to keephis mind on it. Of the Second Battle of the Marne he was to rememberlittle worth telling.Two nights later they came to rest in the woods back of St. Eugene, inthe little valley of the Surmelin, that gateway to Paris from thefarthest point of the second German drive. It was a valley shining withthe gold of little wheat fields, crimson-specked with poppies. Itrecalled to Private Cowan merely the farmland rolling away from that oldhouse of red brick where he had gone one day with SharonWhipple--yesterday it might have been. Even the winding creek--thoughthe French called theirs a river--was like the other creek, its coursemarked by a tangle of shrubs and small growths; and the sides of thevalley were flanked familiarly with stony ridges sparsely covered withsecond-growth timber. Newbern, he kept thinking, would lie four milesbeyond that longest ridge, and down that yellow road Sharon Whipplemight soon be driving his creaking, weathered buggy and the gaunt roan.The buggy would sag to one side and Sharon would be sitting"slaunchwise," as he called it. Over the ridge, at Newbern's edge, wouldbe the bony little girl who was so funny and willful.They moved forward to the south bank of the Marne. Beyond thatfifty-yard stream lay the enemy, reported now to be stacking up driveimpedimenta. The reports bored Private Cowan. He wished they would hurrythe thing through. He had other matters in hand. A woman clothed withthe sun, and under her feet the moon, and upon her head a crown of--hecould not make the crown of stars seem right. She was crowned with anurse's cap, rusty hair showing beneath, and below this her wan,wistful, eager face, the eyes half shutting in vain attempts to reason.The face would be drawn by some inner torment; then its tortured linesmelt to a smile of sure conviction. But she was clothed with the sun,and the moon was under her feet. So much he could make seem true.The dark of a certain night fell on the waiting regiment. Cricketssounded their note, a few silent birds winged furtively overhead.Rolling kitchens brought up the one hot meal of the day, to be taken tothe front by carrying parties. Company commanders made a lastreconnaissance of their positions. For Private Cowan it was a moment ofdouble waiting. Waiting for battle was now secondary. In a tiny slittrench on the forward edge of a railway embankment Private Brennonremarked upon the locomotion of the foreign frog."Will you look at 'em walk!" said Spike. "Just like an animal! Don'tthey ever learn to hop like regular gorfs?"Said Private Cowan: "I suppose you saw that girl back there the otherday?""Me and the regiment," said Spike, and chewed gum discreetly."She's a girl from back home. Funny! I'd never taken much notice of herbefore.""You took a-plenty back there. You've raised your average awful high.I'll say it!""I hardly knew what I was doing.""Didn't you? We did!""Since then sometimes I forget what we're here for.""Don't worry, kid! You'll be told.""It's funny how things happen that you never expected, but afterward yousee it was natural as anything."       *       *       *       *       *At midnight the quiet sky split redly asunder. German guns began to feela way to Paris. The earth rocked in a gentle rhythm under a rain ofshells. Shrapnel and gas lent vivacity to the assault. Guns to theirutmost reach swept the little valley like a Titan's sickle. PrivateCowan nestled his cheek against the earthen side of his little slittrench and tried to remember what she had worn that last night inNewbern. Something glistening, warm in colour, like ripe fruit; and arusty braid bound her head. She had watched, doubtfully, to see ifpeople were not impatient at her talk. A rattlepate, old Sharon calledher. She was something else now; some curious sort of woman, older, notafraid. She wouldn't care any more if people were impatient.At four o'clock of that morning the bombardment of the front line gaveway to a rolling barrage. Close behind this, hugging it, as the mensaid, came gray waves of the enemy. It was quieter after the barrage hadpassed: only the tack-tack of machine guns and the clash of meetingbayonets."Going to have some rough stuff," said Private Brennon.For a long time then Private Cowan was so engrossed with the routine ofhis present loose trade that the name of Whipple seemed to have no roomin his mind. For four hours he had held a cold rifle and thought. Nowthe gun was hot, its bayonet wet, and he thought not at all. When it wasover he was one of fifty-two men left of his company that had numberedtwo hundred and fifty-one. But his own uniform would still be clean ofwound chevrons.Two divisions of German shock troops had broken against a regiment ofAmerican fighting men."I don't like fighting any more," said Private Cowan."Pushed 'em across the crick," said Private Brennon. "Now we chase 'em!"So they joined the chase and fought again at Jaulgonne, where it rainedfor three days and nights, and Private Cowan considered his life indanger because he caught cold; it might develop into pneumonia. Hedidn't want to get sick and die--not now. It had not, of late, occurredto him that he would be in any danger save from sickness. But he threwoff the menacing cold and was fit for the big battle at Fismes,stubbornly pronounced "Fissims" by Private Brennon, after repeatedcorrections.Private Cowan thought now, when not actually engaged at his loose trade,of his brother. He wished the boy could have been with him. He wouldhave learned something. He would have learned that you feel differentlyabout a country if once you fight for it. His country had been only aname; he had merely ached to fight. Now he hated fighting; words couldnever tell how he loathed it; but his country had become more than aname. He would fight again for that. He wished Merle could have had thisnew feeling about his country.It was before Fismes, being out where he had no call to be, and afterwinning a finish fight with a strangely staring spectacled foe, that hestumbled across the inert form of Private Brennon, who must also havegone where he had no call to go. He leaned over him. Spike's mask wasbroken, but half adjusted. He shouldered the burden, grunting as he didso, angered by the weight of it. He was irritated, too, by men who werefiring at him, but his greater resentment was for Spike's unreasonablemass."You son of a gun--hog fat! Overweight, that's what you are! You'llnever make a hundred and thirty-three again, not you! Gee, gosh, a lightheavyweight, that's what you are!"He complained to the unhearing Spike all the way back to a dressingstation, though twice refusing help to carry his load."Mustard gas," said the surgeon.He was back there when Spike on his stretcher came violently to life."What a dark night!" said Spike between two of the spasms that wrenchedhim. "Can't see your hand before your face!""Say, you're hog fat!" grumbled Private Cowan. "You weigh a ton!""It's dark, but it feels light--it's warm."Private Cowan leaned to shield the sun from Spike's garbled face."Sure it's dark!" said he."Can't see your hand before your face!"Spike was holding up a hand, thumb and fingers widely spread, moving itbefore his sightless eyes."You got to go back. You're too fat to be up here."He rested his hand on Spike's forehead but withdrew it quickly whenSpike winced.He went on with the war; and the war went on.       *       *       *       *       *"You would never guess," wrote Winona, "who was brought to this basehospital last week. It was the Mr. Brennon I wrote you of, Mr. EdwardBrennon, the friend of Wilbur's who went with him from Newbern. He isblind from gas, poor thing! Our head surgeon knew him. It seems he isone of the prettiest lightweights the head surgeon ever saw in action, atwo-handed fighter with a good right and a good left. These are termsused in the sport of boxing."Of course he knows he is blind, but at first he thought he wasonly in the dark. Wilbur had told him of me. The most curiousmisunderstanding--he is positive he once saw me at home. Says I am theprettiest thing he ever looked at, and don't I remember coming into thepost office one day in a white dress and white shoes and a blue parasoland getting some mail and going out to a motor where some people waitedfor me? The foolish thing insists I have blue eyes and light brown hairand I was smiling when I looked at him in passing; not smiling at him,of course, but from something the people in the car had said; and I hadone glove off and carried the other with the blue sunshade. And I thinkhe means a girl from Rochester that visited the Hendricks, those millpeople, summer before last. She was pretty enough, in a girlish way, butnot at all my type. But I can't convince Edward it was not I he saw. Ihave given up trying. What harm in letting him think so? He says,anyway, he would know I am beautiful, because he can feel it even if Icome into the room. Did you ever hear such talk? But I am looking a lotbetter, in spite of all I have been through."I had a week in Paris last month, and bought some clothes, a real Parisdress and things." You would not know me in the new outfit. The skirt isof rather a daring shortness, but such is the mode now, and I am told itbecomes me. Poor Edward, he is so patient, except for spells when heseems to go mad with realizing his plight. He is still a man. Hisexpression is forceful. He doesn't smoke, and warns me against it,though the few cigarettes I allow myself are a precious relief. But Ihave promised him to give up the habit when the war is over. He is astrong man, but helpless. He still believes I am the pretty thing he sawin the post office. The skirt is pleated, light summer stuff, and fallsin a straight line. Of course I have the shoes and stockings that gowith it.""There!" exploded the judge. "Taking up with prize fighters--traipsinground in a regular French dress, looking like something she's notsupposed to be!""Lysander!" rebuked his wife hotly."He tells me lots about Wilbur," continued the letter. "He hints thatthe boy is in love, but will say nothing definite. Men are soclose-mouthed. I hope our boy doesn't marry some little French anybody.His face is not exactly pleasant to look upon for the time being, but hehas a very winning personality.""Who's she mean that for?" demanded the Judge, truculently. "The Cowanboy?"CHAPTER XXOn a day late in June of 1919 Wilbur Cowan dropped off the noon trainthat paused at Newbern Center. He carried the wicker suitcase he hadtaken away, and wore the same clothes. He had the casual, incurious lookof one who had been for a little trip down the line. No one about thestation heeded him, nor did he notice any one he knew. There was a newassemblage of station loafers, and none of these recognized him.Suitcase in hand, his soft hat pulled well down, he walked quickly roundthe crowd and took a roundabout way through quiet streets to thePenniman place.The town to his eye had shrunk; buildings were not so high as heremembered them, wide spaces narrower, streets shorter, less thronged.On his way he met old Mr. Dodwell, muffled about the throat, though theday was hot, walking feebly, planting a stout cane before him. Mr.Dodwell passed blinking eyes over him, went on, then turned to callback."Ain't that Wilbur Cowan? How de do, Wilbur? Ain't you been away?""For a little while," answered Wilbur. "Thought I hadn't seen you forsome time. Hot as blazes, ain't it?"He came to the Penniman place at the rear. The vegetable garden, lyingbetween the red barn and the white house, was as he had known it,uncared for, sad, discouraged. The judge's health could be no better. Onbare earth at the corner of the woodshed Frank, the dog, slumberedfitfully in the shade. He merely grumbled, rising to change his posture,when greeted. Feebly he sniffed the newcomer. It could be seen that hismemory was stirred, but his eyes told him nothing; he had a complainingair of saying one met so many people. It was beyond one to place themall. He whimpered when his ears were rubbed, seeming to recall afamiliar touch. Then with a deep sigh he fell asleep once more. Hismaster took up the suitcase and gained, without further encounters, thelittle room in the side-yard house. Yet he did not linger here. He keptseeing a small, barefoot boy who rummaged in a treasure box labelled"Cake." This boy made him uncomfortable. He went round to the front ofthe other house. On the porch, behind the morning-glory vine, JudgePenniman in his wicker chair languidly fanned himself, studying athermometer held in his other hand. He glanced up sharply."Well, come back, did you?""Yes, sir," said Wilbur, and sat on the top step to fan himself with hishat. "Warm, isn't it?"The judge brightened."Warm? Warm ain't any name for it! We been having a hot spell nobodyremembers the like of, man nor boy, for twenty years. Why, day beforeyesterday--say, I wish you'd been here! Talk about suffering! I washaving one of my bad days, and the least little thing I'd do I'd bepanting like a tuckered hound. Say, how was the war?""Oh, so-so," answered the returned private."You tell it well. Seems to me if I'd been off skyhootin' round inforeign lands--say, how about them French women? Pretty bold lot, Iguess, if you can believe all you--"The parrot in its cage at the end of the porch climbed to a perch withbeak and claw."Flapdoodle, Flapdoodle, Flapdoodle!" it screeched. The judge glaredmurderously at it."Wilbur Cowan, you bad, bad, bad child--not to let us know!" Mrs.Penniman threw back the screen door and rushed to embrace him. "Youregular fighting so-and-so!" she sobbed."Where'd you get that talk?" he demanded.Mrs. Penniman wiped her eyes with a dish towel suspended from one arm."Oh, we heard all about you!"She was warm, and shed gracious aromas. The returned one sniffed these."It's chops," he said--"and--and hot biscuits.""And radishes from the garden, and buttermilk and clover honey andraspberries, and--let me see--""Let's go!" said the soldier."Then you can tell us all about that war," said the invalid as withgroans he raised his bulk from the wicker chair."What war?" asked Wilbur.       *       *       *       *       *He spent the afternoon in the little room, where he would glance up tofind the small, barefoot boy staring at him in wonder; and out in thePenniman front yard, where the summer flowers bloomed. Thesesurroundings presented every assurance of safety, yet his restless,wide-sweeping gaze was full of caution, especially after the aeroplanewent over. At the first ominous note of its droning he had broken forcover. After that, in spite of himself, he would be glancing uneasily atthe Plummer place across the road. This was fronted by a hedge ofcypress--ideal machine-gun cover. But not once during the long afternoonwas he shot at. He brought out and repaired the lawn mower, oiled itsrusted parts and ran it gayly over the grass. At suppertime, when DaveCowan came, he was wetting the shorn sward with spray from a hose."Back?" said Dave, peering as at a bit of the far cosmos flung in hisway."Back," said his son.They shook hands."You haven't changed any," said Wilbur, scanning Dave's placid faceunder the straw hat and following the lines of his spare figure down tothe vestiges of a once noble pair of shoes."You only been away two years," said Dave. "I wouldn't change much inthat time. That's the way of the mind, though. We always forget howslowly evolution works its wonders. Anyhow, you know what they say inour trade--when a printer dies he turns into a white mule. I'm no whitemule yet. You've changed, though.""I didn't know it.""Face harder--about ten years older. Kind of set and sour looking. Everlaugh any more?""Of course I laugh.""You don't look it. Never forget how to laugh. It's a life-saver. Laugheven at wars and killings. Human life in each of us isn't much. It'slike that stream you're spreading over the ground. The drops fall backto earth, but the main stream is constant. That's all the life forcecares about--the main stream. Doesn't care about the drops; a few moreor less here and there make no difference.""Yes, sir," said Wilbur.Dave Cowan scanned the front of the house. The judge was not in sight.He went softly to lean above the parrot's cage and in low, wheedlingtones, uttered words to it."Flapdoodle, Flapdoodle, Flapdoodle!" screeched the parrot in return,and laughed harshly. The bird was a master of sarcastic inflection.Dave came back looking pleased and proud."Almost human," he declared. "Kept back a few million years byaccident--our little feathered brother." He gestured toward the house."Old Flapdoodle, in there, he's a rabid red these days. Got tired ofbeing a patriot. Worked hard for a year trying to prove that Vielhaberwas a German spy, flapping his curtain at night to the German ForeignOffice. But no one paid any attention to him except a few otherflapdoodles, so then he began to read your brother's precious words, andnow he's a violent comrade. Fact! expecting any day that the workerswill take things over and he'll come into money--money the interestshave kept him out of. He kind of licks his chops when he talks about it.Never heard him talk about his wife's share, though. Say, that brotherof yours is making a plumb fool of himself!""He didn't understand.""No--and he doesn't yet.""Where is he now?""Oh"--Dave circled a weary hand to the zenith--"off somewhereholy-rolling. Gets his name in the papers--young poet radical thatabandoned life of luxury to starve with toiling comrades. Say, do youknow what a toiling comrade gets per day now? No matter. Your brotherhasn't toiled any. Makes red-hot speeches. That Whipple bunch reared atlast and shut off his magazine money, so he said he couldn't takeanother cent wrung from the anguished sweat of serfs. But it ain't hishands he toils with, and he ain't a real one, either. Plenty of realones in his bunch that would stand the gaff, but not him. He's a shine.Of course they're useful, these reds. Keep things stirred up--humanyeast cakes, only they get to thinking they're the dough, too. Thatbrother of yours knows all the lines; says 'em hot, too, but that's onlyso he'll get more notice. Say, tell us about the war."It was an awful big one," said his son.       *       *       *       *       *Soon after a novel breakfast the following morning--in that it was lateand leisurely and he ate from a chair at a table--he heard the squealingbrakes of a motor car and saw one brought to a difficult stop at thePenniman gate. Sharon Whipple, the driver, turned to look back at themachine indignantly, as if it had misbehaved. Wilbur Cowan met him atthe gate.It became Sharon's pretense that he was not hugging the boy, merelyfeeling the muscles in his shoulders and back to see if he were as gooda lightweight as ever. He pounded and thumped and punched and even madeas if to wrestle with the returned soldier, laughing awkwardly throughit; but his florid face had paled with the excitement."I knew you'd come back! Old Sammy Dodwell happened to mention he'd seenyou; said he hadn't noticed you before for most a month, he thought. ButI knew you was coming, all right! Time and time again I told people youwould. Told every one that. I bet you had some narrow escapes, didn'tyou now?"Wilbur Cowan considered."Well, I had a pretty bad cold in the Argonne.""I want to know!" said Sharon, much concerned. He pranced heavy-footedlybefore the other, thumping his chest. "Well, I bet you threw it off! Ahard cold ain't any joke. But look here, come on for a ride!"They entered the car and Sharon drove. But he continued to bubble withquestions, to turn his head and gesture with one hand or the other. Thepassenger applied imaginary brakes as they missed a motor truck."Better let me take that," he suggested, and they changed seats."Out to the Home Farm," directed Sharon. "You ain't altered a mite," hewent on. "Little more peaked, mebbe--kind of more mature or judgmaticalor whatever you call it. Well, go on--tell about the war."But there proved to be little to tell, and Sharon gradually wearied fromthe effort of evoking this little. Yes, there had been fights. Big ones,lots of noise, you bet! The food was all right. The Germans were goodfighters. No; he had not been wounded; yes, that was strange. The Frenchwere good fighters. The British were good fighters. They were all goodfighters."But didn't you have any close mix-ups at all?" persisted Sharon."Oh, now and then; sometimes you couldn't get out of it.""Well, my shining stars! Can't you tell a fellow?""Oh, it wasn't much! You'd be out at night, maybe, and you'd meet one,and you'd trade a few punches, and then you'd tangle.""And you'd leave him there, eh?""Oh, sometimes!""Who did win the war, anyway?" Sharon was a little irritated by thisreticence.The other grinned."The British say they won it, and the last I heard the French said itwas God Almighty. Take your choice. Of course you did hear other gossipgoing round--you know how things get started."Sharon grunted."I should think as much. Great prunes and apricots! I should think therewould of been talk going round! Anyway, it was you boys that stopped thefight. I guess they'd admit that much--small-towners like you that wasready to fight for their country. Dear me, Suz! I should think as much!"On the crest of a hill overlooking a wide sweep of valley farmland thedriver stopped the car in shade and scanned the fields of grain wherethe green was already fading."There's the Home Farm," said Sharon. "High mighty! Some change since mygrandad came in here and fit the Injins and catamounts off it. I wonderwhat he'd say if he could hear what I'm paying for farm help rightnow--and hard to get at that. I don't know how I've managed. See thatmower going down there in the south forty? Well, the best man I've hadfor two years is cutting that patch of timothy. Who do you guess? It'smy girl, Juliana. She not only took charge for me, but she jumped inherself and did two men's work."Funny girl, that one. So quiet all these years, never saying much,never letting out. But she let out when the men went. I guess lots havebeen like her. You can see a woman doing anything nowadays. Why, theygot a woman burglar over to the county seat the other night! And I justread the speech of a silly-softy of a congressman telling why theyshouldn't have the vote. Hell! Excuse me for cursing so."Unconsciously Wilbur had been following with his eyes the course of thewillow-bordered creek. He half expected to hear the crisp little tackingof machine guns from its shelter, and he uneasily scanned the wood athis left. It was the valley of the Surmelin, and yonder was the Marne."I keep thinking I'll be shot at," he explained."You won't be. Safe as a church here--just like being in God's pocket.Say, don't that house look good to you?" He cocked a thumb toward thedwelling of the Home Farm in a flat space beyond the creek. It was thehouse of dull red brick, broad, low, square fronted, with many windows,the house in a green setting to which they had gone so many yearsbefore. Heat waves made it shimmer."Yes, it looks good," conceded Wilbur."Then listen, young man! You're to live there. It'll be yourheadquarters. You're going to manage the four other farms from there,and give me a chance to be seventy-three years old next Tuesday withouta thing on my mind. You ain't a farmer, but you're educated; you canlearn anything after you've seen it done; and farming is mostlycommonsense and machinery nowadays. So that's where you'll be,understand? No more dubbing round doing this and that, printing officeone day, garage the next, and nothing much the next. You're going tosettle down and take up your future, see?""Well, if you think I can.""I do! You're an enlightened young man. What I can't tell you Julianacan. I got a dozen tractors out of commission right now. Couldn't getany one to put 'em in shape. None of them dissipated noblemen round theMansion garage would look at a common tractor. You'll start on them.You're fixed--don't tell me no!""Yes, sir," said Wilbur."You done your bit in a fighting war; now you'll serve in a peacefulone. I don't know what the good Lord intends to come out of all thisrumpus, but I do know the world's going to need food. We'll raise it.""Yes, sir."Sharon glanced shrewdly at him sidewise."You're a better Whipple than any one else of your name ever got to be.""He didn't understand; he was misled or something.""Or something," echoed Sharon. "Listen! There's one little job you gotto do before you hole up out here. You heard about him, of course--theworry he's been to poor Harvey and the rest. Well, he's down there inNew York still acting squeamishy. I want you should go down and put thefear of God into him.""I understand he's mixed up with a lot of reds down there.""Red! Him? Humph!" Sharon here named an equally well-known primarycolour--not red. Wilbur protested."You don't get him," persisted the old man. "Listen, now! He cast offthe family like your father said he would. Couldn't accept another centof Whipple money. Going to work with his bare hands. Dressed up for itlike a hunter in one of these powder advertisements. All he needed was ashotgun and a setter dog with his tail up. And everybody in the houseworried he'd starve to death. Of course no one thought he'd work--thatwas one of his threats they didn't take seriously. But they promised tosit tight, each and all, and bring him to time the sooner."Well, he didn't come to time. We learned he was getting money from someplace. He still had it. So I begun to get my suspicions up. Last night Igot the bunch together, Gid and Harvey D. and Ella and Juliana, and Itaxed 'em with duplicity, and every last one of 'em was guilty aspaint--every goshed last one! Every one sending him fat checksunbeknownst to the others. Even Juliana! I never did suspect her. 'I didit because it's all a romance to him,' says she. 'I wanted him to go hisway, whatever it was, and find it bright.'"Wha'd you think of that from a girl of forty-eight or so that cantinker a mowing machine as good as you can? I ask you! Of course I'dsuspected the rest. A set of mushheads. Maybe they didn't look shamedwhen I exposed 'em! Each one had pictured the poor boy down there alone,undergoing hardship with his toiling workers or whatever you call 'em,and, of course, I thought so myself.""How much did you send him?" demanded Wilbur, suddenly."Not half as much as the others," returned Sharon in indignant triumph."If they'd just set tight like they promised and let me do the little Idone----""You were going to sit tight, too, weren't you?""Well, of course, that was different. Of course I was willing to shellout a few dollars now and then if he was going to be up against it for asquare meal. After all, he was Whipple by name. Of course he ain't gotWhipple stuff in him. That young man's talk always did have kind of anutty flavour. You come right down to it, he ain't a Whipple in hide norhair. Why, say, he ain't even two and seventy-five-hundredths per cent.Whipple!"Sharon had cunningly gone away from his own failure to sit tight. He wasproving flexible-minded here, as on the links.They were silent, looking out over the spread of Home Farm. The redhouse still shimmered in the heat waves. The tall trees about it hungmotionless. The click of the reaper in the south forty sounded like adistant locust."Put the fear of God into him," said Sharon at last. "Let him know themchecks have gosh all truly stopped.""Yes, sir," said Wilbur."Now drive on and we'll look the house over. The last tenant let it rundown. But I'll fix it right for you. Why, like as not you'll be having amissis and young ones of your own there some day.""I might; you can't tell.""Well, I wish they was going to be Whipple stock. Ours is running down.I don't look for any prize-winners from your brother; he'll likely marrythat widow, or something, that wants to save America like Russia hasbeen. And Juliana, I guess she wasn't ever frivolous enough formarriage. And that Pat--she'll pick out one of them boys with a headlike a seal, that knows all the new dances and what fork to use. Trusther! Not that she didn't show Whipple stuff over there. But she's arattlepate in peacetime.""Yes, sir," said Wilbur.He left a train at the Grand Central Station in New York early thefollowing evening. He had the address of Merle's apartment on lowerFifth Avenue, and made his way there on foot through streets crowdedwith the war's backwash. Men in uniform were plentiful, and he was manytimes hailed by them. Though out of uniform himself, they seemed toidentify him with ease. Something in his walk, the slant of hisshoulders, and the lean, browned, watchful face--the eyes set for widerhorizons than a mere street--served to mark him as one of them.The apartment of Merle proved to be in the first block above WashingtonSquare. While he scanned doors for the number he was seized and turnedabout by a playful creature in uniform."Well, Buck Cowan, you old son of a gun!""Gee, gosh, Stevie! How's the boy?"They shook hands, moving to the curb where they could talk."What's the idea?" demanded ex-Private Cowan. "Why this dead part oftown for so many of the boys?"Service men were constantly sauntering by them or chatting in littlegroups at the curb."She's dead, right now," Steve told him, "but she'll wake up pronto.Listen, Buck, we got the tip! A lot of them fur-faced boys that hurl themerry bombs are goin' to pull off a red-flag sashay up the Avenoo. Getit? Goin' to set America free!""I get it!" said Wilbur."Dirty work at the crossroads," added Steve."Say, Steve, hold it for twenty minutes, can't you? I got to see a mandown here. Be good; don't hurt any one till I get back.""Do my best," said Steve, "but they're down there in the Square nowstackin' up drive impedimenta and such, red banners, and so forth,tuning up to warble the hymn to free Russia. Hurry if you want to joinout with us!""I'll do that little thing, Steve. See you again." He passed on, makinga way through the jostling throng of soldiers and civilians. "Just myluck," he muttered. "I hope the kid isn't in." Never before had hethought of his brother as "the kid."He passed presently through swinging glass doors, and in a hallway wastold by a profusely buttoned youth in spectacles that Mr. Whipple wasout. It was not known when he would be in. His movements were uncertain."He might be in or he might be out," said the boy.He was back in the street, edging through the crowd, his head up,searching for the eager face of Steve Kennedy, late his sergeant.Halfway up the next block he found him pausing to roll a cigarette.Steve was a scant five feet, and he was telling a private who was ascant six feet that there would be dirty work at the crossroads--whenthe fur-faces started."We're too far away," suggested Wilbur. "If they start from the Squarethey'll be mussed up before they get here. You can't expect peoplefarther down to save 'em just for you. Where's your tactics, Steve?"They worked slowly back down the Avenue. It was nine o'clock now, andthe street was fairly free of vehicles. The night was clear and thestreet lights brought alert, lean profiles into sharp relief, faces ofmen in uniform sauntering carelessly or chatting in little groups at thecurb. A few unseeing policemen, also sauntering carelessly, were to beobserved."Heard a fur-face speak last night," said Steve. "It's a long story,mates, but it seems this is one rotten Government and everybody knows itbut a few cops. If someone would only call off the cops and let thefur-faces run it we might have a regular country."From the Square singing was now heard."Oh, boy!" murmured the tall private, dreamily; "am I glad I'm here?"Stretching a long neck to peer toward the Square, he called in warm,urgent tones: "Oh, come on, you reds--come on, red!"They came on. Out from the Square issued a valiant double line ofmarchers, men and women, their voices raised in the Internationale. Attheir head, bearing aloft a scarlet banner of protest, strode acommanding figure in corduroys, head up, his feet stepping a martialpace."I choose that general," said the tall private, and licked his lips."Not if I get him first," shouted Steve, and sprang from the walk intothe roadway.But ex-Private Cowan was ahead of them both. He had not waited forspeech. A crowd from each side of the Avenue had surged into the roadwayto greet the procession. The banner bearer was seen to hesitate, to losestep, but was urged from the rear by other banner bearers. He came onagain. Once more he stepped martially. The Internationale swelled involume. The crowd, instead of opening a way, condensed more solidlyabout the advance. There were jeers and shoving. The head of the lineagain wavered. Wilbur Cowan had jostled a way toward this leader. Helost no time in going into action. But the pushing crowd impaired hisaim, and it was only a glancing blow that met the jaw of the corduroyedstandard bearer.The standard toppled forward from his grasp, and its late bearer turnedquickly aside. As he turned Wilbur Cowan reached forward to close a handabout the corduroy collar. Then he pulled. The standard bearer came backeasily to a sitting posture on the asphalt. The crowd was close in,noisily depriving other bearers of their standards. The Internationalehad become blurred and discordant, like a bad phonograph record. Theparade still came to break and flow about the obstruction.Wilbur Cowan jerked his prize up and whirled him about. He contemplatedfurther atrocities. But the pallid face of his brother was now revealedto him."Look out there!" he warned the crowd, and a way was opened.He drew back on the corduroy collar, then sent it forward with a mightyshove. His captive shot through the opening, fell again to the pavement,but was up and off before those nearest him could devise furtherentertainment. Among other accomplishments Merle had been noted incollege for his swiftness of foot. He ran well, heading for the north,skillfully avoiding those on the outskirts of the crowd who would havetackled him. Wilbur Cowan watched him out of sight, beyond the area ofcombat. Then he worked his own way from it and stood to watch thefurther disintegration of the now leaderless parade.The tumult died, the crowd melted away. Policemen became officious. Fromareaways up and down the Avenue forms emerged furtively, walkeddiscreetly to corners and skurried down side streets. Here and there acrimson banner flecked the asphalt. Steve and the tall private issuedfrom the last scrimmage, breathing hard."Nothing to it!" said the tall private. "Only I skun my knuckles.""I was aimin' a wallop at that general," complained Steve, "butsomething blew him right out of my hand. Come on up to Madison Avenoo. Iheard they was goin' to save America up there, too.""Can't," said Wilbur. "Got to see a man.""Well, so long, Buck!"He waved to them as they joined the northward moving crowd."Gee, gosh!" he said.       *       *       *       *       *"No, sir; Mr. Whipple hasn't come in yet. He just sent word he wouldn'tbe back at all to-night," said the spectacled hall boy. But his mannerwas so little ingenuous that once again the hand of Wilbur Cowan closeditself eloquently about the collar of a jacket."Get into that elevator and let me out at his floor.""You let me alone!" said the hall boy. "I was going to."He knocked a third time before he could hear a faint call. He opened thedoor. Beyond a dim entrance hall the light fell upon his brother seatedat a desk, frowning intently at work before him. The visible half of himwas no longer in corduroy. It was incased in a smoking jacket ofvelvet, and his neck was conventionally clad in collar and cravat. Thelatter had been hastily tied."Why, Wilbur, old man!" cried Merle in pleased surprise. He half rosefrom the desk, revealing that below the waist he was still corduroy orproletarian. Along his left jaw was a contusion as from a glancing blow.He was still breathing harder than most men do who spend quiet eveningsat desks.Wilbur advanced into the room, but paused before reaching the desk. Itwas an invitingly furnished room of cushioned couches, paintings,tapestries, soft chairs, warmly toned rugs. The desk at which Merletoiled was ornate and shining. Ex-Private Cowan felt a sudden revulsion.He was back, knee-deep in trench bilge, tortured in all his being,looking at death from behind a sandbag. Vividly he recalled why he hadendured that torture."You're all out of condition," he announced in even tones to Merle. "Alittle sprint like that shouldn't get your wind."Merle's look of sunny welcome faded to one of chagrin. He fell back inhis chair. He was annoyed."You saw that disgraceful outbreak, then?""I was in luck to-night.""Did you see that drunken rowdy strike at me, and then try to get medown where he and those other brutes could kick me?"Wilbur's stare was cool. He was feeling the icy muck about his numbedlegs."I was the one that struck at you. Too many elbows in the way and Iflubbed it." He noted his brother start and stiffen in his chair. "And Ididn't try to get you down. When I saw it was you I got you up and shotyou out where you could run--if you wanted to. And I wasn't drunk, andI'm not a rowdy."Merle gazed with horror upon the apparently uncontrite fratricide. Twicehe essayed to speak before he found the words."Do you think that was a brave thing to do?""No--but useful. I've been brave a lot of times where it didn't do asmuch good as that.""Useful!" breathed Merle, scathingly. "Useful to brutalize a lot ofbrave souls who merely sought--" he broke off with a new sense ofoutrage. "And not a policeman there to do his duty!" he finishedresentfully.Wilbur Cowan sat in a carven chair near a corner of the beautiful desk,hitching it forward to rest his arms on the desk's top. He was newlyappraising this white-faced brother."Whining!" he suddenly snapped. "Get up and boast that you're outlaws,going to keel the Government off its pins. Then you get the gaff, andthe first thing you do is whine for help from that same Government! Yousay it's rotten, but you expect it to watch over you while you knock itdown. If you're going to be an outlaw, take an outlaw's chance. Don'tsqueal when you get caught. You say the rules are rotten, then you fallback on them. What kind of sportsmanship is that?"Wearily but with a tolerant smile Merle pushed back the fallen lock withone white hand."What could you understand of all this?" he asked, gently. "We merelyclaim the right of free speech.""And use it to tell other people to upset the Government! That crowdto-night did what you tell your people to do--went against the rules.But you can't take your own medicine. A fine bunch of spoiled childrenyou are! Been spoiled by too easy a Government at that!" He broke off tostudy Merle again. "You're pasty, out of condition," he repeated,inconsequently.Again his brother's intolerant smile."You have all the cant of the reactionary," he retorted, again gently."It's the spirit of intolerance one finds everywhere. You can't expectone of my--" he hesitated, showing a slight impatience. "I've been toolong where they are thinking," he said."Aren't you people intolerant? You want to break all the rules, andthose same rules have made us a pretty good big country.""Ah, yes, a big country--big! We can always boast of our size, can't we?I dare say you believe its bigness is a sign of our merit." Merle hadrecovered his poise. He was at home in satire. "Besides, I've broken norules, as you call them.""Oh, I'll bet you haven't! You'd be careful not to. I see that much. Butyou try to get smaller children to. I'd have more patience with you ifyou'd taken a chance yourself.""Patience with me--you?" Merle relished this. His laugh was sincere."You--would have more patience with--me!" But his irony went for littlewith a man still at the front."Sure! If only you'd smashed a few rules yourself. Take that girl andher partner they arrested the other day. They don't whine. They'rebehind the bars, but still cussing the Government. You've got to respectfighters like that Liebknecht the Germans killed, and that RosaWhat's-Her-Name. They were game. But you people, you try to put on alltheir airs without taking their chances. That's why you make me sotired--always keeping your martyr's halo polished and handy where youcan slip it out of a pocket when you get just what you've been askingfor.""You're not too subtle, are you? But then one could hardly expectsubtlety--"Merle was again almost annoyed."Subtle be jiggered! Do you think you people are subtle? About as subtleas a ton of bricks. All your talk in that magazine about this being aland of the dollar, no ideals, no spirituality, a land ofmoney-grubbers--all that other stuff! Say, I want to tell you this isthe least money-grubbing land there is! You people would know that ifyou had any subtlety. Maybe you did know it. We went into that scrap foran ideal, and we're the only country that did. France might have gonefor an ideal, but France had to fight, anyway."England? Do you think England went in only to save poor littleBelgium? She herself was the next dish on the bill of fare. But we wentin out of general damfoolishness--for an ideal--this country you saiddidn't have any. We don't care about money--less than any of thosepeople. Watch a Frenchman count his coppers, or an Englishman thatcarries his in a change purse and talks about pounds but really thinksin shillings. We carry our money loose and throw it away."If this country had been what your sniveling little magazine called itwe'd never have gone into that fight. You're not even subtle enough toknow that much. We knew it would cost like hell, but we knew it was agreat thing to do. Not another nation on earth would have gone in forthat reason. That's the trouble with you poor little shut-ins; youdecide the country hasn't any ideals because someone runs a stockyardout in Chicago or a foundry in Pittsburgh. God help you people if you'dhad your way about the war! The Germans would be taking that nonsenseout of you by this time. And to think you had me kind of ashamed when Iwent over! I thought you knew something then." He concluded on a notealmost plaintive.Merle had grown visibly impatient."My dear fellow, really! Your point of view is interesting enough, evenif all too common. You are true to type, but so crude a type--so crude!""Sure, I'm crude! The country itself is crude, I guess. But it takes acrude country to have ideals--ideals with guts. Your type isn't crude, Isuppose, but it hasn't any ideals, either.""No ideals! No ideals! Ah, but that's the best thing you've said!"He laughed masterfully, waving aside the monstrous accusation."Well, maybe it is the best thing I've said. You haven't any ideals thatwould get any action out of you. You might tear down a house, but you'dnever build one. No two of you could agree on a plan. Every one of youis too conceited about himself. If you had the guts to upset theGovernment to-morrow you'd be fighting among yourselves before night,and you'd have a chief or a king over you the next day, just as surelyas they got one in Russia. It'll take them a hundred years over there toget back to as good a government as we have right now."You folks haven't any ideals except to show yourselves off. That's myprivate opinion. The way you used to tell me I didn't have any form ingolf. You people are all gesture; you can get up on a platform and takeperfect practice swings at a government, but you can't hit the ball. Youused to take bully practice swings at golf, but you couldn't hit theball because you didn't have any ideal. You were a good shadow golfer,like a shadow boxer that can hit dandy blows when he's hitting atnothing. Shadow stuff, shadow ideals, shadow thinkers--that's what youpeople are--spoiled children pretending you're deep thinkers."Merle turned wearily to a sheaf of papers at his hand."You'll see one day," he said, quietly, "and it won't be a far day.Nothing now, not even the brute force of your type, can retard the sweepof the revolution. The wave is shaping, the crest is formed. Six monthsfrom now--a year at most----"He gestured with a hand ominously.Wilbur briefly considered this prophecy."Oh, I know things look exciting here, but why wouldn't they after theturnover they've had? And I know there's grafting and profiteering andhigh prices and rotten spots in the Government, but why not? That'sanother trouble with you people: you seem to think that some form ofgovernment will be perfect. You seem to expect a perfect government fromimperfect human beings.""Ah," broke in Merle, "I recognize that! That's some of the dear oldDave Cowan talk.""Well, don't turn it down just on that account. Sometimes he isn't socrazy. He sees through you people. He knows you would take all youcould get in this world just as quick as the rest of us. He knows thatmuch."Merle waved it aside."Six months from now--a year at the most! A thrill of freedom has runthrough the people!"Wilbur had relaxed in his chair. He spoke more lightly, scanning theface of his brother with veiled curiosity."By the way, speaking of revolutions, there's been kind of a one atNewbern; kind of a family revolution. A little one, but plenty of kickin it. They want you to come back and be a good boy. That's really whatI came down here to say for them. Will you come back with me?"Merle drew himself up--injured."Go back! Back to what? When my work is here, my heart, my life? I'velet you talk because you're my brother. And you're so naively honest inyour talk about our wonderful country and its idealism and thecontemptible defects of a few of us who have the long vision! But I'velet you talk, and now I must tell you that I am with this cause to theend. I can't expect your sympathy, or the sympathy of my people backthere, but I must go my own way without it, fight my own battle--"He was interrupted in a tone he did not like."Sympathy from the folks back there? Say, what do you mean--sympathy?Did I tell you what this revolution back there was all about? Did I tellyou they've shut down on you?""You didn't! I still don't get your meaning.""You cast them off, didn't you?""Oh!" A white hand deprecated this. "That's Sharon Whipple talk--hisfamous brand of horse humour. Surely, you won't say he's too subtle!""Well, anyway, you said you couldn't accept anything more from them whenyou left; you were going to work with your hands, and so forth. Youweren't going to take any more of their tainted money.""I've no doubt dear old Sharon would put it as delicately as that.""Well, did you work with your hands? Have you had to be a toiler?""Oh, naturally I had resources! But might I ask"--Merle said it withchill dignity--"may I inquire just what relation this might have----""You won't have resources any longer.""Eh?" Merle this time did not wave. He stared stonily at his informant."That was the revolution. They called each other down and found thatevery last one of them had been sending you money, each thinking he wasthe only one and no one wanting you to starve. Even your dear old SharonWhipple kicked in every month. No wonder I didn't find you in atenement.""Preposterous!" expostulated Merle."Wasn't it? Anyway, they all got mad at each other, and then they allgot mad at you; then they swore an oath or something." He pausedimpressively. "No more checks!""Preposterous!" Merle again murmured."But kind of plausible, wasn't it? Sharon wasn't any madder than theothers when they found each other out. Mrs. Harvey D. is the only onethey think they can't trust now. They're going to watch that woman'sfunds. Say, anything she gets through the lines to you--won't keep youfrom toiling!""Poor Mother Ella!" murmured Merle, his gaze remotely upon the woman."She has always been so fond of me.""They're all fond of you, for that matter, I think they're fonder of youthan if you'd been born there. But still they're rank Bolsheviks rightnow. They confiscated your estates.""I didn't need you to tell me they're fond of me," retorted Merle withrecovered spirit. He sighed. "They must have missed me horribly thislast year." There was contrition in his tone. "I suppose I should havetaken time to think of that, but you'll never know how my work here hasengrossed me. I suppose one always does sacrifice to ideals. Still, Iowed them something--I should have remembered that." He closed on a noteof regret."Well, you better go back with me. They'll be mighty glad to see you.""We can make that eleven-forty-eight if we hurry," he said. "I'll haveto change a few things."He bustled cheerily into a bedroom. As he moved about there he whistledthe "Marseillaise."Ten minutes later he emerged with bag, hat, and stick. The last item ofcorduroy had vanished from his apparel. He was quietly dressed, as anexploiter of the masses or a mechanic. He set the bag on the desk, andgoing to a window peered from behind the curtain into the street."Some of those rowdies are still prowling about," he said, "but thereare cabs directly across the street."He pulled the soft hat well down over his brow.Wilbur had sat motionless in his chair while the dressing went on. Hegot up now."Listen!" he said. "If you hear back home of my telling people you're adangerous radical, don't be worried. Even the Cowans have some familypride. And don't worry about the prowling rowdies out there. I'll getyou across the street to a cab. Give me the bag."As they crossed the street, Merle--at his brother's elbow--somewhatjauntily whistled, with fair accuracy, not the "Marseillaise," but aninnocent popular ballad. Nor did he step aside for a torn strip of redcloth lying in their way.CHAPTER XXIThe next morning Wilbur found the Penniman household in turmoil. Thespirit of an outraged Judge Penniman pervaded it darkly, and his wifewept as she flurried noisily about the kitchen. Neither of them wouldregard him until he enforced their notice. The judge, indignantlyfanning himself in the wicker porch chair, put him off with vague blackmutters about Winona. The girl had gone from bad to worse. But hisskirts were clean. The mother was the one to blame. He'd talked all hecould.Then Wilbur, in the disordered kitchen, put himself squarely in the wayof the teary mother. He commanded details. The distraught woman, hairtumbling from beneath a cap set rakishly to one side, vigorously stirredyellow dough in an earthen mixing dish."Stop this nonsense!" he gruffly ordered.Mrs. Penniman abandoned the long spoon and made a pitiful effort to dryher eyes with an insufficient apron."Winona!" she sobbed. "Telegram--coming home tomorrow--nothing cookedup--trying to make chocolate cake--""Why take it so hard? You knew the blow had to fall some time."Mrs. Penniman broke down again."It's not a joke!" she sobbed. Then with terrificeffort--"Mar--married!""Winona Penniman married?"The stricken mother opened swimming eyes at him, nodding hopelessly."Why, the little son of a gun!" said Wilbur, admiringly. "I didn't thinkshe'd be so reckless!""I'm so glad!" whimpered the mother.She seized the spoon and the bowl. Judge Penniman hovered at the opendoor of the kitchen."I told her what would happen!" he stormed. "She'll listen to me nexttime! Always the way in this house!"Mrs. Penniman relapsed."We don't know the party. Don't know him from Adam. She don't even signher right name."Wilbur left the house of mourning and went out to the barn, where allthat day he worked at the Can, fretting it at last into a decentactivity.Dave Cowan that night became gay and tasteless on hearing the news. Hedid what he could to fan the judge's resentment. He said it wasprobably, knowing Winona's ways, that she had wed a dissolute Frenchnobleman, impoverished of all but his title. He hoped for the best, buthe had always known that the girl was a light-minded baggage. Hewondered how she could ever justify her course to Matthew Arnold if theneed rose. He said the old house would now be turned into a saloon, orsalong, as the French call it. He wished to be told if the right to beaddressed as Madame la Marquise could compensate the child for thosethings of simple but enduring worth she had cast aside. He somewhatcheered Mrs. Penniman, but left the judge puffing with scorn.       *       *       *       *       *Wilbur Cowan met the noon train next day. The Can rattled far too muchfor its size, but it went. Then from the train issued Winona, bedeckedin alien gauds and fur-belows, her keen little face radiant under aParis trifle of brown velvet, her small feet active--under a skirt whosescant length would once have appalled her--in brown suede pumps andstockings notoriously of silken texture. Her quick eyes darting alongthe platform to where Wilbur stood, she rushed to embrace him."Where's the other one?" he demanded.Astoundingly she tripped back to the still emptying car and led forwardnone other than Edward--Spike--Brennon. He was in the uniform of aprivate and his eyes were hidden by dark glasses. Wilbur fell upon him.Spike's left arm went up expertly to guard his face from the rush, butcame down when he recognized his assailant. Wilbur turned again toWinona."But where's he?" he asked. "Where's the main squeeze?"Winona looked proudly at Spike Brennon."I'm him," said Spike."He's him," said Winona, and laid an arm protectingly across hisshoulder."You wild little son of a gun!" He stared incredulously at the bride,then kissed her. "You should say 'he's he,' not 'he's him,'" he toldher."Lay off that stuff!" ordered Winona."You come on home to trouble," directed Wilbur. He guided Spike to thecar."It's like one of these dreams," said Spike above the rattle of the Can."How a pretty thing like her could look twice at me!"Winona held up a gloved hand to engage the driver's eye. Then shewinked."Say," said Spike, "this is some car! When I get into one now'days Ilike to hear it go. I been in some lately you could hardly tell youmoved."The front of the house was vacant when the Can laboured to the gate,though the curtain of a second-floor front might have been seen to move.Winona led her husband up the gravelled walk."It's lovely," she told him, "this home of mine and yours. Here you gobetween borders all in bloom, phlox and peonies, and there are pansiesand some early dahlias, and there's a yellow rosebush out.""It smells beautiful," said Spike. He sniffed the air on each side."Sit here," said Winona, nor in the flush of the moment was sheconscious of the enormity of what she did. She put Spike into a chairthat had for a score of years been sacred to the person of her invalidfather. Then she turned to greet her mother. Mrs. Penniman, arrayed infancy dress-making, was still damp-eyed but joyous."Your son, mother," said Winona. "Don't try to get up, Spike."Mrs. Penniman bent over to kiss him. Spike's left went up accurately."He's so nervous," explained Winona, "ever since that French generalsneaked up and kissed him on both cheeks when he pinned that medal onhim.""Mercy!" exclaimed Mrs. Penniman."For distinguished service beyond the line of duty," added the youngwife, casually."I was so happy when I got your wire," sputtered her mother. "Of course,I was flustered just at first--so sudden and all.""In the Army we do things suddenly," said Winona.Heavy steps sounded within, and the judge paused at the open door. Hewas arrayed as for the Sabbath, a portentous figure in frock coat andgray trousers. A heavy scent of moth balls had preceded him."What's that new one I get?" asked Spike, sniffing curiously.Winona pecked at her father's marbled cheeks, then led him to the chair."Father, this is my husband.""How do you do, sir?" began the judge, heavily.Spike's left forearm shielded his face, while his right hand went tomeet the judge's."It's all right, Spike. No one else is going to kiss you.""Spike?" queried the judge, uncertainly."It's a sort of nickname for him," explained Winona.She drew her mother through the doorway and they became murmurous in theparlour beyond."This here is a peach of a chair," said Spike.The judge started painfully. Until this moment he had not detected theoutrage."Wouldn't you prefer this nice hammock?" he politely urged."No, thanks," replied Spike, firmly. "This chair kind of fits my frame."Wilbur Cowan, standing farther along the porch, winked at Spike beforehe remembered."Say, ain't you French?" demanded the judge with a sudden qualm.He had taken no stock in that fool talk of Dave Cowan's about a Frenchnobleman; still, you never could tell. He had thought it as well to bedressed for it should he be required to meet even impoverished nobility."Hell, no!" said Spike. "Irish!" He moved uneasily in the chair. "Excuseme," he added."Oh!" said the judge, regretting the superior comfort of his linen suit.He eyed the chair with covetous glance. "Well, I hope everything's allfor the best," he said, doubtfully."How beautiful it smells!" said Spike, sniffing away from the moth ballstoward the rosebush. "Everything's beautiful, and this peach of a chairand all. What gets me--how a beautiful girl like she is could ever takea second look at me."The judge regarded him sharply, with a new attention to the hidden eyes."Say, are you blind?" he asked."Blind as a bat! Can't see my hand before my face."The horrified judge stalked to the door."You hear that?" he called in, but only the parrot heeded him."Flapdoodle, Flapdoodle, Flapdoodle!" it screeched.Winona and her mother came to the door. They had been absent for a briefcry."What she could ever see in me," Spike was repeating--"a pretty girllike that!""Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!" screamedthe parrot.Its concluding laugh was evil with irony. Winona sped to the cage,regarding her old pet with dismay. She glanced back at Spike."Smart birdie, all right, all right," called Spike. "He knows her.""Pretty girl, pretty girl!" Again came the derisive guffaw.Never had Polly's sarcasm been so biting. Winona turned a murderousglance from it and looked uneasily back at her man."Dinner's on," called Mrs. Penniman."I'm having one of my bad days," groaned the judge. "Don't feel as if Icould eat a mouthful."But he was merely insuring that he could be the first to leave the tableplausibly. He intended that the apparent misunderstanding about thewicker chair should have been but a thing of the moment, quickly pastand forgotten."Why, what's the trouble with you, Father?" asked Winona in the tone ofone actually seeking information.The judge shot her a hurt look. It was no way to address an invalid ofhis standing."Chow, Spike," said Wilbur, and would have guided him, but Winona waslightly before him.Dave Cowan followed them from the little house."Present me to His Highness," said he, after kneeling to kiss the handof Winona.       *       *       *       *       *The mid-afternoon hours beheld Spike Brennon again strangely occupyingthe wicker porch chair. He even wielded the judge's very own palm-leaffan as he sat silent, sniffing at intervals toward the yellow rose. Oncehe was seen to be moving his hand, with outspread fingers, before hisface.Winona had maneuvered her father from the chair, nor had she the graceto veil her subterfuge after she lured him to the back of the house. Shemerely again had wished to know what, in plain terms, his ailment was;what, for that matter, had been the trouble with him for twenty years.The judge fell speechless with dismay."You eat well and you sleep well, and you're well nourished" went on thedaughter, remorseless all at once."Little you know," began the judge at last."But I shall know, Father. Remember, I've learned things. I'm going totake you in hand. I may even have to be severe with you but all for yourown good."She spoke with icy conviction. There was a new, cold gleam in her pryingeyes. The judge suffered genuinely."I should think you had learned things!" he protested, miserably. "Forone thing, miss, that skirt ain't a respectable garment."Winona slid one foot toward him."Pooh! Don't be silly!" Never before had Winona poohed her father."Cigarette fiend, too," accused the judge."My husband got me to stop.""Strong drink," added the judge."Pooh!" again breathed Winona. "A little nip of something when you'redone up.""You talking that way!" admonished the twice-poohed parent. "You thatwas always so----""I'm not it any longer." She did a dance step toward the front door, butcalled back to him: "Spike's set his heart on that chair. You'll have tofind something else for yourself.""'Twon't always be so," retorted the judge, stung beyond reason at thecareless finality of her last words. "You wait--wait till the revolutionsweeps you high and mighty people out of your places! Wait till theworkers take over their rights--you wait!"But Winona had not waited. She had gone to confer on Wilbur Cowan a fewprecious drops of that which had caused her father to put upon her thestigma of alcoholic intemperance."It's real genuine dandelion wine," she told him. "One of the nursesgot it for me when we left the boat in Boston. Her own mother made it,and she gave me the recipe, and it isn't a bit of trouble. I'm goingafter dandelions to-morrow, Spike and I. Of course we'll have to besecret about it."In the sacred precincts of the Penniman parlour Wilbur Cowan raised thewineglass to his lips and tasted doubtingly. After a second consideringsip he announced--"They can't arrest you for that."Winona looked a little relieved, but more than a little disappointed."I thought it had a kick," she mourned."Here's to you and him, anyway! Didn't I always tell you he was one goodlittle man?""He's all of that," said Winona, and tossed off her own glass of whatshe sincerely hoped was not a permitted beverage."You've come on," said Wilbur."I haven't started," said Winona.       *       *       *       *       *Later that afternoon Winona sat in her own room in close consultationwith Juliana Whipple. Miss Whipple, driving her own car as no otherWhipple could have driven it, had hastened to felicitate the bride.Tall, gaunt, a little stooped now, her weathered face aglow, she hadascended the steps to greet the couple. Spike's tenancy of the chair hadbeen made doubly secure by Winona on the step at his feet.Juliana embraced Winona and took one of Spike's knotted hands to presswarmly between both her own. Then Winona had dragged her to privacy, andtheir talk had now come to a point."It's that--that parrot!" exploded Winona, desperately. "I never used tonotice, but you know--that senseless gabble, 'pretty girl, pretty girl,'and then the thing laughs like a fiend. It would be all right if hewouldn't laugh. You might think he meant it. And poor Spike is sosensitive; he gets things you wouldn't think he'd get. That awful birdmight set him to thinking. Now he believes I'm pretty. In spite ofeverything I've said to him, he believes it. Well, I'm not going to havethat bird putting any other notion into his mind, not if I have to--"She broke off, but murder was in her tone."I see," said Miss Whipple. "You're right, of course--only you arepretty, Winona. I never used to think--think about it, I mean, butyou've changed. You needn't be afraid of any parrot."Winona patted the hand of Miss Whipple, an able hand suggesting that ofSpike in its texture and solidity."That's ever so nice of you, but I know all about myself. Spike's eyesare gone, but that bird is going, too.""Why not let me take the poor old thing?" said Juliana. "It can say'pretty girl' to me and laugh its head off if it wants." She hung amoment on this, searching Winona's face with clear eyes. "I have noblind husband," she finished."You're a dear," said Winona."I'm so glad for you," said Juliana."I must guard him in so many ways," confided Winona. "He's happynow--he's forgotten for the moment. But sometimes it comes back on himterribly--what he is, you know. I've seen him over there losecontrol--want to kill himself. He says he can't help such times. It willseem to him that someone has shut him in a dark room and he must breakdown its walls--break out into the light. He would try to break thewalls down--like a caged beast. It wasn't pretty. And I'm his eyes andall his life, and no old bird is ever going to set him thinking I'm notperfectly beautiful. That's the plain truth. I may lie about it myselfto him pretty soon. I might as well. He only thinks I'm being flirtywhen I deny it. Oh, I know I've changed! Sometimes it seems to me now asif I used to be--well, almost prudish.""My dear, he knows better than you do, much better, how beautiful youare. But you're right about the bird. I'll take him gladly." Shereflected a moment. "There's a fine place for the cage in my room--on myhope chest.""You dear!" said Winona. "Of course I couldn't have killed it."Downstairs ten minutes later Winona, the light of filial devotion in hereyes, was explaining to her father that she was giving the parrot awaybecause she had noticed that it annoyed him.The judge beamed gratitude."Why, it's right thoughtful of you, Winona. It does annoy me, kind of.That miserable Dave Cowan's taught it some new rigmarole--no meaning toit, but bothersome when you want to be quiet."Even in the days of her white innocence Winona Penniman had not beenabove doing a thing for one reason while advancing another lesspersonal. She had always been a strange girl.Juliana took leave of Spike."You have a lovely wife," she told him. "It isn't going to be too hardfor you, this life.""Watch us!" said Winona. "I'll make his life more beautiful than I am."Her hand fluttered to his shoulder."Oh, me? I'll be all right," said Spike."And thank you for this wonderful bird," said Juliana.She lifted the cage from its table and went slowly toward the gate. Theparrot divined that dirty work was afoot, but it had led a peaceful lifeand its repertoire comprised no call of alarm."Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl!" it shrieked. Then followed itsharshest laugh of scorn.Juliana did not quicken her pace to the car; she finished the littlejourney in all dignity, and placed her burden in the tonneau."Pretty girl, pretty girl!" screamed the dismayed bird. The laugh waslong and eloquent of derision.Dave Cowan reached the Penniman gate, pausing a moment to watch the carleave. Juliana shot him one swift glance while the parrot laughed."Who was that live-looking old girl?" he demanded as he came up thesteps. "Oh!" he said when Winona told him.He glanced sympathetically after the car. A block away it had slowed toturn a corner. The parrot's ironic laughter came back to them."Yes, I remember her," said Dave, musingly. He was glad to recall thathe had once shown the woman a little attention.CHAPTER XXIIOf all humans cumbering the earth Dave Cowan thought farmers the mostpitiable. To this tireless-winged bird of passage farming was not aloose trade, and the news that his son was pledged to agrarian pursuitsshocked him. To be mewed up for life on a few acres of land!"It was the land tricked us first," admonished Dave. "There we were,footloose and free, and some fool went and planted a patch of ground.Then he stayed like a fool to see what would happen. Pretty soon hefenced the patch to keep out prehistoric animals. First thing he knew hewas fond of it. Of course he had to stay there--he couldn't take if offwith him. That's how man was tricked. Most he could ever hope after thatwas to be a small-towner. You may think you can own land and still befree, but you can't. Before you know it you have that home feeling.Never owned a foot of it! That's all that saved me."Dave frowned at his son hopefully, as one saved might regard one whostill might be."I'm not owning any land," suggested his son."No; but it's tricky stuff. You get round it, working at it, nursingit--pretty soon you'll want to own some, then you're dished. It's thefirst step that counts. After that you may crave to get out and seeplaces, but you can't; you have to plant the hay and the corn. You tofool round those Whipple farms--I don't care if it is a big job with bigmoney--it's playing with fire. Pretty soon you'll be as tight-fixed to apatch of soil as any yap that ever blew out the gas in a city hotel.You'll stick there and raise hogs _en masse_ for free people that cantake a trip when they happen to feel like it." Dave had but latelylearned _en masse_ and was glad to find a use for it. He spoke with theuntroubled detachment of one saved, who could return at will to the gladlife of nomady. "You, with the good loose trades you know! Do you wantto take root in this hole like a willow branch that someone shoves intothe ground? Don't you ever want to move--on and on and on?"His son at the time had denied stoutly that he felt this urge. Now,after a week of his new work, he would have been less positive. It was aSunday afternoon, and he sprawled face down on the farther shaded slopeof West Hill, confessing a lively fear that he might take root like thewillow. Late in that first week the old cry had begun to ring in hisears--Where do we go from here?--bringing the cold perception that hewould not go anywhere from here.Through all his early years in Newbern he had not once felt thewander-bidding; never, as Dave Cowan put it, had he been itchy-footedfor the road. Then, with the war, he had crept up to look over the topof the world, and now, unaccountably, in the midst of work he had lookedforward to with real pleasure, his whole body was tingling for newhorizons.It seemed to be so with a dozen of the boys he had come back with. Someof these were writing to him, wanting him to come here, to come there;to go on and on with them to inviting places they knew--and on againfrom there! Mining in South America, lumbering in the Northwest,ranching in the Southwest; one of his mates would be a sailor, and onewould be with a circus. Something within him beyond reason goaded him tobe up and off. He felt his hold slipping; his mind floated in an ecstasyof relaxation.His first days at the Home Farm had been good-enough days. SharonWhipple had told him a modern farmer must first be a mechanic, and hewas already that--and no one had shot at him. But the novelty ofapproaching good machine-gun cover without apprehension had worn off."Ain't getting cold feet, are you?" asked Sharon one day, observing himhang idly above an abused tractor with the far-off look in his eyes."Nothing like that," he had protested almost too warmly. "No, sir; I'llslog on right here."Now for the first time in all their years of association he saw animmense gulf between himself and Sharon Whipple. Sharon was an old man,turning to look back as he went down a narrow way into a hidden valley.But he--Wilbur Cowan--was climbing a long slope into new light. Howcould they touch? How could this old man hold him to become another oldman on the same soil--when he could be up and off, a happy world romperlike his father before him?"Funny, funny, funny!" he said aloud, and lazily rolled over to stareinto blue space.Probably it was quite as funny out there. The people like himself onthose other worlds would be the sport of confusing impulses, in the longrun obeying some deeper instinct whose source was in the parent stardust, wandering or taking root in their own strange soils. But why notwander when the object of it all was so obscure, so apparently trivial?Enough others would submit to rule from the hidden source, take rootlike the willow--mate! That was another chain upon them. Women held themback from wandering. That was how they were tricked into the deadly homefeeling his father warned him of."Funny, funny, funny!" he said again.From an inner pocket he drew a sheet of note paper worn almost throughat the fold, stained with the ooze of trenches and his own sweat. It hadcome deviously to him in the front line a month after his meeting withPatricia Whipple. In that time the strange verse had still run in hismind--a crown of stars, and under her feet the moon! The tumult offighting had seemed to fix it there. He had rested on the memory of herand become fearless of death. But the time had changed so tremendously.He could hardly recall the verse, hardly recall that he had faced deathor the strange girl."Wilbur, dear," he read, "I am still holding you. Are you me? What doyou guess? Do you guess we were a couple of homesick ninnies, tired andweak and too combustible? Or do you guess it meant something about usfinding each other out all in one second, like a flash of something? Doyou guess we were frazzled up to the limit and not braced to hold backor anything, the way civilized people do? I mean, will we be the sameback home? If we will be, how funny! We shall have to find out, shan'twe? But let's be sporty, and give the thing a chance to be true if itcan. That's fair enough, isn't it? What I mean, let's not shatter itsmorale by some poky chance meeting with a lot of people round, whom itis none of their business what you and I do or don't do. That would befierce, would it not? So much might depend."Anyway, here's what: The first night I am home--your intelligencedepartment must find out the day, because I'm not going to write to youagain if I never see you, I feel so unmaidenly--I shall be at our stileleading out to West Hill. You remember it--above the place where thosesplendid gypsies camped when we were such a funny little boy and girl.The first night as soon as I can sneak out from my proud family. Youcome there. We'll know!"       *       *       *       *       *"Funny, funny, funny--the whole game!" he said.He lost himself in a lazy wonder if it could be true. He didn't know.Once she had persisted terribly in his eyes; now she had faded. Herfigure before the broken church was blurred.Sharon Whipple found him the next afternoon teaching two new men the useand abuse of a tractor, and plainly bored by his task. Sharon seized themoment to talk pungently about the good old times when a farm handdidn't have to know how to disable a tractor, or anything much, andwould work fourteen hours a day for thirty dollars a month and his keep.He named the wage of the two pupils in a tone of disgruntled awe thatpiqued them pleasantly but did not otherwise impress. When they hadgone their expensive ways he turned to Wilbur."Did you get over to that dry-fork place to-day?""No; too busy here with these highbinders."He spoke wearily, above a ripening suspicion that he would not muchlonger be annoyed in this manner. A new letter had that morning comefrom the intending adventurer into South America."I'll bet you've had a time with this new help," said Sharon."I've put three men at work over on that clearing, though.""I'll get over there myself with you to-morrow; no, not tomorrow--nextday after. That girl of ours gets in to-morrow noon. Have to be there,of course.""Of course.""She trotted a smart mile over there. Everybody says so. Family tickledto death about her. Me, too, of course.""Of course.""Rattlepate, though.""Yes, sir," said Wilbur.When the old man had gone he looked out over the yellowing fields with afrank distaste for the level immensity. Suddenly there rang in his earsthe harsh singing of many men: "Where do we go from here, boys, where dowe go from here?" Old Sharon was rooted in the soil; dying there. But hewas still free. He could wire Leach Belding he was starting--and start.       *       *       *       *       *About eight o'clock the following night he parked the Can beside theridge road, and for the first time in his proud career of ownershipcursed its infirmities. It was competent, but no car for a tryst onemight not wish to advertise. When its clamour had been stilled he waitedsome moments, feeling that a startled countryside must rush to the spot.Yet no one came, so at last he went furtively through the thinned groveand about clumps of hazel brush, feeling his way, stepping softly,crouching low, until he could make out the stile where it broke thelines of the fence. The night was clear and the stile was cleanlyoutlined by starlight. Beyond the fence was a shadowed mass, first aclump of trees, the outbuildings of the Whipple New Place, the houseitself. There were lights at the back, and once voices came to him, thenthe thin shatter of glass on stone, followed by laughs from twodissonant throats. He stood under a tall pine, listening, but no othersound came. After a while he sat at the foot of the tree. Cricketschirped and a bat circled through the night. The scent of the pine fromits day-long baking was sharp in his nostrils. His back tired againstthe tree, and he eased himself to the cooled grass, face down, his handscrossed under his chin. He could look up now and see the stile againststars.He waited. He had expected to wait. The little night sounds thatcomposed the night's silence, his own stillness, his intent watching,put him back to nights when silence was ominous. Once he found he hadstopped breathing to listen to the breathing of the men on each side ofhim. He was waiting for the word, and felt for a rifle. He had to riseto shake off this oppression. On his feet he laughed softly, being againin Newbern on a fool's mission. He lay down hands under his chin, butagain the silent watching beset him with the old oppression. He must bestill and strain his eyes ahead. Presently the word would come, or hewould feel the touch of a groping foe. He half dozed at last from thememory of that other endless fatigue. He came to himself with a startand raised his head to scan the stile. The darkness had thickened butthe two posts at the ends of the fence were still outlined. He watchedand waited.After a long time the east began to lighten; a deepening glow rimmedWest Hill, picking out in silver the trees along its edge. If she meantto come she must come soon, he thought, but the rising moon distinctlyshowed the bare stile. She had written a long time ago. She wasnotoriously a rattlepate. Of course she would have forgotten. Then fora moment his straining eyes were puzzled. His gaze had not shifted evenfor an instant, yet the post at the left of the stile had unaccountablythickened. He considered it a trick of the advancing moonshine, andlooked more intently. It was motionless, like the other post, yet it hadthickened. Then he saw it was taller, but still it did not move. Itcould be no one. Mildly curious, he crept forward to make the post seemright in this confusing new glamour. But it broadened as he neared it,and still was taller than its neighbour, its lines not so sharp.He rose to his feet, with a dry laugh at his own credulity, taking someslow steps forward, expecting each stride to resolve the post to itstrue dimensions. He was within a dozen feet of it before he saw it couldnot be a post--anyway, not the same post. His scalp crept into minutewrinkles at the back of his head. He knew the feeling--fear! But, as inother times, he could not make his feet go back. Two other steps and hesaw she must be there. She had not stirred, but the rising light caughther wan face and a pale glint of eyes.All at once his fear was greater--greater than any he had known inbattle. His feet dragged protestingly, but he forced them on. He wantedher to speak or move to break that tension of fear. But not until hereached out stiffening fingers to touch her did she stir. Then she gavea little whispered cry and all at once it was no longer moonlight forhim, but full day. A girl in nurse's cap and a faded, much laundereddress of light blue stood before a battered church, beside a timberedbreach in its gray stone wall. He was holding her.The song was coming to him, harsh and full throated from many men:"Where do we go from here, boys, where do we go from here?""We don't go anywhere from here," he heard himself say in anger. Theywere the only words he had spoken.The girl was shaking as she had shaken back at that church; utteringlittle shapeless cries from a throat that by turns fluttered andtightened. One clenched hand was fiercely thumping his shoulder. Theywere on strange land, as if they had the crust of the moon itselfbeneath their feet. They seemed to know it had been true.       *       *       *       *       *They were sitting on a log in shadow. He rose and stepped into thelight, facing his watch to the moon, now gone so high it had paled fromgold to silver. He went to her again."Do you know it's nearly one?""It must be that--I suppose so.""Shouldn't you be going?"She leaned forward, shoulders drooping, a huddled bit of black in theloose cloak she wore. He waited. At length she drew her shoulders upwith a quick intake of breath. She held this a moment, her chin lifted."There, now I've decided," she said."What?""I'm not going back.""No?""Not going through any more fuss. I'm too tired. It seemed as if I'dnever get here, never get out of that dreadful place, never get out ofParis, never get out of Brest, never get off the boat, never get home!I'm too tired for any more never gets. I'm not going to have talking andplanning and arguments and tearful relatives forever and a day more. Seeif I do! I'm here, and I'm not going to break it again. I'm not goingback!"He reached down to pat her hand with a humouring air."Where will you go?""That's up to you.""But what can I----""I'm going where you go. I tell you I'm too tired to have any talk."He sat down beside her."Yes, you're a tired child," he told her.She detected the humoring inflection."None of that! I'm tired, but I'm stubborn. I'm not going back. I'msupposed to be sleeping soundly in my little bed. In the morning, beforeI'm supposed to be up, I'll issue a communique from--any old place; ortell 'em face to face. I won't mind that a little bit after everything'sover. It's telling what's going to be and listening to talk about itthat I won't have. I'm not up to it. Now you talk!""You're tired. Are you too tired to know your own mind?""No; just too tired to argue with it, fight it; and I'm free, white, andtwenty-one; and I've read about the self-determination of smallpeoples.""Say, aren't you afraid?""Don't be silly! Of course I'm afraid! What is that about perfect lovecasting out fear?--don't believe it! I'm scared to death--truly!""Go back till to-morrow.""I won't! I've gone over all that.""All right! Shove off!"He led her to the ambushed Can, whose blemishes became all too apparentin the merciless light of the moon."What a lot of wound chevrons it has!" she exclaimed."Well, I didn't expect anything like this. I could have got----""It looks like a permanent casualty. Will it go?""It goes for me. You're sure you don't think it's better to----""On your way!" she gayly ordered, but her voice caught, and she clung tohim a moment before entering the car. "No; I'm not weakening--don't youthink it! But let me rest a second."She was in the car, again wearily gay. The Can hideously broke thequiet."Home, James!" she commanded.       *       *       *       *       *Dawn found the car at rest on the verge of a hill with a wide-sweepingview over and beyond the county seat of Newbern County. Patricia sleptwithin the fold of his arm. At least half of the slow forty miles shehad slept against his shoulder in spite of the car's resoundingprogress over a country road. Once in the darkness she had wakened longenough to tell him not to go away.The rising sun lighted the town of Halton below them, and sent levelrays across a wide expanse of farmland beyond it, flat meadows androlling upland. White mist shrouded the winding trail of a creek. It wasthe kind of landscape he had viewed yesterday with a rising distaste;land that had tricked people from their right to wander; to go places ona train when they would.He brought his eyes back from the treacherous vista and turned them downto the face of the sleeping girl. A pale scarf was wound about her head,and he could see but little beyond it but the tip of her nose, a fewscattered, minute freckles on one cheek. She was limp, one bare handfalling inertly over the edge of the seat between them. He looked outagain at the checkerboard of farms. He, too, had been tricked."But what a fine trick!" he said aloud. "No wonder it works!"He dozed himself presently, nodding till his forward-pitching head wouldwaken him. Afterward he heard Spike saying: "So dark you can't see yourhand before your face." He came awake. His head was on Patricia'sshoulder, her arm supporting him."You must have gone to sleep and let the car stop," she told him. Hestared sleepily, believing it. "But I want my breakfast," she remindedhim. He sat up, winking the sleep from his eyes, shaking it from hishead."Of course," he said.He looked again out over the land to which an old device had inveigledhim. A breeze had come with the dawn, stirring the grain fields intolong ripples. At the roadside was the tossing silver of birch leaves."This is one whale of a day for us two, isn't it?" he demanded."You said it!" she told him."Breakfast and a license and--""You know it!" she declared."Still afraid?""More than ever! It's a wonder and a wild desire, but it scares mestiff--you're so strange.""You know, it isn't too late."She began to thump him with a clenched fist up between his shoulders."Carry on!" she ordered. "There isn't a slacker in the whole car!"       *       *       *       *       *A few hours later, in the dining room of the Whipple New Place, Gideon,Harvey D., and Merle Whipple were breakfasting. To them entered SharonWhipple from his earlier breakfast, ruddy, fresh-shaven, bubbling."On my way to the Home Farm," he explained, "but I had to drop in for alook at the girl by daylight. She seemed too peaked last night.""Pat's still sleeping," said her father over his egg cup."That's good! I guess a rest was all she needed. Beats all, girlsnowadays seem to be made of wire rope. You take that one--"A telephone bell rang in the hall beyond, and Merle Whipple went to it."Hello, hello! Whipple New Place--Merle Whipple speaking." He listened,standing in the doorway to turn a puzzled face to the group about thetable. "Hello! Who--who?" His bewilderment was apparent. "But it's Pattalking," he said, "over long distance.""Calling from her room upstairs to fool you," warned Sharon. "Don't Iknow her flummididdles?"But the look of bewilderment on Merle's face had become a look of purefright. He raised a hand sternly to Sharon."Once more," he called, hoarsely, and again listened with widening eyes.He lifted his face to the group, the receiver still at his ear. "Shesays--good heaven! She says, 'I've gone A.W.O.L., and now I'm safe andmarried--I'm married to Wilbur Cowan.'" He uttered his brother's namein the tone of a shocked true Whipple."Good heaven!" echoed Harvey D."I'm blest!" said Gideon."I snum to goodness!" said the dazed Sharon. "The darned skeesicks!"Merle still listened. Again he raised a now potent hand."She says she doesn't know how she came to do it, except that he put acomether on her."He hung up the receiver and fell into a chair before the table that heldthe telephone."Scissors and white aprons!" said Sharon. "Of all things you wouldn'texpect!"Merle stood before the group with a tragic face."It's hard, Father, but she says it's done. I suppose--I suppose we'llhave to make the best of it."Hereupon Sharon Whipple's eyes began to blink rapidly, his jaw dropped,and he slid forward in his chair to writhe in a spasm of what might beweirdly silent laughter. His face was purple, convulsed, but no soundcame from his moving lips. The others regarded him with alarm."Not a stroke?" cried Harvey D., and ran to his side. As he sought toloosen Sharon's collar the old man waved him off and became happilyvocal."Oh, oh!" he gasped. "That Merle boy has brightened my whole day!"Merle frowned."Perhaps you may see something to laugh at," he said, icily.Sharon controlled his seizure. Pointing his eyebrows severely, he cockeda presumably loaded thumb at Merle."Let me tell you, young man, the best this family can make of thatmarriage will be a darned good best. Could you think of a betterbest--say, now?" Merle turned impatiently from the mocker."Blest if I can--on the spur of the moment!" said Gideon.Harvey D. looked almost sharply at the exigent Merle."Pat's twenty-five and knows her own mind better than we do," he said."I never knew it at all!" said Gideon."It's almost a distinct relief," resumed Harvey D. "As I think of it Ilike it." He went to straighten the painting of an opened watermelonbeside a copper kettle, that hung above the sideboard. "He's a fineyoung chap." He looked again at Merle, fixing knife and fork in a justeralignment on his plate. "I dare say we needed him in the family."       *       *       *       *       *Late the following afternoon Sharon triumphantly brought his car to astop before the gateway leading up to the red farmhouse. The front doorproving unresponsive, he puffed about to the rear. He found a perturbedPatricia Cowan, in cap and apron, tidying the big kitchen. Her hegreeted rapturously."This kitchen--" began the new mistress."So he put a comether on you!""Absolutely--when I wasn't looking!""Put one on me, too," said Sharon; "years ago.""This kitchen," began Patricia again, "is an unsanitary outrage. Itneeds a thousand things done to it. We'd never have put up with this inthe Army. That sink there"--she pointed it out--"must have something ofa carbolic nature straight off.""I know, I know!" Sharon was placating. "I'm going to put everythingright for you.""New paint for all the woodwork--white.""Sure thing--as white as you want it.""And blue velours curtains for the big room. I always dreamed I'd have ahouse with blue velours curtains.""Sure, sure! Anything you want you order.""And that fireplace in the big room--I burned some trash there thismorning, and it simply won't inhale.""Never did," said Sharon. "We'll run the chimney up higher. Anythingelse?""Oh, lots! I've a long list somewhere.""I bet you have! But it's a good old house; don't build 'em like thisany more; not a nail in it; sound as a nut. Say, miss, did you knowthere was high old times in this house about seventy-three years ago?Fact! They thought I wasn't going to pull through. I was over two daysold before it looked like I'd come round. Say, I learned to walk out inthat side yard. That reminds me--" Sharon hesitated in mildembarrassment--"there's a place between them two wings--make a bullyplace for a sun room; spoil the architecture, mebbe, but who cares? Sunroom--big place to play round in--play room, or anything like that."Patricia had been searching among a stack of newspapers, but she hadcaught "sun room.""Stunning!" she said. "We need another big place right now, or when mythings get here."Sharon coughed."Need it more later, I guess."But Patricia had found her paper."Oh, here's something I put aside to ask you about! I want you tounderstand I'm going to be all the help I can here. This advertisementsays 'Raise Belgian hares,' because meat is so high. Do you know--dopeople really make millions at it, and could I do the work?"Sharon was shaking his head."You could if you didn't have something else to do. And I suppose theysell for money, though I never did hear tell of a Belgian-haremillionaire. Heard of all other kinds, but not him. But you look here,young woman, I hope there'll be other things not sold by the poundthat'll keep you from rabbit raising. This family's depending a lot onyou. Didn't you hear my speech about that fine sun room?""Will you please not bother me at a time like this?" scolded Patricia."Now out with you--he's outside somewhere! And can't you ever in theworld for five minutes get mere Whipples out of your mind?" She activelywaved him on from the open door.Sharon passed through a grape arbour, turning beyond it to study thesite of the sun room. All in a moment he built and peopled it. How hehoped they would be coming along to play in there; at least three beforehe was too old to play with them. He saw them now; saw them, moreover,upon the flimsiest of promises, all superbly gifted with the Whipplenose. Then he went hopefully off toward the stables. He came upon WilburCowan inspecting a new reaper under one of the sheds. This time the oldman feigned no pounding of the boy's back--made no pretense that he didnot hug him."I'm so glad, so glad, so almighty glad!" he said as they stood apart.He did not speak with his wonted exuberance, saying the words veryquietly. But Sharon had not to be noisy to sound sincere."Thanks," said Wilbur. "Of course I couldn't be sure how her peoplewould----""Stuff!" said Sharon. "All tickled to death but one near-Whipple andhe's only annoyed. But you've been my boy--in my fool mind I always hadyou for my boy, when you was little and when you went to war. You couldof known that, and that was enough for you to know. Of course I neverdid think of you and Pat. That was too gosh-all perfect. Of course Icalled her a rattlepate, but she was my girl as much as you was my boy."The old eyes shone mistily upon Wilbur, then roved to the site of hisdream before he continued."Me? I'm getting on--and on. Right fast, too. But you--you and that finegirl--why, you two are a new morning in a new world, so fresh and youngand proud of each other, the way you are!" He hesitated, his eyes comingback. "Only thing I hope for now--before I get bedfast orsomething--say, take a look at the space between them south wings--standover this way a mite." Sharon now built there, with the warmestimplications, a perfect sun room. "That'll be one grand place," heaffirmed of his work when all was done."Yes, it sounds good," replied Wilbur."Oh, a grand place, big as outdoors, getting any sun there is--greatfor winter, great for rainy days!" Wistfully he searched the other'sface. "You know, Buck, a grand place to--play in, or anything likethat.""Yes, sir," said Wilbur.THE ENDEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Wrong Twin, by Harry Leon Wilson*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WRONG TWIN ******** This file should be named 11625.txt or 11625.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/1/6/2/11625/Produced by Suzanne Shell and PG Distributed ProofreadersUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year. For example:     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer partof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which isidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of singledigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.

E. DOUBLEDAY.LONDON:SIMPKIN, MARSHALL, HAMILTON, KENT AND CO., LIMITED.BUXTON AND BAKEWELL:U.F. WARDLEY, "HIGH PEAK NEWS" OFFICES.PREFACEThe real romance of Haddon Hall is a sweet, old-world idyll ofsingular attractiveness and interest. The gems of the story have beenreset by dramatists in different surroundings; but while, as in theSullivan-Grundy opera, many of its chief incidents have been retained,many have been omitted.In the old story there are no Puritans, and not one solitary Scotchmanappears upon the scene. The original drama was enacted in the pastoraldays of "Good Queen Bess," when the Tudor Queen was still young andbeautiful, and  "When all the world was young, lad,    And all the trees were green;  And every goose a swan, lad,    And every lass a queen."Haddon Hall, the scene of the story, is situated at the foot of thePeak, between Bakewell and Chatsworth, close to Matlock, and not farfrom Buxton. Far from the madding crowd the hoary old edifice stands,carefully preserved, and generously thrown open to public view by itsprincely owners, the Dukes of Rutland, who, though for more than acentury back they have ceased to inhabit it, have yet most carefullyprotected the building from falling into the slightest disrepair.In our own day, the Hall stands very much as it did in the heyday ofits glory, when the sisters Margaret and Dorothy received the homageof their numerous admirers, or the "King of the Peak" himself passedto and fro within its walls. But it is more beautiful now than it wasthen, for now it is tinged with a beauty which age alone can bestow,and mellowed with a charm that none of the Vernons ever knew.And of this charm Dorothy Vernon herself is assuredly the centralfigure. For three centuries her romantic career has been a favouritetheme with minstrel, poet, and painter; and during all this time--likethe ivy which grows and clusters around the walls and nooks andcrannies of what, generations ago, were the abiding-places of kingsor nobles, scenes of splendour and animation--so, during the lapse oftime, there has grown a beautiful and romantic web of legendary lorewhich clings tenaciously to every wall, window, and stone of the oldHall, until every room and every corner of old Haddon seems to tellthe story of the beautiful maiden who, once upon a time, fell in lovewith a certain plain John Manners, whom she was determined to wed, inspite of all the obstacles that were placed in her way.The story telling how she accomplished this has been told in manyvarying forms, but in the following pages the writer has sought toincorporate the essence of nearly all the legends, concerning not onlyDorothy, but also of Sir George Vernon. A considerable amount of freshmatter has been introduced, and, without unduly intruding the dryfacts of history, a few of the great events and persons of the timehave been pressed into service; whilst at the same time, some of theold English customs of the days of "Good Queen Bess" have been made toserve the purpose of the narrative.W.E.D.CONTENTS.

There is a spirit brooding o'er these walls  That tells the record of a bygone day,  When 'mid the splendour of these courtly halls,  A pageant shone, whose gorgeous array  Like pleasure's dream has passed away.  ANON.  Where both deliberate the love is slight;  Who ever loved that love not at first sight?  MARLOWE.Amid the hills of Derbyshire which cluster around the Peak thererises, in a lovely dale slyly peeping out from behind the surroundingtrees, the fine old pile of Haddon Hall.Perhaps the old shire of Derby, with its many rich examples, canpresent to view nothing equal in historic and legendary interest tothis old mansion. Its turrets and towers, its windows and itswalls, its capacious kitchens, and its fine halls and banquetingrooms--unspoiled by the hands of the "restorer"--have gained forit the almost unchallenged position of being the finest baronialresidence which still exists.There stand the grey old walls whose battlements have proudly biddendefiance to the storms and blasts of half a thousand winters, andthere still stand the gnarled old trees which have gently swayed toand fro while many a baron has ruled the Hall, and whose leaves aftergrowing in superlative beauty, seeming to partake in the grandeur andpride of the "King of the Peak," have drooped and fallen, after havingmade, with their rich autumnal tints, a succession of beautiful livingpictures which have delighted the lords and ladies of Haddon foralmost twenty generations.When William the Conqueror had invaded England and had succeeded inseating himself upon his somewhat insecure throne, he began to rewardhis followers with liberal grants of the land he had won. Among thesefortunate individuals was one, William Peveril, said to be a son ofthe Conqueror, and to him, in common with many other estates in andaround Derbyshire, was given the manor of Haddon. Part of the fabricwhich was then erected is still standing, and it is surmised by somethat traces are still left of a previous Saxon erection. In the year1154, the estate was forfeited to the Crown, and it was granted byKing Henry II. to the Avenals, from which family, two hundred yearslater, it was transferred by marriage to the Vernons.Its fate has been strangely wrapped up in the history of its women,for as it passed from the Avenals to the Vernons by marriage, soagain, three centuries later, by a similar process, it passed from theVernon family to the Rutland, which ever since has retained it in itspossession.Everything around, both inside and out, is fragrant with interest.Everything seems to breathe out the spirit of departed ages. It is onevast relic of "Merrie England's" bygone splendour.It was the old original "Palace of the Peak," nor was it unworthy ofthe name. The glory of many royal palaces of its time indeed mightwell have paled beside its splendour, and as a matter of fact thebaron of Haddon was a king within his own domain, who wielded apower which few around dared to question, and fewer still resist. Itshospitality was lavish, as the poor of a neighbourhood of no smallradius knew full well; and the vastness and riches of the propertywhich accompanied the ownership of Haddon was enough to maintain itslord in an almost regal state.What happy scenes have taken place within its walls! How many fairladies have stepped off the riding stone outside its gate, helped bythe gallant but superfluous aid of chivalrous knights, each strivingto outdo the others by gentle acts of courtesy! What brilliantcavalcades have issued from its portals! How many merry huntingparties have started from its iron-studded gate; and what jovialmonster feasts have taken place within its rooms. If walls couldspeak, what a tale would Haddon have to tell.The spring of the year of grace 1567 had just commenced, and the treeswere beginning to adorn themselves once again in their green array,when the Knight of Haddon, Sir George Vernon, led out a merry companyfor the first hawking expedition of the year. The winter had beenunusually long, and more than extraordinarily severe; and whilst theknight and his sturdy friends had been enabled to pursue their sportby submitting to a more than usual amount of inconvenience, yet theladies had been almost entirely confined within the limits of theHall. Winter at Haddon was by no means a dreary imprisonment, forfetes and balls were continually taking place, and however rough theweather might be, and the condition of the miserable tracts which inthose days did duty for roads, there were not a few cavaliers, bothold and young, who would gladly adventure the discomforts of a journeyto Haddon, even were it to be only rewarded by a smile, or perchancea dance with the two daughters of the host, whose beauty, though ofdifferent types, many were ready to swear, and to maintain it, ifneed be, at the point of the sword, could not be surpassed in all thecounties of the land.Indeed, the beauty of Margaret and Dorothy was almost as famous asthe reputation of the "King of the Peak" himself, and the old knight,owner as he was of immense wealth, was often heard to assert that histwo daughters were the greatest treasures he possessed.Many eyes were cast upon these two fair maidens, and many hearts werelaid at their feet. Margaret, the elder, was already being wooed bySir Thomas Stanley, and some gossips even went so far as to saythat she had already plighted her troth to him. The younger sister,however, had kept her heart intact, and in spite of the persuasions ofSir George and the threats of Lady Maude, had refused to comply withtheir request to accept Sir Henry de la Zouch as her betrothed.Although by no means dreary, yet the continual round of winter feastshad at last begun to assume an aspect of staleness, and lords andladies alike had for some time past been eagerly anticipating the timewhen they might once more pursue their noble sports. As the winterhad gradually withdrawn its ice and snow, and occasional gleams ofsunshine appeared, hearalding the advent of spring, the excitement hadincreased. Dancing was discarded, the tapestry work was laid aside,and all with one mind began to make preparations for the comingexcursions.And now the long wished for day had come. The number of guests at theHall had been largely augmented by fresh arrivals, and as the jovialbaron looked round the table at the feast of the previous evening, hedeclared that a better company could not be found in all the land.The scene as they started out was animated in the extreme. The ladies,in their many-coloured dresses, riding on horseback, were gracefullycoquetting with the knights and squires who surrounded them anddutifully paid their court to them with all the reverence of afast-departing chivalry.The chase was to be on foot, and in the rear followed a number ofpages, each leading his dogs and carrying his own as well as hismaster's jumping pole. Everything promised well. The turf had driedafter the recent floods, with a pleasing elasticity. The sun shonebrilliantly upon the gold-trimmed jerkins of the hawks, and the hum ofconversation, with its occasional outburst of merry ringing laughter,added to the tinkling of the sonorous little falcon bells, or the barkof the dogs every now and again as they ineffectually tried to breakaway from the leashes in which they were held, all tended to put theparty in the best of spirits.Dorothy Vernon, as usual, was surrounded by a circle of admirers,each of whom was anxious to bring himself under her especial notice byanticipating her wishes, or quickly fulfilling her slightest commands.Sir Henry de la Zouch was there, as a matter of course. He was mostassiduous in his attentions, and although it was plainly visible thathis presence was as little appreciated as his suit, yet he still keptby her side."Methinks, fair demoiselle," he began, "thou art hardly so sprightlythis morning as the occasion might warrant. Now, Mistress Margaret,there--""Aye, Margaret again, Sir Henry," interrupted the maiden; "thou artfor ever placing me beside my sister Margaret. He bears too hardlyupon a simple maiden, does he not, Sir John?"Sir John de Lacey, a little fidgety old man on the wrong side ofsixty, nervously played with his collar, and, delighted at theopportunity thus afforded him of paying back a grudge of longstanding, he summoned to his aid all the dignity he was capable ofassuming, and declared that the whole of Sir Henry's conduct wasungallant to the last degree.De la Zouch darted a look of intense wrath at the old man, but as thelatter was yet rearranging his collar, the effort was lost."Nay, nay, sweet Dorothy," he said, "I meant to say naught that wouldvex thee, for I would have thee smile upon me and not frown; and if mywords have not been pleasing to thee in the past, I am sorry for it,and will endeavour to amend my ways in the future.""Where do we go to-day?" asked Dorothy, not noticing his last remark."We are full late for the woodcock, and the partridges are not yetready.""There are plenty of sparrows on the wing," exclaimed Sir Benedict aWoode, who had been anxiously awaiting an opportunity to join in theconversation."Aha! Sir Benedict," she replied. "Methought thou wert too unwell tojoin us to-day, but thou hast weathered the attack, I see.""Now, could I stay away, fair cousin, when I knew thou wert among themerry company?" gallantly responded the knight."'Twas but the wine got into his head, Dorothy," insinuated Sir Henry.Dorothy, according to the fashion of the time, was carrying a hawk,one which she herself had trained, upon her wrist, which was protectedfrom the beak and talons of the bird by a large thick glove. Shelooked upon the noble bird, and felt proud of her treasure."St. George," she said, "would scorn a sparrow, though, or else,I fear, most noble Benedict, he shares not in the pride of hismistress."St. George cocked his head on one side, as if to receive thecompliment in a most befitting manner, and catching sight of a handupon the saddle, it rapidly dipped down its head and made a viciouspeck at the intruding fingers.It was the hand of De la Zouch, and he withdrew with an ejaculation ofanger."There, Mistress Dorothy," he exclaimed, "did I not say the bird wasbut imperfectly taught, and now see here;" and he ruefully pointed tothe bleeding finger.Dorothy was so overcome by the tragic attitude Sir Henry assumed,that instead of offering him her sympathy, she burst out into anuncontrollable fit of laughter, in which the rest of the companyjoined; and, burning with indignation, the unlucky knight hastenedaway to join the group around the elder sister.Having fallen behind, Dorothy and her companions had now to hurryforward, for they learned by the blowing of the horns and signals ofSir George Vernon that they were now close upon the scene of the day'ssport."Come, Doll," shouted the baron, "we are waiting for you; we are readyto begin, and there are some strangers with whom I must acquaint you."They soon joined company, and Master John Manners, together with hisfriend, Sir Everard Crowleigh, had soon passed through the pleasantformality of an introduction to one of the prettiest and wealthiestheiresses in England.John Manners, who plays a prominent part in this veracious narrative,was the nephew of the Earl of Rutland. As he reverently kissed thedainty hand which Dorothy held out to him he was so smitten with thecharm of her beauty that Cupid led him, an unresisting captive, toyield his heart to the keeping of the maid. He was deeply smitten,nor was Dorothy herself insensible to the more masculine beauty of thescion of the house of Rutland, for as his dark, flashing eyes met herown, in spite of herself, she felt the power of a strange attractionwhich drew her towards him. The sprightly god of love had already donehis work, and, although perhaps neither of them was aware of the fact,they were each being bound by his chains.It was a case of love at first sight.CHAPTER II.A JEALOUS HEART AND CRAFTY.  He that sows in craft does reap in jealousy.  MIDDLETON.  Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand;  Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.  SHAKESPEARE.The scene of the pastime had been reached, and the preparations forthe hawking had already begun. The falconers brought up their birds,the pages gave up their masters' jumping poles, and the dogs weresniffing the air, eager for the chase to commence.At last the jerkins were taken off, and the straps which had held thehawks were unloosed; the dogs were sent to the front, and the realwork of the day began.Sir George was in capital humour, and closely followed by Sir Benedicta Woode and the others, he led off at a rare pace, with the ladiesfollowing upon their steeds a little distance in the rear, and, behindall, a number of admiring rustics, eager to see a little of the sportin which it was not their lot to participate.Sparrows were plentiful, but no other kind of bird was to be seen, andSir Benedict was just thinking that Sir George would have to humblehimself, when the dogs began to bark."Quails, as I'm alive! See!" shouted the baron, in high delight."And a whole bevy of them, too," added De la Zouch, turning round tothe ladies.The excitement, which had simmered before, now suddenly becameintense, and away went lord and lady, knight and esquire, over walland ditch, in their eagerness to keep up with the hunt.Dorothy had not flown her bird, for she had noticed that MasterManners was without a hawk, and now she sent it forward to him by herpage, and waited with a beating heart to learn whether her offer hadbeen accepted.Manners himself came back and thanked her."But marry, fair Mistress Vernon," said he, "I could no more rob youof your bird than I could steal away your beauty or take possession ofyour heart.""Nay, now," replied Dorothy, not paying the proper amount of regard tothe truth, "I am already for-wearied of the hawking; and it were moreto my taste to follow on in a more leisurely fashion," she added,seeing that he was about to refuse. "St. George is a good bird, and isanxious to try a flight; and thou art a stranger, too; thou must takeit," and she placed the merlin on his wrist.Manners had never felt more embarrassed in the course of his life,and, ready-witted though he was, he found himself at a loss how toreply. Before he had collected his scattered senses, Dorothy hadgone, and he, left alone, was a long way in the rear. The horns of thehunters, which were continually sounding, proved a sufficient guide,and being nimble of foot, he started off in great haste to rejoin theparty, which was now well out of sight.All this had not escaped the jealous eyes of De la Zouch, for,securely hidden within the friendly foliage of a patch of brushwood,he had seen and heard all, and, with perceptions sharpened by thejealous spirit which raged within his breast, he had at once divinedthe secret which neither of the two, as yet, understood.As Manners departed, he emerged from his hiding-place, gnashing histeeth with rage. His anger was terrible to behold."So, so!" he exclaimed, as he watched the retreating figure, "ithas come to this, then, that I am to yield my share of the riches ofHaddon to this usurping churl. But no; it shall never, never be! JohnManners shall lie in six feet of solid earth ere I forego the prize!"Had he been more careful, Sir Henry would have discovered that he wasnot alone. Had he been less rash, whatever he might have thought, hewould have kept his opinions to himself; for hardly had he spoken,when a rough voice at his elbow awakened him from the reverie intowhich he had fallen."Such words, noble sir, are costly, and I ween thou hadst rather nothave them repeated to the King of the Peak."De la Zouch turned sharply round and fiercely confronted thewell-known figure of the Derby packman."Thou art over bold for a knave," he exclaimed; "get thee gone.""Not till I am the richer, or I will hie me to Sir George, and tell mytale to him," was the cool reply."Villain!" hissed Sir Henry, "begone!" and obeying the impulse of themoment, he dealt the pedlar a blow which felled him to the ground."There will be a few more nobles for that," groaned the man as heslowly regained his feet.De la Zouch glanced contemptuously at him and turned to depart, but hewas not to go so easily."Nay, forsooth," cried the pedlar, clapping his hands upon theshoulders of the nobleman. "And thou wilt forget thy debts it behovesme to insist."With a curse the latter turned round again, but seeing the determinedaspect of the man, he pulled out three golden nobles and offered themto him.The packman laughed."What!" he exclaimed. "I must have more than that for my bruisesalone.""Thou art insolent; that is all I shall give thee; take it or leave itand get thee gone. Thy word would never weigh against mine.""Well, master," returned the other, "it is a case of life or death,and you value your life at three sorry nobles? I would take thatrather than the money, for Manners is a friend to the poor," andgrasping his thick stick with both his hands he struck at De la Zouchwith all his might.The blow was parried by Sir Henry, who received it upon his jumpingpole, and with blood now thoroughly aroused and life on either side tofight for, the conflict was furiously sustained.The packman's attack was at no time equal to the defence of hisadversary, and as he rained down blow after blow they were coollycaught upon the pole, which, used in skilful hands in much the samefashion as the quarter-staff, made quite an admirable weapon both forattack and defence.Such an unequal contest could not long continue. Science must evertriumph over mere brute force, and this occasion proved to be noexception to the rule, and as the man tired, his blows perceptiblyweakened. Had Sir Henry by any piece of misfortune failed to protecthimself, the end might have been different. His skill, however, savedhim in the end, and as the fury of his opponent abated the knightbecame more vigorous in his attack.The end soon came, for, raising his stout ash pole high up in theair, De la Zouch brought it down with, tremendous force, and easilybreaking through the pedlar's guard, it alighted heavily upon hishead. With a groan the unlucky man staggered back and fell upon theturf. The blow had struck home, and the Derby packman was no more.Whilst this scene was being enacted, Sir Henry's page, missing hismaster from amongst the hawking party, had turned back in greattrepidation to seek him. Guided by the sound of the blows, the youthhad experienced little difficulty in attaining the object of hissearch, and, standing at a respectable distance, he had been a silentwitness of the tragic conclusion of the encounter. Seeing that all wasover, he slowly advanced, in a very uncertain state of mind as to thecharacter of his reception.De la Zouch was too busily engaged in a scrutiny of his late opponentto notice the arrival of his page, and upon the latter devolved theunpleasant duty of announcing himself."That was a featly stroke, my lord," he began.Sir Henry turned round, and a sigh of relief escaped him as he foundit was not a fresh combatant with whom he would have to contend."Ha, Eustace," he said, "There are many who would like to learn thetrick of it; 'tis known to few besides myself, but I will teach itthee some future time."Eustace, too, gave a sigh of relief. His master was unusuallygracious.When Sir Henry spoke again, his voice was changed."Hast thou seen all?" he asked."I saw the end of it.""But the commencement?""No! I was--""Ah, well," interrupted the knight, "'twas not my fault; I would fainhave had thee witness its commencement, for, by my troth, the knavebrought his fate upon himself."He rolled the corpse over and they turned to go, but ere they hadproceeded many yards they came to a halt. De la Zouch had an idea, andthey wheeled about and returned to the body once more."Empty the jerkin," said Sir Henry, as he pointed to the man's jacket.Eustace shuddered, but the command was given in so peremptory a tonethat there was no option but to comply. He stooped down and emptiedthe capacious pockets of the dead man's jerkin, wondering thewhile-time whether or no his master had suddenly turned robber."There is little enough to take," said he."Tut, I want none of it," replied the knight, and picking up theassortment, which consisted of a huge jack-knife, a pair of spectacleswith monstrously wide rims, some bootlaces, a broken comb, and a fewcoins, he carefully scattered them about the scene where the strugglehad taken place. He was not yet satisfied, though, for espying thehollow trunk of an old tree close by, he made the unwilling page helphim to deposit the body there.Eustace wonderingly helped him. He would much preferred to have leftit alone, but he dared offer no resistance. He could only hope thatif the matter were heard of again, he might not be implicated in theplot.De la Zouch critically surveyed the scene, and after lightly coveringthe body over with grass and twigs, he turned to depart.They walked on in silence for some distance before either of themspoke: the knight deeply wrapped in thought; the page eager and yetfearful to learn the particulars, yet not daring to question hismaster.At last Sir Henry spoke."Mind you, Eustace," said he, "say naught of this affair. I would nothave my name mixed up with it, and if they ask thee, say thou knowestnaught."Eustace felt mightily relieved, and readily gave the required promise.He was used to these little deceptions which his master was wont touse on pressing occasions."And see," continued the knight, after a pause, "I am hurt, foralthough I have come off victor without a scratch, I have not come outof the tussle without a bruise or two. I shall tell them I have had afall. You understand!"The page acquiesced, the conversation ceased, and the two walked on insilence to rejoin their companions.CHAPTER III.THE CLOSE OF THE DAY.  See how the wily rascal plays his part.  With many a groan and many a practised art.  Around his victims he the net entwines,  Nor rests till he is snared within its lines.  But sure such hurtsome craft and wicked toil,  Will eftsoon on the villain's head recoil.In the meantime the chase had grown in excitement. The hawks were aseager to distinguish themselves as the birds were to escape, and thesport waxed fast and furious.As the sun declined, the scattered hawkers struggled back to theappointed rendezvous to partake of refreshment ere they began theirreturn journey. By ones and twos they came, bearing with them thetrophies of their sport, which they deposited in a heap before theladies.No one missed De la Zouch at first, and it was not until nigh upon theconclusion of the meal that his absence was remarked."Why, where is Sir Henry de la Zouch?" asked the old knight.No one had seen him for some time."Ah, well," exclaimed Sir George, "'tis a bad plan to be betwixt townsat mealtimes, eh, Doll? I suppose he'll come soon, though. Perhapshe's having the best run of the day all alone;" and the knight sighedat the bare thought of his being away from it.But Sir George's anticipations were not fulfilled, for when the mealwas finished De la Zouch had not appeared."He may have met with an accident?" suggested Manners."I rather think Sir Henry is afraid of me," stammered old Sir John deLacey, as he buried his face in the last tankard of ale."Then he were wise indeed to stay away," added Sir Thomas Stanley,with a sly wink. "I, for one, would not lightly risk a combat with sodoughty a knight as yourself, else Margaret might eftsoon weep for alover departed."As there was still some time left, and there was no certain knowledgethat Sir Henry needed their assistance, it was determined to returnslowly homewards, and if sport offered itself upon the way to turnaside and follow it. The party had not been long in motion before itroused a "fall" of woodcocks, the very sight of which--so excessivelyrare at such a time--infused into the sportsmen all the animationof which they were capable. The hawks shot up after them, and theirbells, which could be heard tinkling even when the birds were beyondthe range of vision, served in some degree to inform the hunters whichdirection they should take."Well, if De la Zouch is doing better than this, why then he iswelcome to it," said Sir George, as with his coat sleeve he wiped awaythe perspiration which was streaming down his face. "'Tis fine sport,this, Master Manners," he added, and the old baron chuckled with glee.It was at this moment that the head falconer approached."We have found Sir Henry, my lord," he said. "He is sorely injured bya fall.""Ha! is that so? Then you were right, Master Manners," exclaimed SirGeorge, as he turned round to the falconer. "Where is he?" he asked."Over the ditch, my lord, close by the wall where his page is standingby his side," and he pointed to where Eustace stood.Sir George blew his horn, and in answer to the signal the eagerhunters broke off their chase and returned, puzzled in no small degreeby the summons they had received. In a few brief words the situationwas explained to them, and the party rapidly pushed on to rejoin theirinjured companion.De Lacey, upon hearing that his quondam friend was hurt, was soovercome by a most chivalric spirit of forgiveness that he determinedto be the first to reach his side, and to offer him what relief laywithin his power. Filled with this noble resolve, he hurried forward,but, unfortunately for him, he was not destined to accomplish hismission, for as he was crossing the ditch his pole snapped asunder,and he suddenly found himself located in the very centre of the rankmud dyke. There he was, and all his efforts to free himself caused himonly to sink deeper and deeper."O, Blessed Mary, save me; save me!" he yelled out in an agonyof anguish as he felt himself slowly but surely sinking; but not,apparently, feeling very much assured about the answer to his prayer,he turned from things spiritual to things visible and mortal."Help me; save me, George," he cried.Sir George Vernon was too much overcome by the ludicrous aspect ofthe affair to lend any assistance just then, for he well knew that twofeet, if not less than that, was the excess of its depth."Let him alone," he cried. "If he had not so befuddled his head withale he would remember as well as I do that twenty inches would reachthe bottom of the mud."Had Lady Maude been there she would in all probability have senther lord and master to aid the poor unfortunate, but she was safeat Haddon, and, rejoicing in his freedom from restraint, he laughedlouder and louder as he watched the frantic efforts of his friend."Don't let me die," pleaded poor De Lacey. "Don't let me die like adog. Oh, dear, I'm going, I'm going! Blessed Virgin, help me; saveme!" and the old man made a last great struggle to free himself.Manners could bear it no longer. He clearly perceived that whatwas fun to them was mortal terror to the pitiable object of theirmerriment, and, advancing to the edge of the dyke, he held out hispole at arm's length to render him what assistance he could."Here, take hold of it," he cried.Sir John endeavoured to obey the injunction, but he could not eventouch it, and he sank back again in despair."Why, man," laughed Sir George, "as I'm a Vernon, you know as well asI do that thou canst never sink deep in two feet of mud."The words roused De Lacey to struggle to his feet and attempt toextricate himself. He staggered forward and advanced a foot ortwo, but the slimy mud had such a determined hold of him that heoverbalanced himself, and fell forward at full length into the ditch.This time, however, he was closer to the bank, and making anothereffort, he grasped the pole which was still held out to help him.Manners leaned forward, and pulled with all his might, but for sometime it was an open question whether he would go in or Sir John comeout.At this critical juncture Dorothy arrived upon the scene of thedisaster. The sight of the old man's distress at once appealed to herwomanly nature, and she had but to murmur a word of pity, when, in amoment, half-a-dozen knights leapt over to fulfil her unspoken wish.With this accession of strength the captive was easily freed, and aqueer figure he was. It would have been difficult for a stranger tohave determined exactly what he was; for, covered as he was to thedepth of several inches with black mud, he looked more like an animalof prehistoric times--such as we see represented by fossils--than anyhuman being.De Lacey was promptly rolled upon the turf, and the pages set to workand endeavoured to reach his person by scraping away the adhesiveslime with the aid of sticks and stones."Get up, man, get up," exclaimed Sir George. "Here is Doll waiting tohonour thee with a dance."Dorothy shrank back, while Sir John, utterly exhausted, sank backagain helplessly upon the ground. Seeing that he was totally unableto walk of his own accord, and in too dirty a condition to leanupon anyone's arm, a rough extempore litter was made, upon which theunfortunate knight was set and carried away, loudly lamenting theunkindness of the fate which had brought him to such a sorry plight."And now let us see what we can do for De la Zouch," said Sir GeorgeVernon, and they proceeded to the spot where the injured knight waslying."How now, Sir Henry? What's this, any bones broken, eh? How did you doit, man; was it here?" and having delivered himself of this string ofquestions, the King of the Peak leaned against the wall and awaitedthe reply."More hurt than injured, I believe," replied the other, "but Eustacehere will tell thee all about it;" and Eustace, who had carefully gotthe story by heart, recounted how, when they were after a fine bevyof quail, his master's pole had snapped as he was springing up, andinstead of clearing the wall he had fallen heavily against it.The pole, broken in twain, which lay upon the grass close by, attestedthe truth of the statement."Sir Benedict," exclaimed the baron, "thou art somewhat learned inleechcraft; see if thou canst do aught. Tell us what is amiss."A Woode stooped down, and after a prolonged examination he gave it ashis opinion that some of his friend's ribs were broken.Another litter was quickly made up and De la Zouch, who was nowfeeling the full effects of the injuries he had received, and who inreality stood in need of assistance, was placed upon it and carriedoff in the wake of Sir John de Lacey.Leaving them to pursue their way homewards, the hunting party set offonce more to make a fresh attempt at sport ere the day should close.But now the fortune which had so favoured them during the day desertedthem. Not a bird was seen, and after vainly beating about for sometime the party at last reluctantly determined to wend its way oncemore towards Haddon. Sir George sounded his horn again, and in answerthe wanderers returned from all quarters of the wood, all of themlight-hearted and most of them light-handed too.The route now taken was precisely the same by which they had advancedduring the day, and they soon arrived at the spot where the strugglehad taken place. Dorothy discovered the first signs of the conflict."Why, what in the name of faith is this?" she cried, as she pointeddown to the ground. "'Tis a noble, I declare.""And here is another," added Crowleigh, stooping down and picking upthe glittering coin."And here's a comb, what a nice--"Sir Benedict never missed that sentence, for as he bent down to pickit up he caught sight of the body of the packman, and he started backaffrighted at the sight. "Look!" he cried, "'Tis a--the blessed saintsprotect us, 'tis a murder see!" and he pointed to the tree."A what?" asked Sir George, coming up. "What's a murder? Where?""Here, see!" and a Woode pulled away the twigs which had but halfhidden the body from view."Heaven forfend us!" ejaculated the baron as he gazed horror-strickenat the body. "'Tis a foul villainy, and so near Haddon, too.""'Tis the poor Derby pedlar," exclaimed Dorothy, "and it was butyester e'en since he was at the Hall.""Ha! 'tis lately done, I see. Trust me, I shall see to this. We'llhave no ghosts round Haddon, Doll. To-morrow we'll enquire into it. Imust get to the root of this.""'Tis evident it was a robbery," suggested Manners. "Even now theknaves may be lurking round."Sir George took the hint and the vicinity was closely examined, but,of course, not a trace of the perpetrators could be found; so, leavingthe followers to bring on the body in the rear, the party hurriedforward to gain the friendly shelter of the Hall and to partake of thebountiful feast which the Lady Maude had provided for them.CHAPTER IV.DAME DURDEN'S ORDEAL.  Fear fell on me and I fled.  *       *       *       *       *  I took the least frequented road,    But even there arose a hum;  Lights showed in every vile abode,    And far away I heard the drum.  Roused with the city, late so still;    Burghers, half-clad, ran hurrying by,  Old crones came forth, and scolded shrill,    Then shouted challenge and reply.  AYTOUN.Next morning the Hall was early astir. The news of the murder hadspread far and wide, and had caused a feeling of consternation in theneighbourhood, which was intensified by the mystery in which it wasenshrouded.De la Zouch had grown worse during the night, and soon after the breakof day had departed, with Eustace, for Ashby Castle, declaring thatin spite of the good intentions of Sir Benedict his case was notunderstood, and that it had been aggravated rather than improved bythe attentions he had received from his friend.Sir George, as magistrate of the district, had caused the body to bedressed, and for a long time he sat in his dressing-room ponderingwhat steps he had better take next. There was absolutely no clue, yetthe baron was determined not only to discover the culprit, but to makesuch an example of him as should effectually deter a repetition ofsuch a crime in the neighbourhood of Haddon, at least for some time tocome.At length he issued from his room, and, passing along the corridor, heascended a short flight of stairs, and stopped at the door of theroom in which Dorothy was busily engaged in making some new tapestryhangings. He paused, uncertain whether to turn back or to enter."Yes, I will," he muttered; "she has the clearest head of them all,"and suiting the action to the word he gently turned the handle andwent in.Dorothy had dropped her work, and so intently was she gazing throughthe open lattice window that she did not notice the arrival of herfather.The knight stood still for a moment or two, and involuntarily admiredthe graceful figure of his daughter, and stepping gently forward, hetapped her lightly upon the shoulder.Dorothy turned hastily round, and as she did so he caught her deftlyin his arms and printed a loud, smacking kiss upon the fair girl'scheek."There," said he, "I'll warrant me thou wert longing for it; come now,confess."Dorothy disdained any such idea."Nay," she replied, "I was but thinking of the poor pedlar. I hadbought these from him only the day before," and she pointed to alittle heap of silks which lay upon the table."I had come to talk it over with thee, Doll," replied the baron as hesat himself comfortably down upon a chair. "I think it was a robbery,eh?""Yes," slowly replied the maiden, "I should think so, too. Meg and Ipaid him six nobles.""And only two were found.""Only two?" asked Dorothy."That is all," replied the knight. "The knaves must have made off withthe rest. That ill-favoured locksmith would be as likely a rascal asany; I must examine him.""Nay, that cannot be, he was all day in the stocks."Sir George scratched his head in despair. He had privately determinedthat the locksmith was the guilty one, but now that his idea wasentirely disproved he felt sorely at a loss how to proceed.Dorothy watched him in silence; she was as helpless as the baron."Was the packman staying in the village?" asked Sir George, lifting uphis head after a long pause, during which he had kept his glance uponhis foot, as if seeking inspiration there."He stayed at Dame Durden's, I believe.""What, the witch?""Yes.""I have it, then," he exclaimed as he struck his hand heavily upon thetable. "I have it!" and without saying another word he hastened out ofthe room.Although the knight had thus decisively declared that he "had it," yetwhatever it was that he had got, he did not feel equal to proceedingin the matter alone, and before he had proceeded many steps he turnedback again."Come, Doll," he said, as he opened the door again, "we will gotogether," and the two went off in company to consult the rest of thefamily.The Lady Maude was seated in a low, easy chair, And with an air oflanguor upon every feature of her countenance was listening to SirJohn de Lacey, who was reading to her out of Roger Ascham's treatiseon Archery. As the knight stepped into the room the remembrance of theprevious day's mishap was strongly brought back to his memory."What ho! sir knight," he exclaimed; "better, eh!""A little stiff about the joints, mine host," he replied, "for which Ihave thee to thank.""Tush, man, don't mention it," laughingly returned the baron. "There'sno question of thanks betwixt me and thee.""They gave me some hot sack, and then rolled me in the river," whinedDe Lacey, "and the pity of it is I cannot remember which of them itwas, or else I'd--I'd--"Sir John de Lacey paused to consider what course of action he wouldhave taken, but ere he had resolved, the door opened, and Sir ThomasStanley entered, bringing in with him the Lady Margaret."Well, well," returned Sir George, "since it baffles thy wits todiscover whom it was, thou hadst best have the grace of forgiveness,it will become thee well. But a truce to this. I came to counsel withyou of the murder. Any more news, Sir Thomas?""I hear that the old hag, Durden, had a quarrel with the pedlar theday before his death," answered Stanley, "and she told him to his facethat he would come to no gentle end.""They have often quarrelled," added Margaret, who felt bound to addsomething to her lover's statement."Yes, then," said Sir George, "I have it now. I guessed it was herfrom the very beginning.""Nay, nay," interrupted Dorothy, "you suspected the smith at first.""Well, Doll, it makes no matter of difference if I did. 'Tis theold witch, sure enough, and she will either hang or drown for it, Iswear.""Not so fast, either though, worthy knight," interrupted Stanley. "Iam not yet satisfied that it really was the witch, for she seems tohave been at home all day, except when she was by the side of thestocks.""Courting the proud smith," added Lady Vernon, referring to a rumourin the neighbourhood."But he was killed in the woods," said Dorothy."Tut, there's not a doubt about the matter," pursued Sir George, "notthe shadow of a doubt.""Nevertheless there is something in what Dorothy urges, and wehad better make some sort of inquiry," suggested the more cautiousStanley; "for thou hast many jealous enemies, Sir George, who wouldgladly score a triumph over thee an they had but half a chance.""Sir Ronald Bury, for instance," added Margaret."But why Sir Ronald?" asked De Lacey. "He is a simple enough knight, Itrow.""Pooh, I care naught for him," replied Sir George Vernon; "he isjealous of the beauty of my daughters.""And wants a husband for his child," added Lady Maude."Let him want, then," testily returned the baron. "He may turn greenwith envy for aught I care. I'll do it to his face, I will."But in the end wiser counsels prevailed, and the knight gave way sofar as to order a trial of touch--a superstitious form of trial muchrelied upon in the times when witchcraft was commonly believed in.The witching hour of twilight was chosen for this crude but solemntrial, and at the time appointed a large crowd was gathered in thegreat courtyard of Haddon in obedience to a mandate of the King of thePeak, which they dared not disobey.As the crowd swayed to and fro it was in marked contrast to the usualway in which they were wont to assemble within the great walls ofHaddon. No loud laugh or sound of boisterous merriment broke thestillness of this solemn eventide; no tricks were attempted now uponunconscious friends, and even the almost invariable little groups ofadmirers listening to the marvellously strange tales of those whohad crossed the seas were not to be found. All was silent save thescreeching of the owls every now and again, and the subdued humof conversation which rose up from the awestruck assembly as theypatiently awaited the test which was to bring home the guilt of themurderer.They had a long time to wait, and the moon had long been out beforethe proceedings were properly commenced.A loud blast from the trumpets of the sentries gave the firstintimation of the approach of the head of the house of Vernon. Thegreat gates swung open and Sir George slowly advanced through thethrong, which respectfully fell back on either side and made an openpassage for him. A few yards behind followed a bare-headed priest,chanting prayers for the departed, and heading a diminutiveprocession, in the midst of which the body of the unfortunate pedlarwas carried on a bier. They stopped at the foot of the steps whichstretch across the courtyard; the doleful chant ceased, and animpressive hush fell upon the assembly, as with bated breath theyawaited the next scene in the awful drama.Sir George did not hurry himself, for it was necessary to the successof the ordeal that the culprit, whoever that was, should be dulyimpressed with a sense befitting the character of the moment, and alittle suspense, he shrewdly guessed, would tend to make the guiltyone tremble and offer signs which would make detection the easier.At last he spoke."Mary Durden, Joel Cobbe, Henry Bridge, and Nathan Grene, step out,"he said, "take the oath; touch the body in our presence, and proveyour innocence if you are able."Every whisper was smothered into silence as they watched to see theindividuals named perform the test. No one stirred, however, and theorder had to be repeated."Mary Burden, Joel Cobbe, Henry Bridge, and Nathan Grene," thunderedthe baron, "I command you to answer to your names, or by your silenceshall you be condemned."Joel Cobbe and Henry Bridge, two of the most disreputable men in thewhole district, went forward in company, and succeeded in touching thebody without a rupture of blood taking place or the body moving itsposition one iota."Mary Durden, spinster, Nathan Grene, locksmith," repeated Sir George,"answer to this third, last challenge, or thy last hope of escape isgone."Nathan Grene, fuming with ill-concealed rage, stepped out, and a loudshriek announced the presence of Mary Durden, who was unwillinglypushed into view by those around her. As soon as she had gained thelittle open space that was yet left she fell upon the ground andswooned away."See," said one, "the witch is guilty, she dare not touch the body.""Drown her," shouted another. "Drown her or burn her."The clouds which for some time had been gathering together, andwhich by this time had completely obscured the moon, now burst with atorrent of rain. A flash of lightning for a brief moment illuminatedthe scene, and then died away again, leaving it more weird even thanit had been before. A faint roll of thunder broke upon the unpleasantreverie into which the company had fallen, and Sir George's voiceordering the oil lamps to be lighted, somewhat reassured the morefearful among the spectators. A long five minutes elapsed before thelights appeared, minutes of darkness and suspense, disturbed onlyby the flashes of lightning and peals of thunder, which rapidly grewlouder in sound.Nathan Grene had touched the body, and the trial had proclaimed himinnocent. Indeed, Sir George fully expected it would do so, seeingthat Nathan had been fast bound in the stocks at the time the crimewas perpetrated. His name had only been called out because the baronhad a standing dislike to the man. But the woman still lay on therough stones without offering a sign of life."Sir George, is that the witch?" asked De Lacey."It is.""Then she is praying to her master the devil. Listen!"In the dread stillness of those awful minutes it was not difficult todiscover that she was moaning. The crowd was stricken with terror, andcatching up the words which Sir John had let fall, reiterated the crywhich even yet added to the dismal terror of the scene."This cannot long endure," said Sir George, as a vivid flash oflightning almost, for the moment, blinded him.A long, loud roll of thunder, which terminated in a crashing peal, wasthe only answer he received, and while the noise was at its loudest,Mary Durden started to her feet and dashed forward to touch the body.She just reached the bottom of the steps when, catching her footon the uneven pavement of the yard, she over-balanced herself, andtumbled heavily upon the bier, almost knocking the body off as shefell."Guilty!" eagerly shouted Sir George; "she is guilty; seize her."But before he had finished the sentence, Mary had turned and fled,and far from attempting to hinder her in her headlong flight, theawe-struck people, one and all, shrunk eagerly back to escape beingbrought into contact with one who had just given such unmistakableproofs of witchcraft, and who had been condemned a murderess by thealmost infallible ordeal of the bier.CHAPTER V.A VISIT TO NOTTINGHAM.  One sole desire, one passion now remains,  To keep life's fever still within his veins.  Vengeance, dire vengeance, on the wretch who cast  On him and all he had the ruinous blast.  MOORE.It was upon the third day after the occurrences narrated in the lastchapter had taken place that a lonely traveller might have been seenurging his way across the fields just outside the town of Nottingham.The gates closed at dusk: it was now past sunset, and he hastenedforward to gain admittance.It was the man known at Haddon by the name of Nathan Grene, thelocksmith, whose actions had ever been at variance with his character,and whose nature had always seemed to have been unequally yoked withthe common occupation of a smith.Nathan, in fact, was no true smith. He was a brother-in-law ofSir Ronald Bury, and having taken up the practice of astrology andalchemy, this fact had been seized upon by his foes, and he hadbeen obliged to fly in disguise to save himself from one of thosepersecutions which were so readily and frequently levelled against thefollowers of the "black arts."In the character of a locksmith he had lived for some months in anuneasy state of security at Haddon. The lack of comfort which he wascompelled to experience in his new position being compensated for insome small degree by the kind attentions he had received at the handsof the widow Durden, which began directly upon his arrival, and whichsoon rapidly ripened into a sincere regard for each other, and fromthat eventually progressed into love.Being well born, Nathan Grene--or rather Edmund Wynne, for such washis proper name--had never taken kindly to the conditions imposed uponhim by the disguise he had chosen to assume. He had never sought forwork, and had done as little of it as he possibly could, and hehad held aloof from the people around him, treating them with asupercilious indifference which they were not slow to resent. Undersuch conditions it was by no means surprising that he was decidedlyunpopular in the neighbourhood, and the dislike to him was heightenedby the intimacy which grew up between himself and the woman who wasregarded as a witch.It was for his vigorous defence of Mary Durden that he had been placedin the stocks. His whole spirit revolted from such a degradation; hehad pleaded and had raged, but all in vain, and even Dorothy's appealon his behalf had failed to save him from the bitter humiliation.The ordeal, again, had been a very trying scene for him, and hisannoyance was more than doubled when he saw how his beloved wasbeing persecuted by her neighbours and oppressed by the baron. As sheescaped through the gateway he made up his mind to strike Sir Georgedown, but in spite of his resistance he was carried out beyond thelimits of the Hall in the wild rush that took place when the firstmoment of surprise and terror had passed away.All night long he lay upon the floor of his little smithy ponderingschemes of revenge, but when he ventured out on the following morningall his ideas were dispelled by the sight which met his gaze, forthere was Mary Durden hanging from the branch of a tree at the foot ofthe slope which led up to the gateway of the Hall.He rubbed his eyes in sheer astonishment and looked again, but thesecond view only confirmed the vision of the first. His worst fearswere realised; his Mary was dead!Mechanically he walked to the tree; there was a paper fastened to itupon which was some writing in the hand of the baron. He read it:--          MARY DURDEN.  THE STORM AVAILED HER NAUGHT.Impatiently he snatched it down, and tearing it into a hundredfragments, cast them down upon the ground, and slowly turning on hisheels, he walked homewards, utterly dejected and cast down, and with abitter heart. The last tie which bound him to Haddon was now severed,and he longed to get away.In melancholy silence he dug a grave in the little garden behindhis lowly cottage, and then, with all the coolness which is lent bydesperation, he proceeded again to where the body was hanging, and cutit down. He had brought another paper with him, and this he affixed inexactly the same place as the one he had destroyed. It was laconicalenough, for it had but one word, and that was    REVENGE!He laid the body in the grave, and put some plants upon the top, andthen, after watering them with the tears which copiously ran down hischeeks, he turned his back on Haddon, and started for Nottingham withfew regrets, leaving behind him little enough to love, and much to berevenged.Footsore and weary he hastened to the Chapel Bar, glad indeed tofind himself so near the end of his journey; but before he had quitereached it he had the mortification to hear the sound of the closingbell, and when he arrived there the gates were shut."Ho, ho, there, porter!" he cried, and he violently kicked the ironpost by way of emphasis to the call."Aye, aye, there; steady now, thou'rt over late," replied the burlyporter as he tantalisingly rattled the heavy keys in his hand."Yes, but only a minute," Edmund replied; "you can let me in, and youwill.""Nay, master, not till next sunrise," he returned. Edmund groaned."But I cannot stay outside all night," he said. "Come, open the gate,there's a good fellow.""I were like to lose my position if I did," answered the other. "Icannot unless--," and he significantly jingled some coins in hispocket."Unless what?"The gatekeeper thought Edmund Wynne uncommonly dull of comprehension,and with a little hesitation he suggested that it were surely worth atrifle if he did break through the rule."Here, here's a groat then," exclaimed the smith, bringing out hislast coin as he saw the other moving away."Pooh, a sorry groat!" said the keeper, "Make it two, and then!""But I must get in to-night," expostulated Edmund, "I have urgentbusiness with Sir Ronald Bury. It is important, it is a matter of theState."At the mention of Sir Ronald's name the key was inserted in the lock,and by the time the sentence was completed the great gate was swungopen, and the visitor found himself, to his great satisfaction, beyondthe barrier."I was but jesting," humbly said the man as he re-locked the gate;"for you must well know that we are not allowed to take bribes, thoughwhere the harm of it would be, I confess I cannot see."Having succeeded in passing the barrier, Edmund did not stay to arguethe question with the gatekeeper. He turned his steps towards theCastle, and in a very few minutes found himself at its embattledentrance.The gates, of course, were fastened, but the bell-rope was hangingdown, so seizing hold of that he gave it a vigorous pull."Holloa, my hearty, what's amiss?" asked a stentorian voice. "That'sthe third summons to-night.""I want to see the constable of the Castle," replied the traveller."Well, thou hadst better hie thee to London, and happen, if you'relucky, you may find him there.""Sir Ronald at London!" exclaimed Edmund, in blank dismay."Sir Ronald!" repeated the other. "No, the Earl of Rutland.""But Sir Ronald Bury?""He's the deputy-constable.""Well, I would see him. Is he here?""Yes, he is here," responded a gruff voice. "I am Sir Ronald; who artthou? What dost thou require at this time o' night?""I want to see thee privately, upon a matter of much importance,"answered the pseudo smith, somewhat annoyed not to be recognised byhis brother-in-law."See if he has any weapons on him, Wilton," said the knight, "and lethim enter if there is no suspicion of foul play. It will go badly withhim, though, I trow, has he ventured here on no sufficient reason."Wilton approached him to obey his master's commands, but Edmund wavedhim back by an imperious gesture of the arm."Nay, cousin Ronald," he exclaimed in high dudgeon. "It is beyond ajoke to take matters so far. Ellice might well expect that a littlekinder treatment would have been extended to her brother at the handsof her husband.""Eh, what! Are you Edmund; risen from the grave?" asked the knight inhigh surprise."I am Edmund, sure enough," was the reply, "but I have not risenfrom the grave. I am not astrologer enough for that. This is a sorrywelcome, and no mistake.""Faith, man, how could I tell it were thee? We thought thee deadtwelve months agone. Come in, man, come in; there's no occasion forthee to tarry there now. Let him in, Wilton, and be sure the gates arewell fastened to-night. Robert and Lucy will be right glad to see youagain," he said, "especially Little Robert, who has never forgottenthose little iron toys that you made for him two years ago."Edmund Wynne needed no second invitation. He hurried through the openportals and the two walked up together towards the inhabited part ofthe building."This is indeed a strange surprise," began Sir Ronald, as soon as theywere out of danger of being overheard. "We felt sure that thou wastdead, and have often thought of thee. Where hast thou been?""Hiding in the country. I have been a village smith.""A smith!" cried the knight. "Then that fancy of yours for workingwith metals has stood thee in good stead for once?""It has indeed; but it was a base use withal.""Thou has been well hidden, for Her Majesty's servants have scouredthe country to discover your where-about.""I have been at Haddon in the Peak," he replied."Haddon: phew! Do you know that arrogant knight, Sir George Vernon?""Do I know him?" echoed Edmund. "Would to heaven I had never cast myeyes upon him.""Ah! he has stung thee too, I perceive?" exclaimed Sir Ronald. "I hatehim like poison. It should go ill with him did I ever have the power.I hear he is a Papist; cannot we prove aught against him on thatscore?" and the excited knight wistfully regarded his companion'sface, waiting for a favourable reply."I should like some supper first," drily suggested the toil-worntraveller, "and then," he added, "I may satisfy your eagerness to thefullest extent. I have a score of my own against him to clear off yet,and, what is more to the point, Ronald, I have the power. It was forthat I came to visit you.""Ha!" ejaculated the knight, expectantly. "He can satisfy my cravingto the fullest extent," he mused. "This is fortunate.""Yes," continued Edmund, "we shall have him cited to London; he issurely within our power. He hath grievously broken the law, and willhave to answer to the charge of murder and treason; and if we cannotcompass his ruin, then, between us, I have other ways, of which no manknows.""Hush," said Sir Ronald. "That led thee into trouble aforetime. Hereis Lettice coming down the steps.""That is not Nicholas with her, surely?" exclaimed Edmund."No, Nicholas has discarded us and turned monk, I hear, but wherehe is I cannot tell. That is John Manners, the nephew of the Earl ofRutland. He is after my Lucy, I trow.""Manners, Manners, John Manners," murmured Edmund; "I have heard thatname before. I have met him somewhere I am sure.""Well, hither he comes," said the knight; "now do you remember him?"As soon as Edmund caught sight of the young man's face he recognisedhim."Why," he exclaimed, "that's--I know him well enough: I have seen himat Haddon.""At Haddon!""Yes, let me hide myself; I would rather not meet him here; it werebetter so for both of us. Where shall I go, tell me; quick?""Steady, ho! steady, man," said the knight. "Hie thee back again tothe lodge and wait for me there. Wilton shall let you share his supperif thou wilt. I will tell them you are a gardener if they ask aughtabout thee," and in answer to the beckoning of his wife, Sir Ronaldleft his newly-discovered relation and hastened across the green.CHAPTER VI.DE LA ZOUCH INDULGES IN A LITTLE VILLANY.  If I can do it  By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,  She shall not long continue love to him.  SHAKESPEARE.The Courtly hall of Haddon was never quiet for long together, and verysoon both the death of the witch and the warning of the locksmithwere forgotten amid the preparations which were being made for a grandball. Sir Thomas Stanley, having wooed Margaret, had successfullypetitioned the sanction and blessing of Sir George and Lady Vernon,and the event was to celebrate their betrothal.The morning of the festive day had opened fair, and as the day spedon, the guests rapidly assembled. De Lacey was there, delighting theladies, as usual, with his braggadocio. Manners and Crowleigh wereboth there too, by special invitation, and, of course, cousin Benedicta Woode, who made no scruple of inviting himself to Haddon Hall if byany means his invitation had not come; and also, to Dorothy's greatdisgust, Sir Henry de la Zouch was there.The musicians struck up a lively tune, and very soon the steamingboar's head was placed upon the table. Father Philip pronounced a verylong benediction, and the singing of an old Latin rhyme beginning--  "Caput apri defero,"announced that the feast had commenced in earnest. The venison pastiesof Margaret's make disappeared with a truly marvellous rapidity, whileDorothy's confections had a very short lease of life, and fared nobetter, either because they were nice or that Dorothy was the maker ofthem."Pass round the wine," hailed the baron, "and drink to the health ofthe ladies of Haddon Hall.""Hurrah!" vociferously replied the guests, "to the health of theladies of Haddon.""But stay; what's the matter with Master Manners?" asked De la Zouch,whose eagle eye had discovered that HIS tankard was not upraised withthe rest. "A discourteous guest, upon my troth.""May I drink it in water?" asked Manners, as he felt the eyes of hishost fixed sternly upon him."Nay, you must have the wine, sir," replied Sir George, "but whetherit goes down your throat or your arm makes little matter," and as hespoke he pointed to the iron ring fastened in the door post ready forsuch contingencies."I suppose the arm must have it, then," he replied, "for I am sworn totaste no wine until I have performed a solemn vow.""Waste good wine!" exclaimed De Lacey, as he gazed in blankastonishment at the speaker; "what a pity.""Have you forsworn ale too?" asked Dorothy."No, only wine, sweet demoiselle," replied Manners, smiling as hecaught the drift of the question."Then fill his glass with ale," commanded Doll, "and drink the toastwithout delay."This happy suggestion was loudly applauded, and the healths were drunkoff amid acclamation, the only one who did not heartily join in itbeing Sir Henry de la Zouch, who was annoyed to find that hispetty attempt to spite his rival had failed, and that, too, by theintervention of Dorothy herself."Confound it all," he muttered, "he shall not escape me like this.Eustace.""Did you call?" asked the page, bending down."Yes," whispered De la Zouch. "Listen, you remember the Derbypackman?""Aye, too well, I do.""Nonsense," he replied, softly; "Master Manners killed him.""Oh!" gasped the astounded page."Remember," added his master, "it was Manners.""Yes, Master John Manners," repeated Eustace."Hush, that is all. A little more of that delicious jelly of yours,sweet Dorothy," he added in a louder tone as he turned round again tothe table.Whilst the feast was progressing, De la Zouch was pondering thefittest way of broaching the topic which lay so heavily upon his mind.Sir Thomas Stanley had won the elder sister, he argued, why should henot win the younger? He clearly saw that Dorothy was receding from hisgrasp, and that the longer he delayed, the fainter grew his chance ofsuccess. Lady Vernon daily grew less favourable too, he noticed, andso without delay he resolved to ask Dorothy for her hand. The presentoccasion was most propitious, and he determined to carry his plan intooperation at once.When the meal was ended--and that was not very soon--the company brokeup into little parties and separated, to amuse themselves in whateverfashion they liked best. Margaret, as the heroine of the day, wassurrounded by a number of knights and ladies, who contentedly watchedher as she played at chess with Benedict. Sir John de Lacey racked hisbrains to the uttermost in order to sufficiently garnish the veraciouslittle scraps of his own autobiography, and succeeded both in makingthe group around him open their eyes wide with surprise, and at thesame time in making his listeners roar with laughter.A marvellous hero was Sir John. He had been the ruling spirit in morethan one Continental Court during his one brief sojourn in France. Hehad slain dragons, in different parts of the globe, in numbers enoughto make St. George turn green with envy; and only his excessivemodesty has prevented his name from being handed down to posterity.Manners, naturally enough, joined Dorothy's party, and went out uponthe lawn to take part in a game at bowls."Dear me, how careless I am to-day," she exclaimed; "there are six ofus, and I have only brought four balls; I must fetch some more," andshe started to go back."Let me go," said Manners."You," replied Doll, "you could never find them; I will go, and youmust entertain the ladies while I am away," and she tripped across thegreen to the Hall."Ha, Doll, dearest," said a voice, as she turned the corner of theterrace, "I have been searching for thee."Dorothy turned round and met the gaze of Sir Henry de la Zouch."For me!" she exclaimed, without pausing."Nay, prithee, now don't hurry so," he replied, catching hold of herarm, "I would ask thee a weighty question.""But I am in a great hurry," she replied."Then I shall not keep thee long, but thou canst stay a little while,surely?""Indeed, I cannot, Sir Henry," she replied. "There are some visitorsawaiting my return.""John Manners for one," sneered the knight.Dorothy blushed deeply, and bit her lip to repress the sharp retortwhich came readily to her tongue. Sir Henry saw that he had committedan error, and he endeavoured to recover his position."Sir Thomas has wooed thy sister Margaret," he exclaimed, "and I havelong been wooing thee, and now the time has come when I am to offeryou my hand."Dorothy struggled to get away, but her suitor held her fast."Nay, cruel one," he continued, "I must have an answer. I shall bean earl in good time, perchance, and if you will but say 'aye' to myproposal you may be a countess--think of it, Dorothy, a countess--andthe hostess of Ashby Castle."He let go his hold of her, and dropping down upon his knee, heraised his clasped hand in the most approved fashion of the time, andcontinued his suit."Dorothy," he went on, "will you--?""Never," she replied, cutting him short in the middle of his speech,and, finding herself at liberty, she rushed precipitately into theHall.De la Zouch gazed after her in mute astonishment, and, staggered as hewas, he remained in the same position until he was startled by a voicebehind him."At prayers, sir knight?" asked the baron. "Father Phillip's grace atthe table was long enough to serve me through the day.""No, Sir George," replied the crestfallen lover, "I have been pleadingmy suit with Dorothy.""And what said she?""She is bashful.""What! My Doll bashful? That were hardly polite to thee, methinks.""Perchance I should have more success with thee?" pleaded Sir Henry,as pathetically as he could."Let us withdraw into the bower, then," replied Sir George, "we cantalk it over there, and we shall not be disturbed. Ha! here comes LadyVernon, she will know what to do."Lady Vernon came up at the bidding of her lord. The lover would fainhave seen Sir George alone, but there was no help for it, and he hadto brave the circumstances with the best grace possible."Maude, we must take your counsel," began the baron. "Sir Henry de laZouch would take advantage of to-day's festivity to ask for the handof Doll. What think you; can we spare her too, as well as Margaret? Weshould lose them both together then. What dost thou advise?""That depends upon many things," replied the stately dame, as sheseated herself. "Dorothy would be a splendid match for anybody. Whathas Sir Henry to say?""I hope to be an earl soon," he replied, "and she would be a countessas you will. My father is infirm, he cannot live much longer, andI expect news of his death from Florence every day. And as for theestates, though they may not be equal to those of Haddon, yet they areby no means insignificant."Dame Vernon knew all this, and the knowledge of it had influenced herbefore; but lately she had heard ill tidings of Sir Henry, and shewas by no means so enthusiastic on his behalf. And, besides, a freshcompetitor had entered the lists."Humph," growled the old knight, "we don't want to sell the girl.""Be quiet, Sir George," interrupted his worthy spouse. "The thing mustbe done properly. Does Ashby Castle fall to your share, sir knight?"she asked."Certainly. To whom else should it go?""Have you spoken to Doll about it?" continued the dame."She is too dutiful a daughter to commit herself without the consentof her parents," answered De la Zouch. "But I doubt not, that whenonce again you have spoken to her, I shall speedily be rewarded withsuccess.""Ay," exclaimed Sir George, "Doll was ever a dutiful child.""She would bow to our will, anyway," replied Lady Vernon, "but I thinkshe has another suitor. We must think the matter well over ere wesettle anything.""Another suitor," laughed the baron; "why there are scores of them.""Ah, you see, Sir Henry, the baron has not the quick, discerning eyeof a mother--or a love either," she added shyly. "Bless his innocence,he knows naught of it yet. Sir George, I trust Master Manners is atrusty young man?""John Manners is goodly enough, forsooth, for aught I trow," returnedthe King of the Peak, reflectively. "Aye, and a likely enough youngman, too!""But Manners cannot seek the hand of so guileless a maiden as sweetDorothy," interrupted the dismayed lover. "His hands are stained withblood.""A soldier should do his duty," quickly returned Sir George.""But he is a murderer!""That is a bold statement, De la Zouch, to make against a guest ofmine," exclaimed the baron quickly, "and I fear an thou persist in itthat it will prove awkward for thee if thou canst not prove it, andworse still for him if it be true.""Are you certain of it?" asked Lady Maude."I have a witness," was the calm reply."Then by my halidame," quoth the irate knight, "as I'm a justiceo' the peace, he shall be faced with the offence. When was itperpetrated?""At the hawking party.""What, here at Haddon?""You don't mean the pedlar, surely?" inquired Lady Vernon."Aye, but I do; he was murdered in the wood.""Tut," angrily exclaimed Sir George, "'tis all a tale, and I for onedon't believe a word of it. The witch killed him, and was punished forit too.""But I saw it," stubbornly returned Sir Henry, "and I have a witness;one who saw it done.""We tried Dame Durden by the ordeal, an she was found guilty andhanged," persisted the baron. "And, beshrew me, that's enough for anyman"; and the Lord of Haddon reverently crossed himself to show thatthe trial had had the approval of his conscience."But," urged De le Zouch, "I tell you I saw it done myself, and I amready to prove it any way you choose.""Come now, Sir George," interrupted Lady Vernon, "the trial may foronce have led us astray, as it did in the case of Thomas Bayfordsixteen years ago. Doubtless Mary Durden got no more than shedeserved, and mayhap she was punished for deeds we wot not of.Perchance Master Manners would not deny the charge if he were here,and faith! I remember me now that Margaret did say he was left behindwith Dorothy, and then Doll left him and galloped on.""Yes, that was it," Sir Henry said, "and Eustace, who was left behind,saw them quarrelling and fetched me back to stay the strife.""Well, prithee now, go on," exclaimed the knight. "You saw him killed,and said naught?""No.""And let me hang another for it. Truly, 'tis a right noble way totreat a host.""Nay, you are too hard upon me. I thought he was but thrashingthe knave, and as that was no affair of mine I left him to it, butafterwards his body was found in exactly the same spot. I was awaywhen the ordeal was performed, else I had told thee what I had seen.Eustace will bear me out in all I have told you; question him foryourselves. But now, if you still think well enough of Master Mannersto mate him with the peerless Dorothy, I am sorry alike for her andyour vows of knighthood.""Come that is right enough," exclaimed the dame, "and Master Mannershas not denied the accusation yet.""Then he shall soon have the opportunity," said the baron, "for hitherhe comes; he could not have come at a readier moment."John Manners had waited a long time for Dorothy's return, and now,half fearing that some accident had befallen her, he had willinglyacceded to the request of the ladies and had set forth to find her.Hearing voices in the house, he approached it to pursue his inquiries,when the watchful eye of Sir George Vernon immediately espied him."Pardon my intrusion," exclaimed Manners, "but I am in searchof Mistress Dorothy. She left us to fetch some balls and has notreturned.""Hie, man," interrupted Sir George, "we have a serious chargepreferred against thee; thou art just come right to answer it.""Have I been stealing some fair maiden's heart?" he laughinglyinquired."Nay, listen! 'tis a charge of murder; but I tell thee frankly, Idon't believe a word of it.""A charge of murder," echoed Manners blankly, "a charge of murder, andagainst me! This is past endurance, 'tis monstrous! Whom have I slain,I pray thee tell me?""The Derby packman," promptly returned De la Zouch, "and thou knowestI saw thee do it.""You lie. I never saw the man until he was dead. Thou shalt prove thywords, Sir Henry de la Zouch," returned the esquire, "or I shall havethee branded as a knave. There is some cause for this, Sir George,"he added, turning to the baron, "of which I am in ignorance. I am thevictim of some plot.""Like enough, like enough," returned the baron, sympathetically. "Thenyou deny the charge? I knew De la Zouch was wrong. The ordeal--""But I saw him myself, and so did Eustace," stuck out the disappointedlover; "and Margaret remembers that Master Manners was left behind.""And for the matter of that, so were you," said Sir George sharply."And Eustace is but a page who must, perforce, obey his master's willin everything," continued Manners. "Crowleigh was with me all the day,save when I went back to Mistress Dorothy. How tallies that with youraccount, eh?""That was precisely the time it occurred, and bears me out in all thatI have said," glibly responded the scion of the house of Zouch. "Itall but proves his guilt, Sir George.""Nay, not so much as that," quoth Lady Maude; "but since it cannot beagreed upon, I should advise you to let the matter drop.""Stop," exclaimed Manners. "If De la Zouch has a spark of honour leftwithin him he will step out and measure swords with me, for by mytroth I swear he will have to render me the satisfaction my honourdemands."This was by no means to the taste of the knight of Ashby. He had notcalculated for such a course as this; but, fortunately for him, LadyVernon spoke, and unwittingly released him from his difficulty."Nay, not before me," she said, "and on so festal a day as this.""As you will it," said De la Zouch, assuming an air of injureddignity."They must settle it in true old knightly fashion at the tourney,"exclaimed Sir George decisively."Since you command it I suppose I must obey," replied Sir Henry; "butI had rather not have stained my weapons with the blood of so foul acaitiff.""You will be good enough to leave me to decide that matter," said thebaron testily."Then, by St. George, I shall be ready," replied Manners. "I am aswell born as he, and can give him a lesson or two in good breeding,besides showing him a trick or two with the sword that I learned inthe Netherlands. In the meantime I disdain him as a dog;" and boilingover with rage the maligned esquire left the little group and stalkedacross the terrace to rejoin the ladies on the green.CHAPTER VII.DOROTHY OVERHEARS SOMETHING.  The cruel word her heart so tender thrilled,    That sudden cold did run through every vein;  And stoney horror all her senses filled    With dying fit, that down she fell for pain.  SPENSER.And, meanwhile, where was the innocent cause of this disturbance?Dorothy had been half expecting some such course of action on thepart of De la Zouch for some time past, and had carefully prepareda stinging answer which should once and for ever decide the questionbetween them. Though she was petted and admired on almost every hand,yet she had sense enough to value such conduct at its proper worth;and whilst with the coquetry of a queen of hearts she accepted all thehomage that love-sick cavaliers brought to her, she looked below thesurface, and had a private opinion of her own about all those withwhom she was brought into contact.Her opinion of Sir Henry de la Zouch was distinctly unfavourable tothat knight; for, with the instinct of a woman, she had divined fromthe very beginning that his motives were more mercenary than genuine,and in spite of all his protestations of love towards her, he hadfailed to convince her that he loved her for herself alone. A littlewatching on her part had quickly convinced her that the dislike shefelt for him was not without sufficient reason, and as the evidenceagainst him accumulated, she congratulated herself that she hadescaped the clutches of a villain of so wily a disposition.Long before the appearance of John Manners she had determinedlyrefused all the advances of her would-be lover, and his every attempthad been met by her with chilling sarcasm; or, were she in a lightermood, she had retreated into safer ground under cover of a burst ofmerriment. Had De la Zouch been possessed of ordinary perceptions hewould have noticed that his conduct was alienating Dorothy from himmore and more; but, like many others, he was so eager to gain his endsthat he was partially blind as to the means employed.The manner in which Sir Henry had just preferred his suit had takenher so completely by surprise that she had entirely forgotten what shemeant to say; but the indignation she felt at his conduct indetaining her against her will would have deprived her of the powerof expressing the prettily turned speech so long prepared, even if shehad remembered it. She fled into the house, and without casting a lookbehind to see if she were being pursued or not, she rushed through thedeserted state chambers and never stopped until she found herself inher own room and had turned the key in the lock.She flung herself down upon the bed, and her overwrought feelingsfound relief in tears. How long she would have so remained would beimpossible to say, but she had barely succeeded in locking herself inwhen she was startled by a gentle rap at the door.She stopped her sobbing and listened. Surely De la Zouch would neverventure to follow her to her own boudoir! No, it was incredible, andshe dismissed the idea.The silence was broken only by a second rap at the door. It was toogentle for Sir Henry, it must be her tire-maid, Lettice, or her sisterMargaret, maybe. She rose up, and in a tremulous voice inquired whowas there."It is I, Lettice, your maid," replied a gentle voice.Lettice was of all people just the one whom she stood in need of mostat such a moment, so she unfastened the door and let her in."My lady is troubled," exclaimed the maid, as she entered. "Is thereaught that I may do for thee?""Oh, Lettice," she sobbed, as the tears chased each other down hercheeks in quick succession, "see that he does not come. Stop him, keephim outside. Don't let him come to me.""Who, my lady, whom shall I stop? No one dare follow thee here."Dorothy returned no answer, she was trembling all over withexcitement; she fell upon the bed and wept, while the sympatheticLettice could only look on in silence, and wonder what it all meant."My lady is troubled," she repeated at length. "Someone has beenfrightening thee. Tell me who it was! Who is it thou art feared wouldtry to come at thee here?"Still there was no answer."You ran through the hall," the maid went on, "just like a frightenedhare, and cast never a look at one of us, and now--the saints preserveus, thou look'st as if thou hadst seen the ghost of Mary Durden.""Was he following me, Lettice?" asked Dorothy, raising her head fromthe pillow. "Was he there?""Following thee, no. Who's he? There was no one else went through.""I thought he was close behind.""Who?""De la Zouch.""Sir Henry de la Zouch!" repeated the maid. "'Tis he then who has beentreating thee so ill. Were he not a noble, my Will should thrash himsoundly for daring to offend so sweet a lady.""Take these balls to Master Manners, Lettice," said her mistress,composing herself as well as she was able. "You will find him waitingfor them on the bowling green. Tell him I will rejoin him soon."Lettice unfastened the door and disappeared down the passage inobedience to the command whilst Dorothy re-arranged her disorderedhead-dress, hesitating the while whether to venture out again or tostay within doors.Ere she had decided which course to take, Lettice returned. Her facewas deeply flushed and her manner unusually agitated."Why, what's the matter?" asked Dorothy. "Has he assailed thee, too?""He is telling the baron such a tale," replied the maid. "He says thoulovest him, and he is asking Sir George and my lady for thy hand. O,Dorothy, believe me, 'tis only that thou art so fair and so rich thathe seeks thee, and when he has thy gold and the bloom of thy beautybegins to fade (which God forfend!) he will care naught for thee, andleave thee for another.""I know it, Lettice.""They are in the little bower, and I could hear everything," pursuedthe maid. "That De la Zouch is jealous of another, and is seeking toget him out of the way. He says that Master Manners killed the pedlar,and 'fore heaven, we all know it was the witch.""Master Manners?" echoed Dorothy."Yes," returned the maid, "and he says he can prove it, but the goodknight, your father, won't believe him. Master Manners denies it, ofcourse--but lack-a-day, what ails thee now? Thou art as white as theveriest ghost!""'Tis nothing," replied Doll, as she sank down into a chair. "I am atrifle faint; give me some water, Lettice.""Nay, but it is something," returned the other, as she speedilycomplied with her mistress's behest. "Thou canst not throw me off likethat. Come, my good lady, tell me what it is; there are few things youhide from me.""There is nothing to tell you, Lettice," she replied, "but prithee goon; what did Sir Henry de la Zouch make answer?""He said he had a witness, but I had to hasten away, for I heardfootsteps approaching; but come, I can read your secret; MasterManners will make a worthy knight.""Keep such thoughts to thyself, Lettice," Dorothy blushingly replied."Trust me," said the maid, with a toss of her pretty head. "I will dothy bidding; but faith! you will be a comely pair.""Hush, or I shall be angry with thee. I tell thee he has said naughtyet.""And I tell thee, Mistress Dorothy," returned Lettice, "he is head andears in love with thee. I would stake my troth on it; there!""I wish it were so," sighed Dorothy, "for I love him dearly.""It is so, assuredly it is," replied her companion, decisively. "Letme give him a hint, my lady.""No, Lettice, not another word; don't breathe it to a soul unless Ibid thee.""My Will could do it," continued the other, "an you would but let himtry. He can do anything that way, Will can.""Be quiet, Lettice; and mind you take care of your tongue. No one musteven so much as guess at the truth; there, begone.""Happen you would like to see if they have settled the matter?"suggested the tire-maid; "let us go and see."Dorothy willingly agreed, and away they went through room after room,until at last Lettice stopped."Let me open the window," she said; "we shall hear better here thananywhere else," and she stepped upon a chair and silently pushed thelatticed window open. The balmy breeze came pouring into the room,bringing in with it the sound of the conversation from outside."That's splendid," she said. "Now, my lady, listen.""I tell you it's of no use, Sir Henry. I don't believe a word of it.""Nevertheless, Sir George, it's perfectly true.""Well, I cannot believe it," returned the baron, sharply, "but allthe same, you will have to fight him now. We shall make quite a grandaffair of it; 'tis a rare long time since there was a tournament atHaddon.""I had rather it passed off quietly," suggested De la Zouch, who wasby no means confident of his own prowess in a stern contest with nakedweapons. "It is only by thy direct command that I have consented toenter the lists to fight him. 'Tis more a case for the assize than forthee. Sir George, and I have my honour to maintain.""You must let that remain with me," replied the baron. "Eustace isbut a page, and as Manners rightly enough pointed out, his word wouldcount for little in such a circumstance. But apart from all suchconsiderations, I flatly tell you, Sir Henry, that I don't for aminute think him guilty. The ordeal--""Tut, bother the ordeal," broke in De la Zouch, who was rapidly losingcontrol of his temper. "Then you doubt me?""You are rash, sir knight," interrupted Lady Maude. "You do not doproper justice to the baron.""Hark! what's that?" whispered Lettice, "There's someone coming.""Inside?""No, don't you hear them coming on the gravel?""Listen," exclaimed Doll, nervously, "'twas but Eustace, the page,stealing away; he's been playing eavesdropper.""Like us," laughed the maid."Hush! Sir Henry is talking. How excited he is. Listen.""I humbly crave his pardon then, fair lady. When shall I learn whatfate you have in store for me?""Not till after the tournament, at least," promptly replied LadyVernon."And that will be--prithee when?""This day week, and in the meantime I would advise you as a friend topractise well with your arms," and, added the baron with grim humour,"say your prayers day by day, Sir Henry, for Manners has not fought inthe Netherlands for naught.""Then I shall present myself before you, Lady Vernon, at theconclusion of the tourney," he loftily replied, "and I will have myanswer then.""If so be, that is, that there be aught left of thee to come,"supplemented Sir George, considerably nettled at the other's tone,"for I hear that Manners is terrible with the sword.""Thank you, sir baron," was the proud retort, "but I have learntere now how to hold the lance, and can wield the mace;" and withoutdeigning to cast a look behind him he strode away in an ill humourwith himself and everybody else, to scowl in silence at the group ofmerrymakers on the green."There, a pretty lover!" exclaimed Dorothy, as her suitor walked away,"but I have given him his answer.""Hush, my lady," whispered the maid."We shall be able to get it all arranged for a week to-day, and youshall be queen of the tourney, Maude, if it so please you.""I, Sir George? I indeed!" replied the dame. "Pooh! my queening daysare gone. It must be either Margaret or Dorothy.""Fancy," whispered Lattice, "you the queen of the tournament!""Hush!""But I hear he is likely to lose the Ashby estates. Think of that, SirGeorge; think of that. He would be a poor man directly.""Why, how?""The Ashby estates were forfeited to the De la Zouches, but King Henrygranted them back before he died, and I hear they are like to go atlast.""It were a pity for Sir Henry, but in truth, Maude, I like him not.""Pooh, nonsense! He wants none of our pity, but I tell thee Dorothy istoo good a match to throw away upon him.""Perhaps so, Maude," replied the baron; "it may be so, but I shallbe much mistaken if, after the tournament, he is able to ask for heragain, but if he does I will refer him to you.""That will do, Lettice," said Dorothy. "I have heard quite sufficient.Shut the window; I will go now and see how they are faring on thebowling green. I have a lighter heart now." And followed by a "Godspeed you" from her maid, she opened the door and passed out of theroom.CHAPTER VIII.A TOURNAMENT. THE COMBAT.  At this the challenger, with fierce defy,  His trumpet sounds; the challenged makes reply.  DRYDEN.Grass did not grow beneath the feet of the good people of Haddonduring the week which ensued. Inside the Hall everything was inconfusion and disorder. Rooms were being emptied of hangings which hadlain undisturbed repose for many a long year, and everybody was eagerto bring to light such old relics of previous tourneys which had evertaken place there as could be discovered outside, and the stir was notone whit less. The level sward through which the Wye rippled on itsway to join the Derwent, having once been selected as the battleground, was immediately transformed from a scene of lovely rusticpeacefulness to a very pandemonium of noisy workmen, out of whichslowly evolved tents and pavilions for the accommodation of thenumerous visitors who were expected to witness the struggle.The news had spread far and wide, and a large number of persons,attracted by the well-known splendour and hospitality of the King ofthe Peak, as well as by the desire to witness the rare exhibition ofa tournament, which was now about extinct, assembled at Haddon as thetime appointed for the fray drew nigh.At length the eventful morning dawned. Everything was fully prepared.The white tents, with their fluttering pennons of many lines, occupiedone side of the ground; the balconies, decked with their brightlycoloured hangings, faced them from the other side, and a slightlyelevated platform, upon which was the throne for the queen of thetourney, filled one end, while the other was left open for such of theneighbouring villagers as liked to come.Long before the appointed hour the space had been filled up by eagersightseers. Men and women, lads and lasses, old folk and young,all alike were there, tricked out in holiday attire. Not a coign ofvantage was lost sight of, and every tree which might reasonably havebeen expected to yield a glimpse of the scene was crowded by rustics,eager to gaze upon so rare an exhibition. Behind all rose the grey oldtowers of the Hall, which presented a very picturesque appearance asthe sun flashed upon its turrets, and its flags waved to and fro inthe gentle breeze. Haddon had witnessed many stirring scenes before,but surely never a more brilliant one than was about to be enacted.Jousts were divided into two classes. The "joust a plaisir" was a mereknightly display of skill, and was fought with weapons, the edges ofwhich were dulled; but the other, the "joust a l'outrance," was ofa far more dangerous kind. Lances, swords, and even, occasionally,mace-like weapons with sharp spikes were used, and it rarely happenedthat serious injuries did not result, while not unfrequently it wasaccompanied by a fatal termination.Additional interest was attached to this tournament, inasmuch as itwas of the latter class, and when the sound of the herald's trumpetswas heard, a shout of admiration went up from the assemblage, as thegates swung open and the party descended from the Hall; and roundafter round of praise was accorded by the crowd as the cavalcadewended its way through it, and took up its allotted position in thetents and on the balconies.Without waiting any time Dorothy seated herself upon the throne, andgiving the signal to commence by waving a dainty little flag, thetrumpeters took it up and blew a loud blast upon their instruments.This was the summons for the combatants to appear, and amid thetumultuous greetings of the whole assembly, Manners and De la Zouchcame forward from either side of the balcony, and each, well protectedwith armour, stood leaning upon his charger while the herald readaloud the order of the King of the Peak, by whose command the tourneywas held.Having read it out, this functionary retired with all the graceand speed at his command; the trumpet sounded again, and the twoassailants leapt simultaneously into the saddle. A minute later thegalloping rush, the sound of contending horsemen, and the noise ofshivering lances told the outsiders that the conflict had begun.So terrible was the shock as the two met together in the centre ofthe ring that it seemed utterly impossible that either of them couldrecover from it, but after the first thrust and parry they each passedon, apparently uninjured, and wheeling their horses around, withlances couched they paused to spy out a weak point in the other'sdefence.Every breath was hushed, and every eye was strained, to the uttermostas the anxious onlookers stood on tiptoe to follow every movement ofthe competitors.But neither the knight nor the esquire appeared to be particularlyeager to commence the struggle. Each waited for the other to advance,and for a moment or two they stood perfectly still, keenly regardingeach other through the bars of their visors."They are not going to fight, Sir George," exclaimed De Lacey, inpiteous, tones, "and I've come all this weary way to see the sport.""Never fear, Sir John," replied the baron cheerily, "you'll seesport enough soon; they will begin directly, but they don't know eachother's mettle yet."Even as he spoke Manners rode forward and the conflict was renewed.Sir Henry de la Zouch was famous at the London schools for hisbrilliant lance play, and many of his friends had accepted hisinvitation to witness his triumph; but, although it was anticipatedthat he would win easily enough with that weapon, it was feared by hiswell-wishers that unless he succeeded in placing his combatant horsde combat then, his chance of doing so with the sword would beconsiderably less.De la Zouch himself knew this, although he would not own it, and itmade him cautious. For a long time he stood carefully upon his guard,but at last, espying a favourable opportunity, he darted a fierceblow at the vizor of his opponent, hoping it would pierce the bars andtransfix itself there. It was a well-aimed thrust, and almost provedsuccessful, but, unfortunately for De la Zouch, Manners unwittinglyfoiled him by rising in his saddle at the same time to deliver asimilar blow at him, and instead of receiving the lance upon hishelmet, he caught it in the very centre of his breast-plate. Stillthe blow was delivered with so powerful a stroke that, standing in thestirrups as Manners was, it completely upset his balance, and he fellover.A great shout rose up at this feat, but Dorothy turned her face aside,fearing that he whom she loved was stricken down never to rise again,and wishing, for the fiftieth time, that she was in her own chamber,peacefully occupied in stitching at her tapestry.But the shout was broken off suddenly--to be succeeded the next momentby another, louder and more prolonged, for, although taken unawaresand overturned, Manners put into execution a trick he had learned inHolland, and sliding under the belly of the horse, he nimbly swunghimself up by the girths on the other side, and reseated himself inthe saddle, much to the astonishment of De la Zouch, who imaginedhe had unhorsed him, and much to the delight of the audience, whichgreeted him with plaudits again and again renewed."See!" exclaimed De Lacey, with eyes wide open with astonishment,"where's he come from?""Never saw a neater thing in my life," replied Sir George, enrapturedat the trick. "Look now!"Sir John looked as he was bidden, and saw the astounded De la Zouchreceive a stinging blow on his arm from his opponent ere he hadrecovered from his surprise.As the lances of both were now broken, the trumpet sounded, and thecombatants, nothing loth, rode off for a few minutes' rest, and afresh supply of weapons.The latter having been procured, they very quickly renewed thestruggle, and this time De la Zouch had better fortune, for just asthe bugles were sounding for them to cease he pierced the joint ofManners' armour, and inflicted a nasty flesh wound upon his elbow.As the latter would not own himself vanquished, even at Dorothy'srequest, the conflict was resumed, and this time with swords, and herethe inferiority of De la Zouch was soon apparent. Though he was nomean swordsman, yet his opponent was far more than a match for him,and blow after blow was rained down upon him, whilst on his own partSir Henry was too busily engaged in defending himself to attempt toact on the offensive. He was hard pressed, and it was fortunate indeedfor him when the signal was given which called upon them both todesist awhile, in order to gain fresh breath, and to put to rights, asfar as they were able, the damages they had already received.The interval was filled up by the shouts of the onlookers, who nowmade up for their previous silence by loudly criticising the deedsof their respective champion, and vociferously calling out theirparticular favourite worthless instructions how to proceed when theconflict was continued.Eustace stood ready to receive his master, and give him cordialswherein to reinvigorate his nerves, while Crowleigh was in waiting inlieu of a page, to bathe his friend's wounds with water.The sight of blood, which slowly trickled from Manners' arm, remindeda Woode that he was a doctor, and, leaping from his seat, he clamberedover the balcony and rushed across the arena to where the woundedesquire was standing."Let me see it," he cried. "This must be stopped at once. Sir Henry, Ideclare you the winner of the----""Hold there," cried Manners, "I have not yielded yet.""Leave him alone, Sir Benedict," added Crowleigh. "He will make asorry example of De la Zouch even yet.""But," persisted the old knight, "I declare----"His speech was rudely cut short, for with a yell of pain he darted offacross the arena, closely followed by a huge mastiff, whose tail hehad been unfortunate enough to tread upon.With the doctor out of the way the conflict was speedily renewed. Itwas a terrible combat. De la Zouch, intent on ridding himself ofhis adversary, declared he would give no quarter, and, altering histactics, he hewed and lunged away with all the temerity of a man whofights for death or victory.Manners' superiority with the sword, however, was so apparent thatafter the restarting of the contest the final issue of it was neverfor a moment doubted, not even by the veriest tyro present. SirHenry's wild thrusts were parried with consummate ease, and while theknight's sword moved hither and thither with lightning-like rapidity,the trusty blade of the other moved equally quick, but with far morecertainty.He waited until De la Zouch began to tire before he exerted himself.The time came at last, and then with a few quick strokes he laid hisfoeman before him on the ground."Strike!" shouted a score of voices. "Strike!"The victor uplifted his sword, and poised it high above his head tobring it down with all his might. The people waited with throbbinghearts to witness the stroke which should finish the combat, butinstead of striking Manners paused and turned round."Strike, man, strike!" yelled a chorus of onlookers.Humbly bowing before Dorothy, he magnanimously declared that the fateof his rival rested with her."'Tis a tournament, not a murder," decided Doll promptly; "you haveproved your cause, and if your foe will yield we are ready to sparehim."Amid the plaudits of the crowd, Manners bowed low upon his knee,kissed the hand held graciously out towards him. He murmured hisperfect acquiescence to her will, and was about to pass out of thering, an easy victor, when a horseman rode in, and without in anywayannouncing himself, he sprang off his horse and scanned the company."What does this fellow want?" growled Sir George, as with knittedeyebrows he scrutinised the intruder. "Thou art a Royal messenger," headded, turning to the man, who had advanced until he stood before thebaron.There was little sympathy between the Court at London and the King ofthe Peak, and the baron surmised little good from the arrival of thecourtier. As the latter urged his horse through the crowd, and enteredthe arena, Sir George anticipated trouble."I want the King of the Peak," replied the new comer."I am Sir George Vernon.""Then," replied the other, "I deliver into thine hand this summons,which cites thee to appear at Westminster to answer the charge ofslaying Mary Durden."The baron started with surprise, and thought for a moment of layingviolent hands upon the man, but a moment's reflection convinced him ofthe unwisdom of such an act."And if I refuse to come," he doggedly said, "what then?""Then you do so at your peril," he replied, and leaping again uponhis horse, he departed as suddenly as he had appeared, leaving theawe-stricken assembly to disperse with much less pleasure than theyhad anticipated from the scene of such an exciting exhibition of manlyprowess.CHAPTER IX.AT THE COCK TAVERN, LONDON.  London! the needy villain's general home,  The common sewer of Paris and of Rome.  Here malice, rapine, accident conspire,  And now a rabble rages, now a fire;  Their ambush mere relentless villains lay,  And here the fell attorney prowls for prey.  JOHNSON.Five days after the tournament had taken place, two travellers reinedin their steeds at the gates of the Cock Hostelry, just within theTemple Bar. They were dusty with hard riding, and evidently in no goodhumour with themselves nor with anyone with whom they were broughtinto contact--a result doubtless attributable to the discomforts of along journey on roads rough enough to try the patience of any man.The elder of the two, throwing the reins upon his horse's neck,alighted, and leaving the ostler to take the steed away, he strodequickly into the inn without uttering a word. The young man, however,got off his saddle in a more leisurely fashion, and before he followedhis companion he proceeded to the stable to see that the horses wereproperly attended to."The old man is a trifle out of sorts," the ostler ventured to remark,as they entered the yard together."Perchance so," returned the other, "but that is no affair of thine;but an you keep good care of his horse he will think well of thee.""Yes, yes; certainly!" replied the man, grinning. "I always look wellafter gentlemen's horses, I do. You'll not be wanting them in themorning, I suppose?"Yes, no; that is--I don't think we shall, but anyway you had betterhave them in readiness, we may possibly want them for the returnjourney to-morrow: tend them well;" and leaving a few finalinstructions, Sir Thomas Stanley, for he it was, passed out of thestables and entered the parlour of the inn.Sir George Vernon was so engrossed in poring over a document whichlay stretched out on the table before him that he did not noticethe approach of his friend, and it was not until the latter inquiredwhether the meal was already ordered that the baron looked up and sawhim."Oh, it's you," he exclaimed; "yes, we shall fall to directly; but Iwant you just to look at this first.""What is it," inquired Stanley, "the summons again?""The summons, of course," replied Sir George, as he thrust it into theother's hands."What did the attorney say?""He said it was a bad case; a very bad case. He said, in fact, that henever came across a more unpromising case for a client of his since heset himself up as a lawyer.""Humph!" returned Sir Thomas, "they always do say so. I tell you itwill come out all right in the end.""Happen so; but he says the ordeal would go for nothing, they don'tcount now in courts of law here. They would do if the trial came offat Derby, I know.""Aye," assented his friend, "I'll warrant it would count there, forno one would dare to resist thee; but you see, Sir George, it's atLondon, and that makes all the difference.""Warder, read the summons through," pursued the baron. "I could notunderstand it, of course, I'm not much of a lawyer; but he says 'tisthe work of that villainous locksmith. I wish I had hanged him at thesame time, and then--""Well, what then?""It's too late, now," said Sir George, bitterly. "If they do condemnme I shall claim the benefit of clergy. I know some of the prayers,and if I can only find the right page I shall get on well enough. Theywill only fine me, though, at worst.""But you have enemies at Court, remember.""Well, let them do their worst. I shall not disgrace myself whenthe time comes, and in the meantime I will address myself to LordBurleigh; he is all-powerful now.""And if he fail us," added Sir Thomas, "I will take thee to SirNicholas Bacon.""The Lord Keeper?""Yes, why not?""He is a hard man.""He is honest, and will take no bribe, if that is what you mean, SirGeorge; but if there is a flaw in the proceedings he will point itout for us, and that will be better than naught. We shall have thesatisfaction of knowing that everything was properly done, at least.""We will try my Lord Burleigh first," sighed the knight."Sir Nicholas might intercede for thee with the Queen," Stanley wenton. "He owes me some service, and is not ungrateful.""Hush! there is someone coming," interposed the baron. "Let us say nomore at present."It was the maid bringing in the dinner; and, folding up the paper, SirGeorge carefully deposited it within his breast pocket, and relapsedinto a moody silence as they began and continued the meal.Meanwhile, outside the inn a very different scene was being enacted.No sooner had Sir Thomas Stanley entered the house than the ostler,having quickly stabled the horses, emerged into the yard again, andputting his fingers into his mouth he blew a soft peculiar whistlingnote, and reared himself up beside the wall to await the answer.It was not long in coming, for almost directly the door of thestable loft above him opened, and the head of the locksmith of Haddoncautiously peeped out."Is all clear?" he inquired."Yes, they have both gone in to dine. I didn't know you were there. Iwill come up and join you."In another minute the ostler stood beside the once more disguisedEdmund Wynne, and the two, secure from intrusion, began to conversewith unrestrained freedom."Well, are they the right ones?" he asked, as he fastened thetrap-door down."Yes," replied Edmund; "what did Sir Thomas say to you; I could hearhim speaking?""Who's Sir Thomas?""Sir Thomas Stanley, of course.""Oh! He didn't mention the affair at all.""H'm! Did he say aught about me?""How should I know even if he had?" returned the ostler, "for I don'tknow your name yet. He did not mention anybody, only to say how thatthe old man, the baron would think well of me when parting time cameif I took good care of his horse.""Call me James," quickly replied Edmund."Very well," returned the other, "it shall be so; but I don't believeyour name is James, nor do I think you are a broken-down wool merchanteither; but so long as you pay me what we have bargained for, I don'tcare a straw what you are or what you call yourself.""Just so, that will do exactly," Edmund promptly replied. "That isjust what I require.""I'll call you James, then, and if anybody asks about you I don't knowaught of any such person.""Exactly; yes.""And I will get to know as much as I can from the maids, and will keepyou well informed of the movements of your friends. Their trial comesoff, you say, to-morrow?""I think it does.""They will not go far to-day, then?""I cannot say, but they will be well watched. What accommodation haveyou here for half-a-dozen stalwart fellows?""Plenty in the inn.""I don't need telling that: but here---in the yard. I am expectingsome guests for the night.""Let me see. It means money.""Of course it does.""And I shall run great risks.""You will be well repaid, though," said Edmund, "and they might aswell be here, I trow, as elsewhere; only see that they don't have toomuch drink, and be careful that they are not seen lounging togetherabout in the yard.""Trust me," laughed the ostler, "I shall manage that easily enough.I shall bolt the doors and fasten them in, and nothing except a ratcould get out then.""Nay, you misunderstand me. They are not prisoners, but men who havebeen hired for the journey.""I see now; ah, I see," returned his companion in the most unconcernedmanner possible. "In that case they only want a little watching.""And, mayhap, a little restraining, yes. Here is a shilling for someale, which they will be expecting. You will meet them for me, and takecharge of them?""Very well, James, so be it; where shall I meet though? It would neverdo for them to hang about here that's very certain, for our landlordwould have his eyes upon them in a minute. He is awfully sharp ontramps and beggars and such.""No, certainly not," agreed Edmund; "meet them at the Temple Gates atsix.""It shall be done; and in the meanwhile you will have a first-rateview of the entertainment from here.""What entertainment?""The players are here to-day. See, there is the stage and everything.'Tis the Earl of Leicester's company, too," and pushing the door stillfarther open, he pointed out to Edmund Wynne's astonished eyes oneof the rudely extemporised platforms which passed in those days forstages.Those who have witnessed the splendid scenic triumphs which have beenachieved by managers of late years would be astonished indeed werethey confronted by one of the theatres of the earliest dramatic times.Nothing could present a much greater contrast than the elaboratedrapery and the ingenious trap-doors, side wings, and numerous othermechanical contrivances which are now a necessary complement of themodern stage, and the superlative simplicity which characterised thetheatres of three hundred years ago.Theatres, indeed, there were none, and the troupes of players wanderedabout from city to town, and from village to hamlet, giving theirperformances in open-air; or, if they were fortunate, in thecourtyards of inns.It was a scene such as this that the two men gazed upon.A slight wooden shed afforded protection to the actors from theburning rays of the sun or the more uncomfortable showers of rain. Thestage, which was a movable wooden platform, was supported at a littledistance from the ground by a number of empty boxes--which a tornpiece of faded tapestry vainly endeavoured to hide from view. A smallgallery ran along the wall at the rear of the stage, which was readyto do duty as the wall of a castle, a fort, a mountain, an upper room,or a window, or anything else, just as the necessity might be; whilea flag, which floated in the breeze from the summit of a stunted pole,announced to the general public that the play was about to commence.Edmund Wynne had never witnessed such an elaborate display before,and for a time he watched in silent wonder as the people congregatedbelow."There will be a goodly company to-day, my lord," exclaimed theostler, as he drew his head in after a prolonged look round the yard."'Twill be a notable day, will this.""I tell you I am not a lord," angrily interrupted Edmund Wynne. "Ionly wish I were.""So do I, James, with all my heart, but look here; here is a properlord for you, a great lord, too. See, do you know him?""No, where?" he quickly replied."Do you see that little platform there?""With a lamp hanging from the roof?""No, that's the moon for the players. They will light it soon, andwe shall know that it is night then, and folks can't see each otherwithout the moon. Look there;" and he pointed to where two or threegaily-bedecked ladies and some equally gaily-attired gallants wereconversing together in a part of the courtyard which was separatedfrom the rest by a rope which stretched from end to end."Well, I see them," he said. "Who might they be, prithee?""They might be Pope Joan and the cardinals, but they are not.""Then who are they?""That thin man, with the big buckles on his shoes, is Sir HenrySidney.""Never!" ejaculated Edmund, "he is too gray haired.""Even so, James. He is the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and thatlight-haired boy beside him is little Philip. He is the pet of theCourt already, but heigho! whom have we here? Why, it is, yes--it isthe Lord High Treasurer himself!""So it is," murmured Edmund, as he carefully retreated well into theshade. "This door won't attract attention, eh?""No, thank goodness, for I can't very well get out now. You see, 'tisonly a loft door, and it is as often open as shut. They will think Ihave been pitching some hay in."Nevertheless, Edmund was by no means satisfied. There was only thedistance now of a few yards which separated him from his persecutor,and he feared, in spite of his disguise, lest he should be discovered.He upbraided himself a thousand times for his foolhardiness inexposing himself to the perils which he knew beforehand would besethim in the capital; and in the extremity of his fear he absolutelyshook with terror. Fortunately, however, for him, his companion wastoo engrossed in watching the new arrivals, as they rapidly flockedin, to notice his agitation, and for some time he was left to his ownuncomfortable reflections. In vain he wished himself safe within thewalls of Nottingham Castle. Even Haddon would have been preferable,but even that sorry refuge was denied him too. However much he wishedit, he could not break away from the fact that he was at London,almost within arm's length of his persecutor, and he already began tolook upon himself as lost.CHAPTER X.IN DIRE STRAITS.  And if the worst had fall'n which could befall,  He stood, a stranger in this breathing world,  An erring spirit from another hurled;  A thing of dark imaginings, that shaped  By choice the perils he by chance escaped;  But 'scaped in vain.Edmund Wynne was rudely awakened from the train of thought into whichhe had fallen by the rough hand of the ostler, which alighted upon hisshoulders with a smack which was re-echoed in the farthest corner ofthe yard."Now, James," said his companion, whose ready familiarity was becomingexceedingly distasteful, "they are about to begin, see!"The courtyard was, in fact, already more than comfortably filled.Those of the audience who formed the pit squatted unceremoniously downin groups upon the ground, and having brought with them a plentifulsupply of fruit and provisions, they were already busily engaged indiscussing them; whilst the more select company, which paid a higherprice and represented the modern gallery, occupied the reserved parton the other side of the rope, and was amusing itself in a generalway, by looking down with supercilious contempt upon the common folkbelow.Edmund stretched himself slightly forward, and peering out of thedarkness of his retreat, was just in time to witness the appearanceof the musicians, who, after making their bow to the audience, passedalong the stage and made their exit through a doorway at the otherend. A profound silence fell upon the company, and as the music ofthe violins floated gently on the breeze, the players made theirappearance on the stage."What grotesque figures," he exclaimed, as an involuntary smile stoleacross his face; "why, they are covered with ivy leaves.""See how Lord Burleigh cheers," interrupted the delighted ostler, asthe play commenced, "and Sir Henry, too; see! Hang him, that's oldBoniface rooting about; what can he want, I wonder? I believe he islooking for me.""Who is Boniface?" meekly asked Edmund."The landlord, of course; and your friends are with him, too," was thecurt reply.Edmund shrank back still further into the shadow of the room. "Itwould never do for them to see me here," he explained; "it would upsetall our plans. You must screen me somehow, won't you?""Take care of yourself, sir," returned the ostler as he snatched upthe pitchfork and began to toss the hay about. "Take care of yourself,sir, for he's coming up here, upon my faith he is. Here's luck!" andthe hay flew about in all directions.No second bidding was required. Edmund scrambled over the heaps of hayand straw which lay upon the floor and never slackened his haste untilhe found himself hidden from view behind the stack in the further-mostcorner of the loft. Barely had he succeeded in ensconcing himselfthere, when footsteps were heard ascending the ladder, and a momentlater a sharp knocking at the door announced to the only too consciousconspirators that the landlord was waiting to enter."Halloa," shouted the ostler, as he stamped upon the floor with hisfork, to convey the impression that he was busily engaged, at work."You can't get in here, I've got my work to do."Edmund was astonished at the cool impudence of his friend, and helifted his head to accord him a nod of approval, but a bundle of strawwhich the ostler purposely tossed at him from the other side of theroom made him quickly withdraw his cranium again into the shelter."Let me in, I say," shouted a voice from below. "You knave, let me in,I tell you."The ostler had played his little game, and, having sheltered hiscompanion, he now anxiously awaited the result. Glancing round tosee that Edmund was completely buried from sight, he dropped upon hisknees, and moving the catch on one side he slowly raised the door."You knave! you villain!" exclaimed his irate master, as he steppedinto the room. "Wasting your time in looking at puppet-shows. How dareyou, sir; how dare you? Get you gone, sirrah!" and he gave him a kickwhich considerably accelerated the speed with which he disappearedbelow.Having thus satisfactorily vented his displeasure, his brow relaxedand he turned to the baron and Sir Thomas and conducted them to a seatso lately vacated by the guilty pair, with an urbanity which lookedpositively impossible to ruffle."You see, my lord, there is a seat ready provided," he exclaimed, ashe pointed to the bale of hay which stood beside the wall. "Perhapsyour lordships will be pleased to seat yourself on that? I'll warrantme 'tis clean enough, for I espied the rogue sitting on it."Sir George Vernon, nothing loth, accepted the proffered seat."I will reach another bundle down for you," continued the loquaciousinnkeeper, turning to the younger knight. "I will get you one of aconvenient size; most of them are far too big to be comfortable,I fear, but I have them in all shapes and sizes; you shall be madecomfortable in a trice, my lord."He cast his eyes about in search of the bundle "of convenient size,"and his choice fell upon the one which covered the gap where EdmundWynne lay hidden. Having once selected this he proceeded straightwayto climb over the impeding bundles to reach it from the corner wherethe ostler had tossed it just before.This, however, proved no slight task. He was burly and heavy, whilethe bundles were frail and loosely stacked and failed to yield to hisfeet that amount of support which, of all men, the stouter ones aresupposed most to require. This being so, it was not surprising to findthat ere he reached it he stumbled and fell several times, until atlast Sir Thomas took pity upon him and told him to desist."I would stand, my good man," he said, "rather than thou should'stbreak thy neck, or I might lay upon some of this soft straw for thenonce.""A prison bed," chimed in Sir George. "Well, some folks like one thingand some another, there's no accounting for tastes."The landlord scouted the proposal at once. He felt that somehow he wason his mettle, and it was incumbent upon him to vindicate the honourof his house. "Had the kind nobleman been possessed of a betteracquaintance with him," he said, "he would have known that it was notin his nature to be overcome by trifles. Things, thank goodness, weremanaged better than that at the Cock hostelry," and to support hisstatement he wiped away the perspiration from his brow, and made afurther attempt to reach it down.Edmund's feelings during these critical moments would be easier toimagine than describe. Every moment he expected that the bundle wouldbe lifted off, and he anticipated the mortification of being draggedout and being brought face to face with the man whom he now mostdreaded. As the other advanced and the unstable walls of his shelterquivered until they threatened to fall upon him, he crouched downfurther and further into the corner, preferring rather to be buriedunder the solid squares of hay than to be discovered in such aposition. Sir Thomas' words inspired him with a ray of hope, but hisexpectations were dashed as suddenly as they had arisen by the wordsof the baron and the action of the busy landlord, who, all unconsciousof the torture he was inflicting, struggled valiantly on towards hisquarry.At last his perseverance was rewarded, and he found himself able tograsp the object of his toil; but Edmund as he felt the protectingroof of hay departing, snatched at the withes which bound it round,and dragged it down with all his might.In vain did the furious landlord pull and tug. Try as he would, itwould not move an inch, and he was about to give it up in disgust andoffer some reason for his lack of success, when Stanley again came tohis aid."Stand aside, man; thou art too old for such a task, and too fat, too,perchance. Let me get it out. Odd's fish, my good fellow, but there'sbeen much to do about a little thing. Here it is, see."Edmund had, for the moment relaxed his hold, and it was at preciselythat same moment that Sir Thomas Staley took hold of the top of thebundle to pull it up. There was but one chance left, and although itpromised a little hope of success, he deemed his position desperateenough to warrant him in attempting it. He decided to leap outsimultaneously with the withdrawal of the bundle, and, trusting to theconfusion his unexpected appearance would create, to escape throughthe trap-door, and race away for his life.However, when he saw the sole protection which had hidden him fromhis enemies begin to move away his courage failed him, and he had notsufficient boldness to carry out the plan he had so neatly arranged.Instinctively he threw his arms up to clutch the rope again, butit was too late, it had already passed beyond his reach; there wasnothing left to save him. Another moment and his hiding place wouldbe discovered, when----, Sir Thomas missed his footing, and with agesture of impatience he let the bundle fall again, and turned hisback upon it in disgust.It alighted heavily upon the luckless Edmund's shoulders, and itstruck him with so much force that almost before he was aware ofit, he found himself most uncomfortably doubled up, and tight pinnedbeneath its weight upon the floor. He could neither free himself norease his position without attracting attention, for his arms weretightly wedged underneath him, while his legs had found a restingplace between two lots of hay, at a height somewhat above the levelof his head. One thing, and one alone, was at his command. He couldat least, he thought, remain quietly there, an unwilling eavesdropper,until his persecutors had gone. This he resolved to do; meanwhilehe could only submit to the conditions which a series of unfortunateincidents had brought upon him, and listen to the conversation inthe hope that some of it, at least, might at some time or other proveprofitable to him in the accomplishment of the object he had in view."How long will they be, mine host?" inquired Sir George, to whom thecircumlocution of the stage proved uninteresting indeed."About two hours, my lord," suavely replied that individual, as hegazed proudly at the brilliant company assembled in the yard below,wondering the while how much they would expend at the inn when theplay was over."Two hours!" Edmund groaned inwardly, but the groan was none the lesssincere because it was inaudible."Two hours!" exclaimed the astonished baron, "then I'm off."Hope again revived within the heart of the prisoner."Nay, stop, Sir George," interrupted the younger knight; "you cannotsee a play like this at any time you choose. Stay awhile and bid mecompany, and forget your troubles in a stoup of ale.""Aye, I have the best in the town," added the host; "there is nothinglike it in all London."This was quite a new idea, and Sir George scratched his head, as ifby so doing he might facilitate his judgment, and then he did what somany other troubled ones have done, both before his time and since,he sought to drown his troubles by gorging himself with his favouriteliquor."Ha! well," he muttered, "the ale is good, as London ale goes, I trow,but----""It is indeed," added the tavern-keeper promptly. "There's nonebetter, though I say it.""But I think I will have cider," continued the baron, not heeding theinterruption."I will fetch it myself," exclaimed the proprietor of the Cock; "andsure I am, 'twill be the best that ever you have tasted.""Nay, hold," interrupted Sir George, "I will go with thee. I willtrust none to spice my drink except it be Lady Maude, or Dorothy. Iwill go with thee and spice it myself.""And I will have some simple sack," said Sir Thomas.Sir George Vernon and the landlord descended the ladder, and threadedtheir way through the crowd into the tavern, while Sir Thomas Stanley,left to his own devices, continued to lie quietly down upon his couchof straw, watching with intense interest the progress of the play.Edmund, meanwhile, hearing no one stirring, and not being in aposition to see, concluded that all three had descended together, andthat he was the sole occupant of the room. He waited for a moment ortwo, and then, as the silence confirmed him in his opinion, he beganto make strenuous efforts to free himself. There was no sign madein response to the noise he made in the attempt, and, without anyinterruption, he released himself from his uncomfortable position.Slowly and painfully he raised himself up, but as he reached the top,the thrill of triumph to which his new-born hopes of liberty had givenbirth, died away, and a sigh of dismay escaped him as he discoveredthat he was not alone.For a time he stood perfectly motionless, too terrified to advance,and too paralysed by fear to regain his hiding-place. Fortunately,however, for him, Sir Thomas Stanley's back was turned towards him,and so intently had he fixed his attention upon the scene which wasbeing acted on the stage before him, that he was in complete ignoranceof the events which were transpiring in his rear. Edmund wistfullycast a look at the ladder which protruded temptingly through thetrap-door, but the look more than satisfied him that he could nothope to gain it without attracting the attention of his most unwelcomecompanion.There was only one idea which presented itself to the unlucky man'smind which promised any fair successes, and that left no alternative.He must put Sir Thomas out of the way!However repugnant this plan might be, and Edmund felt all itshideousness, he felt every moment more and more convinced that itwas the only safe way. He had suffered too much already to venturewillingly back into the torture-chamber from which he had justescaped, even if he could safely have regained its shelter--in itselfno mean feat; and at the bare idea of spending two more hours of likeagony he trembled. He resolved that rather than he would be drivento that uncertain refuge again, Sir Thomas should pay the penalty ofdeath.At this stage of his reflections he was rudely stopped, for the youngknight, as if conscious of some impending danger, withdrew his headinto the room and rolled over upon his back, leaving Edmund so littletime in which to screen himself from view, that in attempting tosecure a cover he toppled right over and fell back upon a thinscattering of straw.Sir Thomas stopped the yawn with which he was indulging himself, andgot upon his feet, surprised in no small degree to find that no onehad entered the room. He went to the ladder to satisfy himself, butmeeting with a like measure of ill-success there, he came away in adiscontented mood; not perceiving Edmund, who lay, holding his breath,behind a heap of hay."I thought it was my sack coming," he muttered; "but it was only thoseconfounded rats. What a time they are gone, to be sure," and as a lastresource he sat himself down upon Sir George's seat and watched theplay afresh.Edmund during all this time was slowly making up his wavering mind.The memory of Dame Durden was still fresh within him, and it was infulfilment of his scheme of revenge for that that he had united withSir Ronald Bury to bring the baron to book for his misdeeds, and wasnow in London. Why should he not wreak his vengeance upon Sir ThomasStanley, and then at once accomplish the work on which his heart wasset? In the intensity of his passion he could find no satisfactoryanswer to the question. There were powerful reasons both for andagainst such a plan. Sir Thomas was seriously jeopardising his presentsafety; but would his death at all affect the baron? Margaret wouldfeel it, mayhap, and so might Sir George to some extent, but he wasfully aware that Sir Ronald's aim would be by no means compassed bysuch a termination; nor was he at all certain his own desire would beaccomplished even then. The danger of his present position, however,was too apparent to be lightly put aside, and it proved too much forhim. Were the others to return now his ruin would be assured; andrealising this, he cautiously raised his head, and finding the youngnobleman again deeply interested in the progress of the scene beforehim, he quickly drew out his knife and crept silently on towards hisunsuspicious prey.CHAPTER XI.AN UNFORTUNATE DENOUEMENT.                                  But  In proving foresight may be vain:  The best laid schemes o' mice and men             Gang aft a-gley.  BURNS.As Edmund drew nearer to Sir Thomas Stanley his heart began to failhim, and when at last he was sufficiently near the knight to havecarried out his design, his courage oozed out at his finger ends andhe felt powerless to strike.Finally he relinquished the attempt altogether, and a new ideaflashing upon him, he tossed the knife into the furthest corner of theroom, and rising to his feet, he tapped the still unconscious noblemanupon the shoulder, trusting that his careful disguise would preservehim from being recognised by Sir Thomas at least, for circumstancesat Haddon had brought them into connection with each other but a fewtimes at most."Come at last, eh! and time, too," exclaimed the young knight, ashe listlessly held out his hand for his potion of sack. "What, notbrought it yet?" he added, as he saw the other's empty hands; "I havebeen kept waiting for it more than a quarter of an hour.""Will you have it cool or spiced, my lord?" meekly asked Edmund,following up the idea thus thrown out. "I have but just received theorder for it.""Spiced, indeed!" replied the knight contemptuously; "not I, let mehave it fresh from the cellar, and that quickly. No, here, stay," headded by the way of afterthought, "where is Sir George?""Sir George! Is that the oldish gentleman with the master?""That is Sir George Vernon, yes.""He is lying down in the parlour," was the ready reply."Humph, that's queer, poring over that confounded document again, I'llwarrant me. I will go back with you," returned Sir Thomas."I will bring it to you in half a minute," gasped Edmund."Nay," returned the other, "I will accompany thee. Ha! here he is,coming up again. He's crossing the yard now, and Sir Nicholas Bacon iswith him, I perceive."Edmund had played his last card, and the game was lost. Fortune hadforsaken him at every turn; not one of his efforts had met with anysuccess, and after all his endeavours he found himself as securelycaught as the rat which was even then writhing within a few inches ofhis feet, in its last vain endeavour to free itself from the trap inwhich it was held.For a moment or two he stood irresolute, but then, quickly gaininga mastery over the feeling of despair which had at first stolen overhim, he made for the ladder, only to find, as he put his foot on thetopmost step, that Sir George had set his foot upon the one at thebottom.There was no help for it. He could neither advance nor retreat, so hestood at the top, carefully selecting the darker side, to await thecourse of events which could bring him no good fortune, but only evilin a greater or lesser degree. The completeness of his disguise, whichhad so completely deceived Sir Thomas, encouraged him to hope, forthe moment, that he might also pass unrecognised even before the eagleeyes of the King of the Peak, and he solaced himself by trusting thatif he were discovered the landlord might dismiss him in as summary amanner as he had done the ostler before him.As Sir George passed him by, deep in conversation with Sir NicholasBacon, Edmund's hopes were considerably augmented, but the sameill-luck which had followed him heretofore did not desert him now.His hopes were dashed as soon as they had arisen, for the eye of theworthy Boniface was fixed upon him ere that person had fully enteredthe room.Had he been attired in a manner more befitting his station, Edmundwould undoubtedly have received a more befitting reception; butclothed as he was in shabby knee-breeches, loosely tied at the knees,a coat which was out at the elbows, a hat minus a portion of its brim,and with a dilapidated ruffle round his neck, which had been in itsprime years ago, he presented a striking similarity in appearanceto the ordinary marauding beggar of the period, such as were then soexceedingly common, and for one of whom, indeed, the landlord took himto be.As soon as this worthy had ascended, Edmund coolly made for theladder, but he was motioned back by a sweep of the arm, as thelandlord loosely fastened down the door."Who might you be, pray?" he asked, turning to the terror-strickencaptive; "and what are you doing here, eh?"At this sally Sir Thomas Stanley, who had just been exchangingcompliments with the Lord Keeper, turned round."Who might he be," he laughed, repeating the words he had justoverheard; "well, by my troth, Sir George, he does not remember hisown servant, even the one he sent about my sack. You have been priminghim with his own ale and this is the result."Not a drop," interrupted the baron."What do you say?" gasped out the astonished innkeeper. "This rascallyknave a servant of mine! Pooh, does he look like it, I ask you? Youimpudent jackanapes," he pursued, as he clutched the unfortunateEdmund by the collar. "What are you here for, eh? What are you herefor? Speak."So far was Edmund from complying with this command that he remainedabsolutely silent. He dare not open his mouth for fear that Sir Georgewould recognise his voice."Prowling about for as much as he can lay hold of, I'll warrant me,"continued his captor, addressing Sir Thomas Stanley, who had advancedtowards them. "How long has he been here, my lord?""Nay, I know not," said Sir Thomas. "I saw him but just before youcame up.""Then you may satisfy yourself that he had watched us out," repliedthe other sharply, "and was surprised enough to find anyone left uphere.""Like enough," assented the baron."He was pretty smart with his tricks, then," said Sir Thomas. "How washe to know I wanted any sack, I should like to know?"The question was unanswerable, and no one attempted to reply."How did you know that, eh?" asked the proprietor, emphasising thequestion by a series of hearty shakings.Still there was no answer; Edmund would not speak."Did you see him enter?" asked Sir Nicholas."I did not know he was in the room until he tapped me on the shoulder.I was watching the play.""These rogues are wonderfully sharp," muttered Sir George."Then probably he was in the room all the time," suggested the LordKeeper."What did the rascal say to you, my lord?" went on the tavern keeper."He asked me whether I would have my sack spiced or no.""Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Sir George; "that was cool enough, at any rate.I think we ought to let the knave free this time for his wit.""And let him prey on somebody else?" added Sir Nicholas."Bad policy, Sir George, bad policy. He might try his hand on you nexttime.""I wonder how much property of mine he has taken already?" continuedthe host. "I will have him thoroughly searched. I know the rascal wellenough, he's been here before now many a time. There's a whole lot ofthem prowling around the neighbourhood; a regular gang. I'll make anexample of this one, I will. You might as well give me what you havetaken," he added, turning to his captive, "and save me the labour oftaking it from you.""I have nothing of yours," replied Edmund, in a strangely foreignvoice."Not been through the house yet, maybe, eh!""No.""Humph, I don't believe you. Here, Hugh," he cried, hearing the ostlermoving about below, "come up here."Edmund's quondam friend and fellow conspirator came up in answerto the summons in no very enviable frame of mind, anticipating verycorrectly what was about to take place, and debating within himselfwhat course of action to pursue. He quickly decided, however, thatinasmuch as he had not yet possessed himself of the money due tohim from the captive, that he would screen him as far as he wasable--compatibly with his own safety."What's this fellow doing here?" demanded his master, as soon as Hughstepped into the room."Can't say, sir," replied Hugh, gazing at Edmund with well-simulatedsurprise, "maybe he's in drink.""A likely story, that. Do drunken folk climb up ladders, eh?""Not always, sir.""How long has he been up here, now?""Never seen him afore, sir," returned the unabashed ostler, with anair of perfect candour."You will be getting into serious trouble some day if you don't becareful to speak the truth," exclaimed his master, "so I warn you,sir. Now, out with it; he was here when you went down.""I had not seen him then, by the blessed Virgin I had not. I havenever clap't eyes on the knave before!""Now, mind, I warn you, so be careful.""I had only just got up, master; upon my word I had. I had notsufficient time to see anybody before you came and sent me down,"and at the remembrance of that event he stepped back a pace or two inorder that his previous experience might not be repeated."You good-for-nothing rascal you!" broke out the landlord. "I stoodand watched you myself, you were looking at the play. Get you gone,you idle vagabond," he added, in high dudgeon, "get you gone, andbring me up some stout cord."Glad to escape, Hugh quickly made his exit, having come off far moreeasily than at one time he feared. He reappeared in a short time, butwith empty hands."Well, where's the cord?" angrily enquired his master."An it please you, sir," he replied, with a sly wink at Edmund, "Icannot find one strong enough to bear him.""You can't hang him yet; let him have a proper trial. There has beennaught proved against him as yet," eagerly interrupted the baron, uponwhom the lesson of his own trouble had not been lost."He shall have a proper trial, my lord," exclaimed the landlord, "andto-morrow we shall have him in the pillory. The proprietor of the CockTavern is no hangman; I only wanted to bind him. Fetch me a piece ofcord, you knave, and be quick, or I'll lay it about your back when itdoes come. Nay, you don't do that," he added, turning to Edmund, whowas struggling to free himself; "not yet, my fine fellow. I have notdone with thee yet," and by Sir Nicholas' timely help the prisoner waslaid upon his back and then firmly secured with the cords which theostler brought up a minute later.Leaving Edmund to bemoan his fate to himself, the party drew nighto the window to witness the play afresh. They were just in time towitness the advent of another "silent scene.""Let me explain it to you," proffered the once more equable Boniface."I know all about these things, they oft-times visit us here. I knowevery bit of this play as well as I know my creed.""Happen you may not be very familiar with the creed, though," laughedSir Thomas."Don't I know it, though?" he replied. "Sir Nicholas, if I might bepardoned for mentioning it, knows full well that every citizen ofLondon knows the creed by heart.""Yes," assented the Lord Keeper, "everyone is compelled to attend somechurch at least once a Sabbath.""Or else they are smartly fined for staying away, as I was," ruefullyadded the landlord. "Yes, my lords, I know my creed full well.""Well, what's that fellow drinking now?" asked Sir George."He's fainting, poor fellow," replied Sir Thomas."Fainting," laughed the host, "fainting! not a bit of it. He isdrinking some of my best Malmesey wine, that's what he is doing; onlyyou must think he is taking poison. He is Gorboduc, the king.""Well?""Oh, I forgot, you know naught of him as yet. Well, he, a king ofBritain years ago, has just told everybody that the kingdom is tobe divided between his two sons, Ferrex and Porrex. Some of hiscouncillors advised 'Yes,' and some said 'No,' but the old king wasdecided upon having his own way, and the land had just been dividedbetween them.""Get on," said the baron impatiently, as the other paused and finallycame to a dead stop. "They are beginning to act again.""And one of the old councillors strongly advised the king to keep hisrealm entire," continued the man, "I remember his very words. He toldthe king how bad any division would be, not only for himself, but alsofor his sons. He says:--  But worst of all for this our native land.  Within one land one single rule is best,  Divided reigns do make divided hearts,  But peace preserves the country and the prince.""As correct as the creed itself," whispered Sir Nicholas."It may be so," exclaimed the young knight, "but we will let thepoetry go. For my part I can't understand that new-fashioned poetry,and I don't want to either. I only like it when it rhymes, likeChaucer.""That all means," resumed the landlord, "that Queen Mary of Scotlandhad far better leave our gracious Queen Elizabeth (God bless her)to herself. We don't want Roman Catholic princesses here again, SirNicholas.""No, indeed not. Mary was enough."Sir George Vernon frowned heavily. He was too sincere a Papist himselfto relish such remarks, but he dared not show his displeasure in theface of the Queen's minister."And I don't care for poetry anyhow," he gruffly said, "so finishwithout any more of it if you can.""I will then. You saw those two mugs offered to the king?""Both made of common horn, yes.""They both came from my bar. One was full of wine, but the other heldwater.""Then when my sack comes I would prefer it without the water," SirThomas replied, amid a chorus of laughter."You exercise your wit upon me, my lord," replied the landlord withsome asperity, "but I have not the means wherewith to retort. I am aman of business, not a Court fool." Here he paused, astonished at hisown trepidity, and also in fear lest his aristocratic customers shouldbe offended. As he stopped his virtuous indignation passed away, andwhen he resumed again it was in a tone at once apologetic and placid."The water," he continued, "was offered by the good councillors, butGorboduc took the poison, and now he has drunk it off, so----""Look at your prisoner," interrupted Sir Nicholas, "or very soon youwill not have one to look after."Edmund had, in fact, been thrown down just over his knife, andvery soon finding this out he had, by dint of considerable trouble,succeeded in cutting the cord which bound his wrists, and was busilyengaged in freeing his legs by a similar process when he unfortunatelyattracted the attention of the Queen's Councillor.No time was lost in securing him afresh. In spite of his strenuousefforts he was quickly overpowered, and after all his labour he onlyfound himself more hopelessly a prisoner than he had been before."Why, the fellow must be bewitched," exclaimed Sir George, "I neversaw his like before. Take him away before he does us any injury. Takehim away, we don't want him here.""He is safe enough now, my lord.""Take him away, I say," repeated the baron. "We want him here nolonger. Do you hear me, sirrah! Take him away I say, and lock himup in safety," and amid the oft-continued reiteration of the baron'sorder, Edmund Wynne was carried below and consigned to the care ofthe ostler until such time as the gaol officials could be convenientlycommunicated with.CHAPTER XII.A CONFESSION OF LOVE.  It was my fortune, common to that age,    To love a lady fair, of great degree,  The which was born of noble parentage.    And set in highest seat of dignity.  SPENSER.The sun was declining, after a gorgeous display of its fiery hues;gilding with a translucent light the grey walls of Haddon, and castingweird shadows on the closely-cropped bowling green, when two figuresemerged from the shades of the neighbouring wood and passed into themeadow which lies below the Hall.Sir George Vernon had not yet returned from London; indeed, nothingbut a note from Margaret's lover had given them any information aboutthe two travellers since they had departed, six days ago, and althoughnews of them was now considered overdue, yet, in those days of badroads and slow travelling, communications from distant places werenever, or seldom at best, rapidly transmitted, and, bearing this inmind, no concern was felt on that account.Haddon, usually so gay, wore for the time being a sombre aspect. SirGeorge was its life and soul, and now that he was away and exposed tothe machinations of enemies who were hungering and thirsting after ashare of his riches, a gloom settled down upon the place and envelopedit in an ill-befitting aspect of dreariness. Baits and hunting partieswere alike abandoned; no one felt in the humour to participate ingaieties, of whatever kind, so long as the baron was away; and theguests who had assembled to witness the tournament had, with fewexceptions, returned to their homes feeling deprived, in a largemeasure, of that succession of festivities and enjoyments to whichthey had looked forward with so much expectancy.Sir Henry was still confined to his room from the injuries which hehad received in his encounter with Manners; and Cousin Benedict, whohad stayed to take the baron's place during his enforced absence, hadfound his position so intolerably lonely that he at last took refugein such copious libations of wine that henceforward his interest incontemporary events entirely ceased.This air of desolation had infected Lady Vernon, too. Her temper,never of the mildest disposition, now became exceedingly irritable,and finding little consolation forthcoming from Sir Benedict, shevented her spleen with all those with whom she came into contact, andfinally shut herself up within her own room and added to the misery ofthe household by obstinately refusing to hold any intercourse with thefamily.Margaret and Dorothy were thus thrown much upon their own resources,and they managed to spend the time wearily enough at the tapestryframe until Manners and Crowleigh paid a visit to the Hall--ostensiblyto inquire after the health of the wounded knight. Their arrival, asmight be readily imagined, was cordially welcomed by the girls,and nothing beyond a first request was required to induce the twogentlemen to stay; and, so once again, Manners found himself, to hisheart's great contentment, housed under the same roof as the lady ofhis love.This time, however, he had come with the firm determination to bringmatters to a crisis. He felt that his passion for Dorothy could be nolonger controlled. Her bearing towards him had fired him with hope,but her position and her surpassing beauty had brought so many suitorsto worship at her shrine that he was driven to despair between theconflicting emotions of hope and fear.For a whole day he waited a favourable opportunity to carry out hispurpose, and in vain. The two sisters seemed to be inseparable in thistime of trouble, and try as he might he could not get the interviewfor which he so ardently longed. The fates were unpropitious, and oneafter another his artifices were defeated until at last he was obligedto fall back upon the assistance of his friend, and ask him, as a lastresource, to help him out of his difficulty.As the shades of evening crept silently on, and the cooler air beganto assert itself over the torrid atmosphere of the day, Sir EverardCrowleigh opened the campaign on behalf of his companion by suggestingthat a walk would not only be refreshing to the two maidens, but alsopositively beneficial. "I don't pretend to know much of the skillof the leech," he added, "but I think that fresh country air is thefinest physic out for young ladies, both for health and beauty too.""And maybe 'tis good for gentlemen as well," laughed Dorothy."It is the true elixir of life, for which the alchemysts labour invain to find," exclaimed Manners. "Sir Benedict knows leechcraft, letus take his opinion upon its merits."Nay," laughingly responded Margaret, "Cousin Benedict, I fear, is toomuch engaged in other affairs to attend to us just now.""Why, how?" asked Crowleigh in surprise, "surely no one would beungallant enough not to lend their services to two such fair maidens.Never! I cannot conceive it.""Margaret means," interposed Dorothy, "that he has been taking toomuch wine again, and then he goes wandering about the cellars andpassages until he falls down and goes to sleep. Nobody takes anynotice of him now, though, we have all got too familiar with hisways.""Well, we will go," decided the elder sister, "but which way--north,south, east, or west? Bakewell, Rowsley, or where? Let us determinequickly, for it will soon be dark.""We are at your service," gallantly responded John Manners. "Any waywill suit us equally well." Certainly, provided that the walk was longenough, the direction they should take was of little importance tohim. He had a more important matter on his mind."Let it be Rowsley way, Margaret," asked Dorothy."Well, then," she agreed, "we will say Rowsley, 'tis a pretty walk;but we might first see our venerable protector in safety, then nothingcould be nicer. Follow me, brave gentlemen," said Margaret, andthe two girls led the way through the banqueting-room and down thestone-flagged passage into the capacious wine cellar below.Benedict was not there, but it was evident, from signs which couldnot be mistaken, that he had been there shortly before. All theneighbouring cellars were thoroughly explored, but to no purpose; hecould not be discovered, and, finding that he had just been seen inthe vicinity of the old archer's room, they turned their feet in thatdirection, only to find themselves once more baffled when they arrivedthere."No, your ladyships," replied the serving-maid, in answer to theirinquiry, "he has gone again just now; you will be sure to find him inthe kitchen, though.""'Tis as good as a badger hunt," laughed Crowleigh, as they trailedinto the kitchen again, "but prithee, fair mistress, what shall wegain by discovering the august knight?""In truth I cannot tell," replied Dorothy; "but, trust me, Margarethas some plan or other in her head."Yes," said Margaret, "but see him, here he is; the master of thehouse, our guardian, our protector; behold him where he lies," and shepointed to where the too festive knight lay doubled uncomfortably upin the salting trough."I expected about as much," she went on, "and I want to cure him; whatshall we do?""Salt him," slyly suggested Dorothy, "that is the usual way.""Fasten him down in the box for the night," suggested Crowleigh."We will," she said; "here is the lid, we can easily fasten it down sothat he cannot undo it, and we will have a peep at him to see that heis not smothered when we come back."In accordance with this decision Sir Benedict was unconsciously made aprisoner, as securely as any culprit in Derby gaol, and leaving himin this position the merry quartette started off upon their eveningstroll.Disdaining the highway, they followed the beaten path which ledthrough the wood to Rowsley, Crowleigh doing his part to aid hisfriend by walking on with Margaret in front, and so deeply engaged herinterest by recounting some of his adventures in badger hunting thatshe entirely forgot her sister, who followed behind her in a moreleisurely fashion with Master Manners.In vain the anxious esquire sought to broach the topic which lay sonear to his heart; the words would not come, and beyond a few gallantand courtier-like remarks--to the like of which Dorothy had oftenlistened beforetimes with impatience--he could not succeed; and whenat last he began to give expression to his feelings, it was in a wildand almost incoherent manner.As for the maiden who lightly tripped by his side, although she worea sober, pensive look, yet she was filled with a silent joy, and thegreat fire of love which was burning in her breast she found difficultto control. With that quick and subtle faculty which belongs towomankind alone she had intuitively guessed his mission at the outset,and with perceptions rendered keener by the intensity of her passion,she was on the alert to detect his advances and respond to them witha due amount of proper maidenly reserve. Finding, however, that he wasslow to approach the subject, yet feeling sure of his intentions andfearing lest the opportunity should slip by, she sought to precipitatehis movements by a few, delicate hints."Why, we are all alone," she exclaimed, "Wherever can my sister be?Let us hasten on.""She is in safe hands, fair Dorothy," he replied, "and you will not bemissed awhile."Dorothy noted with satisfaction that he had dropped the "Mistress"from before her name, and this, she argued, denoted that he wasawakening at last, and encouraged her to venture again with anotherremark."Margaret is such a scold," she teasingly said; "I fear we must reallyhasten forward.""Nay, we will not hurry, we should not catch her now were we to try.""Why not, prithee?""Because--because: well, do not let us try," he responded. He hadfully meant to have declared his love to her then, but that "because"stuck in his throat and blocked up all the other words he would havesaid. The very intensity of his love hindered him from declaring hispassion."What would Sir Thomas Stanley say if he knew Sir Everard were outcourting with Meg?" wickedly suggested Dorothy. "Would he not be in atowering rage?""There would be another tournament, maybe," laughed Manners, notnoticing the tender tone in which his fair companion had addressedhim."Poor De la Zouch will remember his attempt to provide amusement forus for some time yet, I fear," she continued coquettishly. As herprevious efforts had led to nothing, she had started afresh in anothervein, mentally resolving that her companion was wretchedly slow inresponding to her advances."I fear he will," he replied; "but he is improving, I hear. SirBenedict seems to understand his case.""He is like to be scarred for life, though," Dorothy returned. "PoorSir Henry.""You are sorry for him," exclaimed Manners, who felt a little piquedat the tone of Dorothy's reply, as, indeed, she intended he should be."Yes," she said, "I am; very sorry."Manners bit his lip with annoyance, and made a foolish remark."Ha, he was your lover, perchance?" he said.Dorothy flushed up hotly at the taunt. Manners saw it, and would havedone much to have recalled his hasty words, but they were gone."Master Manners!" Doll exclaimed, turning quickly round upon him; "Ihave spurned him; I have told him what I think. Once and for ever haveI refused him, and he knows I shall not change.""Fair Dorothy, sweet Dorothy," Manners penitently exclaimed, droppinghurriedly upon his knees; "you shall be my queen. Forgive me--orcondemn. I sue you for your pardon, nor will I rise until I havegained it.""I will visit you to-morrow, then," she said, turning to go."Farewell."Her voice was sweet again, and her brow was once more clear."You have forgiven me?" he cried, rising up and following her."What, sir knight?" she exclaimed, in feigned surprise, "risen, eh?Upon my word, you are a fickle cavalier. Well, I suppose I must extendmy clemency to you. At what price will you be willing to purchase myforgiveness?"Manners was just going to tell her he would give himself and all hehad to her if she would take it, but a sudden bend in the path broughtthem face to face with Margaret and Crowleigh, and the words were leftunspoken.It needed no question to inform Sir Everard that his friend's missionwas not accomplished yet. He looked to see the sparkling eyes anda countenance beaming with delight, but was met by a face the verypicture of disappointment; and shrewdly seeing that their companywould be in no wise acceptable at such a juncture, he adroitly ledMargaret on, still an interested listener to his wonderful tales, andintimating that they were returning to Haddon, they passed the loversby.For a time Dorothy and Manners walked on in perfect silence, the onepreparing to pour out the story of his love, and the other waiting andexpecting the declaration."We had better retrace our steps now," exclaimed Dorothy at length.They turned round and began to wend their way again towards the Hall,in a silence that was positively painful to both."You are dreaming, Master Manners," she exclaimed, as they neared thenarrow bridge which spans the Wye just outside the gates of Haddon."Come, sir, declare your thoughts; let me be your confessor, forI will shrive thee right easily, and the penance shall be pleasantenough, I assure thee. Now confess!""I was thinking of--of love," he stammered out."Love! then I forgive thee," she exclaimed with a beating heart, "'tisa common sin. Proceed, my son.""I was thinking of a little poem.""Oh!" That was a disappointing continuation."'Twas a verse of Sir Thomas Wyatt's. Shall I tell it thee?""'Hide nothing from me,' as Father Philip says," replied Doll,brightening up again, for she was well acquainted with the verse ofthat unfortunate nobleman, which was almost all on the subject oflove. She thought she knew the verse which he would tell her, nor wasshe mistaken. Almost everyone knew that verse, even if they knew noneother.The young esquire fixed his eyes upon her, and began--  A face that should content me wondrous well.  Should not be fair, but lovely to behold;  Of lively look, all grief for to repel,  With right good grace as would I that it should  Speak, without words, such words as none can tell,  Her tress also should be of crisped gold;  With wit, and these, I might perchance be tried,  And knit again with knot that should not slide."Then I perceive you are difficult to please, my son," she replied."Listen, stay Dorothy," he said, quickly, as she stepped upon thefootbridge, "surely that means you. Oh, Dorothy, let me speak. I musttell you. I cannot let you depart yet. I love you. I have loved youever since I saw you first."He paused, but as the maiden did not speak, he continued."Ever since the hawking party I have loved you. Do you remember that?""I do," she demurely replied."Nay, stay, leave me not thus," he cried, as Dorothy unconsciouslymoved. "You must stay, you must listen. Dorothy, I cannot flatter youlike some; I speak the truth. I cannot live without you make me happy.Will you be mine?""But, sir knight--""Nay," he interrupted, "say it is so. I am no knight, I am but asimple esquire, but though you be the daughter of the rich King of thePeak--""Nay, do not talk like that," she interrupted quickly."Let me do something to show the vastness of my love," he went on."What shall it be? Bid me do aught, or go anywhere; command me whatyou will, but say you love me.""And if I do, what then?""What then?" he echoed; "I would live or die for you--for you alone.""I do love you, then," she replied, with downcast eyes and blushingface.Manners stood up erect, and glanced straight into the honest eyes ofthe beautiful girl as she stood on the bridge beside him."You do?" he exclaimed; "say it again.""I do love you." she repeated; "and will be yours for ever if you loveme as you say.""What!" he cried, "you, the fair Dorothy Vernon, the Princess of thePeak, the fairest jewel in the land, you give yourself to me--JohnManners, a simple esquire? I can scarce believe my ears.""I will show you. John," she replied; "my life shall prove it. I haveloved you dearly ever since that self-same hunt"; and permitting herlove-troth to be sealed by a kiss, she buried her fair face in hisbosom and quietly wept in the excess of her joy.CHAPTER XIII.FATHER PHILIP'S ACCIDENT.  And thou hast loved him! Faith, what next?  It had been better far for thee  That thou had'st ne'er been born, than this.  Brood on thy folly, and return,  But when thou hast repented on't.  A WOMAN'S WHIM.As the two lovers, happy in their newly-pledged love-troth, enteredthe gateway of the Hall they were encountered by the news that FatherPhilip had met with an accident. Margaret and Sir Everard Crowleighhad not yet returned, and messengers were even then, by thechamberlain's commands, preparing to go out to secure aid."'Tis a sad mishap, my lady," said that functionary, as Dorothyentered. "That stupid old horse of his threw him against a tree, andwe cannot find Sir Benedict anywhere; the poor father is bleedingto death. He's dying, my lady, dying; what will the baron do if hereturn?""Hush! Thomas, of course he will return.""May the blessed Virgin take pity on us," pursued the wretched man,"there is an evil spirit o'er the place. Someone is working a spellagainst us.""Where is the father?" asked Manners abruptly."He lies in the chaplain's room; I can hear him groaning now. Thesaints look down in----"Dorothy passed on, heeding not the continued invocations which the oldman made to all the saints in the calendar, and led her lover into thelittle room in which the unfortunate priest lay.The portly form of Father Philip lay stretched at full length upon awooden bench, and the room resounded with his painful groans. As theyapproached nearer to him they could see the fearful injuries he hadreceived; and the continued reiteration of the sufferer that he wasabout to die needed no other confirmation than a glance at his paleface, upon which the mark of death was plainly written.Father Philip, despite his faults, was universally beloved in theneighbourhood--by the poor for the bounty he dispensed at the gatesfrom the well-stocked larder of the knight; by the rich because hewas by far the best tale-teller of the district, and the success of afeast at which he was present was at once assured; and by the childrengenerally, for the confections and little silver pence he bestowedupon them, along with his kind word and cheery smile, in a mostliberal manner.At Haddon he was a prime favourite with all alike. He had entered theservice of the Vernons soon after the monasteries were dissolved, inthe time of Henry VIII., and had grown old in his office. Throughoutthe critical and changeful reigns of Edward and Mary, as well as theearly years of Elizabeth's time, he had, in spite of all the attemptsmade to oust him, retained his position as confessor to the family andpriest of the chapel at Haddon, and, as he had christened Margaret, hewas looking forward with pleasurable expectancy to the occasion whenhe would be called upon to marry her also.Leaving Dorothy standing on the threshold of the doorway, Mannersadvanced to the injured man's side, and endeavoured to sooth him byinstilling into his mind a ray of hope."O, Dorothy," gasped the priest, disregarding the words of hiswould-be comforter, "I am dying, dying like a dog. O, for some ofDame Durden's simples now. For the blessed Virgin's sake fetch SirBenedict. O, dear! O, dear!" and he sank back with a groan.Dorothy turned, and with a fast-beating heart hastened to deliver thecaptive knight, while her lover endeavoured to staunch the flow ofblood by binding the wound tightly up in strips of cloth.By dint of much shaking and shouting cousin Benedict was at lastroused from his drunken sleep, and also at last was made to understandsomewhat of the exigencies of the case for which his aid was needed."I will come soon," he exclaimed, in answer to Dorothy's entreaties."You must come now!" she replied, in a peremptory tone, which admittedof no prevarication."Where is the wine?" he asked, as he rubbed his eyes and glancedaround; "why, this is the kitchen.""Come along, Benedict; Father Philip is dying, I tell you. Do youunderstand?"Benedict a Woode stood up as still as he was able, and rubbed off aquantity of the salt which tenaciously adhered to his garments, then,noticing for the first time that he was in the great salt trough, heexclaimed in a tone of great surprise, "What! have I been here?""You have," she answered severely, "but why do you not come andsuccour Father Philip? He is bleeding to death, while you, who arestaying here, might help him."As the knight rapidly collected his scattered senses, he becamemore and more ashamed of himself; and now, clambering out of hisignominious confinement, with bowed head and tottering feet he humblyfollowed his fair companion across the yard. Not even the giganticvat, which was still steaming from a recent brew, the pungent odourof which could be plainly scented, induced him to alter his course; hemeekly entered the room at Dorothy's heels.Whatever effects of his recent indulgence remained with him before heentered the room, they were quickly dispelled as he beheld thepallid countenance of his friend, and falling down upon his knees, hescrutinised the injuries the venerable father had received.A brief examination satisfied Benedict that, unskilled as he was, thecase was entirely beyond his power, and he knew not what to do. Heunloosened the bandages which Manners had made, and let the alreadyover-bled man bleed still more; and then, bethinking himself ofsummoning superior aid, he hastily concocted a dose of simples,which the sufferer could with difficulty be prevailed upon to take,despatched a mounted messenger to Derby, and sat himself down at thefoot of the bench to await the course of events.The effect produced by the dose was evidently what Benedict hadwished, and for a long time the sufferer was far more quiet."O, Benedict," he feebly exclaimed, "my head, my head!""Well, it will be better soon.""Nay, I know I'm dying; 'twas a fatal fall, and I cannot shrivemyself."Benedict saw that his patient was getting excited, and he mixedanother draught, which the father absolutely refused to take."Oh, dear, I'm dying, dying," he gasped."Tut, man! rubbish. There's life enough left yet in you. We shall beout together again in a day or two.""Send for another brother," pursued the unfortunate man. "I am dying;my end has come, and I know it.""Tut, man!" returned the knight, "I tell you you will be better soon.""A witch told me I should die like this," continued the fatherobstinately, "and the time has come. I am too old to survive it now.""Go to sleep, father," interrupted Manners, "you ought not to talknow; you want rest.""Yes, sleep," assented a Woode."I cannot, I am dying," he gasped; and he groaned in agony again andagain."Father Philip," interposed Dorothy, "you must rest yourself. MasterManners is a soldier and has seen many hurt like you, and even worse;you must do his bidding an you would get well again.""What in the name of faith does all this mean?" asked Margaret, as shestepped into the room. "What is all this stir and commotion about?""I am dying, Margaret," repeated the confessor, as he gasped for verybreath. "I thought to marry thee, my daughter, but now it is deniedme. You will pray for the repose of the soul of Father Philip, willyou not?" he inquired, looking up into her face as she bent over him."When you are dead, yes," she replied, "but not until.""Don't talk to him, Mistress Margaret," said Manners; "he will onlyinjure himself by talking in return. I have enjoined quietness, but hewill take no heed. He ought to refresh himself by quietness, and sleepif possible, does he not; is not that correct, Everard?""Aye, it is indeed,""I shall be dead soon, Margaret, and--""Go to sleep, man, or at least lie still," growled a Woode. "What isthe use of all my care and simples if you won't do as I order you?""And you will ask the baron to forgive an old man's follies,Margaret?" slowly pursued the father, between the gasps, quiteheedless of the counsel given him to remain silent."I'll stop this," Sir Benedict broke in savagely, as he proceeded totie the bandages on afresh. "Father Philip, you shall be silent, ordie you must. That's better," he exclaimed, as his patient fell backunconscious. "He will, perforce, be quiet now awhile, and we maysafely remove him to his room.""Is he badly hurt, think you?" asked Margaret."I don't think he will ever get better again," Benedict gravelyreplied; "he is old, and it is a terrible wound.""Neither do I think he will weather it," added Crowleigh; "I have seenmen hurt like that before, fair Mistress Margaret, and we soldierssoon recognise the mark of death."Slowly and with great care the poor father was carried into the hall,and as soon as he was laid upon his bed, seeing that there wereno signs of returning consciousness, Margaret and Dorothy quietlyretired."Meg," exclaimed the younger sister, with glistening eyes, as they satin cheerless solitude before the blazing logs in their own room, "Ihave something to tell thee, and I shall mayhap want your aid ere Ihave done."She stopped short, to see if her sister had guessed her secret, but itwas apparently undiscovered, so she went on."I don't expect Lady Maude will be very willing; she always opposesus, does she not?""Sometimes," said Margaret drily."He is not so rich as De la Zouch," pursued Dorothy, "so I don't thinkshe will agree to it at first.""To what? What do you mean? Father Philip's accident has turned yourhead, I verily believe," replied her sister, as a terrible suspicionof the truth flashed into her imagination."Nay, Meg, dear, listen. I have plighted my troth to-night."Margaret jumped from her seat as if stung, and her face turned lividwith anger."What!" she exclaimed, "you have dared to plight your troth to MasterManners?""To John Manners, yes."Her voice was quiet and her bearing firm, nor was she half so agitatedas her sister, a fact which Margaret was slow to understand."Speak fair, Dorothy," she said, as she tried to persuade herself thatshe had misunderstood her meaning. "None of your riddles for me. Youare joking, surely.""Nay, I am in earnest, Meg. Ask him yourself; he will tell you whetherI was joking an hour ago. De la Zouch knows I would perish ratherthan be his countess. I told him so myself. And oh! Meg, dear, I am sohappy now, for I love John Manners so very, very much.""'Tis a sad night's work for _you_", burst out Margaret. "What righthave you, prithee, to make arrangements such as these? You are to bebetrothed to a brother of Sir Thomas Stanley. Edward is coming fromthe Isle of Man within a month to arrange it all, and a nice affairhave you made it with your forwardness.""Edward Stanley?" echoed Doll, in blank dismay."Yes, surely.""Never," she replied, decisively; "I will have none of him, nor couldI if I would. I am betrothed already.""You foolish child," returned Margaret. I must rate this MasterManners for his presumption. Sir Thomas will have talked the matterover with your father ere now, as they journeyed up to London.""It will be of no use even if he has. John Manners has my pledge, andI shall keep it with him, too.""Tut, child, this is idle talk. By now the matter is all arrangedfor you, and very thankful ought you to be. If Master Manners is agentleman----""He _is_ a gentleman.""He will think no more about you, then, after he knows the facts,"said Margaret sharply, and passing out of the room she left Dorothyalone to her tears, while she tried to discover the happy esquire togive him a piece of her mind.CHAPTER XIV.AN UNPLEASANT NIGHT.  But justice though her dome she doe prolong,  Yet at the last she will her own cause right.  SPENSER.When the landlord of the Cock Tavern thoughtlessly gave his prisonerinto the custody of the ostler he put Edmund Wynne in the way of theonly piece of good fortune which fell to his share on that unluckyday.No sooner did the two conspirators find themselves alone than Edmundbegan to implore his companion to set him at liberty, offering largeprospective bribes for freedom; but quickly perceiving that his keeperwas inexorable, he turned his attention to the best possible provisionfor the safety of those who had embarked on the expedition along withhim.It was patent to both that for the meeting of Edmund's associatesto take place, as had been arranged just previously, would now onlyinvolve them all in one common ruin; and arrangements were accordinglymade for them to be warned of the danger their presence would incur.The conference, however, was prematurely ended by the advent ofthe minions of the law, who, for once in a way, were prompt in theexecution of their duty, and in a very short space of time Edmundfound himself securely lodged within the precincts of Fleet MarketGaol.Little ceremony was shown him at his new resting-place, for no soonerhad the outer doors of the prison closed upon him than he was rapidlydragged forward across the courtyard and thrust into a dimly-lighted,evil-smelling room, the very appearance of which, with itsstrongly-barred windows high up in the wall, and the massive studdeddoor which was closed and double locked upon him almost before he hadentered the room, struck a feeling of shrinking terror deeply intothe prisoner's heart. He sank disconsolately down upon the cold stonebench just beside the door, and placing his elbows upon his knees, hepropped his head up between his hands, and peering into the dimnessbitterly bewailed his fate.He was startled from the train of thought into which he hadunconsciously fallen by hearing a sound not far from him. He raisedhis head and rubbed his eyes, half expecting to be confronted by aspectral visitor; but not being able to distinguish anything in thedeep gloom to which his eyes were not yet accustomed, he dismissedthat theory, and ascribed the noise to the rats."Rats, ugh!" he exclaimed, and he lowered his head down again, feelinga trifle less dejected because of the trivial interruption which hadfor the moment excited him, and changed his dismal channel into whichhis thoughts had flown."Who says rats?" exclaimed a voice in tremulous tones, evidently fromthe corner of the room.Edmund's head was upraised in a moment. His hair stood on end, for, ashe hastily glanced around, his eye lighted upon a form enshrouded inwhite. He was convinced that he was at last confronted by one of theghostly fraternity, of whose existence he was a firm believer; andhastily springing from his seat, he retreated as far as he could inthe opposite direction.To his terror the figure rose up at the same time, and advancingtowards him, frantically waving its arms, and repeating the wordsEdmund had just uttered. He was in a frenzy of despair, and rushingto the door, as the spectre had come up to him, he had made anineffectual effort to open it, and was busily engaged in kicking itsstout timbers to attract the attention of the gaolers.All this took but a moment, but it was a terrible time to Edmund, andhe found himself, in spite of his efforts, completely nonplussed bythe unearthly foe beside him."Rats, who says rats?" piped the figure again in its shrill, thinvoice. "Where are they?"For answer Edmund turned round, and in his desperation lunged out withhis foot towards his persecutor. It struck something solid, and toEdmund's intense relief the spectre limped away with a howl of painjust as the key turned in the lock outside.A moment later the door swung slowly back upon its creaking hinges,admitting the gaoler, and, at the same time a flood of light, whichdisclosed to view the form of a haggard man writhing in pain upon thewooden bed, sparsely covered with straw, in the very corner of theroom."Here's a pretty pickle," quoth the new comer, as he stood upon thethreshold of the door. "Which of you made all the din? Halloa, whyPeter," he added, as he stepped up to the side of the bed and gazedupon the emaciated form of an old and well-known inmate of the Hut,"what does all this portend?"No sooner had he stepped into the room than Edmund, seeing the doorwayclear, bolted out on an ill-timed venture of escape. He rushedalong the passage, hotly pursued by his custodian, and ran withoutinterruption into the yard; but here, alas, he was at bay. It was notthe same yard through which he had entered so shortly before, and hecould find no way of exit. It was futile to attempt anything further,and, discovering this unwelcome fact, he passively yielded himself up,and was rewarded for so doing by receiving sundry cuffs and jerks fromhis captors, who carried him straightway before the governor.There are some people in the world who seem to have been born under alucky star. Everything upon which their hands are laid at once turnsinto gold; all their ventures are successful, or if they have a slightmishap it is more than compensated for directly afterwards by a grandsuccess. Fortune is never weary of smiling upon them; they are herprime favourites, and she marks her approval by heaping favours uponthem in a most indiscriminate and prodigal manner. Upon others shecontinually frowns. All their efforts uniformly bring back a plentifulharvest of disappointment. Their labour is ever in vain, they are leftto languish in misery and to repine over the illusion which temptedthem with a feigned promise of success ever nearer and nearer to ruin.Edmund was one of these last, and this was the more inexplicable bothto himself and a certain number of his friends, inasmuch as he, beingan astrologer, had discovered that he was born under a lucky star.His interview with the governor was short, but decisive. The gaolerstated the case against him, adding to the facts here and thereto embellish his story; and in a very short space of time he foundhimself manacled with heavy chains, which fastened him down to thefloor of the damp cell into which he had been thrust.At the Cock Tavern Sir George was ill at ease when he retired to restthat night. His slumber was broken, and when he slept it was only todream of his trial on the morrow. Hobgoblins were judges, and legionsof little imps bore witness against him. Old Dame Durden rose up fromher grave on purpose to bear witness against him in person, and as, inhis vision, he saw her stretch out her long, bony arms towards him, hefelt her cold, clammy hand upon his head, and awoke to find himself ina cold perspiration.He attempted to quieten his fears, and tried to reassure himself, and,having succeeded in some degree in doing this, he fell asleep again.It was a vain search for rest. This time a myriad of hostile pygmieswere dragging him down into a bottomless pit. They tugged, and pushed,and danced upon his helpless body, and laughed in spiteful glee as hedescended further and further into the dread abyss.He rose at cock-crow, unrefreshed both in body and mind, and,descending into the lower regions, he paced abstractedly through eachtenantless room in turn.He found it, however, a forlorn and cheerless way of killing the time.Everything seemed dead; not a sign of life was visible. The rooms weredesolate, and looked the worst, while the fire grate, empty save for afew dead ashes, seemed but a picture of his own misery, and instead ofyielding him even a grain of comfort, its bars, appeared to grin uponhim with solid defiance. Everything seemed comfortless in the extreme,and as the melancholy train of thought into which he had fallen wasin no wise cheered by this manner of proceeding, he passed into thelibrary, which seemed least cheerless of all, and sat himself down.Still he could not enliven himself nor shake off the gloomy feelingwhich had settled upon him; all around was perfectly still, and thevery silence palled upon his fancy. It was, he imagined, the calmbefore the storm; the tempest would be raging round him soon in allits fury; and moving the empty horn cups aside--the relics of thenight's carousal--he reached down a volume from the thinly-populatedbookshelf, hoping to calm his excited feelings by arousing an interestwhich might for a time distract his attention from the forthcomingtrial. It was a book of poems, and with a contemptuous "tush!" heimpatiently replaced it upon its shelf, and sank down into his seatand fell into a fitful doze, only to be tormented afresh by hosts ofenemies, each of whom was eager to destroy him, while he could onlylook on in dismay and witness his own fall.Sir George was no light weight, and under the pressure of his bodythe table was gradually pushed further and further away from the benchupon the smoothly polished boards, until at length it failed to offerhim any support and he was suddenly awakened by falling heavily uponthe floor.Half dazed by the fall, and still uncertain whether he were awake orasleep, the good knight rubbed his eyes and looked around. He heaveda sigh of relief to find that he was yet alive, for he had at firstimagined that the furies had succeeded in encompassing his ruin. Heran his fingers through his iron-grey locks of dishevelled hair, andcomprehending that he was seated upon the floor, he made an effort torise.As he placed his hand upon the floor it touched something whichyielded to the pressure. Involuntarily he drew it back and placedhimself instinctively in an attitude of defence. He hated verminof every kind, and this he instantly resolved was a rodent of somedescription.His first hurried glance showed him that he was mistaken. It was butan innocent roll of paper, and laughing at his fears, he picked it up,and placing it upon the table, regained his seat.He turned it over, but there was no superscription on its exterior tooffer any clue as to its owner, and taking it with him to the window,he pushed the lattice open and removed the shutter. The dial pointedto six, and the sun had risen. He peered closely into the roll heheld in his hand, and pressing the packet slightly open, he slowlydeciphered the writing. It was that of a lawyer. The first word heencountered was his own name, and brushing all scruples hastily aside,the baron burst the package open, and with little compunction sat downto peruse its contents.It took the knight, who was no fluent scholar, some considerable timeto read it through, and when, after the exercise of much patience,he had reached the end, the legal terms, which were so profuselyemployed, so baffled his simple understanding that he had decidedlyfailed to grasp its true intent. Of one thing, however, and only one,was he perfectly sure, and that was that he had come across the nameof Mary Burden and Nathan Grene several times in close connectionwith his own; but what heightened his surprise and added to hisdiscomfiture was that the name of Sir Ronald Bury also appeared.In this predicament he bethought himself of seeking aid to unravel themystery, and he hastened up to arouse his companion.Sir Thomas was dressed, and he met the baron at the top of thestairs--much to their mutual surprise."Good morrow, Thomas," exclaimed the baron, "I had come to awakenthee; see here!" and holding up the document he had discovered, hedragged the heir to the Derby estates downstairs without utteringanother word or allowing any time for explanations."Read that," he said, as soon as they were seated.Sir Thomas took the roll from the other's hand, and after asuperficial scrutiny he was soon deeply engrossed in carrying outthe command, while Sir George leaned his elbows upon the table andcarefully studied the changing emotions which followed each other inrapid succession upon the young man's face.Sir Thomas Stanley read it through twice, and then carefully foldingit up, he gave the baron a prolonged inquiring look."Well," exclaimed Sir George, "you have read it?""I have.""Is it important?""Assuredly it is. What have you done in the matter?""Naught, save that I have shown it thee.""Is that all, Sir George?""All! yes. Why?""It is valuable; where did you get it?""I found it upon the floor under the table. What is it, though?""Show me your summons first. You have discovered information, Ibelieve, which will tide you safely over the trial.""Eh!" ejaculated the old knight, dropping the bulky summons upon thetable; "found what?"Sir Thomas returned no answer to the query, for, leaving his companionto grasp the importance of the words he had just uttered, he spreadout the two documents side by side upon the table and busied himselfin comparing them together.CHAPTER XV.SIR GEORGE AT WESTMINSTER.  Go, let the treacherous throw their darts   And sore the good malign  Perjure their conscience, stain their hearts,   To gain their foul design.  Yet shall right triumph at the end;  And virtue fortune shall defend.  ANON.For some time the two noblemen sat in silence, but at length SirThomas Stanley looked up and gave the baron some very pleasant news."You are safe," he said. "You need no longer fear this Nathan Grene,nor Sir Ronald Bury, nor anybody else for the matter of that; you areperfectly safe."Sir George Vernon simply opened his eyes and his mouth wide in sheersurprise, and seeing that he made no attempt to speak, Sir Thomasproceeded."This is a letter from Grene's own counsel. It is of the utmostimportance. Nathan Grene must have been here yesterday.""What! at the inn here? This very inn?""Aye! and in this very room. Here is his signature, dated yesterday.Maybe he is above even now.""Like enough," said the baron fiercely, and he looked as if he wouldlike to search each separate chamber in the house there and then."Listen," said Stanley, "this is what the lawyer says: 'I am doubtfulif, after all, the prosecution will not fall through. The summons wasissued by your direction against "The King of the Peak," whereas itought to have read "Sir George Vernon." Warder, who, I hear, is theagent of the Vernon family, will surely recognise this, and if thebaron refuses to answer the title contained in the summons, then ourcase will fall to the ground. We must hope for the best, as we can dono more. It is too late to rectify the error now.'""Here," said Sir Thomas, looking up, "the counsellor stops; but ourfriend Grene has added a few notes of his own, evidently directions tosome of his friends.""Go on, then," commanded Sir George impetuously."'We must get Warder out of the way till the trial is over,' hewrites. 'The ostler here, who brings this message to thee, is in ourconfidence, and may be trusted. Meet as arranged to-night. If we failat the trial we will have our revenge elsewhere. I am in danger, andmay not meet you yet, but follow Sir Ronald and he will reward you.'"He stopped reading, for while they had been thus together thehousehold had become astir, and it was evident that someone was aboutto enter the room in which they were seated.His conjecture was right, for barely had he paused ere the door waspushed open, and the ostler stepped quickly in, startled indeed tofind the library already occupied. He started to retire, but the baroncalled him back."Come hither, sirrah," he cried, regardless of his friend's wisercounsel to desist.Hugh unwillingly returned."Do you know that?" Sir George exclaimed, holding up the packet he haddiscovered.Hugh had come purposely to seek it, but deeming it unwise to admitthe fact, he boldly answered in the negative. "That will do," said theyounger knight quietly; "you can depart."Again he started to go, but again Sir George called him back."Read it," he said peremptorily, and he thrust the parchment into theostler's hands."I cannot read," he replied; but suddenly bethinking himself that hewas implicated by the written evidence, he quickly changed his mind,and eagerly snatching the document from the baron, he hastened out ofthe room and turned the lock sharply upon the wonder-stricken knights.No time was to be lost; Hugh knew their knocking would soon be heard,and that before long they would be released, when there would behue and cry after him; so, rapidly catching up a few of his ownthings--and he had few of his own handy enough to take--and addinga few convenient valuables belonging to his master to pay for hisservices, he quickly passed out of the house and sped on his way tojoin the confederates of Edmund Wynne.Edmund, too, had passed a sleepless night. At first he had attemptedto burst his chains asunder, but soon realising the utter uselessnessof such conduct, and being also covered with bruises, he desisted andpassed the next hour in calling out for relief. No relief came; onlythe mice and the insects heard his cries, and the former affrighted,sought seclusion in their holes, leaving the latter to survey insilent surprise the new comer who had intruded upon their privacy.Wearied out, he gave over shouting at last, and lay upon the floor ofhis damp cell, tossing uneasily about from side to side. The sun set;the dark night came and went; the morning sun arose, and yet he knewit not. It was too dark for him to see anything, for even no ray oflight found its way inside to gladden the heart of the prisoner. Hewas altogether shut off from the world; he was, for the time being, toall intents and purposes, buried alive.At length, after a night of abject misery, which seemed as if it neverwould end, he heard the key turned in the lock, and in another momentthe gaoler entered. He fastened Edmund's hands securely behind hisback, and unlocking the fetters he bade him follow him to the court.The landlord of the Cock Tavern was already there, much enraged at theloss of his property and the conduct of his servant, which he laid tothe charge of the prisoner. In a very short space of time Edmund Wynnewas convicted as a vagabond, and he listened akin to relief as theJudge sentenced him to be kept in the stocks for the rest of the dayand threatened him with a whipping in the pillory if he were broughtbefore him on a second occasion. Much to the annoyance of theinnkeeper, the attempt to connect the prisoner with the loss of hisproperty and the ostler's flight entirely broke down; and disgustedwith everybody and everything, the good man returned to the tavern tosmile with counterfeited pleasure at his customers, and to vent hisrage upon the servants who were left him.The loss of the paper somewhat disconcerted Sir George Vernon, andafter the disappearance of the ostler he sat for a minute or two quitedumbfounded, gazing in speechless surprise at the closed door. Hiscompanion was a man of action, however, and undaunted by finding thedoor locked, he hastened to the window, and would have attempted anexit there had it not been that the windows were too narrow for such aprocedure.Baffled again, but in nowise disheartened, he began to thunder at thedoor, and with the assistance of Sir George Vernon he soon made noiseenough to attract attention.The first to hear them was the chambermaid, and she, very naturallysuspecting that thieves were in the room, ran out into the yard andintimated as much, at the top of her voice, to all the neighbours.Meanwhile the knocking continued, and was, if anything, more vigorousthan before. Startled by such an unusual din, the worthy Bonifaceawoke from his slumbers, and, in no very enviable frame of mind, setoff, poker in hand, to summon aid. Help soon came, and, armed withpokers, brooms, and pitchforks, the door was quickly broken openand the gallant company rushed in, knocking Sir George over as theyentered.In the pause that followed the first rush the mistake was discovered,and the situation was explained. The landlord was profuse in hisapologies, the more so as he caught the look of anger in the baron'seye, but peace being quickly made, he rewarded his followers andsallied out to discover the whereabouts of his delinquent servant,breathing out dire threatenings against him. He searched in vain, andafter a thorough examination, returned in ill mood to partake of thefirst meal of the day, and to discover the extent of his losses ere heproceeded to appear against the unfortunate Edmund Wynne.As the baron and Sir Thomas rode together to Westminster a few hourslater, it was with spirits considerably higher than they could haveexpected four-and-twenty hours earlier. Sir George had resumed hishaughty bearing, but he was, in truth, though he would never haveconfessed it, more than a trifle nervous. At last the great JusticeHall was reached, and, with a parting injunction not to answer to thechallenge, Sir Thomas separated from him, passing in by one door whilethe baron entered by another.Sir George's nervous temperament was severely tried upon thisoccasion, for he had a considerable time to wait, and he found nobetter plan of whiling it away than that of impatiently pacing upand down in the little room allotted to him; and he imagined himselfsuffering all sorts of horrible tortures.At last his turn came. The door opened; his name was called; andcomposing himself as well as he was able, he stepped into the crowdedhall with considerable dignity, accompanied by a pompous member of theCourt, and at once became the cynosure of all eyes.He stood impassively, casting his eyes around in search of Sir ThomasStanley, and curious to recognise as many as he could among the motleycrowd which had come to see him tried. During the time the charge wasbeing read, and just as he had discovered his companion in the throngstraight before him, he was challenged by the Clerk of the Crown toplead."King of the Peak," cried the officer of the law, "hold up thine hand.Thou art accused of the murder of Mary Durden, spinster. Art thouguilty or art thou not guilty?"Instinctively he held up his hand as directed, and in a bold andfearless voice which echoed along the passages answered, "_Notguilty_."As soon as he had uttered the words he remembered that he had donewrong, but it was too late to recall it now, and filled with nopleasant forebodings by learning that the one who had just stepped outof the place in which he had stood had been committed to the Tower, hewatched the swearing-in of the jury with stolid indifference.It was soon evident that something was wrong somewhere. The minionsof the court rushed hither and thither in the utmost haste; messagespassed from the Judge to the clerks who sat at the table below; andby-and-bye the fact leaked out that neither the prosecutor nor thewitnesses were in attendance."Nathan Grene," called the clerk, "stand forth." There was no answer."Nathan Grene," he repeated in a louder voice, "come forward andaccuse this man."The cry was taken up both inside the hall and without; but still noNathan Grene appeared, nor was he likely to, for at that time he wassitting securely in the stocks; the sport of every passer-by, andthe delight of some little mischievous urchins, who were amusingthemselves by pulling his hair and sprinkling him with dirty water,while he was powerless to defend himself in any way."Nathan Grene," exclaimed the Judge in tones of awful dignity, "youare called upon to support the charge of murder against the King ofthe Peak; a charge made by yourself. This is the last time thou wiltbe summoned to answer, and unless you now appear, or afterwards showgood, full, and sufficient cause for thine absence, the law shall turnits course on thee."The long silence which followed this speech was broken only by theJudge, who rose again from his seat, and turning to Sir George toldhim he was free; and amid the congratulations of his friends and theconcealed disappointment of his enemies, he passed triumphantly out ofthe hall which had proved so fatal to so many of the nobility beforehim, as it has also done since.CHAPTER XVI.A NIGHT ADVENTURE.  But whatsoe'er his crime, than such a cave  A worse imprisonment he could not have.         *       *       *       *       *  But here a roaring torrent bids you stand.  Forcing you climb a rock on the right hand,  Which, hanging penthouse-like, does overlook  The dreadful channel of the rapid brook.  Over this dangerous precipice you crawl,  Lost if you slip, for if you slip you fall.  WONDERS OF THE PEAK, 1725.Elated by their success, the two noblemen at once left London andhastened on towards Haddon, and leaving the city behind them withfew regrets, they arrived at Derby late in the afternoon of the dayfollowing the trial.It was Sir Thomas Stanley's time to be impatient now He was anxiousto behold Margaret again, and leaving the baron behind him to settlea few matters of business he rode off upon a fresh horse to carry thegood news to the Hall, and to herald the approach of the knight.John Manners was keeping Dorothy company on the top of the Eagle Towerwhen Sir Thomas appeared in sight. A "look out" had been on the watchfor the last three days, waiting to announce the approach of theexpected messenger from London, and each night a beacon fire had beenlighted, that in the darkness he might not pass by. But no messengercame, and anxiety was beginning to make itself apparent on more facesthan one when the two lovers espied the fast-approaching rider, andproclaimed the news to the household below.Margaret soon joined them company. She was burning with impatience toread the long-expected missive and she eagerly watched the horsemandraw nearer who was bringing her tidings from her betrothed."See Meg," exclaimed the overjoyed Dorothy, "thither he comes!" andshe pointed to a cloud of dust in the far distance, in the midst ofwhich might be seen every now and again the indistinct form of a horseand its rider."Maybe he will pass by," exclaimed Manners."Not he!" scornfully replied Margaret, "he will none pass by. Noneother than a messenger to Haddon would ride like that. The steed ishard put to it; surely it is near its journey's end.""Well, we shall soon see," interposed Doll, "he is making good speed."It was as Dorothy said. Even while they had been talking, the riderhad considerably lessened the distance which separated him from theHall, and, had it not been for the dim twilight which was then slowlydeepening, they would have been enabled to distinguish more than theyhad already done."He rides well," said Margaret, more to herself than to either of theothers. "Methinks I know that ride.""'Tis like Crowleigh's," said Manners."But Sir Everard is with Father Philip. It cannot be him," returnedDorothy."There is but one man who bestrides a saddle in such a fashion,"exclaimed Margaret, as she carefully scanned the horseman. "But no! itcannot be so. I thought it was Sir----""Sir Thomas Stanley," exclaimed Dorothy, taking the words out of hersister's mouth."I thought it was he," she confessed; "and see," she added, raisingher voice, "it is Sir Thomas; I thought it was," and she left thelovers as she had found them, and hastened down, greatly excited,to meet her own beloved, and not without some feelings of dismay atseeing him return alone.Leaving the succeeding scene to be imagined rather than described, wewill hark back to Sir George at Derby.He accomplished his business more expeditiously than he hadanticipated, and in a very brief space of time started out ofthe town, hoping with a hope soon to be dispelled that he might,perchance, overtake Sir Thomas.Without a halt he arrived at Matlock at just about the same time ashis companion reached Haddon, and reining up his steed at the villageinn close by the churchyard, he alighted for a short rest and somerefreshment ere he finished what remained of his journey.He was well known here, and his peremptory commands were obeyed withthe utmost alacrity.His first enquiry was about Sir Thomas Stanley, and he learned to hissatisfaction that he had passed safely through there a good hour or sobefore."In good sooth, your lordship is surely going no further to-night,"exclaimed the host, as Sir George made the preliminary preparation forresuming his journey."Tut, man, why not? Of course I shall.""Your horse is stabled," responded the landlord; "surely you will notattempt to ride further to-night.""My horse stabled," thundered the baron, "I said not so; 'tis freshfrom Derby. Out with it, man, and let me away."The horse was quickly unstabled, and brought round to the tavern door,but the innkeeper was loth to let the good knight depart. It was athing he would not do for a trifle, and he feared for the safety ofthe baron."The roads are very bad," he exclaimed, as they stepped into thelittle passage together, "and it will be dark ere you reach the Hall,my lord. Had you not better change your mind?"The knight declined the request in the most emphatic manner, andplaced his foot upon the stirrup to mount."There be many rogues and footpads in the neighbourhood of late, andespecially to-day," pursued the other. "I have had as ill-looking acrew in my house to-day as I ever clapt eyes upon; I am sure they bodeno good."Nothing, however, could persuade Sir George to stay, and seeing thathis guest was obdurate, the host continued,"Stay awhile, Sir George, an' thou wilt, thou shalt at least have aman of mine to accompany thee. The neighbourhood is full of knaves oflate, and I like it not that thou should'st go alone."But the offer was lightly refused; and fearing nothing for his ownsafety, the old knight spurred his horse forward, and in a few momentswas lost to sight in the fast-settling gloom.Little time as he and Sir Thomas had lost in leaving London, and quickas they had been in reaching Derby, there had yet been those who hadbeen more expeditious than they.Upon the receipt of the unwelcome news which the ostler had brought tothem, Edmund Wynne's confederates at once departed from the city, andunder the leadership of Sir Ronald Bury hastened on, with few rests,to the wilds of Derbyshire, to perform the deed, still enshrouded inmystery, which they had been hired, if necessary, to perform.Blissfully unconscious of the trap into which he was rushing, andwholly contemptuous of the idea of being benighted, the lord of Haddonrode fearlessly on. The way was dark to be sure, but he knew it well,and what added to his confidence was the fact that he was right in thevery heart of his own possessions.He had barely ridden a couple of furlongs, though, before his horsebecame restive, and in response to a free application of both whip andspur only pricked up its ears and advanced in a more unsatisfactorymanner than before.Still suspecting nothing, the baron applied the whip more vigorously.He perceived, clearly enough, that his charger was frightened atsomething or other, and to inspire it with a little of his own couragehe started to whistle a lively tune which he had heard Dorothy playupon the spinet till he got it well by heart.The tune was never finished, for barely had he begun it when thebranch of a tree, which was hurled at him from the side of the road,completely unhorsed him and sent him rolling into the ditch on theother side.Before he could rise or place himself in any posture of defence hewas roughly seized, and in spite of his struggles was carried away ashelpless as a child, whilst to aggravate his position his eyes weretightly blindfolded."What does this mean?" he shouted out in desperation; but no onedeigned to answer."I am Sir George Vernon," he added stoutly, but if he had thought thatthis was information, or that his captors would be inclined toquake before this declaration of his rank and person, he was sorelymistaken, and the brief answer they returned soon convinced him on thepoint."We know it," they laughed; "we are no fools.""Nathan Grene," he passionately shouted, "you shall rue this day." Heno longer wondered now at the non-appearance of his adversary; he feltconfident that the recreant smith was there, and the thought of beingthus within his power goaded him into a frenzy of passion."Thou shalt live to rue this bitterly," he repeated, but before hecould say anything further his mouth was filled with grass, and inspite of his attempts to speak he could no longer succeed in makinghimself heard.How far he was being carried he knew not, nor yet did he know the way;and beyond making a few desultory attempts to disengage his netherlimbs from the vice-like grasp in which they were enclosed, the baronmade no further attempts to free himself.It was quite dark before they stopped, and when his bandages weretaken off he had only sufficient time to discover that they had haltedat the mouth of a cave before his captors seized hold of hisperson and unceremoniously pushed him in, sending, after a briefconsultation, one of their number after him to see that he made noeffort to escape."Where is Nathan Grene?" inquired the outraged nobleman, as soon as hefound himself at liberty; "I want to see him.""Happen you do!" replied his keeper, who was none other than theostler; "then, maybe, you will find him at London. You were nearenough to him in the stable loft; maybe he is out of the stocks againnow.""Don't talk with him," commanded an imperious voice from the exterior,"or he will be taking you unawares."The order was literally complied with, and to all his queriesthenceforward the baron could gain no reply. At length he gave up theattempt, and watched in sullen silence his captors kindle a fire justwithin the cavern mouth.He meditated a dash out, but the venture seemed to promise littlehope, and seeing, after a time, that the man had fallen asleep, heproceeded to explore his prison.It was a long cave, and there were many fissures and passagesbranching out on either side, but he found to his intense disgust thatinstead of leading out into the open they all terminated after a fewyards in a solid wall of rock.Nothing daunted by his successive disappointments, the lord of Haddoncarefully wound his way round the circuitous cavern path. He found itdifficult work, however, to walk in darkness in an unknown way, and hemade little progress until, suddenly remembering that the ostler hadcharge of the tinder and flint which his associates had thrown inafter kindling their fire, he stole back as quickly as he could tofetch it.He found everything exactly as it was when he left it. The ostler wasstill asleep and loudly snoring; the noisy gang beyond were cookingtheir evening meal, and without attracting their attention hesucceeded in gaining the coveted articles, and rapidly retreated withthem in his possession.He waited before obtaining a light, until a sharp bend in the cavesecured his position, and then, stooping down, he struck the flintand steel together and made a torch of his cravat. He was now able tohasten forward, and fearful lest his torch should burn away ere hehad effected his escape, he pushed quickly on, and soon reached thefarthest end.The cave, which had been gradually narrowing as Sir George advanced,instead of suddenly rising up into the ground above, or ending in anarrow opening, as the good knight had fervently hoped, terminatedin a deep chasm, and far down below there rushed a tumultuous stream.Even as he stopped short, startled by the discovery, a stone rolledover the brink, and after a pause of several seconds' duration theforlorn explorer was suddenly recalled to a sense of his position byhearing a faint splash in the deep waters far below.He turned round regretfully, and commenced to return, fully decided,unless he quickly discovered a way of escape, to attempt to surprisehis captors by rushing through their midst, trusting to the darknessof the night to favour his escape.He had not gone far before he discovered that his absence had beennoticed. The ostler must have awaked; the echoing cavern resoundedwith the imprecations of his companions, and their approachingfootsteps warned him that they were coming in search of him. Not amoment was to be lost, and espying a large shelving rock which juttedout from a side passage, Sir George Vernon hastily clambered up andextinguished his light. The mass of rock upon which he had takenrefuge was fairly flat, and he was able to maintain his position uponit; but he soon discovered that it would not be big enough to screenhim from view were the searchers to look in that direction. It was toolate to think of moving now, for his pursuers were close at hand; hecould even distinguish the reflection of their torches; there was onlyone course open for him, and that was to endeavour to squeeze throughthe narrow fissure at the end of the ledge on which he lay.A squeeze and a cut or two, a tug and a stifled groan; another squeezemore violent by far than the former one, and the portly baron rolledpanting through the jagged briar-covered little crevice, just as thelight of the searchers illuminated the place from which he had only amoment before released himself.Some painful moments elapsed ere he stopped rolling, and then itwas not until he found himself entangled in the strong but friendlyembrace of one of the tough blackberry bushes which were growingin profusion, and still continue to do so, on the hill sides ofDerbyshire. He had, in fact, found out a way of escape just as he hadabandoned all hope of doing so, and carefully extricating himself fromhis uncomfortable position, he pursued his way by Masson's shadowyheights, boiling over with rage against his ruffianly captors, andmade the best of his way to the nearest inn to secure a horse to carryhim home.CHAPTER XVII.A DALE ABBEY HERMIT.  Far in a wild, unknown to public view,  From youth to age, a reverend hermit grew;  The moss his bed, the cave his humble cell,  His food the fruits, his drink the crystal well;  Remote from man, with God he passed his days,  Prayer all his business, all his pleasure praise.  PARNELL.Sir George's first care upon his arrival at Haddon was to send off anumber of his retainers to capture, if possible, the gang which hadentrapped him; but after searching for nearly a couple of days theywere obliged to return and communicate their failure to their lord.The villains had all made off and left not a clue behind them.His next care was to calm the overwrought feelings of Lady Maude andhis daughters, to whom the suspense of the last few hours had beenpainful in the extreme; and then after he had refreshed his inner man,he retired to seek that repose for which he was so well prepared.Time sped on; the days soon passed into weeks, and the lovely springhad merged into a still more lovely summer. John Manners' visit hadcome to a close, and he was longing for an invitation for anothervisit and seeking to find some decent excuse for becoming aself-invited guest.At last, much to his relief, he received the long-wished-forinvitation. He and Crowleigh were invited together to one of thenumerous feasts of Haddon's hospitable Hall, and De la Zouch, whosewounds were now fast healing, was wishful that a reconciliation shouldtake place between them, and professed himself even anxious to makesome advances towards his late adversary.Without loss of time the two guests sped on their way at the appointedtime, and were amongst the very first of the visitors. Disappointment,however, awaited them. Father Philip was dying. The Derby leechhad done his best to restore the injured man, and although he hadsucceeded in prolonging the patient's life for a little while, allhis efforts to save the unfortunate confessor failed, and seeing thefather suddenly begin to sink, he had, the night before John Mannersarrived, given up all hope of saving his life, and announced that theend was nigh at hand.Under these circumstances mounted messengers were at once despatchedto inform the invited guests that it had been found necessary topostpone the feast, and asking them to defer their visit until theyshould hear again from Haddon. This, in almost every other instance,had succeeded in staying the visitors; but Manners and Crowleigh hadstarted at the break of day, and were well on their way before themessenger had found his way to stop them.A little manoeuvring on Dorothy's part gained, to Margaret's qualifieddelight, an invitation for them to stay from no less a personage thanthe dying man himself. Father Philip had taken kindly to Crowleighfrom the first, and was grateful to him for the skill and patience hehad bestowed upon him on his previous visit, and he was ready enoughto accede to any request, whatever it might be, that his Dorothy, hisbeloved Dorothy, thought well to ask.Not a brother of the cloth could be found to take the father's place,and this loss proved exceedingly awkward to all at Haddon at thisjuncture.The Reformation had come in with so much vigour; the enactmentsagainst the Roman Catholics were so stringent, that not even anotherpriest could be found to shrive him. The pendulum of fortune hadindeed swung back again with a vengeance. From one extreme thereligious laws had gone to the other; and so it befell that thefather, to his exceeding great regret, found himself dying with nevera minister of his own persuasion near at hand.Crowleigh again came to his relief. He had a friend, a staunchCatholic who had been expelled from Oxford University soon afterElizabeth's accession on account of his strong religious views. He hadturned monk, and, during the recent pitiless times, it had frequentlyfallen to Sir Everard's lot to befriend him. He was at this time inhiding at no great distance from Crowleigh's estate, and the latterhad sufficient confidence in his friend's willingness to come topromise Sir George Vernon that he would fetch him.The offer was gladly accepted. Without any delay the two best horsesin the stable were saddled, and within a very short space of timeboth horses and rider were well started on their way towards thesouth-western boundary of the shire.Nicholas Bury had for two years lived the life of a hermit. In hisseclusion he had become happy, and though the reverence was denied himwhich the early hermits had accustomed themselves to receive, yet hewas at least unmolested, and thanks to Sir Everard, who ever assistedhim in time of need, he was never left to want for the few necessariesof life that he required.Sir Everard Crowleigh rode hard all the morning, and stopping on hiserrand but once--to partake of a light meal--he arrived at the abodeof his friend as the twilight put forth its gentle mask of gloom.Deepdale was an attractive spot, but it was not the natural beauty ofthe scene which had first attracted the eyes of Nicholas Bury so muchas the facilities it offered for his purpose. Centuries before apious Derby baker had retired to the self-same spot, and besides thishallowed memory there was the still more substantial cell to handwhich the saintly old recluse had left behind him.This, cut out of the solid rock, and situated at the summit of a deepdeclivity, was overgrown by a curtain of ivy, which not only screenedits tenant from the wintry winds, but also hid his retreat fromthe gaze of the innocent passer-by. The Abbey, hard by, hadbeen dismantled before Nicholas knew it, but it was a source ofgratification to him to be so near so sacred a building, and ateventide he would wander fondly about its walls and murmur his vespersto himself.Sir Everard paused before entering upon the solitude of his friend,and would fain have rested his weary limbs on the mossy banks ofthe slope, but remembering how nearly Father Philip was to death heoverruled his feelings, and, brushing through the ivy covering of thedoorway, he entered quietly into the sanctum of the hermit.Nicholas was evidently deeply engaged in his devotions, for he waskneeling before the little altar of his cell, and, catching somewhatof the spirit of reverence, Everard paused upon the threshold, lothto penetrate any further. The lamp gave but a fitful flickering light,hut the devotee heeded not; and, by-and-bye, as the knight stoodspellbound, the wick sputtered in the oil, and making a final effortthe flame shot up for a moment with a brilliant glare and then diedslowly out, leaving nothing but a fragment of smouldering wick and asickly odour to attest its presence.Crowleigh roused himself as it died away, and came to the resolutionthat it was high time to announce his presence; and failing todistinguish any signs to intimate that his friend's prayers werenearing conclusion he advanced towards him.He had scarcely moved a step when he started back with horror. Therewas little enough light entered within this solitary abode, but yetthere was quite enough to enable him to see curled up together upon abed of leaves a number of snakes of different kinds. His first impulsewas to rush out and escape, but bethinking himself of the defencelessposition of his friend, he picked up a huge stone and let it fall uponthem.Still Nicholas did not stir, and heedless of the badger, whichfiercely showed its teeth and looked as if it meditated an attack uponhim, Sir Everard strode softly up to his friend's side and tapped himlightly on the shoulder."Nicholas," he exclaimed.Nicholas returned no answer, and his friend stood dumbfounded. Surelythat pale face and that emaciated form could not belong to the oncesturdy companion, or--and he noticed that the eyes were closed; orelse--and he trembled at the bare idea--Nicholas Bury must be dead!He put out his hand and shook it gently, and he was speedily rewardedby seeing his friend open his eyes."Lie still, Leo," he commanded, addressing the badger.The faithful animal, which had regarded the intruder with markeddisfavour, rolled itself up again in obedience to the command, andremained in the corner watching the knight with glistening eyes."Nicholas," repeated Crowleigh, for he had not yet been noticed.Nicholas turned slowly round, as if his ears had not deceived him,but on seeing his friend and benefactor standing by his side, his facelighted up with pleasure, and he quickly arose."My good friend, Everard," he exclaimed, as he warmly shook theproffered hand, "thou art indeed a stranger here.""Aye, I have a mission to thee," he replied."A mission," the hermit echoed. Art thou, then, the bearer ofill-tidings to me? Is my safety jeopardised, or what? Tell me,Everard, let me know it all. I have done no man evil that I wotof--unless in these evil days it be wrong to visit the sick and theafflicted; but I am ready for aught, even though it were instantdeath.""Nay, Nicholas," returned his friend, "thou art in a gloomy strain.I am a messenger of peace; I bear good tidings to thee, not ill-news.Thou must away with me at once.""I cannot go; but see! my lamp is out. I must light it again. Yousee how indifferent I am," he apologetically exclaimed, "I even fallasleep over my prayers.""Ha! I perceive thou art over-weary; take my advice for the once, anddo not rise so soon, nor pray so long.""Ah, Everard, 'tis not that," replied the holy man; "I have not beento my poor couch since yester morning. I have been praying through thenight for the speedy restoration of our holy Church.""And see, whilst thou hast been sleeping I have saved thy life,"interjected Everard; "but I must tell thee on my journey. I would havethee accompany me back to Haddon.""My poor pets!" exclaimed the hermit sorrowfully, as he lifted up thestone; "they are all killed.""'Tis a case of death, I fear," pursued Crowleigh, referring to thefather's illness."I fear it is," replied the other, looking ruefully at his dead pets."Thou hast killed my companions, Everard.""Ugh! pretty companions, I trow," said the knight, scornfully; "but wemust hasten. I will acquaint thee with the whys and wherefores aswe go. Nay, never mind the lamp, thou can'st say adieu to that. Ourhorses are tethered to a tree below, and thou must shrive a friend whois at death's door--a priest. I have ridden throughout the livelongday to fetch thee. Art thou ready now?""What, so soon? This is sudden indeed.""Aye, man, so soon. Death tarries for no man, and, beshrew me, it willnot tarry for us either.""I must take Leo, then.""Very well, pick him up, but let us be off I pray.""This is _too_ sudden, Everard, indeed it is. I have many sick tovisit, and I would fain go to the monastery just once again, tobid----""There must be no buts about it, Nicholas," returned his friendquickly, "the father is dying, and the baron expects you.""Give me but an hour, then I will go with thee. 'Tis sad to breakaway from a spot hallowed by so many sacred memories, and at so shortwarning, too. I am loth to go, Everard, even now. There is no otherspot on earth like this to me.""'Tis a cold and cheerless home, truly," exclaimed the knight,sympathetically, "and I will find thee a far better one, Nicholas.See, I will give thee half-an-hour, and then you must bid adieu tothis place or I must return alone and leave thee."Nicholas submitted to the decision of his friend, and in less than thestipulated time they had both turned their backs upon the hospitableshelter which had been a home to the monk when every door seemed shutagainst him, and were on their way to Haddon.CHAPTER XVIII.THE CHAMBER OF DEATH.  Child, if it were thine error or thy crime,    I care no longer, being all unblest;  Wed whom thou wilt; but I am sick of time.    And I desire to rest.  TENNYSON.Haddon Hall was sighted by the two travellers just before mid-day, andlong before they reached it Manners had been despatched in great hasteto hasten them forward with the news that the poor father was almostat his last gasp.They needed not the urging, for they had ridden hard, almost without arest, and not only was Nicholas thoroughly wearied out by the unusualexertion of riding but the horses were sorely jaded too.In a few minutes they all three rode up to the doorway together, andleaving their steeds to Manners, Sir Everard Crowleigh took the priestto the sick man's chamber.Father Philip was reclining upon the well-cushioned couch when theyentered. His eyes were closed, but he was not asleep; he hadnot enjoyed the luxury of a sleep for days past, and the haggardexpression of his face, and the twitching muscles of his body,foretold only too truly that the end of the father was not very faraway.The sick man knew it, and was willing to escape from his agony assoon as he had received the proper consolation and preparation of hisreligion. His only fear was that he would not linger long enoughto receive it, but that he might his lips were even then moving inprayer.Dorothy was sitting by his bedside, and as Nicholas Bury steppedgently forward she silently arose, and, with a heart too full topermit her to speak, she offered him her hand as a token of welcome,and led him up to the chair upon which she had just been sitting.Her courtesy was acknowledged by a most profound bow, but, refusingthe seat she proffered him, Nicholas reached another for himself andsat down upon it by the side of the maiden.It was a long time since Nicholas had witnessed so much magnificencegathered together in one room, and tired by his long ride and soothedby the grateful odour of the incense which filled the room, and alsostruck by a feeling of reverential awe by the solemnity of thewhole scene, which readily appealed to his religious instincts, heremembered nothing of what had just transpired, but leaned his headupon his hand and fell into a reverie, such as he had allowed himselfto indulge in when alone in his solitary Deepdale cell."He is not asleep," said Dorothy, stretching forward and laying herhand upon his arm. "He has been waiting long for thee."Her voice startled Nicholas, who had become sublimely unconscious ofhis surroundings; and incoherently murmuring some remark, maybe theconclusion of one of his prayers, he turned round and fixed his gazeupon the form of the dying man."Reverend father," he exclaimed in a subdued and quiet voice, "I amhere to aid thee."Father Philip turned himself round with difficulty and faced thespeaker."Dorothy," he called."I am here, father," she replied, "I have never left thee.""Take it away from my eyes, child," he commanded.Father Philip never called her child except on rare occasions whenher conduct displeased him, and she would have felt hurt at theappellation now had it not been for the unusual circumstances of thecase. She looked inquiringly at him to fathom his meaning, but, seeingnothing to remove, she would have asked him what it was he meant, hadhe not interrupted her."Take it away, Dorothy," he repeated, "I cannot see.""Poor brother," exclaimed Nicholas, noticing the discomfiture. "I fearme thou art blind. There is naught to take away, save the film fromoff thine eyes.""Brother, did you say?" asked the dying man. "Did you say brother; areyou then the priest? Praise be to God; I shall die easy now," and heburied his face in the pillow and wept for joy."Let him lie as he is," whispered Nicholas; "he will be far easier so.Poor man, he is indeed at the portals of death.""The leech said so," replied the heart-broken Dorothy, and then for along time they sat motionless, watching with intense earnestness eachmovement of the dying man.The good father wept unrestrainedly. His whole frame quivered withemotion as the sobs escaped his breast; until, after a time, thesounds gradually and yet perceptibly grew weaker and fainter, andfinally died away altogether."He is dead!" sobbed Dorothy, after a long pause."Nay, see," replied her companion, "his bosom heaves, but the end isvery near. May my last hour be as calm as this," he added earnestly,as he gazed as the father."Amen, so be it, Nicholas Bury," said a voice from the region of thedoorway.The monk started at the sound of his name, but did not move; thetapers were burning before the altar, and the curtain was drawn, andhe failed to distinguish the features of the visitor.Dorothy, even through her ears, noticed that he was startled anddiscomposed, and she hastened to reassure him."No harm, no harm, good father; 'tis but Master John Manners," shesaid."You have not forgotten me, surely?" inquired Manners, steppingforward, and throwing the light upon his face.The priest gave a start of surprise as he recognised the visage of thenew comer."Forgotten a Rutland?" he exclaimed. "No, never! Right glad am I tomeet with thee again, but hush! This is the chamber of death. I willsee thee afterwards. The father moves, see."Father Philip endeavoured to turn himself over, but he was too weak tosucceed, and he fell back exhausted."Oh, dear," he groaned, "I am a sinful man.""So are we all, brother," returned Nicholas. "The best of us are verysinful.""Dorothy."Doll stood up and leaned over the bed."Give me your hand, my daughter."She placed her hands between the thin hands which the father held outfeebly to her, while the hot tears trickled down her face and fell inrapid succession upon the quilted coverlid beneath."Will you kiss me, Doll?" he asked. "I shall never ask aught of theeagain. Tell the baron," he slowly continued, addressing the priestnow, "tell him that I blessed her and told her yes."Dorothy bent down thoroughly heartbroken, and kissed the marble-likeforehead, dropping as she did a shower of tears upon his face."What is that, the holy water?" he asked, placing his finger upon oneof the drops."I could not help it, father," she sobbed aloud, "indeed I could not.They are tears, but I will wipe them off.""God bless thee, Doll, thou hast a tender heart. Nay, nay, leave themon I beseech thee, they shall be thy last gift to the old man; I willtake them with me into my grave."He paused, but Dorothy could not speak. She covered her face with herhands and wept on."May the Blessed Virgin ever be your friend," he continued, restinghis hand upon her head, "and may the saints protect thee. I havenaught to give thee, Doll, but thou shalt have my blessing. God blessthee, Doll, God bless thee and thy lover," and he sank back upon thebed completely exhausted.They sat motionless by his side for some minutes, only Dorothy's sobsand the sick man's broken sighs breaking upon the silence, until atlast Manners advanced, and taking the hand of his betrothed, led herunresistingly out into the garden.Nicholas sat, after their departure, until well into the night,watching by the bedside, before Father Philip opened his eyes again.Many inquirers had visited the room, but they had departed again, and,though they knew it not, they had looked for the last time upon thefamiliar form of the confessor, ere he breathed his last.As the morrow dawned the old man passed away, happy, inasmuch asNicholas had afforded him the last rites of his religion. As thetwilight descended the chapel bell rung out upon the stillness of theeventide. It was the Sabbath, but amid the sorrow and the gloom whichreigned around, this fact had been well-nigh forgotten.The summer breeze carried the sound a long way along the dale. Ithad not been heard since the day of Father Philip's accident, and itssound had been sorely missed.But now it was no longer the herald of peace, nor the token of joy,for the villagers knew full well that it was tolling the knell ofthe departed priest, and their hearts were heavy with sorrow for thefriend they knew had just passed away.The chapel was open. It was free for the once to as many as couldenter, and there were few around who did not wish to show respect tothe man who had surely, in one way or another, proved himself theirfriend.The limited number that the chapel could accommodate took their placeslong before the vesper bell stopped ringing, and when Sir George camein, bringing in with him the Lady Maude, and followed by his daughtersand the two guests, there was a large concourse of disappointedworshippers outside who were bent on remaining as near the sacrededifice as they might get. Though they were denied admittance, theywould hear the solemn chant as it sounded through the open windows,and they felt that they would fall under the same sacred influence asthose who were inside; and whilst these latter were favoured by thehallowing influences of the sanctuary, they were compensated for thisby the rustling of the leaves, which seemed to moan in sympathy withthem as the wind swept gently by.Of all who mourned the loss of the father--and there were many whoregretted that he was taken from their midst--none was more sincere inher grief than Dorothy, and none apparently was so little affected bythe loss as Margaret.This maiden had watched the growing familiarity of the intercoursebetween her sister and John Manners with no friendly eyes. She hadperceived that it was necessary to take action at once in the matter,and at her express command her lover was even now on a mission to hisbrother to secure the double alliance between the two houses of Vernonand Stanley, upon which she and Lady Vernon had set their minds.The absence of Sir Thomas had intensified her feelings in the matter,and seeing Manners leading Dorothy out of the sick man's chamber withhis arm interlinked with hers, it had goaded her to such a frenzythat, regardless of the inopportunity of the time, she had proceededstraightway to Sir George and Lady Maude and had laid the matterbefore them in a most unfavourable light.And now, as the impressive requiem was about to be sung--a dirge fullof soul-stirring reflections and sacred grandeur--Margaret's headwas full of bitterness, and she failed to respond to the sympatheticsublimity of the service, or to notice its serene beauty either. Toher it was nothing more than a tiresome form; her interest was centredon Dorothy alone, and she heartily condemned herself for not arrangingthat. Dorothy should not sit beside the esquire. It was a dreary andunpleasant time to her, and when she raised her eyes from hersister it was only impatiently to watch the deepening shades of theapproaching night as they registered themselves upon the glass-panesat her side. The windows gradually became more and more difficult tosee through; each time she looked it had grown a shade darker, untilat length the pure glass had changed, to her unmitigated satisfaction,in hue from clear transparency to green, and from that to black.At length the service was over. She hailed its conclusion with a sighof relief, mentally promising the new confessor but a small portionof her favour if he were always as long-winded as he had been on thisoccasion; and she anxiously awaited the moment when Sir George wouldrise from his knees and lead the way out, so that she might carryDorothy off in safety.The time came in due course. The baron rose; the others followed hisexample, and as Lady Maude, less haughty than usual, led the way outof the chapel, Margaret eagerly caught hold of her sister and led heraway in silence across the courtyard and into the hall.CHAPTER XIX."THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE."'Twere wild to hope for her, you say, I've torn and cast those wordsaway, Surely there's hope! For life 'tis well Love without hope'simpossible.--COVENTRY PATMORE.Father Philip had lain under the sod but one sunset before the fruitsof Margaret's intriguing began to make themselves apparent.It was with a secret sense of misgiving that Manners received aninvitation, which he readily construed into a command, to attend thebaron in his private room, and it was with a fluttering heart that heprepared himself to meet Dorothy's father. Nor were his forebodingsset at rest or in anywise lightened by the first view he got of thebaron.Sir George was pacing up and down the room, but hearing the door openhe stopped suddenly, and when Manners entered he saw upon the knight'sface a look which at once struck a chill to his heart."Sit down, Manners, sit down," said the baron curtly.He was nervous and excited, and as Manners obeyed the injunctionhe clearly perceived this fact, and it afforded him a littlesatisfaction."You wished to see me?" he exclaimed, breaking the awkward silencewhich ensued after he had sat down."Eh, yes, I did."Another long pause followed, which was painful alike to both.The baron's agitation increased, and it did not need any greatexercise of shrewdness to guess the cause. The lover guessed itintuitively, and deftly altered the topic which was just about to bebroached."Poor Father Philip is gone," he exclaimed in a sympathetic tone."Ye-e-s," slowly assented the baron."And you miss him, I perceive," pursued the esquire tremulously."Very true, but--""And I hear Nicholas Bury is about to depart," hazarded Manners,interrupting the baron."Eh! what?" exclaimed Sir George. "Father Nicholas going?""He has informed Everard so.""No, he must stay," returned the knight, banishing the wrinkles thathad contracted his brow; "of course he must stay."He was clearly off his guard now, and Manners breathed easier again;for, thanks to the efforts of Dorothy and Crowleigh, as well as tohis own perceptions, he was by no means ignorant of the conspiracy ofwhich he was the victim, and he wished to procrastinate the inevitableinterview until a more favourable time presented itself for thepurpose."Where did he come from?" continued the baron, drifting innocentlyfarther and farther away from the purpose of the interview."Am I to trust thee with his secret then?" asked the lover."Of course, let me know all. I shall protect him, come what will.""Then he is Sir Ronald Bury's brother.""He is a better man than his brother, then," exclaimed Sir George,when he had overcome his astonishment. "Did Sir Everard fetch him fromNottingham?""Nay, from Dale Abbey.""Ha!" ejaculated the baron, "say you so? The abbey is dismantled, andmethought I knew every Catholic in the shire.""Then, Sir George, you forgot the hermitage," was the prompt reply.Sir George had just caught sight of his good lady through the openlattice window, and as he saw her wending her way quickly along thepath it painfully recalled him to a sense of his position."I sent for thee," he said suddenly, changing the conversation andknitting his brow, "because I wished to see thee on a matter of muchimportance.""I am honoured by your confidence," promptly returned the esquire,making a gallant effort to escape the subject, "but pray on noaccount tell either Everard or Nicholas that it was I who gave theinformation. I was charged to tell no man, by my honour."Unluckily, Lady Vernon passed the door just as he was speaking, andthe sound of her footsteps kept the subject too well in the baron'smind for him to wander from it again."About Dorothy," he explained, ignoring the last remark.Manners was nonplussed; he attempted no rejoinder, and the baron pacedthe room again in great perturbation. At length he stopped."'Tis an awkward piece of business," he said, "and I had much ratherit had not fallen so; but I suppose it must be done."Still Manners vouchsafed no reply, and his silence added to thebaron's discomfiture.For a long time neither of them spoke. The baron wiped theperspiration from his brow and tried to frame together the wordswhich proved so troublesome to utter, while Manners sat, ill at ease,waiting to hear the worst."Most young men fall in love," exclaimed the knight at length. Hejerked the words out rather than spoke them, but they were at leastuttered, and feeling that he had broken the ice he heaved a sigh ofrelief."I did so myself," he innocently rambled on, "more than once." He hadalmost said "and once too many," but he paused with the words uponhis lips, and the recollection that Lady Maude might not be far awaydecided him to leave the remark unexpressed."I have done so, too, once and for ever," exclaimed Manners, musteringup courage enough to break into the subject at a stroke. He feltthat it must all come out now, and the sooner it was over the betterpleased would he be; therefore he plunged headlong into it, hoping,perchance, to fire the baron with a little of the same enthusiasm withwhich he was himself possessed."It has been my good fortune," he continued boldly, "to fall deeply inlove with your daughter, your Dorothy--and she has not spurned me.""No, Doll is a rare girl, a bonnie girl, and a good one, too. I loveher better than I love myself, and forsooth, young man, we valueourselves at no sorry figure neither.""I wonder whoever saw her that did not love her," said thedeeply-smitten swain sententiously.They were both engaged in conversation now in common sympathy, and theeyes of the old knight sparkled with joy as he thought of his darlingand her many charms."She is the light of my life," he replied. "See, there she goes, withher bewitching grace," and he caught hold of Manners and drew him intothe recess of the oriel window and pointed out where Dorothy and hersister were talking together on the green."Margaret is to wed Sir Thomas Stanley this autumn, I hear," venturedthe esquire."Yes--and Dorothy is to be wedded this winter also," replied the baronas he heard the partner of his joys pass again outside the door."This winter!" echoed Manners in blank dismay. "Dorothy to be weddedthis winter! To whom, I pray?""To Sir Edward Stanley."Manners staggered back against the wall as though he had been smittenby some invisible hand. His face blanched, his lips quivered, and hegasped for very breath. This was news indeed, far beyond his worstanticipations, and he was almost crushed by the blow.The baron watched him with a feeling akin to dismay. He hated hisunpleasant task, and half regretted the promise he had made Sir ThomasStanley. He pitied the unfortunate esquire who stood before him, andsincerely blamed himself for accepting the business, and the dame forthrusting it upon him.Manners soon rallied, much to Sir George's relief; and the two satdown together at the little table. The baron, tried to express hissympathy with him in his great disappointment which had just come uponhim, but his words were clumsy, and afforded no relief."It is not yet quite decided upon, is it?" asked the young man."We expect Sir Edward now at any time," the knight replied."But, Sir George, Dorothy has plighted her troth to me.""Ah, we know it; Margaret has told us of it. 'Twas a foolish thing todo.""And Father Philip blessed the match," pursued Manners."But she has been promised to Edward Stanley," was the quiet reply,"and a Vernon's promise is never broken, never."The two remained silent awhile. Sir George had made wonderful progresswith his mission of late--a fact due to the knowledge that Lady Vernonwas standing just outside the door; and before either of them spokeagain she entered the room, and making a formal courtesy to thevisitor, she advanced to her husband's side."You have told Master Manners, I suppose?" she inquired in a harsh,unfeeling voice that stabbed the lover's heart by every word."Yes, my dear," he replied, looking as if he were ashamed of the wholebusiness, "I have told him all.""But surely you cannot understand Dorothy's feelings in the----""Dorothy will do as we desire," interrupted Lady Maude, severely."Do you really love your daughter, Sir George?" asked Manners, indesperation. "Then I conjure you by all the affection towards her youpossess, that in this, matter you consult her happiness. I cannot livewithout her, and she will fade away like a tender flower if you baulkher choice.""Do I love her?" repeated Sir George, impatiently. "Aye, that I do; amI not her father?""Hush, Sir George," interrupted Lady Vernon, "Master Manners isoutrageous. I will talk with him, and you can depart an you wish it."Nothing loth, Sir George turned to go; glad to wash his hands of thewhole affair, and feeling thoroughly ashamed that it had ever fallento his lot to treat a guest in so inhospitable a fashion."I am sorry, Master Manners," continued the dame, as she watched theretreating figure of her lord, "that Sir George has played his part soill. It had been kinder on his part had he introduced the subject inanother way, but he is ill-fitted for matters of business."Manners had heard the rustle of her gown outside the door some timebefore Lady Vernon had entered, and he shrewdly suspected that she hadbeen listening to the conversation. The manner in which she re-openedthe subject at once convinced him that his conjecture was right, andknowing the integrity of the baron he was ready to defend him."Sir George meant well enough," he said."Come now, Master Manners, that was bravely said," replied the lady."He has a kind heart, but it is apt to be too kind at times, and thenI have to go over it all again; you understand?""Perfectly, but Lady Vernon----""And you will perceive that we are within our rights in disposing ofDorothy as we wish," she continued. "Of course, she will consent to itin time.""Never," returned Manners, stoutly."You are but a youth, therefore you are bold, but mark my words, youngman, you will have less faith and more caution as your years come on.""Will you accept Dorothy's choice?" asked Manners bluntly,disregarding the last remark."Do you suppose, Master Manners," replied Lady Vernon, "that Dorothywill withstand us? We are all agreed in the matter.""All except Dorothy, maybe.""And _she_ will soon----""I tell you never!" he replied hotly.Lady Vernon laughed; a light, incredulous sort of laugh, which onlytended to enstrange them farther still."There are considerations of which you appear to be ignorant, sir,"she replied, "but I am not willing to wound your feelings.""That may be, and yet, perchance, there may be somewhat to be said onthe other side," he calmly rejoined.Lady Vernon fixed her eyes upon him, astounded at his presumption,but instead of crushing him under an avalanche of her wrath, sherestrained herself, and broke into another superficial burst oflaughter."Pooh," she said, "you are simply an esquire, and he is a knight.""And he a knight," echoed Dorothy's lover, scornfully. "As if he wereaught the better for that.""A knight is a knight," replied the lady stiffly; "and he is the sonof an earl.""And I, by the favour of fortune, am the nephew of an earl; and,moreover, Dorothy and I have plighted our troth together.""Then you were over bold.""I might accept your decision for myself, Lady Vernon," he said;"indeed, I had done so ere now, but Dorothy's happiness is at stake aswell as mine.""You accept it perforce, then?""Nay, I will abide by Dorothy's decision alone. She shall have theruling of it, and I know what she will say.""I must be plain with you, Master Manners," said Lady Maude, withconsiderable asperity. "It can never, no, never be as you desire. Wehave other designs for Dorothy than that she should marry a soldier offortune. Her portion," she continued, curling her lips in scorn, "is ahalf of the whole estate of Haddon, which, you must admit, is no smalldowry; and what have you to set against that? Your lands would notmaintain yourself alone," and, having delivered herself thus, she casta triumphant glance upon the young man who stood before her."I may win renown," he quickly replied."You possibly might," she replied, with another contemptuous curl ofher lip, "but that is a shadow, a mere myth. Besides, you can put novalue on fame; you cannot even live upon it.""I have a true and loving heart, and a strong arm.""Tut, man," she laughed; "so has every beggar. Prithee, now, as amatter of business, what have you to offer? Nothing.""What! Surely you do not want to barter her away?" cried Manners. "Whytalk of business?""Certainly not," she replied; "but it is our duty to make as good analliance for her as we can. You ought to perceive that this is to heradvantage, and if you care for her welfare as much as you would haveus believe, you would help us to secure it for her, instead of placingher in a position which can only breed discontent and mischief," andwithout giving Manners time to reply she swept proudly out of the roomand left him alone with his sorrow.CHAPTER XX.THE TROTHPLIGHT.  Yet even now it is good to think,  While my few poor varlets grumble and drink,  In my desolate hall where the fires sink;  Of _Dorothy_ sitting glorious there,  In glory of gold and glory of hair,  And glory of glorious face most fair;  Likewise to-night I make good cheer,  Because this battle draweth near,  For what have I to love or fear?  W. MORRIS (adapted).John Manners sought out Dorothy as soon as the interview wasconcluded, and he was fortunate enough to find her alone.Poor Dorothy; she had long expected this meeting, and she had triedto prepare herself to face it. Her love, subjected to such a terriblestrain, had come like gold out of the refining fire. It had grownstronger and better, and as she saw her lover emerge from the room sherealised for the first time how much she really loved him.The tale was soon told, and as he poured into her ears the unwelcometidings her tender heart was lacerated by each successive word."And now, my own sweet Dorothy," he concluded, "you know all. I havetold thee all the pitiful story. Would to God it had been a pleasanttale I had to tell thee, but alas! I have told thee but the truth."He looked fondly into her face, and wondered how often he would bepermitted to see it more. It was deadly pale, and her lips quiveredagain as she endeavoured to keep them tightly closed."John," she murmured, "in any matter but this I should obey them;but--but----" She broke down under the mental strain. It was aterrible struggle between conflicting affections, and, unable tosustain it, she would have fallen in a faint upon the ground had notthe strong arms of her lover supported her.Manners laid her gently down upon the bank and sprinkled some waterupon her, for they were on the slopes of the Wye, and in a few momentsshe mastered her feelings and opened her eyes."I am dizzy," she apologetically exclaimed, as she saw the form of herbeloved bending over her. "I shall be better soon."She fulfilled her prediction quickly, and when he would have led herback into the Hall she begged him to wait."Nay, nay, John," she said, "the Lady Maude will soon devise a planfor separating us, but let us remain together while we may.""But, Doll, you are ill," he exclaimed, "and I must take good care ofthee.""I should be worse were I severed from thee," she sweetly replied,"and, John, I have somewhat to tell thee.""Speak on then, sweet one.""You will be true to me, John, whatever happens?" she asked.She was timid to approach the subject, and blushed deeply at the soundof her own sweet voice. She had more than half a mind to take thewords back lest they should strike a single pang into his heart, butthey were spoken, and before she could enter into any explanation, hehad bent down and kissed her."My precious darling!" he passionately exclaimed. "I never couldforget thee; thy name is written on my heart; I shall never cease tolove thee. The saints forfend me, Doll. I were a miscreant indeed wereI to play traitor to thy love.""I shall trust you, John," she replied, bestowing upon him a look ofundisguised affection; "I do trust thee; I shall be happy in thy love.Whatever trouble comes I shall be happy, because I shall know yourheart is trusty and true.""That it shall be, Doll," he cried, "a right trusty heart--though theydo make thee wed Edward Stanley.""John!" she exclaimed quickly, flushing scarlet again, "have I notgiven my troth to thee? They shall not force me into it. You can trustme.""O, Doll. My love, my darling, it would break my heart to give theeup; but I must do it for the sake of thy happiness."Poor heart, he spoke but the truth, but he spoke it as bravely as hecould."Hush, John," Dorothy hastily broke in; "you must not say suchthings.""Alas! you little know, my sweet one, to what misery you would consignyourself if you proved staunch to me," he continued. "This fragileform was not made to suffer, but to recline in ease," he added, as hegazed fondly at the graceful form of the maiden."I have recked the cost," she simply replied. "You do not doubt me, doyou, John?" she asked, looking up into his troubled face."Doubt thee, no;" he replied, "but I would save thee from a host ofsorrows."Dorothy held her head down in silence, and seeing that she did notanswer. Manners continued."I must be frank with you, Doll. The husband they have chosen thee maybe an earl in time to come, and is a Derby to boot. He is rich, andmayhap he may love thee, too, and I--and I----""Stop, John, stop," she commanded. "Would you thus trifle with mylove? I have seen in thee a noble heart, a kind heart, a loving heart.I have refused many before thee. I have just refused one lord, andI shall refuse the other. You would not so dispraise yourself but todissuade me; but you have yet to learn the constancy of a maiden'slove.""Are you resolved?" he asked, almost choked by the feelings of joy herwords had caused."I am," she firmly replied; "I shall brave the worst, and be happy inyour love. What more can I desire?"Manners was too much overcome to speak. He could only weaklyarticulate a fervent "God bless you, my love;" but if Dorothy haddesired anything more to prove the intensity of his feelings, shewould have found it had she looked to see it in his eyes.While matters had been progressing thus at Haddon, Sir Henry de laZouch had been gradually improving in health, until by now he hadfound himself almost as well as he had been of yore, and he hadintimated that he was fast getting ready to return to Ashby Castle.His passion for Dorothy had not abated one whit, and he was deeplymortified to find how rapidly Manners had been wooing and winning themaiden.Yet, although his suit had been rebuffed at every point, he wasnot discouraged. Indeed, had his other qualities equalled hisperseverance, he had richly merited a full and good reward; but,unfortunately, this was his only redeeming trait, and the baseness ofthat motive which prompted it poisoned that very virtue too.He was neither dejected nor cast down, because he felt that he hadwithin his power a mode of wooing the maiden which, were he but touse it, could not fail to insure complete success. The plan had itsdrawbacks, to be sure, but it was the only one at his command, andeven as he lay upon the sick bed, tossing in agony from side to side,he was considering whether or no he should carry it out. When he wasbetter he determined to put it into force upon the first opportunity,but every relapse undid his resolution, and made him pay attention tohis conscience, which bade him reject the idea.As a compromise he determined at last to ask Dorothy again for herhand, and he availed himself of an early opportunity of doing this. Heused all his persuasive eloquence in vain. He pointed to his haggardface, and told her that a refusal would inevitably complete the workthat Manners had begun, but she was firm; and seeing that nothingwould shake her resolution, he resolved to put his plan into operationimmediately upon his recovery.It was a deeply-laid scheme, the scheme of a villain, and it revealedits author in its proper light. As he communicated his plan to hispage, when the latter paid him his final visit, his face glowed withsatisfaction, and he imagined the chagrin his dupes would feel whenthey found themselves within his power.It was necessary, in the first place, to throw Manners off hisguard, and, smarting under the humiliation of his defeat, De la Zouchdetermined that his victor should also come within the reach ofhis net; and, as he witnessed the growing familiarity which existedbetween his rival and Dorothy, he was more than ever determinedto have vengeance upon him, and more jubilant at the prospect ofattaining the consummation of his wish.This was the motive which caused his readiness to meet Manners as afriend. He rightly judged that Manners once put off the scent, therest would follow his example, so he appeared to accept Dorothy'srefusal with a better grace, as a thing inevitable; and once face toface again with his gallant foe, nothing could exceed the extravaganceof the language he employed to convince him that he regretted thefollies of the past and to instil into his mind that he wished for thefuture to be counted as his friend.It is a noticeable feature about villains that they almost alwaysoverreach themselves at some point or other--in story-books theyalways do--and to this characteristic De la Zouch proved no exception,for the very intensity of the words he chose, and the excessiveflattery he employed, instead of gaining their object, aroused inJohn Manners' mind a feeling of suspicion of which he could in nowisedispossess himself. He would have communicated his fears to Dorothy,but he feared lest she should misjudge him and interpret it as anebulition of jealousy, and there was none other except his friendCrowleigh in whom he could confide. Unwilling, however, to woundthe susceptibilities of De la Zouch, who, after all, might have beenactuated by the best of motives, he fairly met all his advances, andthough he was all along mistrustful of his intentions, yet he wascareful that Sir Henry should perceive no signs of it.Lady Vernon soon gave Manners a hint that his visit to Haddon mightterminate at any time he chose; but, although wounded in spirit by herwords, he was in no great hurry to depart from Dorothy's side, and SirGeorge, eager to make amends for his dame's shortcomings, and ashamedthat the traditional hospitality of his mansion should be so roughlycontradicted while he was the lord of Haddon, appeared most anxious toprolong the visit, and endeavoured to make the enjoyment of his guestas complete as it could possibly be, the circumstances being dulyconsidered.To the surprise of them all, De la Zouch added his request to thebaron's, declaring that he and Manners would depart together in a fewdays, and if his late antagonist did not offer any serious oppositionto the plan, he intended to entertain him for a short time at Ashby,adding that he had already given commands that the castle should beprepared for their reception.The request was couched in such a manner that Manners could do noother than accept it, but he immediately resolved to curtail his visitinto Leicestershire as much as he possibly could, and he felt that itwould be a relief to him when the visit was concluded.The days swiftly passed; all too quickly for the two lovers. SirThomas Stanley had sent a messenger to inform them that his brotherhad met with an accident, and was too ill to travel then, and hefeared he would be obliged to return to Haddon alone; but the letterbrought the unwelcome news to Dorothy that Edward Stanley would comeand claim her as his bride before the year had passed.CHAPTER XXI.THE PLOT IN PROGRESS.  His eyebrow dark, and eye of fire  Showed spirit proud, and prompt to ire;  Yet lines of thought upon his cheek,  Did deep design and counsel speak.  SCOTT.It was with mingled feelings of sorrow, suspicion, and gladness thatJohn Manners received news from Sir Henry de la Zouch, who had goneover to his castle some days before, that he was coming back upon themorrow to escort his guests to Ashby.Sir Thomas Stanley had returned to Haddon, and though he was wellsatisfied, upon the whole, with the result of his mission, yet heclearly perceived the real state of affairs, and was far too astutenot to make strenuous efforts to alter their course.He had interposed himself as much as possible between Dorothy andher forbidden lover, and had succeeded in some degree in keepingthem apart. He might, however, have spared himself the trouble, for,although he prevented their meeting on some occasions, yet love wasconqueror in the end, and with Lettice as a trusty helpmeet, the twolovers found ways and means by which to see each other of which henever dreamed.Sir Thomas was too much of a gentleman to affront Manners, as he hadbeen secretly urged to do, but he made no secret of his opinion thatit would be a relief to him when the time came for the visitors todepart.True to his word, Sir Henry arrived at Haddon on the following day,bringing with him an invitation for Sir Thomas Stanley and Crowleighto accompany him on his return.Sir Thomas refused it, as indeed he was expected to do, but SirEverard Crowleigh, glad to be able to bear his friend company,promptly accepted the offer, and Manners began to look upon theprospect of his stay at Ashby with a little more hopefulness.Sir George Vernon was too hospitable a host to let even De la Zouchdepart again upon the self-same day upon which he had arrived. Hewould not tolerate the idea for a single moment; there must be acarousal and a dance at night in honour of the departing guests, andthen they would be at liberty to depart upon the first grey streaks ofdawn if they were so minded.De la Zouch, well aware that the King of the Peak was the soulof hospitality itself, had calculated upon the offer, and at onceaccepted it; while the baron, not content with what he had alreadydone, when the morrow came, drew the designing Stanley with himselfinto his private room, and, under the pretext of taking counsel withhim, kept him by his side, leaving the way open for Manners to have afarewell afternoon with Dorothy.De la Zouch proposed a ride, and as there appeared to be littleprospect of enjoying undisturbed peace at Haddon, the two lovers fellin with the suggestion, and very soon after the mid-day meal they met,booted and spurred, at the gate of the hall."Aye, aye, there," hailed a voice, as Manners was helping Dorothy offthe riding-stone into the saddle, "whither away so gaily?""Aye, Everard," replied his friend, as he turned round and saw who itwas that called. "Hurry up, we are off for a ride.""Shall I come, too?" he inquired, as he hastened up and stood besidethem."Do," returned Dorothy. "Make haste, though, for time is precious withus now.""I will not keep you waiting, fair Mistress Dorothy," he gallantlyresponded; "I will follow thee anon. Which way am I to come, Bakewell,Cromford, or which?""Oh, Cromford," replied Sir Henry quickly. "See how restive my horseis, he will bolt off if I try to hold him in much longer. Are weready? Let us go then; time is short, remember," and giving the reinto his steed he started off at a good pace, whilst the others followedquickly in his wake.It was a beautiful day, and the scenery around was so majesticallygrand that even its familiarity did not detract from its beauty in theeyes of the little party as it rode laughingly by. The early leaveswere just beginning to drop from off the parent stems; the ferns andbracken, which grew in abundance on either side of the road, were justassuming their peculiar fading, golden hue, whilst the hardier leaveswere just beginning to bedeck themselves in the full glory of theirrich autumnal tints."This is beautiful," exclaimed Dorothy, enthusiastically, as she gazedenraptured at the rich variety of form and colour which met them atevery turn. "Look at those cliffs. It is lovely, it is grand."They had just passed the little hamlet of Matlock Bath, and wereapproaching Cromford. There were no stone walls then to hide from vieweven the smallest portion of the gorgeous picture. From the roadto the Derwent there sloped a narrow strip of marshy meadow, whichcovered itself with a superabundance of luxurious tall grasses andtough bracken. Beyond the stream there rose, standing straight up bythe water's edge, a wall of jagged and scarred rock, overgrown withtrees and climbing foliage, which was faithfully mirrored in theplacid water below. The scene could hardly fail to appeal to theirsense of beauty.Manners avowed that he thought it the fairest spot on earth, and De laZouch, not to be outdone in gallantry, added that the presence of sofair a maiden as Dorothy Vernon in the midst of so much natural beautymade a picture a better than which he never desired to see."And, after all, fair Dorothy," he concluded, "I wot that it is butthe reflection of thine own sweet form and peerless grace."Dorothy frowned. She did not care for compliments from Sir Henry dela Zouch; she always feared them, for they generally had a stingsomewhere, and she had noticed that, as a rule, they were followed bysomething more or less unpleasant."Sir Everard has not come yet," she exclaimed, turning round in hersaddle, "perhaps he is not coming after all?""He is sure to follow us," replied Manners. "Maybe he has beendelayed, and yet we have come slowly. Hark! I hear the ring of hoofsupon the road even now."They halted to await their companion, but they soon discovered, as thesound of the galloping grew rapidly more and more distinct, that thehorseman was advancing towards them from the opposite direction."He is hindered, surely," exclaimed De la Zouch, who heartily wishedhe was stating the truth, "and it will soon be time for us to turn ourfaces again towards the Hall.""Not just yet, Sir Henry," Dorothy quickly replied; "but you may; andyou will.""Not yet, eh! Then let us have a race along this lane," suggestedDe la Zouch, evading the hint and pointing to a long lane almostcompletely overarched with the massive branches of the overhangingtrees which grew on either side.Dorothy looked at Manners appealingly."What say you, Doll?" he inquired. "You shall determine.""Nay, you decide.""To that clump of trees," interposed De la Zouch."Well, if Dorothy does not object--""Not I, in truth," she interrupted."Away we go, then," replied Manners. "There and back at once?" heasked."No, only there," replied Sir Henry, ill-concealing a malicious grin."It will be a long, long time before you come back this way, I trow,"he added under his breath."But we are not yet placed," said Dorothy's lover, as De la Zouch wasabout to start away. "We two must fall in the rear, Sir Henry.""Nay, I am equally as well mounted as you," returned the maiden. "Wewill run upon our merits, or I shall withdraw."In a few minutes they were careening along the course in gallantstyle, as nearly as possible all three abreast, but as they neared thetrees which formed the winning mark, Sir Henry fell behind and leftthe other two to finish the exciting race alone."Curse them, a murrain on them!" he muttered, as he pulled his horseto a standstill; "where can the fellows be?"His objurgation might have been heard, for no sooner were the wordsout of his mouth than he saw, rising up from the brushwood, the men ofwhom he had just spoken in such uncomplimentary terms.Burdened as he was with anxiety for the successful issue of his plot,and fearful lest at the last stage it should miscarry and snatch awaythe prize for which he had struggled so long, and which already seemedto be within his grasp, De la Zouch was in a terrible ferment of hopeand fear."The villains," he muttered, as he sat still in his saddle impatientlywatching; "why don't they move? It will be too late in a minute. I'llthrash every mother's son of them when we get back to Ashby, that Iwill. Dear me! what a fool I am to forget the signal;" and putting hishand to his mouth he blew a loud shrill whistle through his fingers.Manners and Dorothy had just raced up together to the trees, andhearing the unusual sound that their companion made, they turnedround at the same instant to see how much they were before him, and toascertain the meaning of the noise. Just at this juncture, in answerto the signal of their lord, De la Zouch's hirelings rushed throughthe already prepared gaps in the tall hedges and fell upon the lovers,taking them completely by surprise.Dorothy was quickly unhorsed with no more roughness than her ownresistance necessitated, but it was not so with her lover. ThoughManners had nothing to defend himself with, except the stock of hisriding-whip, yet he gave so good an account of himself, and wieldedhis paltry weapon to so much purpose that he quickly freed himself,and rushed to aid poor Doll. This purpose, however, he failed toaccomplish. The odds were ten to one, but even then it was for sometime an open question whether the one would not prevail over the ten.All his skill was brought into play. He laid about him right and leftuntil his weapon broke, and then, undismayed, he lunged out with theremnant, and succeeded in wresting a bludgeon from one of his injuredopponents, and plunged into the fray with renewed vigour.In spite of his efforts, however, he was unable to rescue Dorothy.Having once got her into their possession the men were determinedto keep her, and she was borne away from the contest ineffectuallystruggling with her captors, who, having retired to a safe distance,awaited with their quarry until Manners himself was captured too.De la Zouch sat aghast at this exhibition of his rival's prowess.Whatever the cost might be it was imperative that Manners should notescape to tell the tale at Haddon, and he alternately groaned andcursed each time he witnessed his followers quail and fall beneath theterrific blows of their antagonist. He had come, he thought, preparedfor any contingency, but it appeared as though his force was by nomeans strong enough to achieve the desired end.Manners himself, suspicious of De la Zouch, as he all along had been,perceived at the outset the trap into which he had been led, and now,finding it useless to attempt Dorothy's rescue any longer, and feelingthe first approach of weariness come warningly over him, set spursto his horse and galloped back again towards Sir Henry de la Zouch,intent on wreaking a full vengeance upon him, and at the same timedetermined to make an effort to escape in order to discover aid bywhich to rescue his betrothed."Villain!" he hissed, "thou shalt pay dearly for this."De la Zouch did not wait to meet the overpowering fury of his foe.He no longer marvelled at the result of the tournament. He had seenenough of Manners' prowess already to have much faith left in his ownpowers of defense. To him distance lent enchantment to the view, soturning his horse sharply round he galloped away, bidding Manners dohis worst.It would have fared ill with the knight of Ashby had his foe but oncereached within arm's length of him; but Fortune, after wavering aboutas if uncertain which way to make up its mind, declared itself atlast upon the side of villainy, and Manners was stretched low upon theground by a stone hurled at him by one of his assailants.With his fall Dorothy's last chance of escape was taken from her.De la Zouch heard the groan of his injured foe, and turning his faceround to ascertain its meaning, he was just in time to see his rivaldrop from his saddle upon the road, where he was quickly surroundedamid a considerable show of bravery by the minions of De la Zouch towhom he had just given such a terrible exhibition of his skill."You cowardly knaves," cried that worthy, "secure him ere he escapesagain."Not a man stirred, for Manners had inspired them with so wholesome adread of the power of his arm that, although he was sorely wounded, noone was willing to venture within his reach."Secure him, I say," imperiously repeated Sir Henry, who, from hissafe position on horseback, could well afford to ridicule their fearsand give his commands with confidence.Manners with difficulty managed to raise himself upon his elbow,and he looked so fierce and desperate that the solitary man who hadadvanced towards him retreated with dismay."By St. George, seize him, sirrah," exclaimed the knight, springingoff his saddle in high dudgeon. "You are all cowards together.""Seize him, do you say," returned the man, insolently; "seize him,do you say? Seize him yourself, then, for I vow I have had more thanenough of it already. He fights like a dragon; see here," and theman bared his arm and showed a number of bruises upon it. "Now then,master," he continued, "seize him yourself, say I, for I will haveno more to do with the affair;" and to this his companions sullenlymurmured assent."A woman would have less fear than thee," returned the knightcontemptuously, as he glanced at the arm held out before him. "Why, Ihave fought for hours after being grievously wounded in the fray."It had been more to Sir Henry's mind to have struck the man down tothe ground for his insolence, and this he felt strongly impelledto do, but seeing the threatening aspect of the man's companions herestrained his fury, promising himself that his punishment should losenothing by the fact of it being reserved to another and a safer time.It was with difficulty that he had contented himself with returningso mild an answer, but the man's retort drove him at once beyond thebounds of prudence and patience, and made him utterly reckless."Mayhap you have," returned the man incredulously, "but I'll warrantme it was no fault of thine. You showed us some of your skill justnow.""I will prove it," shouted the knight, furiously, and, suiting theaction to the word, he seized hold of the nearest weapon, a stout ashstick, and advancing towards the dazed and bleeding esquire, he dealthim a blow on the head which stretched him insensible upon the turf."Coward!" cried the man, springing forward from among his companions."You are the coward. I will be no party to such a cold-blooded murderas this," and his bosom swelled with indignation as he turned round tohis companions and pointed to where Manners lay."Who says I am a coward? Who dares to speak such insolence?" demandedDe la Zouch, trembling all over with rage."I do, and I repeat it," replied the other, bending over the prostrateform of his late antagonist.For a moment Sir Henry stood in speechless amazement at suchunlooked-for presumption, and then suddenly raising his weapon, hebrought it down upon his offending servant, and stretched him besidethe object of his sympathy."Who says I am a coward now?" he fiercely asked, turning upon theabashed companions of the latest victim of his temper.Whatever the others thought, they wisely held their peace, and,terrified and cowed by the lesson their lord had taught them, theysilently raised the two inanimate bodies, and, according to theirinstructions, proceeded to rejoin Dorothy and her guard ere they begantheir journey back to the castle at Ashby.       *       *       *       *       *CHAPTER XXII.ON A FALSE SCENT.  I can counterfeit the deep tragedian!  Speak, and look back, and pry on every side,  Tremble, and start at wagging of a straw.  Pretending deep suspicion; ghastly looks  Are at my service like enforced smiles,  And both are ready in their offices,  At any time to grace my stratagems.  SHAKESPEARE.Dorothy Vernon had impatiently awaited the conclusion of thecontest, and the prodigious amount of faith she had in her lover'scapabilities, coupled with what she had already witnessed of thefight, led her to hope that he would yet return victorious to deliverher.She had ceased to struggle ere the victors returned, partly becauseof the hope with which she had deluded herself, and partly becauseher attempts had only wearied her without bringing her any nearer tosuccess; but at the first glimpse of the slowly approaching companyshe broke away from her too trustful captors and fled precipitatelytowards the advancing party."Let me go to him; is he hurt?" she cried, as one of her guardiansovertook her and pulled her to a standstill, and starting forwardagain she left a fragment of her dress between the man's fingers, andhastened on again until she reached her lover's side."Speak, John," she exclaimed in piteous tones, as she gazed upon hispallid face and livid form. "Speak just one word to me."But Manners did not speak. Thoroughly stunned by the blows he hadreceived, he lay quite unconscious in the position in which he hadbeen placed, and he was so weakened by the loss of blood from hiswounds that his immediate return to consciousness was exceedinglyproblematical. He lay deaf, and apparently dead, whilst Dorothypleaded in vain for a word from his lips."Just one word," she repeated, pathetically."Poor Lady," exclaimed Sir Henry's page, who was in charge of theparty. "Don't take it to heart so much; he will come round soon, andbe himself again. Nay, touch her not," he commanded, as one of the menwas about to take her away, "she will do no harm.""He is dead," she sobbed, and ere she could be assured that herconjecture was wrong she fainted away, and was gently laid besideher lover, while they were borne swiftly and silently, by sequesteredroads, from the scene of the adventure.Sir Henry watched them departing till a turn in the road hid them fromview, and then, bethinking himself of his position, he mounted hissteed and rode rapidly away, feeling immensely relieved that, afterall, he had proved successful.A few minutes in the saddle sufficed him, and then dismounting, hetook of his hat and belaboured it well with the stock end of his whip.He satisfied himself at length, and ceasing from his efforts in thatdirection he laid it on the ground and surveyed the effect.It looked battered indeed, and evidently well pleased with the result,the knight set busily to work upon his clothes. He carefully tore themhere and there with a sharp-pointed piece of wood, while to completethe deception, he spoiled the appearance of his attire by daubing itfreely with dirt."I trow that will be enough," he murmured, as ceasing his labours hecomplacently gazed upon the transformation he had effected; "but no!"he added, "I had best be on the safe side," and he gently scratchedhis hands to give himself the appearance of having passed through along and stern struggle."A bruise or two would improve my appearance considerably," he added,"but then bruises hurt and are apt to turn awkward; I think I mightsafely spare myself the pain; but I might, at all events, break mywhip-stock and carry the end of it back;" and having settled thesepoints to his own satisfaction, he mounted his saddle afresh, andsetting spurs to his horse he never drew rein until long after he hadpassed out of the lane, and was well on the high road to Haddon.As he neared the vicinity of the Hall he proceeded to put intopractice what yet remained unfinished of his disguise. He had treatedhis own person, and now he turned his attention to the faithful steedwhich had carried him often and well.There was no time to waste. He had lost much precious time already. Hewould have found little time in which to be sentimental had he beenso inclined, but such an idea never entered into his head, and pullinghis jack-knife out of his pocket, he opened the blade and stabbed thehorse in the shoulder.As previously related, De la Zouch had thought of ornamenting himselfwith a few slight bruises, but he had decided to forego whateveradvantages might accrue to him from such a course of conduct, butnow the matter was decided for him in a manner which he had neverconsidered.It had never flashed upon the heated brain of the malignant knightthat wounding a horse was a very delicate operation to perform, and inhis reckless hurry he had never taken into account that such conductwould be attended with any danger, or he would have proceeded toaccomplish his design in a more cautious fashion; and it was not untilthe horse kicked out after the first blow that Sir Henry de la Zouchbecame suddenly aware of the danger of his position. He had not thepower to stay the second thrust, and before he could retreat out ofdanger he was sent sprawling into the hedge bottom.Fortunately, the effects of the blow were considerably diminished,inasmuch as its greatest force was already spent ere De la Zouch wasstruck. Had it not been for this circumstance he would have comeoff ill indeed, but even as it was he was sorely injured, and layinsensible in the place where he had fallen until he opened his eyesat dusk and found himself being lifted up."Where am I?" he gasped, as he mechanically rubbed his eyes and gazedaround. "I am hurt.""Lie still awhile," returned Crowleigh, for he it was who stood overhim. "You will be yourself again directly," and raising his horn tohis lips he blew a loud, clear note upon the still evening air."What does that portend?" asked the conscience-stricken andmistrustful knight. He feared that he was about to be carried off toanswer for his misdeeds."There will be help soon," said Crowleigh. "Lie still, for you arehurt. You will be better by-and-by. Drink this," and he filled hishorn with water and offered it to him.De la Zouch took the water and drank it off. It appeared to do himgood, for he rapidly rallied, and the reassuring words of Crowleighhad a magical effect in clearing his brow and helping on his recovery."Am I much hurt?" he inquired with a look of intense agony upon hisbrow."Bruised and stunned, I think, that is all. Ha, here they come;" and,as he suddenly stopped speaking, the sound of the replying hornscould be distinctly heard, and within a few minutes, from differentquarters, over walls and fences, the horsemen came riding in by onesand twos until at last there numbered a full dozen."Oh!" groaned De la Zouch, loudly, "it is painful, cannot you relieveme?""Where is Sir George Vernon?" inquired Sir Everard; "have none of youseen him of late?"No one had, but they had all blown their horns, so he was sure to bein soon.De la Zouch shuddered at the mention of the King of the Peak--he washardly himself again as yet, but he was fast rallying, and by the timethat the baron arrived he was quite ready to meet him."Heigho! found at last;" exclaimed the baron, as he made his waythrough the group. "But whom have we here; tush, where is my Doll?"De la Zouch, for answer, began to play his game, and he only repliedto the query with a deceitful and prolonged groan."Where's my Dorothy?" impatiently repeated the baron, disregarding theagonised look which met his gaze."There--miles on," gasped Sir Henry, jerking his thumb over hisshoulder, and pointing along the road by which he had just travelled;and then, as if the effort had been too much for him, he fell backpanting upon the turf.Sir George Vernon waited for no more, but hastily bestriding hissaddle, he galloped away, bidding the others disperse again upon theirsearch. Only Sir Thomas Stanley and one solitary retainer remained,and these from very different reasons; the former because he suspectedfoul play, and wished for the immediate future to have De la Zouchunder his own eye; and the latter, much against his will, wasconstrained to tarry behind to help the unfortunate nobleman back toHaddon."Twenty nobles for the man who finds my Dorothy," shouted the baron ashe rode off, "and twice twenty if there has been any knavery and therogues are caught"; and as the knight of Ashby heard the sound ofthe galloping grow fainter he was fain to own himself so far onlypartially successful, and as he was lifted up to be carried away, heshut his eyes and ruminated on the probable present condition of hiscaptives, and wondered where they were.Dorothy soon awoke from the swoon into which she had fallen on seeingthe prostrate condition of her lover, and being graciously permittedby the page to have a considerable amount of liberty, she soon busiedherself in trying to restore Manners to consciousness.Eustace, the page in question, had judged her aright. There waslittle fear now of her attempting to escape. Indeed, the thought neverentered into her head; her whole attention was concentrated upon theone effort of restoring her lover to consciousness, and even the heartof the hardest of the rough men around her was softened by the pictureof grief which she presented.At last John Manners opened his eyes, and as he caught sight ofDorothy's tear-stained face bending over him, he smiled. His smiledispelled all Dorothy's fears, as the rising sun dispels the morningmist, and through her grief she smiled responsively back upon herlover.Eustace witnessed his recovery with a profound sense of relief. It wasin ignorance of the plot that he had been inveigled to obey his lord'sbehests, for though at Haddon De la Zouch had acquainted him witha part of the conspiracy, yet he had grossly deceived him. He hadinformed him that it was Dorothy Vernon's wish to flee to Ashby,and it was not until he was undeceived by the conduct of the maidenherself that the fullness of his master's treachery revealed itself tohim.True, he had been engaged on sundry occasions with his master inunworthy and unknightly deeds, but never until now had he perceivedthe outrageous conduct of his lord. His whole nature recoiled from thetask which had been imposed upon him, and nothing but the extreme fearwith which De la Zouch had inspired him during a long acquaintanceshipheld him back from releasing the two lovers on the way, and helpingthem back to Haddon.He was not yet courageous enough to pursue such a course, however. Hefelt that his master's eye was upon him, and he could not shake theevil influence off; but, although failing in this particular, he gavethem a practical token of his sympathy by offering them such foodas he possessed--a small flagon of wine, purloined from Sir Henry'sstore, together with a rough rye cake, which were gratefully acceptedas a token of friendship, and before long were thankfully consumed.He tendered them gracefully to the captives, and without waiting to bethanked he made his way to the rear, where, forming the men in order,he divided them into two companies, and sending the one on in front,the other half walked a little distance behind, leaving Dorothy andher lover free to converse as they chose. In this order, withoutmolestation or accident, they reached their destination as the greylight of the succeeding morning melted into the clearer light of riperday.CHAPTER XXIII.DARK SUSPICIONS.  But oh, that hapless maiden?--  Where may she wander now, whither betake her,  From the chill dew, amongst rude burrs and thistles?  Perhaps some cold bank is her bolster now.  Or, 'gainst the rugged bark of some broad elm  Leans her unpillowed head, fraught with sad fears.  What, if in wild amazement and affright  Or while we speak, within the direful grasp  Of savage hunger.  MILTON.The liberal offer which the King of the Peak made for the recovery ofhis daughter fired his followers with enthusiasm; for, although theyhad searched willingly enough before, both for the sake of love andduty, yet the tempting reward added to their zeal, and each one setout on his journey anew, feeling pretty confident that very soon hewould be at least twenty nobles the richer.As the shades of evening fell, and the twilight began to fade intodarkness, the prospect of finding the maiden grew fainter and fainter,until at length the most hopeful gave up the search and returneddisconsolately to Haddon, hoping that the maiden would be found at theHall, and that with her return the chance of gaining the twenty nobleswas irretrievably lost. Sir George was the last to return, and thejaded condition of his horse told far more plainly than ever wordscould have done how far he had ridden.He had hoped, amid fear and trembling, that his lost darling had beenfound. He even half expected her to meet him upon his return; but allhis anticipations were rudely dispelled. Not a trace of her had beenfound, and crushed by the ill news, he retired to the solitude of hisdressing room, with his riding accoutrements unremoved, and gazed fora time meditatively into the empty fireplace, in an agony of fear asto the fate which had befallen her. So far, there was no clue to guidehim; he could not even imagine or suspect any adequate reason for herabsence; he could only ruminate sorrowfully on the fact that she wasgone, and lament his inability to find her.He was pondering in this fashion when a gentle knock at the dooraroused him from his reverie."Enter," he gruffly and impatiently responded.The door opened and Lettice entered. Her face was suffused with tears."Well, Lettice," he inquired in a somewhat gentler voice, "what is it,eh?""Is there any news of my mistress?" she tremblingly asked."None," he replied, "would God there were."The maid curtsied and withdrew, but ere she had closed the door, thebaron called her back."Lettice!" he cried.She was in the room again in an instant."Is Sir Thomas Stanley here?" he asked."He is with Mistress Margaret, keeping watch in Sir Henry's room," shereplied."Bid him attend me here, then," he commanded. Lettice closed the dooragain, and with a feeling of keen disappointment went off to dischargeher mission.Sir Thomas received the summons ungraciously, but feeling constrainedto obey it, he bade the maid keep his betrothed company, and tellingher not to let her eyes depart from De la Zouch he hastened to see SirGeorge.When the good folk of Haddon awoke next morning, they were summonedto the Hall by the sound of the bell. The news of Dorothy's mysteriousdisappearance had quickly spread, and feeling sure that someannouncement concerning her was about to be made, they quickly flockedinto the courtyard curious to learn the latest tidings.They were not disappointed. Sir George repeated his offer of theprevious day, increasing it upon the impulse of the moment to fiftynobles, and he at once despatched a number of his household to renewthe search.Meanwhile De la Zouch, to revenge himself upon the baron forhis behaviour to him on the preceding afternoon, continued in awell-feigned semi-unconscious state, and throughout the day hedeclared himself too faint and dazed and altogether unfit to explainDorothy's absence. Although besieged with inquiries from earlymorning, he remained obstinately deaf to all entreaties, nor was ituntil the evening that he professed himself able to understand theirinquiries or returned intelligent answers to their questions."I was almost killed by that treacherous esquire," he whined, as hebegan his explanation."Never mind that, tell us about Dorothy," interrupted the baron."I am coming to that," he replied. "No sooner were we started than Ibegan to suspect mischief. I could see that Manners did not want me.""Very like," interrupted Sir Thomas dryly.De la Zouch felt hurt by the unfeeling remark, and he looked hurt,too, but Sir Thomas took no note of it, and the effort was futile."Why did you not come, Crowleigh?" he continued, changing theexpression of his countenance from anger to agony, "then all wouldhave been different."It would, indeed, but not as Sir Henry implied."I was hindered," returned Sir Everard, highly nettled at the other'stone and speech. "My horse fell lame with a stone in his shoe, and Ihad to return.""At Cromford he set a pack of knaves upon me," pursued De la Zouch,with the coolest audacity. "I was almost murdered; I tried to saveher, but what could I do? They were ten to one, and whilst I foughtlike a madman, Dorothy and Manners laughed at me to my face and rodeoff together.""You lie," returned Crowleigh, hotly."Do I?" he replied with a sneer, "then prithee what does this bespeak,and this, and this?" and he showed in turn the scratches and bruiseson the various parts of his body."At Cromford?" inquired the baron. "Did you say at Cromford?""Aye, at Cromford, Sir George. I struggled hard to rescue Dorothy forthee, but it was of no avail. No man can combat ten and win.""I passed Cromford myself and saw naught of it, nor yet had any of thevillagers," said the baron severely."And what means this?" continued De la Zouch, pointing to the batteredhat and soiled and torn clothes. "Do not these alone prove that I amspeaking but the truth? Can you doubt me longer now?" and he glancedround indignantly, and acted his part so well that he almost persuadedhimself that he was a much-abused and persecuted person."Did no one witness the struggle, Sir Henry?" asked the scepticalStanley. "Was there not one during all that time passed by?""In faith, Sir Thomas, I know not," he replied. "I found no time tolook. I had work enough to do to save my skin, I assure you. He hastaken her to London.""The ingrate!" warmly exclaimed Lady Maude, who had just entered theroom. "And Dorothy is worse than he. Let them go, Sir George, they arenot worth the finding; let them go.""Well, 'twas a knightly thing to do, to leave a lady; a right gallantthing, nay by my troth it was," said Stanley, severely. "And mybrother is on his way here, too; what will Edward say?""Poor Sir Henry, we have judged thee hardly, I fear, but we must tryto make amends for it now," said the dame sympathetically."She _must_ be found; she _shall_," interrupted the baron, emphasisingthe last word with a stamp of the foot. "Manners shall suffer thoughI--""Tush, Sir George, let them go," interrupted his good lady. "They willwant to return soon enough.""Nay, she must be traced and brought home again," said Stanley."Edward would die of chagrin else.""She shall be found," repeated the baron decisively.De la Zouch had mentally calculated that a slight relapse in hiscondition would probably arouse a wider feeling of sympathy for him,and to secure this end he closed his eyes and gasped for breath, butthe feeling of suspicion was too firmly rooted to be dispelled soeasily, and he opened his eyes again to find his companions as coldand unsympathetic as before."You have not told us all," exclaimed Crowleigh. "Manners would neverleave his host in so graceless a style, I know.""Have I not told thee the truth, Sir George?" De la Zouch meeklyappealed, "and do not these rents and scars bear me out? 'Tis a prettyreward for a noble fight is this," and he finished with a sigh ofprofound discontent."I believe thee," returned the baron slowly, to whom the evidence ofthe torn garments and De la Zouch's wounds appeared irresistible."And was not my poor horse lamed by the miscreants, who would havekilled it outright had I not interposed myself?" continued Sir Henry."Are all these things to count as naught, and is not the absence ofthe lovers itself sufficient proof? What more do you require? Whathave you to disprove these things? Why should you doubt me?" and helooked round in triumph, feeling sure that his reply was perfectlyunanswerable."He speaks the truth, Sir Thomas," said the old knight. "We owe a debtof gratitude to thee, Sir Henry.""I found this knife where De la Zouch was lying," said Stanleybluntly. "I thought it was his, and so I brought it for him."De la Zouch gazed with horror upon the tell-tale weapon, but in aninstant he decided how to parry the thrust."'Tis mine," he cried, hastily snatching it away. "The villainswrested it from my grasp.""And part of the blade was buried in the horse's flank," pursued SirThomas. "I discovered it there when the horse dashed into the yardcovered with blood and foam.""The wretches!" interjected De la Zouch."And yet, Sir Henry, methought the struggle took place at Cromford,and that would be nigh three miles from where I found the knife."Sir Henry turned livid with anger, and was at a loss how to reply,when Lady Vernon fortunately came to the rescue."You struggled worthily, sir knight," said she, "and I would that thecause had been more worthy of thy mettle. We cannot doubt thee more.""I cannot contradict thee," went on Margaret's lover, "but you willshow us the exact scene of the fray, Sir Henry, of course?""Assuredly I will, to-morrow--if I am well enough," he addedcarefully.Sir George Vernon noted the answer with displeasure. He was not verystrong in his belief of Sir Henry's innocence as yet, though theevidence in De la Zouch's favour would have been decisive enough forhim had not Stanley shaken it so."Has thy Dorothy forsaken thee, then, Sir George?" asked Crowleighpertinently."Why no, Sir Everard--yes; that is--I cannot say," he hopelesslyreplied. "It must be so, and yet, no! I cannot believe it either."De la Zouch ground his teeth in ill-suppressed rage. Matters had takena decidedly unfavourable turn; he was being sorely worsted, and hewished himself far away. The suspicions of Sir Thomas Stanley werepressing uncomfortably near him, and he found himself in a quandaryhow to evade them."I am doubted, Sir George, I see," he said angrily. "Lady Vernonis the only one who does me justice. I will go. Your deed shall beblazoned to the world. Is this the boasted hospitality of the King ofthe Peak?--then I disdain it. I shall shake the dust off my feet andshall depart at once, and you will find out when too late that youdrove away in such a scurvy fashion the truest friend you ever had,"and boiling over with well-simulated fury, De la Zouch leapt fromhis chair and passed through the doorway, chuckling to himself at thesuccess of his little scheme to extricate himself.He was liberated now from the awkwardness of his false position. Hisday's rest and the attention he had received had done wonders towardseffecting his recovery, and ordering a horse to be saddled, a fewminutes later he passed out of the precincts of the Hall, and hopingthat he would never have occasion to return, he mustered up hisstrength and started out upon a midnight ride to Ashby.CHAPTER XXIV.THE ESCAPE.                                But in these cases  We still have judgment that we but teach  Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return  To plague th' inventor; this evil-handed justice  Commends th' ingredients of our poisoned chalice  To our own lips.  SHAKESPEAKE.When Eustace delivered his charges into the hands of the chamberlainat Ashby his task was ended, and he had no further responsibility inthe matter.The rest afforded him by the journey had the effect of refreshing JohnManners to a considerable degree, and when he stood before Sir Henry'sdeputy he felt well able to take care of himself and quite capable ofresisting any unwarrantable liberties that they might attempt to takewith him.Simon Greenwood, the chamberlain of Ashby Castle, was a fit personto represent his lord. Indeed, had Sir Henry searched throughoutthe length and breadth of the land, he would probably never havediscovered a man more after his own heart, or a servant who would haveso faithfully aided him in the many questionable transactions in whichhe was from time to time engaged. He had grown up on the estate. Hisfather had served the former lord of the manor, and entering intohis master's service when quite a youth, Simon had flourished on thesuccess of his numerous petty stratagems; he had supplanted those whohad been above him, and now, as the right hand of his lord, he wasever eager to distinguish himself in Sir Henry's eyes.He glanced at the two prisoners with an air of haughty contempt whichwould have done credit to De la Zouch himself."So you are John Manners, eh?" he drawled out at length.Manners looked at him disdainfully, but returned no answer."And you be Miss Dorothy, I suspect," he went on with a mostunprepossessing leer."You will remember my lord's instructions, Simon," interrupted thepage."Yes, yes, of course; be off, I know. I am not going to hurt her,"replied the chamberlain. "Well, Mistress Dorothy, I have got to takeparticular care of you," he continued, ironically."And of Master Manners, too, I hope," she fearlessly replied, notnoticing the hidden meaning of his remark. "Remember that he is agentleman.""Yes, oh yes," returned the man, with a hideous grin, "we have gotto take particular care of him as well. He will sleep downstairsfor awhile," and he laughed with a coarse guffaw, again and againrepeated, at his own joke."Enough of this, sirrah," broke in Manners, sternly."We are not here to amuse you. There will be a host of our friendshere soon to deliver us, so thou had'st best beware of what thoudo'st."Simon scowled darkly, but Manners's threat had its effect, and herestrained his temper."I care not," he replied, "so long as Sir Henry be here. I shall butobey my instructions nor more nor less.""And what are they?""You shall find that out for yourself in good time.""And remember that though I am within your power, I am the nephew ofan earl, and have friends at Court who will avenge me on your lord,"Manners pursued."Then I shall put you in a safe place."The man was longing to assert his authority, but the bearing of theprisoner thoroughly cowed him, and he felt helplessly bound to be morecivil to him than he wished."And what about this lady?" asked Manners."Sir Henry's instructions apply equally to her as to you," he replied."If she is treated ill you shall answer for it," said Manners,fiercely, "so I bid you look to it that you treat her well.""Teach me not," Simon hastily broke in. "I know what is expectedof me, and, mark me, I shall do it. Captives ought not to be tooconceited, mark that, too, an it please you.""Enough, sirrah, cease thy prating. I am no fool.""Take him away; take him to the old dungeon," cried Simon, whosewrath was fast gaining mastery over him; "and mind you double lock thedoor.""The dungeon!" shrieked Dorothy. "No, not the dungeon."Manners looked round, but there was no chance of escape, nor would hehave cared to have left Dorothy in such a position, even had the waybeen clear."Sir Henry said he was to be kept in the North Tower," venturedEustace."Did he, indeed," sneeringly retorted the chamberlain. "You had betterbe off or I will have you whipped;" and smarting under the rejoinder,Eustace, who considered prudence the better part of valour, took thehint so broadly given and retired.An hour later, as Manners sat brooding in his deep and lonely dungeon,he was startled by hearing the key turn slowly in the lock, and amoment later Eustace slipped into the cell and the door was closed andlocked again."Oh, Master Manners," he cried, as he dropped on his knees, "this isa shameful thing; what can I do, I would help thee if I might? I amdisgusted with my lord; I loathe him and I shall flee from him.""'Tis no fault of thine, thou art young," kindly responded Manners,"but canst thou tell me aught of Mistress Dorothy Vernon?""She is safe in the topmost room of the tower," he replied."Is she in danger yet?""Nay, she is safe, and will be treated well. Simon Greenwood's damesays my lord left strange commands about her comfort, and she hasalready rated Simon soundly for his rudeness to the maiden.""Hist," whispered a voice through the keyhole, "Simon is coming."Eustace threw up his hands in blank despair. "O, Master Manners," heejaculated, "I am lost; Simon, would kill me if he finds me here.""Creep under there," replied the prisoner, quickly; "it is dark, and Iwill befriend thee."The page obeyed, and he was not a moment too soon; before he couldcomfortably ensconce himself in the damp and fusty hole under thestone bench, the door opened and the chamberlain entered.He was flushed with wine, and not at all the same cool, calculated manwho had stood before the captive an hour before."Well, my hearty," he exclaimed, as he seated himself upon the stonebench just over the gasping page, "things are rather bad, eh?""Begone," said Manners, curtly."Nay, now, that's hardly polite," he replied. "We will tame you downwith the chains; 'tis many a year since I saw them used, and it wouldbe quite a treat to see them on somebody once again," and he kickedthe rusty manacles which lay upon the ground."You dare not, and you know it," retorted Manners fiercely; and, drunkas the man was, he cowered back beneath the glance."Ah, well, you are safe enough as you are, I reckon," he returned,"and I am taking care of Doll for you," he added with a sickeninggrin.Dorothy's lover started forward as the name of the maiden waspronounced."Scoundrel!" he cried, "weak as I am I would thrash thee well for suchpresumption, were I sure you would not visit your displeasure uponher.""Do as you list," was the coarse reply, "but I swear Doll is a prettylass.""Come here, you lout," exclaimed a shrill voice, as the door openedand admitted a buxom woman of forty or thereabouts. "I have found youat last; come out with you," and she emphasised the command by a smartclout on his head.Simon turned quickly round and prepared to retaliate, but quailingunder the stern glance of his better half, he obeyed her will, andmeekly slunk out through the open door."I'll teach him, sir, how to behave to his betters," said the woman,turning to Manners. "He shall have a thrashing for this."Much amused, the captive esquire thanked her warmly for her kindness."But I have another favour to seek at your hands," he said. "I havehad naught to eat as yet, and it is now evening.""The dial only points to three as yet, sir knight," replied the dame,who was not quite certain of the quality of the prisoner, "but youshall have some food.""Only three! Ah, well. And Mistress Dorothy?" he anxiously inquired."She is doing well. She has had a meal already. I have her under myown care, the sweet creature; heaven bless her! I had come to thee ather request to bid thee be of good cheer.""Aye, heaven bless her, for she is in a sorry fix," assented Manners."Tend her well, and I will well reward thee. Thou shalt have suchgauds as thy neighbours shall turn green with envy at the sight ofthee.""I want them not," was the short reply, and Simon Greenwood's damepassed out of the dungeon, leaving Manners alone with the page.The door had barely closed before Eustace emerged from hisuncomfortable retreat, covered with insects of many kinds."Ha, ha!" he laughed. "Simon boasts that he cares for no man, save hislord; but he has to care for Dame Greenwood, though, ha, ha! I wouldeven venture in that vile hole once more to see him thwacked again.""Thank heaven Mistress Vernon is safe," said Manners. "Simon will notdisturb her, think you?""Not he, sir, never fear. Simon Greenwood knows better than that; and,see, I have brought thee this," and the page pulled out a dagger andoffered it to him."Nay, put it back," said Manners kindly. "I would not kill my gaoler,he is but performing his commands.""But if it were for Sir Henry De la Zouch?""Ha! then I might, perchance.""You have much to forgive me," continued the page, "for I have donethee grievous wrong.""How? Thou art but a lad, and I have seen thee only once before?""It was then, at the hawking party, when Sir Henry slew the pedlar. Ithas haunted me ever since."Manners was intensely surprised at this announcement. It was, indeed,startling and important news. The mystery was solved at last."It was Sir Henry, then!" he exclaimed. "I might have guessed asmuch.""It was Sir Henry, and I witnessed it, but I will tell theeafterwards. Listen, for time is short. Pierce this corner with thedagger; do it quickly, for the wall is thick. There is a passage onthe other side, of which none knows save my master and myself. Thewall is softest here, and I will help thee from the other side: butI must make thy gaoler drunk. He is full fond of ale, so you may beassured that you will be unmolested, and I will have horses saddledat a distance. Adieu until to-night," and not heeding the thanks whichManners poured out from his grateful heart, he rapped at the door sothat he might pass out.The meal arrived in good time. A tankard of ale and a slice of baconwith wheaten bread, more than he could eat.It was not long before Manners had satisfied his hunger, and in hisfeverish anxiety he could barely wait to hear Eustace's cheery voiceexclaim to the gaoler, "Mat, I have brought thee some ale for lettingme in to see the prisoner.""Welcome it is," was the reply, and very soon a stentorian snoreannounced to the captive that his guardian had fallen into a drunkenslumber, and told him that he might venture to set about his work withsafety.An hour's labour proved very unsatisfactory, for the wall was muchharder than he had anticipated, and in spite of the goodwill withwhich he worked, the injuries he had received the day before seriouslyretarded his efforts.Eustace, however, was working with more success on the other side, andin a couple more hours a hole, sufficiently wide for Manners to creepthrough, had been made, and in a few more minutes Dorothy's betrothedwas a free man again, urging his steed to the utmost, to fetch helpfrom Haddon, and to capture the miscreant knight who had effected somuch evil.CHAPTER XXV.THE LAST OF DE LA ZOUCH.  Face to face with the past he stands,  With guilty soul, and blood-stained hands;    And his deeds rise up against him.  Too weak to win, he cannot fly,  He begs for life and fears to die,    But justice overtakes him.The second day's search for Dorothy proved as ineffectual as thefirst, and yielding with ill grace to the counsel of his friends, SirGeorge Vernon submitted to retire from active search, and agreedto remain at Haddon while others scoured the country round for thetruants."It is of no use," said the baron, "I cannot sleep. I shall notattempt it to-night either. It is enough that I should consent to stayat home.""But you must have rest," expostulated Stanley, "or you will quicklybreak down under the strain.""I shall stay here, I tell you," was the dogged reply, "and receivethe reports as they come in. There are four or five out yet.""Has Crowleigh returned?" asked Sir Thomas abruptly."Not yet; may he bring her back.""'Tis most queer," soliloquised the young knight. "I cannot understandit, I confess. Do you suspect him, Sir George?""No, I don't," he replied, bluntly, "do you?""I do now. I suspect the whole lot of them; and that Manners and De laZouch are at heart at daggers drawn.""And Doll?""As for her," continued Sir Thomas, demurely; "she is far too fondof Manners. I thought we should have trouble with her, for she has astubborn will.""Like Lady Maude," exclaimed Sir George sententiously, "but go! Leaveme alone; you must be in the saddle early in the morning, and you atall events require rest.""Will nothing shake your determination?" pursued Stanley, as he lookedin unfeigned pity at the toil-worn, care-riven brow of the unfortunatebaron. "You will make yourself far worse else.""I shall sit and wait. Send me in Father Nicholas, for he alone shallbear me company.""Well, well," he replied, "I would persuade thee if I could SirGeorge, but since I cannot do that I will go, but you should rest,"and leaving these words to ring in the baron's ears, the youngnobleman retired to his couch and left the baron alone.The sun had not long risen ere he was with Sir George Vernon again.His horse was ready to carry him once more upon the search, and hehimself was ready for the ride. He had expected to find the baronasleep, but in this he was disappointed, for Sir George sat beside thetable deep in converse with the priest. Crowleigh had returned, and sohad the rest, but their tales were alike despondent; none of them haddiscovered a trace, and good Father Nicholas had found it a difficulttask under the circumstances to revive the drooping spirit of hismaster."No luck, Sir Thomas, naught but ill news," said the baron, as hereplied to his friend's greeting; "'tis an ill wind this. There isnever a trace as yet, and----""Hist!" interrupted Margaret's lover. "I hear the sounds of gallopinghoofs."Sir George opened the casement window, and peered out into the gloom."I cannot see them yet," he exclaimed, "but there are more than one,and they are nearing fast. If it should be Dorothy," he said with asigh of intense feeling; "what joy!""Aye, there are more than one," said Stanley. "We cannot see themhere. Hark, they are thundering at the gate even now; let us go andmeet them, and heaven grant, whoever it may be, that they bring goodnews.""Amen," ejaculated the baron fervently, and his prayer was echoed bythe rest.Before they could reach the gate, the horseman had been admitted;and as Sir George and his friends stepped into the yard theyrecognised--not the features of Sir Edward Stanley, as Margaret'slover secretly thought, but the well-known form of Manners."How!--by my halidame, what meaneth this?" exclaimed the baron,delighted beyond measure to see the esquire again. "Tell me, Manners,where my Dorothy is?""Speak fair words," cautioned Stanley, with a frown."Dorothy!" gasped her lover. "Hasten, I beseech thee. She is at Ashby.Where is De la Zouch, the villain?""On his way home," answered Sir Thomas.Manners groaned aloud."Heaven forfend us, then," he cried. "He is a monster of iniquity. Wemust hasten back, an you would rescue Dorothy.""There is some conspiracy in this," exclaimed Stanley. "Here is De laZouch's page lurking behind these horses. Come hither, sirrah, for Irecognise thee well. 'Twere a bold thing of thee to venture on so rashan errand here."Eustace was pushed unwillingly forward, and as he stood before theknight his knees knocked together under the terrible frowns that werebestowed upon him."Nay, it is right," expostulated Manners. "Leave him alone, SirThomas, he will be of service to us yet.""But where is Dorothy?" asked the impatient baron. "What has become ofher? Why does she not return with thee?""De la Zouch waylaid us," answered the esquire, "and we fell into histrap. I have ridden hard from Ashby since the sun last set. I escapedhis dungeon by the aid of this, his page, to save poor Dorothy. I amfaint from my bruises and hard riding. Cannot you believe me?""Sir Henry," replied the baron, with a sneer. "Sir Henry told us asimilar story, but then it was you who had waylaid him.""The villain!" groaned Manners, "I will have revenge.""That's just what he called you," said Sir Thomas, promptly. "Two of atrade never agree.""My master felled Master Manners to the ground himself," interposedthe page; "or rather, I mean he struck him senseless while he layinjured on the ground.""And he carried Doll away to his castle," said Manners. "I shallavenge her, though. I can understand your suspicions now, and forgiveyou, for De la Zouch has played you false as well as me, and hasreturned to his castle now to reap the reward of his villainy. I shallpursue him, though. He sought my life, defamed my name, imprisoned me,and now he has gone when I get here. Eustace," he added, turning tothe page, "let us return; I will gather friends of my own with whichto rescue her, and I shall be strong till I have met and paid myenemy. God grant we may yet be in time. Crowleigh, you believe me? Youwill come, and, mayhap, we may intercept him ere his journey's end,for he cannot long be gone.""Nay, nay, man; stay and have thy wound attended to," said the baronsympathetically. "Thou'rt honest, I would swear.""And yesterday he seemed well nigh dead," said Eustace, referring toManners. "Sure I am he can ride no longer. We rode hard here, and wellI trow his wound--""Stay not for me," interrupted Manners. "This is precious time. Icommand you to hasten or it will be too late, for when De la Zouchdiscovers I am gone, he will certainly remove her to another place.""We will," enthusiastically shouted Sir George, and in the twinklingof an eye he seized hold of the alarm-bell rope and in an instantawakened the tired sleepers of the neighbourhood by its clang."And thou art his page," said Stanley. "Thou wilt show us the way.""Aye, that I will an it please you, my lord, but I will never returnto him.""Meg, we are off," exclaimed Sir Thomas to his betrothed, who hadhastily descended from her own room, startled at the unusual noisein the courtyard at that early hour. "We are going to bring Dorothyback."'"Where is she?""At Ashby Castle, so Master Manners saith," he replied. "You will gowith us, I hope," he added, turning round to the esquire. "You willwant to revenge yourself.""I will avenge her, yes;" he responded, not heeding the convert sneer,"that I will right heartily."Meanwhile lanterns had been glimmering in the lower portion of theyard; men had been frantically shouting to each other, and theirvoices had mingled with the trampling of horses' feet; and now,everything being ready, the fact was announced, and in a few minutesthe cavalcade started out upon its expedition, determined not onlyto rescue the maiden, but also to administer a sharp and well-meritedrebuke upon the faithless knight who had decoyed her away.De la Zouch arrived at his castle soon after the party started fromHaddon, and although he had failed to lull the Vernons into a falsebelief in his fidelity, yet he had put them on a wrong scent, and hecongratulated himself inasmuch as he had left behind him no strongsuspicion of the truth.Simon Greenwood had retired to rest. Sir Henry was not expected homeso soon. Indeed, he had told his chamberlain confidentially that ifevents progressed aright he should probably not return for a week ormaybe more, and the sudden return of his lord found the worthy deputyin nowise prepared to meet him, and he had his good dame to thankthat, inasmuch as she had deprived him of liquor sufficient to makehim drunk, he was in no worse condition than he happened to be."Ha, Simon," exclaimed the knight, as that functionary put in anappearance, "I am back again, you see.""Troth, and in good time, too, my lord.""Aye, I have come pretty quick, I assure you. The birds are safe, eh?""Safe enough, I would stake my head on that.""That's right, I knew I could trust you, Simon. I am hungry though,and by all the saints in the calendar, I am sore and stiff as well. Iam injured, too, for my horse fell down with me and crushed my leg.""You look it, my lord, and worse," exclaimed Dame Greenwood. "You lookbadly hurt.""Ah, my own fault, my own fault; I have been a fool. Eustace himselfcould not have ridden worse. Where is Eustace, I have not seen himyet?"Simon looked inquiringly at his better half, and to his discomfiture,she stolidly returned the glance. Neither of them appeared to knowanything of his whereabouts. In the scuffle and worry of the time hehad been forgotten, and they had to make the best defence they could."Methinks he is paying a visit to some fair damsel of the town, SirHenry, with his dulcimer," suggested the dame. "I saw him with themusic some while before the gates were closed.""He was prating this and that to me, my lord," added Simon, who foundhis tongue at length, "until I threatened to whip him. He sneaked awayquick enough then, ha, ha!""Ha, ha!" laughed the knight, as he divested himself, with Simon'said, of his riding coat, "he would order thee about, eh? But, by myfaith, man, I am hungry, I swear. I am quite ready to sup when I haveseen my prisoners."Dame Greenwood took the hint and went out to procure the meal. "SirHenry is in wonderful good humour to-night," she murmured, "and 'tis agood thing, too for Simon, that he is. What a fool he would be withoutme," and comforting herself with this reflection, she hastened to obeyher lord's behests."Dorothy is in the tower?" asked Sir Henry as he ravenously fell uponhis meal. "How is she now? Proud, I suppose, eh?""Humph! well enough, though a trifle obstinate.""Well, we will go and see her. And Manners, what of him?""Ha! high and haughty. Rides the high horse, my lord. Has friends atCourt and friends all around coming to release him.""A pretty tale, truly, Simon," laughed the knight, as he finished hishasty meal and ordered some more spiced wine to drink."Yes, my lord," replied the chamberlain. "So I put him in the olddungeon.""Eh, what! You have put him where?" asked Sir Henry, turning backbreathlessly. "You idiot, you; where are the keys?""In the old dungeon, I said," explained the wonder-strickenchamberlain. "The safest part of the castle, my lord.""Where are the keys?" thundered his master. "Quick!"Simon handed them over, and struck with intense amazement at thesudden and complete change in his master's manner, he awaited thecourse of events."Follow me," said the knight, sharply, as he opened the door andstarted across the yard. "Did I not command thee to put him in thetower?" he cried.Simon returned no answer. He was stupified. His head swam, and he halfpersuaded himself as he followed his master across the yard that hewas the victim of some dread nightmare."See here!" exclaimed Sir Henry as he kicked the drunken gaoleraside and sharply awoke him; "and here!" he added, as he unlockedthe ponderous door and held the glimmering lantern up. "See here," hecried, "what's this?" and he pushed the wondering Simon in."Why--how! He has gone," he gasped."Of course he has."And true it was. The worst fears of De la Zouch were realised.Manners, as we already know, had found out the secret of the dungeon,and his flight was only just discovered.Sir Henry de la Zouch was prompt in action, and immediately uponsatisfying himself of Dorothy's safety, he set out, accompanied bya number of his retainers, to find her lover, feeling pretty wellconvinced that he would be discovered lurking somewhere in theneighbouring woods. It was in vain they searched. Under the eye oftheir ubiquitous lord, the tired followers beat every copse and glade,and it was not until the afternoon was well advanced that the Knightof Ashby relinquished the search and thought of turning back."Hark!" said Simon to his master, as the latter gave the order toreturn, "I hear the tread of horse.""We will advance, then," was the reply, and the unwilling company oncemore turned their backs upon their homes, and marched further into theforest.The two parties had for some time unconsciously been approaching eachother, and when the quick ears of the chamberlain had detected theproximity of Sir George Vernon and his followers, they were onlyseparated from each other by a narrow strip of thickly-grown wood, anda minute or two sufficed to bring them into collision."Ha, ha!" shouted Sir George, as he sighted the faithless knight."Ha, ha, torn clothes, we have you now. Here the villain is," and hespurred his horse forward to cope with his enemies single-handed.De la Zouch was amazed and staggered at the sight, and without waitingto meet the baron he rode back to his party, hotly pursued by the Kingof the Peak and his men of Derbyshire."Stay," cried Manners, "we will settle this between ourselves"; andwithout waiting for assistance he dashed forward at De la Zouch, andmade a furious onslaught upon him.It was no tournament now; it was a struggle for life itself! Andwhilst Dorothy's lover was animated by a stern resolve to punish hisfoe, at whatever the cost, De la Zouch fought like a madman, becausehe fought with a halter round his neck.As for the latter's followers, at the first charge, with one accordthey turned, and leaving their lord, for whom they had little love, tomeet his fate, they tried to save themselves by flight.The struggle was not prolonged. Manners was by far the betterswordsman of the two, and De la Zouch, disheartened at the flight ofhis followers gradually weakened in his attack, and at length fellmortally wounded, leaving no one now to hinder them from marchingvictoriously on to Ashby.CHAPTER XXVI.A DISGUISED LOVER.  Imperious beauty,  Treading upon the neck of understanding,  Compelled me to put off my natural shape  Of loyal duty, to disguise myself.  MASSINGERThe autumn winds were howling among the trees and scattering the laterleaves in all directions, when, with the fall of twilight, a gentleknock was heard at the door of the hut of the chief forester ofHaddon.A lonely traveller stood outside, shivering in his rough and scantygarments as he stood in the still evening breeze, and as he waitedexpectantly at the unopened door he heard a gruff voice inside thecottage trolling forth a simple ballad of the chase.He waited patiently until the song was finished, and then, takingcourage, he tapped again much louder than before, and was rewarded byhearing footsteps advance towards the threshold, and a moment laterthe crazy portal was standing open, and the unkempt head of theforester peered inquiringly out."What now, what now," he inquired, as his eye lighted upon the strangefigure before him; "who and what art thou?""Art thou Roger the forester?" asked the wanderer in reply."Roger Morton, at your service, yes.""Then, by the love of heaven, I beseech thee let me in.""Well, there are few ask that favour off me, but none shall ever sayI turned an empty mouth away at night, e'en though it were a beggar's.Come in."Thankful indeed to receive so ready an invitation, the travellerentered the hospitable cottage."I am not a beggar, though, forsooth," he began, as he seated himselfupon the log which did duty for a seat. "You do not recognise me,Roger, I perceive.""Roger Morton, I repeat it, at your service.""Well, then, Roger Morton, be it so, but yet you seem to know me not.""Odds, troth," ejaculated the forester, "I seem to know thee somewhat;we have met before.""A many times, Roger.""Roger Morton.""Well, well, Roger Morton, I am apt to forget myself.""Ha! you are Nathan Grene," interrupted the man, as he laid before hisguest some cheese and a mug of new milk. "I know your voice.""Are we alone?" whispered the traveller."We are," replied Roger, as he picked up a stout stick with which todefend himself, "but he would be a bold man to tackle me alone, for Ican take care of myself full well;" and he quickly placed himself inan attitude of defence."Tut, I mean no ill, 'tis a matter of secrecy which I am about toentrust you with; read this," and pulling up a piece of cord whichsuspended from his neck, he drew up a tiny casket from his bosom, and,opening it, he drew out a neatly-folded slip of paper and held it out.Slowly and laboriously Roger spelled the missive out, and havingsucceeded at last in making himself master of its contents, hewhistled with surprise, and closely scanned the visage of his guest."What a change!" he exclaimed at length. "What will the baron say?""Hush, speak gently, or we shall be overheard. The baron must notknow. Can you be trusted?""Surely. And you are Master Manners who killed that De la Zouch. Tothink of it, now."John Manners it was. His rescue of Dorothy had advanced his suit butlittle. Lady Vernon had been too proud to own herself defeated, andSir George had passed his word to the Stanleys and was bound to keepto his promise, while Edward Stanley, who had arrived at Haddon soonafter the maiden's rescue, had taken a dislike to his rival and hadmade matters so uncomfortable for him at the Hall that the unfortunateesquire had found it necessary to take the hint and withdraw himselffrom Haddon.But though driven away he was not defeated, for he yet found means ofhearing from his betrothed, and even occasionally to correspondwith her, but he soon found that the long absence grew more and moreunendurable, until at last he determined to venture forward at everyrisk to be near her again."And so they would force Mistress Dorothy to marry Sir ThomasStanley's brother?" said the forester after a pause, as he handed thelittle missive back."Yes, and Dorothy conjures you to help us. You will do it, will younot?""So good as she has been to my poor little Lettice, yes, that I willdo; but how?""I must be a forester.""'Tis a rough life for such as thee, Master Manners.""Yes.""And it is dangerous, too, at times.""Aye, I know.""And then if you were to be discovered?""Don't talk of ifs, man. I talked it all over with Dorothy long ago.She could not dissuade me, nor can you. I am ready for anything forher sake.""Heaven bless her. I--""Aye, heaven bless her," interrupted Manners. "I shall wed her yet, ifheaven does but bless her.""You are decided to join our craft, then?" asked Roger. "We are twowoodmen short, as luck will have it.""I have come to be one, then," replied Manners. "I am disguised forthat alone."And so it came to pass that John Manners, the nephew of an earl,whose uncle, even now, was high in favour with the Queen, and who hadhimself bowed the knee on more than one occasion before her throne,had become a woodsman, and joined the foresters of Sir George Vernon.Love, and love alone, could have induced him to humble himself somuch. It was for love of Dorothy that he turned his back upon theRoyal Court; and now, to win his bride, he was content, nay happy, todiscard his own station in life, and take upon himself the lot of acommon woodsman.Fortune was indeed leading him by strange paths, but he trusted shewould lead him to the prize at last.Dorothy's lot, meanwhile, had not been a bright one. Edward Stanleywas relentless, and in answer to her piteous appeals that she lovedhim not, he cited the baron's words, referred her to the promise SirGeorge had rashly made to Sir Thomas; he declared that he loved herfervently, and, had it not been for the baron's interference, wouldhave carried her off at the end of a month and have married herstraightway.Manners was sternly forbidden her; the gates of Haddon were closedagainst him, and even an excuse was found to keep Crowleigh away aswell. It was fondly hoped that these stringent measures would have theeffect of bringing Dorothy to her senses, but their plans completelyfailed. The maiden began to sicken. The colour fled from her rosycheeks, and she began to grow rapidly worse. Lady Vernon ascribed itto mere obstinacy, and grew impatient with her, and made her worsethan she would otherwise have been by finding fault with everythingshe did; and by setting her long tasks of tenter-stitching to perform,making her unhappy lot more miserable still. The only friend she hadto whom she could unbosom her secrets was her maid Lettice, and duringthis time the hearts of the two girls were knitted closely together,the one by a craving for sympathy, and the other drawn to love by thedual bond of love and pity.Many a night had these two wept together in the darkness and silenceof an unlighted room, and many a time had Dorothy laid her head uponher tire-maid's knee and sobbed until with swollen eyes she had sobbedherself to sleep; and many a night had Dorothy sat alone, forbidden toleave the Hall, while her maid had gone out on a fruitless errand todiscover if her lover had yet come."Not yet?" she would ask, as the maid returned, and Lettice had echoed"Not yet," in reply, until she hated the very sound of the words."O, Lettice, he has not forgotten me?" she would sob distractedly, asshe saw the disappointed face return."No, never, my lady. Something has happened, surely.""It must be so," her mistress would reply, and then she would relapseinto silence.To-night Dorothy sat alone. Her eyes were heavy, for she hadbeen weeping long. Her sky seemed overcast; there was not a riftdiscoverable anywhere, and she was almost broken-hearted. Nearly twomonths had passed, and no sign of her lover had she seen to brightenher. Edward had told her that her lover had renounced her, and inspite of herself she almost began to believe the story. Lettice hadgone out on her mission once more, but she questioned whether shewould ever go again, and she prepared herself, as the time for themaid's return drew nigh, to receive the usual answer, "No, my lady,not yet."Later than usual Dorothy heard her well-known footstep lightlytripping along the passage. The very lateness of her return inspiredher with a ray of hope, and opening the door, she went out to meether."Has he come, Lettice, has he come?" she eagerly exclaimed, varyingfor once her usual despondent query. And, as she asked, her heartfluttered wildly within her, and the hot blood mounted to her cheeks."I have news of him for thee," returned the maid, gaily.Dorothy was too overcome to speak. The long-expected news had come atlast; she fell upon the tire-maid's neck and wept tears of joy, whileLettice drew her unresistingly along, and led her to her little roomagain."There," she said, as she closed the doors so that none might hear."Master Manners sends his duty to thee, my lady.""His _duty_, indeed," she exclaimed, with drooping eyes; "why not hislove forsooth?""'Twas love he said," returned the maid. "He is a forester.""A forester!" echoed Dorothy in amazement. "My John a forester! Not acommon woodman, Lettice, surely?""Aye, but he is. He has done it for thy sake. It was the only way.""And they told me he had forsaken me. Was ever man so noble as he?""He has sent thee this," said Lettice, as she handed a letter to hermistress. "'Tis but roughly done, but he said you would forgive it,and he sealed it with a score of kisses before he gave it me."Dorothy hastily took up the note and read it. Evidently it pleasedher well, for as she perused its contents her countenance flushed withpleasure."Lettice," she exclaimed, "only you and I, besides your father, knowthat Hubert is the same as Master Manners. We must keep it secret asthe grave itself. Is he well disguised?""In truth, I knew him not until he called me by name.""'Tis well. He runs a fearful risk. Edward or Thomas Stanley would aslief kill him as they would a dog did they but recognise him again.""He has been ill, and he is deadly thin.""Poor John. He tells me so. I understand all now.""That will disguise him better than aught else, he said.""Perhaps it is so, but 'tis a cruel disguise," said Dorothysympathetically. "Did he give thee any word for me?""Naught, save that I was to tell thee he would write anon, as he couldnot see thee. He will hide the letters in the tree that Father Philipfell against; there is a hole in it, and he has shown it me. But youwill see him soon; he wears a peacock's feather in his cap.""I should know him well enough without a sign," said Dorothydecisively, "and he were best without it, for it might lead him intoperil.""Father will send him with the logs," pursued Lettice. "He came butyesternight.""Hush, Lettice, is not that Lady Maude coming?""Gramercy no, I hope not, or it might fare ill with us," said themaid, "but hide the letter, for the love of heaven do," she addedquickly as the footsteps quickly approached.Quick as thought Doll transferred the missive into her pocket, and,with a guilty look which she vainly strove to hide, she turned tobrave Lady Vernon.Lady Vernon it was, but she passed hurriedly along the corridor, andhaving escaped thus luckily so far, they waited not to tempt fortuneagain, but bidding each other an affectionate "Good-night," Letticewithdrew, and left Dorothy alone with her newly-gotten joy.CHAPTER XXVII.A NARROW ESCAPE.  The moon in pearly light may steep    The still blue air;  The rose hath ceased to droop and weep,    For lo! her joy is there.  He sings to her, and o'er the trees    She hears his sweet notes swim,  The world may weary--she but hears    Her love, and hears but him.  P.J. BAILEY.John Manners found life uncomfortable enough in the new condition oflife in which he had placed himself. The work was hard, and the farewas rough. There was no difference between his lot and the lot ofthose around him, and yet, in spite of this, he was looked ataskance by his new companions, while to crown all, he found very fewopportunities of meeting or seeing his beloved Dorothy.Often had he made arrangements to meet her at different trystingplaces, but, just as often had he waited patiently, only to bedisappointed by the non-arrival of his lady-love. In this sorry plighthe had been obliged to content himself with sending messages to herthrough Lettice, whom he constantly met at her father's hut; or,failing her, as a last resource he fell back upon communicating withhis lover through the unsatisfactory medium of the tree, where, notunfrequently, as he placed a fresh note in he found the previous oneuntouched.At last, however, after many fruitless attempts which would assuredlyhave effectually daunted less ardent lovers, they found themselvesonce more together in the woods. What bliss, what rapture, whatdelight, filled the heart of each as they gazed fondly at the other!Dorothy felt bright and lithesome as of yore, as she felt the touchof her lover's hands again. The weeks of misery through which she hadjust passed seemed but as a dream to her as she once more heard hischeery voice, and the haggard, careworn look, which had settledupon her fair face of late, was instantly dispelled as her betrothedimprinted a warm kiss upon her blushing cheeks. As for Manners, he wascompletely transported with delight, and for some moments he bathedhis hungry eyes in the sunshine of her beauty. To see her again hadbeen his dearest wish, and now she stood before him, and he felt thatall the sacrifices he had been called upon to make for the sake of hislove were more than compensated for as he heard her gently call him bythe old familiar name."John," she said."Well, dearest one; we are met once more.""You can trust me now?""Aye, indeed, I can," he replied, with glistening eyes. "Forgive me,Doll, I know you will.""I do; I did long ago. I knew you could not doubt me long. How good ofyou to come, and to risk so much--for my sake," she added, raising herlustrous eyes up to his."Nay, Doll, it were for my sake, too. I could not be far from theelong; the saints forfend I should. But tell me, Dorothy, how go ourfortunes now; I fear not well?""Alas, no! Lady Maude is stricter than ever," she replied. "Were I alazy serving-maid mine were a happier lot.""And Sir Edward, what of him?""He wooes me with threats. Was ever a maiden won thus, John? He vows Ishall be his bride, and O--""What, dearest?""Margaret is to be wedded soon, and Sir Edward swears there shall betwo weddings at the same time. He says I shall like him well enoughin time to come. Margaret wishes it, Lady Maude wishes it, Sir Thomaswishes it, and Edward Stanley says it shall be.""He knows it not," sturdily replied Manners, as he clasped her to hisbreast. "Our love is strong enough to conquer all that, Doll.""I hope it will. I think it will in the end," she replied, "but theway is very dark for us at present. But naught shall stay us now. Ourlove is too true not to win.""It shall!" he returned, decisively. "Be of good heart, my preciousone, we shall soon have passed all this and be happy together.""Heaven grant it," replied Dorothy, fervently, "but it is a terribletime now. With you exposed to danger every hour outside, and everyhand against me in the house, save Lettice, 'tis terrible, terrible!"and the maiden burst into tears."Poor Doll," said Manners, as he tenderly supported her. "Your lot ishard, but there will be a change ere long. The wind does not alwaysblow from one quarter, you know; it will alter soon.""I fear me not," replied the maiden disconsolately."Oh, surely, when they see what an unconquerable will thou hast. SirGeorge loves thee too well to lightly disregard thy happiness. Heloves you dearly; he will surely repent ere the time comes, for hehath a tender heart for thee."Dorothy laid her hand upon his arm and beckoned him to be still,pointing at the same time to a thick mass of the thick foliage withwhich they were surrounded."Hist," she whispered. "Methought I heard the sound of footsteps,listen!"She paused, and together they bent their heads and listened, butnothing was to be heard save the rustling of the leaves."'Twas thy fancy," exclaimed Manners, "thou art frightened.""I thought I saw the form of a man pass by those trees," she replied."It must be fancy, though, and yet, methought I saw him stop and thenpass on again.""Sir George will stand by thee," pursued Manners, "he loves theebetter than himself.""I know it, I know he loves me much, John; but he has promised me tothe Stanleys, and when I told him of our trothplight he laughed, andsaid he was doing it all for the best. He forbade me to mention yourname ever more, or even think of you again--as if you were not ever inmy mind.""Does not Lady Maude relent at all?""Lady Maude relent! Nay, rather does she grow more bitter against meday by day, and that I may forget thee she makes me tenter-stitch frommorn till eve. Even Margaret gives her voice bitterly against me now.""Thou hast no one to console thee, then?""Save Lettice, no.""Poor Dorothy. And Father Nicholas, what saith he? He is a friend ofmine.""He is so grave I have not mentioned it to him.""Then by my troth, Doll, bid him meet me here to-morrow night. Heshall help us, he shall befriend thee. Tell him all, he can be welltrusted, I wot, unless he has strangely changed since he hath takenthe cowl. Bid him come here alone and without fail."Soon, all too soon, the brief interview came to an end, and Dorothyhad to go back to the Hall, while her lover, having reluctantly partedfrom her when he dare accompany her no further, slowly wound his wayback to the sorry hut which served him, in common with the rest of hisfellows, as a home.He had no heart to join in the boisterous fun with which hiscompanions were making themselves merry as he entered, and passingthem unnoticed by, he took a seat in the furthest corner of the roomand watched the faggots as they blazed and burned away upon the hearthin front of him.Dorothy returned with a sad heart, too. The moment of bliss which hadso transported her with delight had passed away again, and she foundherself in pretty well the same downcast frame of mind in which shehad been before, for she knew not when she would see her lover again,and she dare not let herself ponder on the terrible risks her noblelover ran."Well, Dorothy," said Lady Maude, as she burst into the maiden's roomere Doll had found time to divest herself of hood and wimple, "thouart serving us a pretty trick. Thou would'st meet thy whilom lover allunbeknown to us, eh? Pick up thy things and follow me."It would have been worse than useless to have refused, and argument,Dorothy knew of old, at such a time would have been equally futile;so, while her blood almost froze with terror in her veins, she meeklyobeyed her step-mother and followed her through the long ballroom intothe banqueting-room below in a perfect agony of terror lest her loverhad been taken and was about to be confronted with her.The stone-flagged chamber, in which the festive table, which hascreaked under many a load of beef and venison, still stands ingrandeur all unique, was in full glory then. The musicians' gallerywas richly bedecked with gilt, and was adorned with antlers, thetrophies of many a chase, in place of the dingy, whitewash-spotted,pictures which, hang upon its walls to-day (and look as if they weresadly in need of a washing). Gay hunting-scenes, and a canvas onwhich, were delineated the forms of the Virgin and her Babe, met theeye and pleased it. A savoury odour of newly-baked cakes floated alongthe passage from the kitchens right into the room, and a piece oftapestry, one of Dorothy's first attempts, depended over the doorwayof the carved wooden screen to keep out draughts, and at the same timegive a warm and pleasing effect to the interior.It was into this room, in which sat the baron and Sir Thomas Stanley,looking terribly grave and severe, that Lady Vernon led poor Dorothy."Come hither, Dorothy," said the baron, as she entered.The "Dorothy" sounded ominous, and she advanced in great trepidation."You have been out without our knowledge," he exclaimed."Out; of course she has," interrupted Lady Vernon. "See, she cannotdeny it, she has the tokens of guilt upon her now," and she derisivelypointed at the tell-tale garments she had made her carry in."Hush, Maude," said the baron, "you will frighten her. Dorothy, youhave been with Manners," he added, turning severely towards her.Dorothy hung down her head, but vouchsafed no reply. She was in anagony of fear for the safety of her lover, but amid all her terrorsshe was resolved that no words should fall from her lips which mightbring trouble upon him."Aye, and with Master Manners again," repeated the dame."What have you to say, Dorothy?" asked Sir George quickly."Nothing," she replied."Then you _have_ been with him?""Nay, I said not so.""Of course she has," exclaimed Lady Vernon, "who can doubt it?""We heard Manners speaking; I could swear to it now," said Sir ThomasStanley."I fear it is even so, Dorothy," said the baron, not unkindly. "Thereis a guilty look upon thy face. Now tell us where he is and we willforgive thee thy share."Dorothy returned no answer. She was determined that no words of hersshould injure him."He saved my life," she replied, as the question was repeated."Tut, tell us where to find him, else thou wilt have enough tothank that stubborn will of thine for," interrupted the baroness,impatiently.There was a sound of footsteps just outside, and they all paused tolisten."'Tis Edward bringing Manners back," said Sir Thomas quietly. "Herethey come."The tapestry was quickly pushed aside, and the ruddy face of SirEdward Stanley insinuated itself between, the fringes and the screen,but it was not the face of a contented man, for it wore a disappointedlook."Bring him in," commanded the baron."Nay, I have not caught him yet," he ruefully replied. "Come and helpus, he has hidden himself amid the woodsmen's huts.""You go," said the baron, addressing Sir Thomas. "I will stay withDorothy"; and without waiting to be bidden a second time Sir ThomasStanley left his untasted supper on the table and joined in the searchfor Dorothy's forbidden lover.Meanwhile, the subject of all this commotion sat innocently gazingat the burning embers, watching the logs as they blazed up and thengradually disappeared into powder to be blown away by the first slightbreath of wind. Surely, he reflected, 'tis so with the baron's will;he is in the height of his determined fury now. But soon--and as thedoor opened, another puff of wind blew away the airy ashes of a oncestout log--aye, surely, his opposition will vanish like as that."Never a soul came in here, your lordship, for a long time back,"said Roger, deferentially doffing his cap. "Your lordship must bemistaken."Manners turned round and beheld, with a feeling akin to dismay, SirThomas Stanley and his brother just within the threshold of the door."Tut, tut, man," replied the knight, "I say he came in here; he wasseen to enter, and no one has passed out since then."Sir Thomas appealed to the others, but they were all unanimous insupporting their master, and replied in one chorus of surprise.Manners had not been seen for weeks, and not a soul among them had anyidea of his whereabouts."I suppose no one entered, then?" sneered the knight."No," replied Roger complacently, "not for a long time back.""Did he not come in here?" appealed Sir Thomas to those outside."Aye, aye," came the answer, "he did.""Then where is he?" demanded the knight fiercely."Nay, I swear by the Holy Virgin I saw him not," replied the sturdyforester, in perfect truth, for he had not noticed his arrival."Hugh came in last," said Lettice's lover, Will. "Hast thou seen aughtof this Manners of late, Hugh?"Manners' first impulse was to grapple with his pursuers, but hecontrolled himself, and trusting to the perfection of his disguise toscreen him, without a moment's hesitation he boldly answered in thenegative."Not I," he said, emphatically. "I left my axe just outside, and itlooks so like rain that I went to fetch it in, but I saw nobody; no,not a soul. Methinks it will rain hard, too, before the morning.""Tut," interrupted Sir Edward. "Did you hear anybody?""No, not even a mouse.""Then we must search. Out, men, and help us. The man that catcheshim shall be rewarded well. We must find him; he is hereabouts, forI heard his voice. A murrain on the fellow--all this trouble for awoman's whim."He glanced suspiciously round the cot, but finding no suspicioustokens he led them out and set them to work to discover him. Few ofthem, however, were zealous, for Manners had made himself popularamong them during his visits to the Hall. Dorothy they adored andthey were not at all anxious to bring sorrow upon her to oblige theimperious Stanleys. Besides these considerations, the whole affair wasso romantic that it seemed more like an acted ballad than a seriousreality while Manners' position appealed to them in such a powerfulfashion that they sympathised with him, and had not the search beenconducted immediately under the eyes of the two nobles it would havebeen far more half-hearted than it was. A few, and a few only, weretempted to diligence by the offer of reward, and made a display ofalacrity, and amongst the busiest, with a price upon his head, JohnManners searched vigilantly for himself.CHAPTER XXVIII.NOT YET  You might esteem him    A child for his might,  Or you may deem him    A coward through his flight.  But if she whom love honours    Be concealed from the day,  Set a thousand guards on her,    Love will find out the way.  ANON.If love cannot sharpen the faculties of mankind; if it cannot quickenthe perceptions; if it has not the power to make the deaf hear,the blind see, the lame walk--at least, sufficient for its ownsuccess--then, indeed--! But it is possessed of all these virtues, andmore. If necessity be the mother of invention, then is love the motherof both; and surely the most ingenious devices and the cleverestproductions had been connected with this subtle passion.Divers and many were the plans which Manners devised to meet hisbeloved Dorothy again, but the success he so richly merited was tardyin coming, and one after another his schemes were frustrated, untilsuccess seemed to have receded from his grasp for ever.Dorothy, in fact, was too carefully watched to permit of her meetingher lover easily, and she was kept too busy at the tapestry frameto allow her much time for writing to him had she been so disposed.Whenever she went out she was well attended, and for a long timeManners was fain to content himself with an occasional glimpse ofher pale face as she rode by, or by sending love-notes and receivingmessages back by the kindly aid of the faithful Lettice.Still he persevered, and was rarely absent from the trysting place atthe appointed time, for Dorothy might come on any night, and when shecame he was determined she should find him there. But she never came.Lettice occasionally he met, but even she was suspected and was keptindoors as much as possible, and more often than not he sat his wearyvigils out alone.Good Roger Morton did his utmost to further his friend's design,sending him up as often as possible on missions to the Hall, and hewent so frequently both with messages and faggots, that, seeing himso often, no one suspected that the young woodsman was any other thanwhat he professed to be.Time flew on: weeks passed by. Autumn brought its coldest and chillestweather for the winter to take up and carry forward. The steers werefattening in the stalls, or salting in the troughs, for the Christmasfestivities. The capacious larders of Haddon were replenished to thefull, ready to withstand the attack of the cooks; large piles of woodlay stacked up in the yard, ready to supply the many fires which wereto cook the victuals for the feast; and the servants themselves grewdaily more surprised at the constant arrival of fresh stores, andwondered if ever so magnificent a feast had taken place before.With Dorothy the time passed slowly and painfully along. Her positionhad not improved one whit, and she was wearied of the life ofrestraint and imprisonment to which she was subjected. Her fingerswere sore and ached again with the continual tenter-stitching she hadto perform, and her whole nature revolted at the system of espionagewhich Lady Vernon and Sir Edward Stanley had set upon her. The dailyvisits of that unfeeling and determined nobleman with whom they wouldforce her into marriage, Edward Stanley, always left her with a sadderheart than she had had before.With Manners the time flew by quickly. He sorely wanted to seeDorothy again, and as the days rapidly passed he recked not of thedisappointments of the past, but only thought of the few days whichintervened between them and Christmas.Surely the rumour must be wrong. There would never be two weddings atthe Hall this Christmastide. He, at least, would not believe it."Nicholas," he said, as he met that worthy at last, "thou wilt onlymarry one?""The baron bids me marry the other as well. I would it were not so,for the maiden cares naught for him. I like not this brother; he isworse than Margaret's betrothed.""You must help us, then.""I must do my duty, but if in doing that I can aid thee thou hast butto speak the word.""But you shall help us, Nicholas.""Why, how?""I will tell thee.""I am a priest, remember. I cannot do anything unworthy even for afriend like thee; though thou wert my benefactor."He paused, as if unwilling to wound his friend by his words, andseeing the look of dismay upon the other's face, he stopped."Nicholas," said Manners, "thou shalt do naught but stand. I must seeDorothy. I shall," he added determinedly. "Some way or other Ishall see her; even though blood be shed I shall do it," and in theintensity of his feelings he involuntarily put his hand down to hisside to feel for the dagger which was not there."I fear thou art too venturesome," expostulated his friend, quietly."I am desperate," he replied; "and you, Nicholas, by simply standingstill might help me as much as I require, and might, perchance,prevent bloodshed, too.""Hush, friend John, talk not thus foolishly.""And the blood will be upon your head," continued the distractedlover. "With or without your aid I must, I shall, see Doll; and thatsoon. You know my word is not lightly broken. Did I not succour theeand save thy life when all conspired against thee?""Aye, in truth, and--""And I call upon you now, Nicholas, to discharge that debt," pursuedManners, hotly. "You must; I am resolved, I am well nigh desperate;and Father Philip sanctioned the troth, Nicholas, and blessed us erehe died.""Is that so?""Assuredly it is. Thou shalt help us, nor shalt thou be dishonoured inthe deed.""An you will lead me into no evil I will consent, but I fear to trustthee, thou wert ever rash and headstrong."Two days later, ere the Sabbath mass began, there stole into thelittle chapel of Haddon the figure of a man, which ever since thebreak of day might have been observed crouched down at the bottom ofthe mighty brewing vat. Had anyone cared to look under the cloth whichcovered it they would assuredly have discovered him there.The door of the sanctuary had just been thrown open, somewhat laterthan usual, for the servants had evidently overslept themselves, andwere now to be heard throwing the shutters open, and bustling about inthe kitchens, trying to make up for the time they had lost.The man, by his garb, might have been taken for a labourer. His blackhair hung in matted patches upon his shoulders; his clothes were tornand patched, and the coarse leather jerkin he wore, which was almostready to be replaced by a new one, gave unmistakable tokens that thewearer was a man of toil.In spite of all these signs the face of the man was handsome, and notwithout traces of hauteur. His hands were red and rough, but not hardand horny as those of other craftsmen were; and his whole bearingwould have impressed a critical observer that this man at least wasworthier of a better lot.Yes, it was John Manners. He was bearding the lion in his den.Pushing the inner door ajar, and casting a look around the yard atthe same time to satisfy himself that he was not observed, he quietlyentered the edifice, and closed the door."Ha, ha," he mused. "At last we shall meet again," and at the thoughtof it he heaved a sigh of relief.Seating himself in the family pew, he pulled out a book from hiscapacious breast-pocket, and as he anticipated a long period ofuninterrupted peace, he commenced to peruse it. It was "Tottel'sMiscellany," a collection of amorous sonnets, and little love sonnetsand little love songs, and he read page after page, to the delightof his heart, until he was startled to a sense of his position by thesound of voices just outside."No, no, Sir Edward. We must give her a little longer time, she willcome round soon to our opinion," were the words he unmistakably heard."But you promised her to me this Christmas, remember," was the quickreply."Aye, so I did," returned the first speaker. "I would that I had notpromised her at all, she is so unhappy over it.""And I have laid my plans according to that promise," rejoined hiscompanion."We must allow her a little longer time," replied the baron,decisively. "Manners has been again to flame her passion for him anew.She will be ready to accept thee soon, but not just yet.""I tell her John Manners has forsaken her, but she will persist in herwaywardness, and I expect, forsooth, she will do so until--""Tut, tut, man," interposed Sir George, "it shall not be at Christmas,as we would have had it; but even as she comes not to her senses soon,you shall take her away. Say another month, Sir Edward, another month.There, that is settled, trouble me no more, and now we will off tomass."They were in the garden, and through the open lattice window Mannerscould hear them without the slightest trouble. At the mention of masshe abruptly closed his book, and replacing it in his pocket, he creptcarefully into the dismal hollow under the pulpit, and pulling thepanel to after him he hid himself securely in the dark recess."So ho!" he murmured, as he fixed himself in his retreat; "the baronis good. Another month and then, oh! and then?"He stopped and relapsed into thought. His brow contracted, his lipswere tightly pressed, and his eyes stared fixedly through the darknessof his retreat at the chinks of the panels in front, through which hecould see the place where his beloved would shortly sit."Aye, aye," he muttered, as he fiercely clapped his hand upon histhigh. "It cannot be the worse for her, nor yet much worse for me. Shemust do it; I will broach it to her now. Here they come."The pulpit was none too strong, and as Nicholas ascended the stair andshut the door, it distinctly shook and tottered to and fro over theesquire."Why, by my halidame," thought Manners, "the whole contrivance willfall down together and crush me."This fear was strengthened soon, for as the priest fixed himselfconveniently in his elevated position, the floor above the esquire'shead creaked and groaned and threatened every minute to fall.The service quickly began, much to Manners' relief; but oh, horrors!Father Nicholas began to preach, and by the time the lover expected tohave clasped his darling in his arms, the discourse was just gettinginto full swing."Stop, Nicholas, in the name of mercy, stop," he whispered through thefloor; but Nicholas heard him not, and quietly pursued the even tenourof his way.Another half-hour had elapsed, and the situation had become wellnigh intolerable. Apart from being cramped, Manners was uncomfortableenough. He felt that it would have immensely relieved him to havescreamed, but he dared not do it. He wanted to cough, or sneeze, buthe had to repress his feelings. The place in which he was boxed upwas damp and humid, and the darkness in which he was enveloped wasoppressive. He could bear it no longer, and raising himself up hegroped around with his hands, and easily lifting a piece of the oldpulpit flooring, he looked up at Nicholas and groaned.Nicholas involuntarily started at the sound, but recollecting thevoice, he screened his friend by his presence of mind. Without amoment's pause he stopped and indulged in a prolonged fit of coughing,while the little congregation, which had been startled by the groan,attributed the noise to a premonitory symptom of the attack, andthought no more about it."For mercy's sake, stop," muttered Manners. But the priest placidlyresumed his discourse, and drowned Manners' voice by his own.The sand-glass, which was affixed to the pulpit desk to mark the limitof the time allowed for the sermon, had long indicated that FatherNicholas was trespassing upon the indulgence of his hearers before hestopped; but it was over at last, and confession time had arrived.Well knew the wily preacher that the second part of the service wouldnot be prolonged. Sir George had never much to confess while therewas a good meal awaiting him, and what Lady Maude would have said uponsuch occasions was always cut short when the sermon had been long, andwas reserved for a more fitting occasion.Neither Sir Thomas Stanley nor his brother ever stayed for confession.They generally found some more attractive way of spending the time;and as soon as they could do so they slipped out, heartily cursing thelong-winded priest, and wishing that Sir George were not, by far, sogood a Catholic.Margaret stayed longer than the rest, and when her confession hadceased she kept the father and took occasion to consult him about themarriage ceremony.She went at last, and then it was Dorothy's turn. The way was oncemore open for the brave-hearted Manners to meet his betrothed again."Stop!" exclaimed Nicholas, as Manners eagerly kissed the maiden'sblushing cheek. "Let Mistress Dorothy perform her duty first."There was no gainsaying this. The good father would not be arguedwith, and so Dorothy bended her knee, and in humble penitenceconfessed her misdeeds and prayed forgiveness for her sins.The confession, though well meant, was constrained and short. Themaiden was absent-minded, and though she would have entered into itwith heart and soul, she found herself unable to bend her will, andeven while confessing, her thoughts were fixed on her lover, whomshe knew was impatiently waiting to embrace her as soon as she hadfinished her devotions."And now, my own peerless Doll," said Manners, as she rose and came tohim, "at last I may talk with thee once more.""Yes, John," replied the maiden, "at last! We have waited long forthis.""Nicholas, you will listen and warn us if anyone approaches," saidManners."I pray thee forget not that the time goes on apace," replied theconfessor. "I will guard the door for thee."The lovers were alone; they were free to enjoy each other'scompany for a little while, and in a short time the sound of eagerconversation filled the room."Come, now, 'tis time," broke in the priest, after a long pause. "SirGeorge will be wondering at the long delay.""A minute more, Nicholas, a minute more," was the excited reply."Now, Doll," Manners appealed, "I have told you all. What say you?""Not yet, John, not yet," she demurely replied."O, say not so, Doll," he pleaded, "they will never relent.""I cannot do it, John; indeed, I cannot. I would refuse thee naughtsave this, but this I must refuse."Her lover looked at her sadly. "Then we may not see each other again,"he said, "till thou art Lady Stanley.""Nay, nay," she replied quickly, "I shall never be that. My heartwould break first. I shall never be that.""Or I may be discovered, and--and then, Doll, what?""O don't, don't say that," she cried. "You tear my heart. I cannot doit, John; at least--at least not now.""Mistress Dorothy, we must go now. I cannot, I dare not tarry anylonger," said the priest as he came up and stood beside the lovers."We must go at once.""A minute more, just a minute, Nicholas.""Nay," he replied, "we must not linger any more.""Go, then, I will follow thee," said Dorothy, and taking her ather word the father bowed himself low before the little altar anddeparted."Not yet," said Manners, "you cannot yet! Doll, it must come to this,and why not do it now?""Nay, nay, John, ask me not. I cannot, I cannot do it. Adieu, we shallmeet again soon, trust me till then"; and giving him a farewell kiss,she left him alone and hastened into the Hall.CHAPTER XXIX.THE ANGELS OF LIFE AND DEATH.                     He said no more,  For at that instant flashed the glare,    And with a hoarse, infernal roar,  A blaze went up and filled the air!    Rafters, and stones, and bodies rose  In one quick gush of blinding flame,    And down, and down, amidst the dark,  Hurling on every side they came.  AYTOUN.Deep down in the rock upon which Nottingham Castle proudly stands,there winds a passage which was used in the centuries long gone by asthe readiest way of bringing the victuals in the castle, and which haslong been commonly accepted as the veritable "Mortimer's Hole."A man was busily engaged in arduous toil in one of the cavitieshollowed out in the very heart of the rock. It was the chamber inwhich the dissolute Mortimer and the faithless Isabella had beencaptured by the youthful monarch, Edward III., two centuries anda half earlier, but no traces of its former grandeur--if it everpossessed any--now remained. It was changed into the abode of analchemyst, and as Edmund Wynne ever and anon tapped an iron vessel hiseyes sparkled with delight.The room was full of fumes and smoke. Phials of many shapes andvarious sizes were ranged around on every side, filled with liquids ofevery imaginable odour and hue. A long rude bench, which ran alongthe farther side of the room, was crowded with boxes of crystals,crucibles, and bottles, and, to complete the scene, a log fire wassmouldering away on the centre of the solid rock floor.Edmund had long sought the elixir of life, but it had proved asdelusive as a will-o'-the-wisp to him, and ever, just as he feltassured of success, the prize had slipped away from his grasp, leavinghim further away from success than he had been before. But now it wasnot the elixir that he was seeking to find. From trying to discoversomething that should rob the grave of its prey, he had turned hisattention towards the invention of an engine to hasten death. Hisheart was all aflame with the passion of revenge. The lord of Haddonhad incurred his intense and undying hatred. He had heaped indignitiesupon him; he had slain the object of his affections; and the disgraceinto which he had fallen at London was also ascribed, rightly orwrongly, to the baron.Baulked of his revenge hitherto, his passionate desire for it haddecreased rather than declined through his failures, and the very factof his failing was itself another charge for which the baron wouldhave to answer. Death, and death alone, would now be sufficient towipe out the stain, and Edmund had long cudgelled his wits to securethe destruction of his foe."Aye, Edmund, Edmund," exclaimed Sir Ronald Bury, as he broke in uponWynne's privacy, "at thy whimsical labours again, I see.""Nay, not whimsical, Ronald," was the gentle reply. "My elixir isnearly right; only one ingredient more is wanted, and then!""And then, what?" laughed the knight."Why, then I shall have discovered what all the sages of the earthhave sought in vain.""A toadstone, I suppose?" replied Sir Ronald, lightly."Ha, you may laugh, Ronald," said the astrologer, severely. "Foolsever did mock the wise, like the rich despise the poor. You are but asoldier, and I am a man of science--the great alchemyst! My name shalllive; yea, mark me, Ronald, it will be known and revered in time tocome, aye, even when this castle has crumbled into dust, and when thename of Roger Bacon has been long forgotten.""Well, Edmund," responded the knight, gaily, "let us hope so; only onemore substance, eh?""Only one," the enthusiast replied, while the look of triumph flashedalready from his eyes."And then we shall--shall what, Edmund, what shall we do?""Live for ages.""For ever, in fact, I suppose?""My elixir will conquer disease, and man shall live until his feebleframe has worn away," he responded grandly."Lucky man," soliloquised Sir Ronald, facetiously. "But the dames,Edmund, you said naught of them. Cannot you discover aught for them?Surely they may share the blessing also!""No more is wanted; my elixir will serve for both," majesticallyresponded Edmund, as he placed a cauldron over the fire. He wastoo intensely in earnest himself to note that his companion wassceptically making fun of him."And will soldiers live for ages, too?" continued Sir Ronald."Those who are killed my elixir is impotent to bring back again tolife. The dead are beyond all aid.""And the wounded?" persisted the knight."I can but stave off disease, Ronald; but what a glorious achievementhave I accomplished then! Methinks I see the glory now, and when I amin my grave, pilgrims shall come and worship at my shrine as theyhave done these centuries at the altar of St. Thomas the Martyr atCanterbury. What glory, what glory!" and in the exuberance of hisdelight, Edmund Wynne gleefully rubbed his hands together."I am forgetting my errand, though," exclaimed the deputy-governor, "Ihave a visitor for thee."Edmund quailed. He was not in the habit of receiving visitors, for hehad few friends and many enemies, therefore the announcement gave himvery little pleasure."For me?" he said, in a tone of unmistakable surprise, and equallyunmistakable displeasure."Aye, for thee," Sir Ronald replied. "Shall I bring him to you?""Bring him down here?" screamed Edmund, aghast at the very idea. "No,never.""You will come up to him, then? It makes no matter!""I am too busy," he evasively replied. "Tell me, Ronald, who it is.""'Tis a friend.""Humph! He has heard of my elixir and wants--ah, well, I shall havefriends enough now, I'll warrant me.""He is an enemy of Sir George Vernon, then," added the knight."Hey! Bring him down, then," said the alchemyst. "I will meet himoutside the room.""Well, Master John Manners will be down by and bye. Lady Burymeanwhile is entertaining him, for he was hungry."Edmund started."Manners, John Manners!" he exclaimed. "Nay, then, bring him nothither. Does he know that I am here?""Aye, I have told him.""You have!" ejaculated Edmund, in a frenzy of terror. "I met him atHaddon, he is a friend of the baron's.""He was," replied his friend; "but things have changed, and now he islike to invoke thy aid. He will help us to have our revenge, maybe,for I have been persuading him; he is very bitter now against theVernons, and will make thee a good accomplice.""Revenge," murmured Edmund, "ha! revenge is sweet. The baron shall bepunished; my machine--""Never mind the machine now," broke in Sir Ronald, who was by no meansanxious to listen to the well-worn rigmarole again. "You can showthat to him, and tell him all about it. I shall bring him down, for heknows not the way.""Well, I will yield to thee; do as you list," he replied, and the manof science turned his back abruptly upon his friend, and vigorouslystirred the seething liquid which was beginning to boil over upon thefire.In a few minutes Manners appeared, but Sir Ronald Bury had brought himpurposely with so little noise that the alchemyst was not aware of hispresence, and for a long time they stood in the doorway, and watchedhis movements.He was talking to himself, as he often did. It was a habit into whichhe had unconsciously fallen. He had persuaded himself to think thatthe great posterity for which he laboured so hard could hear him, andin his isolation the reflection was a great consolation to him."Ha, ha," he muttered, "thou hast had thy little day, Sir GeorgeVernon. 'King of the Peak,' indeed--thy reign is o'er. And Margaret,proud Margaret, and the haughty Lady Maude, aha! You shall all trembleat my name.""Hist, move thee not," whispered Sir Ronald, "he is, about to test hisengine again; it blows off sparks of fire as if it were the smithy'sforge, but without the noise. I have seen him perform with it often.Hark."Edmund had brought out his engine from a deep recess in the wall, anda rough, unsightly piece of mechanism it was. It was intended to besquare, but constant testings and trials had caused it to assume morethe appearance of an octagon, and as the sides had thus bulged out,the bands which had held the instrument together became loosened anduntrustworthy.Edmund surveyed it affectionately. It was the offspring of his genius,and he blindly disregarded all its little imperfections amid the greatlove he bore towards it."Aha," he murmured, "thou art done, thou art ready now. Thou art anangel of death, and thou"--turning to his elixir--"thou art an angelof life.""Mix them up, Nathan, mix them up," gaily exclaimed Manners as hestepped into the room. "We will give the Vernons a dose."Edmund was startled, and he hastily retreated to his engine to protectit."Avaunt!" he cried, "touch it not.""Nay, I want not to injure it," returned the other, whose smilecontrasted with the alchemyst's scowl. "Shake hands, man; I will dothee no harm.""Beware," cried Edmund, distrustfully, as he covered over the angel."Beware!""Edmund, thou speakest over rashly," interposed Sir Ronald. "MasterManners would honour thee, and thou treatest him so lightly. Togetheryou may accomplish your designs and work whatever you will; thepast--""Is buried with its forefathers and forgotten," quickly exclaimedManners. "Come, I greet thee on equal terms. I would be thy friend."Edmund shook the proffered hand as though it were a bar of red-hotiron he had been commanded to hold, or a phial of his precious elixirhe was carrying, and he felt by no means flattered at the referenceto their equality, just as if he, too, had discovered such mightysecrets."I shall not want for friends soon, forsooth; the great have evermany," he replied.Manners laughed."Thou hast few enough as yet, I'll warrant, besides thy good friend,Sir Ronald," he exclaimed. "I trow you cannot well afford to turn thefirst comers away, Nathan.""I can do all with my elixir," was the proud response."Sir Ronald Bury tells me thou hast prepared this engine forSir George," said Manners, abruptly changing the topic of theconversation. "Is that so?""Aha, for Sir George Vernon, yes.""Can'st thou direct it against the Stanleys, too? I would have thempunished if we could.""Thou art a friend of his," said Edmund, suspiciously, referring tothe baron."Albeit I seek revenge, justice, anything!" he said bitterly. "I havebeen spurned away from his door like as I had been a dog."Edmund looked at him incredulously. He was not convinced yet."If you mean no treachery," he said cautiously, "call me by my name,for I am Edmund Wynne. I like not to bethink me of the past until--,"and he approvingly looked at his instrument of death."Until what?""Ha, I will show thee," replied Edmund. "Stand not too near."Manners had not much faith in the destructive properties of theinstrument, but the command was given in such an earnest andauthoritative fashion that to have refused compliance would only havecaused offence. Probably, too, Edmund would not try the experimentif he expressed his scepticism, and he was curious to see it, so heretreated to the doorway to watch his movements."This," Edmund went on, "is to be put in the baron's room.""Yes, but how?" asked Manners, perceiving that some sort of a remarkwas expected of him."Cannot I, who have invented it, find some means for conveying theengine there?" replied the inventor, with staggering emphasis.Manners deferentially bowed his acquiescence, much to the amusement ofSir Ronald."You must not heed his words," whispered the knight. "He is infatuatedwith his work. In all things else he is as timid as a mouse.""And then," pursued the mighty alchemyst, "and then--! Nay, I willshow thee, see!" and with some difficulty he forced open a little doorat the side.Both Manners and Sir Ronald moved forward to examine it, for the roomwas but faintly lighted and they could barely see the dim outline ofthe instrument."Go back, go back," screamed Edmund. "Ronald, I look for no treacheryfrom thee.""Tush," contemptuously replied the knight, as he poured some more oilinto the lamp, "get on. We did but want to see.""This," continued Edmund, unabashed, "is more dreadful than RogerBacon's powder;" and pulling out a short, stout iron canister, hepoured some crystals into a hole. "Look and behold," he added. "Iinvoke no saints, nor do I seek the aid of any deity, but see;" androlling some of the crystals tightly up in some parchment, he droppedit into the midst of the fire.For a few moments nothing was seen or heard of it, and the onlookerswere smiling to each other when the wonderful crystals began tosplutter and fizz, till the packet suddenly exploded with a loudreport, rattling the bottles and jars together, while the rumblingreport rolled up the long subterranean passage."Ha!" exclaimed Edmund, triumphantly. "You shudder at the sight; thatis nothing, I can do infinitely more than that. I will do it with morecrystals now.""Nay, we are convinced of thy prowess; when the fumes have clearedaway, show us this engine," replied Manners. "It is full of wheels;show us their purpose.""That shook this chamber," Edmund replied, "but this could well nighshatter it.""Great man, we acknowledge thy mighty genius," responded Sir Ronald."Reveal the limit of thy powers.""I will," said Edmund, enthusiastically, "I will."All his reserve was worn off now, and he expatiated at length upon thewonderful powers of his mighty engine. No such power had been knownbefore; nothing would stand against it; it was indeed a miracle offorce."But, prithee," asked Manners, heartily sick of the ceaselessexplanations, and anxious to see the practical outcome of it all, "howworketh it? Show us, let it move this piece of rock.""You doubt me; I will show it thee; I will test it but this onceagain, and then the baron, curse him! dies."Edmund busied himself for some time in compounding some evil-smellingingredients in a huge mortar, and, as he stirred the pestle round andround, the contents hissed and crackled, and emitted sparks of fire.At length, after many bottles had been partially emptied, and manypowders and the like had been employed, the mysterious substance wasobtained, and he sprinkled a little of it upon the red embers, when aseries of miniature explosions followed."Look, see!" he passionately exclaimed, "I have discovered somethingstill more powerful; nay, stand back. I found it once before, but lostthe art. Now we shall see; hey, hey."Slowly and cautiously the canister was replaced; the requisite powderwas carefully measured and inserted, and after many an examination hadbeen made, Edmund declared that everything was in readiness for thewheels to be set in motion."Stand back, venture not too near," he commanded, and placing a heavypiece of loose rock upon the case, he set the wheels in motion andstepped back proudly behind his handiwork."Thou shalt be convinced shortly, Master Manners," he exclaimed. "Ha,ha, I shall have many friends soon. None know the power I have at mycommand, and princes and queens will court me to possess it. I caneither kill or keep alive, my elixir--"His voice was lost in the din of a great explosion. Bottles and jarswere rattled together and smashed. The chamber was full of smoke andflame. Everything was suddenly thrown into frightful disorder, all wasin confusion. Solid masses of rock were detached from the walls androof, and went crashing across the room, destroying everything withwhich they came into contact, or else burst through the wall andbounded down the steep rock outside. The very room seemed to spinaround, and Sir Ronald and Manners were thrown headlong upon thepavement of the passage outside.What could it all mean?Simply that the engine had done its work. Edmund had overcharged it,and it had exploded. The angel of death had slain its creator, and thewonderful elixir of life was lost to the world for ever.CHAPTER XXX.STOLEN SWEETS.  All close they met again, before the dusk    Had taken from the stars its pleasant veil;  Close in a bower of hyacinth and musk,    Unknown of any, from whispering tale.  Ah! better had it been for ever so,    Than idle ears should pleasure in their woe.  KEATS.It was within a week off Christmas, and at Haddon all was in confusionand disorder amid the preparations for the forthcoming wedding.Manners had now relinquished all hope of Sir George ever relenting,and he waited with feverish impatience the time when, once more, hemight clasp his darling to his heart, and pour again into her ears theoft-told story of his undiminished love.He longed to see her again, or to be seen by her, even though no wordswere spoken; for he had been away awhile, and though he had biddenRoger send Dorothy word of his absence through Lettice, yet he fearedlest the message had not been delivered, and she would feel alarmed athis being away.Ill news awaited his return. Dorothy was to go away with Margaret,for she was ill, and Benedict had prescribed a change of air. He wasdesperate, and in his desperation he was prepared to hazard anythingwhich promised the remotest chance of success; but alas! his ventures,while resulting harmlessly, brought him no nearer the goal of hisambition than he had been before."Roger," he said, "I shall get me to the Hall. Lettice should comesoon; bid her hasten back and tell her mistress I am there awaitingher.""Aye, I will tell her," replied the honest woodsman, "but methinks itis a sorry chance. Thou art far more likely to be discovered thanto succeed, for there be many folks at the Hall, and few dare to befriends of thine.""Nevertheless, I shall attempt it, good Roger; dissuade me not.""Faith, not I. 'Tis not for such as me to interfere. Thou art brave,Master Manners, and art worthy of success; may it come to thee, say I.But the Hall is full big to seek each other in; where shalt thou be?""In the dining-room.""In the dining-room!" quoth Roger, in surprise. "The dining-room!Thou'lt surely never look there? 'Tis as bare of hiding places as theflat of my hand. Why not in the archer's room, or the tower?""I shall hide me behind the arras till she comes," replied Manners."The arras," laughed his companion, "why it will bulge out like themonuments in Bakewell Church; the first who comes will spy thee out.Take my advice, master, and wait in the tower. Why, the buttery weresafer than the dining-room.""Tut, I shall go," he replied; "there is more to hide one than you wotof, but my Dorothy knows it, and I shall meet her there;" and pickingup a bundle of wood he started off to the Hall.He was not long upon the way, and when he arrived at his destinationthere was no difficulty in getting into the kitchens, for he had beenthere scores of times before, and his was quite a familiar figure now."Ho, Hubert," called one of the busy cooks as he entered the room,"lend a hand with this steer; thou hast the strength of a bullock, Iverily believe."Manners dropped the wood and good-naturedly lent the desiredassistance."An thou would'st chop it with this cleaver thou wert a good fellow,"continued the cook, as, having got the beast upon the bench, hesurveyed its goodly proportions, and handed the cleaver to hisnewly-found helpmate."Nay, I am no butcher, I am but a woodsman, and should cut it wrong,I fear," returned Manners, as he laid the chopper down. "Were it atree--""Now, come," interrupted the cook, persuasively. "I am wearied out;I have no strength left in my arm. See you, here, here, and here, andthe thing is done.""I will do it an you will serve me a good turn, too?" he replied."Done, then," said the other; "what is it?""Show me the Hall; I have long wished to see the ballroom. 'Tis a fineroom, Roger says.""Fine!" exclaimed the cook. "I should think it is fine. There's notanother in all Queen Elizabeth's land to equal it. I will show it theeafterwards.""Help me with this sack of flour," exclaimed the baker, "and I willshow it thee now."Manners chopped the carcase up, for which he was promised a share ofthe pie, and quickly satisfied the baker. His strength, indeed, waswonderful, and what two bakers had failed to do together, he easilyaccomplished alone."Thou shalt have a cake to-night," exclaimed the baker, admiringly."A milk-white cake hot off the hearthstone, such as my lord the baronloveth so well," and they passed through the stone-flagged passageinto the banqueting-room beyond to see the wonders of the Hall."Nay," exclaimed the chamberlain, as they attempted to pass up thesteps leading to the upper part of the Hall. "'tis against the rules,you know.""All right, John, 'tis all right," replied the baker. "Hubert is goingto help me, and you cannot stay me, I trow, or Lady Vernon will comeupon thee about the cakes for the feast."There was no gainsaying this argument, for John stood in mortal fearof his mistress, and at the mention of her name he stepped aside andallowed them to pass by."John likes to be flattered," laughed the baker, as the door closedupon them, "but I use a different weapon. I speak of Lady Vernon, andhe always yields.""I saw he was there," replied Manners, "else I had needed noassistance to pass through. He despises us, I verily believe,and likes to show his power. So this is the ballroom, eh? 'Tis amagnificent room, surely," he exclaimed in well-feigned innocence."The ballroom!" laughed the other, contemptuously. "No, this is butthe dining-room. Come, I will show thee the ballroom.""I would linger here awhile," responded Manners, with charmingsimplicity, "this tapestry takes my fancy so; and the ceiling, withsuch quaint devices. Nay, there can be naught to better this, Iswear.""Then you must stay alone, for I am busy," replied his companion.This was exactly what Manners wanted, and as he offered no opposition,the baker left him alone on the threshold of the ballroom, andreturned to attend to his duties.It was a matter of little difficulty to find the hiding, place, forManners knew it well, and pulling the arras aside, he slid an old oakpanel along and stepped into the cavity it disclosed to await withas much patience as he could command the well-known footstep of hisbeloved.A long time he waited; each passing footstep caused his heart toflutter with expectation, only, however, to leave it to quieten indisappointment as the sounds receded and died away in the echoingballroom above, or else mingled, maybe, in the turmoil of the busykitchens below. No Dorothy appeared, and his heart at last began tofail."Surely she will not come," he murmured at length. "Lettice cannothave been," and his spirit sank within him at the thought. He was coldand fatigued, and once being infected with the idea that he was doomedto disappointment, he quickly discovered all the discomforts ofhis position and aggravated his misery by adding to them by his ownimagination.He had made up his mind to depart, and was about to put his resolutioninto practice, when a gentle voice broke the stillness of the room. Heheld his breath to listen. There was surely someone at the door, forhe heard the handle turn; it creaked upon its hinges, and a momentlater a gentle step resounded on the floor, and he knew that he wasnot alone. Could it be Dorothy? He pushed the door of his retreat ajarand listened intently, but only the responsive throbbing of his ownheart could he hear."Doll!" he exclaimed.There was no reply."Doll," he repeated, in a little louder tone as he pushed door andtapestry aside and entered the room. "Doll!""It is not Dorothy, Master Manners," replied a gentle voice, "it is I,Lettice, her maid."His heart stood still; chilled with despair."Where is she?" he cried. "Tell me, will she come?""Nay, she cannot come; Dame Maude is with her, getting ready for thefeast."And Dorothy cannot come," he repeated, with downcast eyes. "Hast thouseen her; has she had my message?""One may not speak with her when my lady is there," said the maid,"but she read it in my eyes. I would, Master Manners, I could helpthee more, but I fear that cannot be.""Bid her keep her tryst to-night, Lettice," he replied, "and thou wiltserve thee well.""I fear me she cannot. Oft has she tried and failed; she is watchedtoo well. An she were to pass the gate alone the whole Hall would knowof it.""Look, then, Lettice, could you come?"Lettice often had done so before to meet her own stalwart young loverin the privacy of the wood, and she blushed at the question."I come?" she replied, "happen I might were I but to speak to thechamberlain first.""Speak to him, then, for mercy's sake, speak," replied the lover,quickly. "Lend Doll your hood and shawl, none will know the differencein the dark. Tell the porter to expect you. There, adieu; fail me not,good Lettice," and without leaving her time to make reply herushed hastily out of the room, and left her alone to carry out hisinstructions as best she could.Dusk was rapidly deepening into darkness when John Manners stole outof his humble abode to wend his way to the old trysting place, whitherhe had been so frequently of late. His progress was watched by a pairof eager, jealous eyes, as their owner silently but surely doggedhis every footstep; and when the tree was reached at last Manners laywearily down at its foot, fully resolved not to depart from thenceuntil he had brought matters to a crisis. At the same moment thefigure of a young man glided stealthily into the cover of a bushwithin a few yards of where the other lay. Manners was not aware ofthe fact; he had neither seen nor heard his pursuer, and in happyignorance of the circumstance he awaited Dorothy's appearance.The night was chilly, for the snow had just departed from off theground, and the fast gathering leaden clouds threatened to quicklycover it over again; but, buoyed up with hope and excitement, Mannersheeded it not. Quietly, but not calmly, he lay, impatiently awaitingthe coming of his love.At last she came, but she approached so silently that her lover wasnot aware of her presence until she spoke."John," she exclaimed, "I am here."He was upon his feet in an instant."My darling, my beloved;" he cried, as he rapturously embraced her inhis arms. "This is good of thee, 'tis more than I deserve.""Say not so," she replied. "I would do aught for thy dear sake. I haveendured much for thee, but I have been happy in it because it was forthee.""Thou would'st do aught for me, my precious one?" cried Manners. "Ihave much to ask of thee. 'Tis well for me thou art so ready. Noneshall part us, Doll.""No, never," she replied, firmly."Then, Dorothy, we must flee together.""What!" she exclaimed, in surprise. "Leave Haddon?""Hush, Doll, I fear it must be so.""Oh, John," she sobbed, "I cannot do it, indeed I cannot do it. Isthere no other way? Have you no other plan?""Sir George will never relent," Manners replied, "and in anothermonth--""Nay, nay, John, I have refused the one, I am resolved not to wed theother."There was a painful pause for a minute or two, but at length Mannersspoke. His voice trembled and betrayed the depth of his feelingsplainly."'Tis a hard choice, Doll," he said, "but you must choose betwixtHaddon and me. If you say me nay, I shall lose you.""Wait, John, you can trust me?" she sobbed."Aye, that I can," he returned, tenderly; "but the flower iswithering, and will soon be gone. This face was not so pale nor yetso thin before. Dorothy, I cannot see thee droop like this before myeyes.""You can trust me," she replied; "then wait awhile.""And then; what then?""If they are against us then, I will do thy will and go with thee.""Nay, Doll, I should lose thee, and that would break my heart; it mustbe yes or no, there is no other way of escape."Dorothy bowed her head upon his shoulders while the tears ran freelydown her cheeks, and Manners stood over her, his breast heaving infierce thrills of mingled emotions."Choose for thine own happiness, Doll," he whispered, breaking againanother painful spell of silence."I cannot leave my father so--and Margaret," she added, after a pause."Margaret will leave thee soon enough," replied her lover, "and SirGeorge would wed thee to Sir Edward Stanley in a month. Thou wilt haveto leave them soon, anyhow--why not with me? I would brave the worldfor thy sake.""I know it," she replied, "but I cannot say 'yes.' Do not persuade me,I will give thee an answer in a little while."I have made arrangements," Manners answered. "Everything is ready. Weshall go to Nottingham; all our plans are laid ready for the wedding.""I cannot refuse thee, John," whispered Dorothy, as she dried hertears, "but I cannot consent--not yet, at least. Lettice shall bringthee word.""So be it, then," he said. "Kiss me, Doll, it may be for the lasttime; an you decide to stay, I shall go to the wars again.""Hush, your words are over loud, John. If you go, I die. Listen!"Manners needed not the injunction, for someone was unmistakablyrushing towards them. He turned, and faced the intruder."Hold!" he cried, "or you shall rue it. Stand back," he added, as thefigure of a man ran towards Dorothy."Lettice," exclaimed the other, "could I think this of thee? I hadtrusted thee better. What have I done that thou should'st treat methus? As for thee--" he said, turning to Manners."Tut, man, doff thy cap," interrupted the latter. "This is MistressDorothy Vernon.""Thou hast met here often enough before," continued the unbelievingWill, "but I'll warrant me this shall be the last time. MistressDorothy, indeed! A likely story that; but I know that hood too well tobe deceived. You are Sir Edward Stanley, or Master Manners, perchance,I suppose. Roger Morton shall know of this.""Lettice is in the hall," said Dorothy. "I know thou art to betrusted, Will, for Lettice ofttimes speaks of thee. This is MasterManners. Hush! not a word, tell it not to anyone."It was the voice of Dorothy, beyond dispute, and not the voice ofLettice, and the astonished youth dropped down upon his knees and suedforgiveness."And you knew me not?" asked Manners, as he clapped his companionfamiliarly upon the back. "I deceived thee, then? Have not the othersfound out my disguise? Methinks they have looked at me askance oflate."The young woodsman rubbed his eyes to convince himself that it was areality, and that it was not a vivid dream."Nay," he replied, at length; "they said thou wert seeking to rob meof my Lettice, for we knew thee not.""I am a craftsman still," returned Manners, "mind you tell them not.There, I shall rejoin thee soon."Lettice's lover took the hint and departed, not at all loth to get outof the way, and feeling mightily relieved that things happened to beas they were, and were not any worse."Doll," said her lover, as the retreating sound died away in thedistance, "we have another friend in him. Do thou tell this toLettice, happen it will enliven her. I will not press thee for thyanswer now; we shall love each other to the end, I know. Rememberthis, Doll, thy happiness as well as mine is at stake. Sir Georgecannot take back his words even though he repent them. He cannotrelent, for he has promised thee, and he is the very soul of honour,but, an we please ourselves, he cannot help it, and all will comeright. Nay, interrupt me not, I have weighed my words, there willnever be such another chance for us to flee. There, now, thou knowestall I can tell thee, thou shalt decide anon."Dorothy was silent, but if looks had speech, she had pleadedeloquently. Her resolution swayed to and fro in the terrible struggleof her affection: her soul was riven. She was too happy in the companyof her lover to say him nay, and yet, at the same time, the bond oflove which drew her to her father was far too strong to be suddenlysnapped."I must go," she said, at last, "but whether it be aye or whether itbe nay, in life and in death I am thine alone. Kiss me, John, and letme go."Manners was deeply agitated. He took her face in both his hands, andstooping down, he kissed her again and again."It may be the last time," he said, "but trust me, Doll, I am onlythine. I shall keep my love-troth true. Keep a stout heart, my sweetone, and by my faith we shall be happy yet."They had approached the Hall as near as was safe, and now the momentfor parting had arrived Dorothy tried to speak, but her heart was toofull, and words failed to come at her command. She listened to herlover's last injunction to keep up a brave heart, and wringing hishands in agonised silence, she gathered her cloak around her, andhastened into the Hall.CHAPTER XXXI.THE TOKEN.  And whilst the feast progressed apace,    The music swelled in joyous strain;  But midst the group was one fair face    That scarcely hid the look of pain.  And ever and anon she looked away;  And when the others went she turned to stay.Early next morning, as Manners was engaged in collecting faggotsfor the hungry fires at the Hall, he was startled to hear himselfaddressed by his proper name.He turned round aghast, but was reassured when he saw that it was noneother than Lettice's lover who stood by his side."Hush, Will," he said, "call me Hubert still; it were dangerous for myname to be overheard. But thou hast news for me, I can read it in thyface.""Aye," replied the youth, "Mistress Dorothy sent Lettice with amessage for thee, but old Roger knew not where thou would'st befound.""Where is it?" cried the lover, impatiently, "let me see it; 'tis theanswer, I'll warrant me.""Nay, I have it not. Lettice awaits thee at the hut; she would noteven let me bring it to thee, for her mistress, she says, charged herto tell it to none but thee.""At the hut," repeated Manners, as he started to return. Is she therenow?""She is awaiting thee; but, Master Manners, let me crave a favourfirst.""Quick, then," was the hasty reply, "tell me what it is, for I cannotwait.""Lettice has been rating me well," returned the downcast lover, ashe started to return with Manners. "She is angered against me that Ifollowed thee last night. She will not look at me now, and if I openmy mouth about it she swears she will speak to me no more. A word fromthee, good sir, would set the matter right again, else I fear me Ihave lost her favour, and there be many round about who would gladlytake my place.""Oh," laughed Manners, "I will see to that, and happen you may do mesome good service in return?""Aye, master, that I will," he replied, mightily relieved.Manners said no more; his mind was too much occupied, his thoughtswere bubbling within him in furious turmoil. Leaving his companionbehind, he rushed hastily on, and never stayed his course until he hadreached his destination."The letter, Lettice, the letter," he cried, as he entered the hut."Nay, I have no letter, Master Manners," replied the maid. "My ladybid me tell it thee instead.""What is it? Is it yes, or no?" he cried."Neither, yet. My mistress went all through the weary night, andthought of naught else but thee and the answer she should give.""Poor Doll," ejaculated her lover, tenderly. "'Tis time all this wasended, Lettice; she is fading away, yes, fading away, and what willcome of it all, if she says me nay, I tremble to think.""She will not say thee nay, though, Master Manners," replied Lettice."I shall lose my mistress soon. She has told me all.""Told thee all?" he echoed. "She will not say me nay, and yet sheconsents not! You speak in riddles. Come, explain it all.""She knoweth not her mind as yet," explained the maiden, "but I canplainly see which way it will all end. Even as she poured her storyout to me I could see it; I could read it in her sobs and sighs. Shehad not wept so long had she not loved thee so well; and her love forthee is stronger than her other loves, else she had obeyed my lord thebaron by now. It needs no astrologer to tell all this.""Heaven grant it may be so," replied Manners, fervently; "but what didmy Dorothy bid thee say? Thy words have made a sore commotion in myheart, fair Lettice."Lettice hung down her head and blushed at the unexpected compliment."Thou art to come to the feast to-night," she replied, "and my ladywill give thee answer there.""I shall be there, Lettice," he promptly returned. "Tell her I shallnot fail her. But how shall I see her, has she thought of that?""We have arranged it all, good sir; thou hast but to do her bidding,and all will go well."She did not say that Dorothy had been too distracted in mind to makeany arrangements whatever, but, as a matter of fact, this duty haddevolved entirely upon the maid, for her mistress had done littlemore than nod assent through her tears to all the propositions ofher companion. It was the ready wit of Lettice which had proposedeverything at just the time when Dorothy was quite unable to suggestanything for herself."The wedding ceremony will take place in four more days," Letticecontinued, "and the feasting begins to-night."Manners was aware of the fact, and he bowed his head in silentacquiescence."And thou art to come to the Hall," pursued the maid. "Thou artskilful on the lute, my mistress says.""I can play the lute," he answered, "but what of that? Will she pipeme an answer back?""Nay, Master Manners, listen. Thou art to be a musician for the once,and must join the minstrels in the gallery.""In the banqueting-room! Then I must seek a fresh disguise," hesaid. "Hey, Lettice, I would it were night already, the day willdrag wearily enough for me, I trow; but I shall look for my rewardto-night. Thou art sure of what thou hast told me, Lettice, for wereshe to refuse me after all, it were hard indeed!""Trust me, I am not like to be deceived; she wears her heart upon hersleeve. Unless she changes, I have told thee aright, but my lady neverchanges in her love. Ah, me, I shall lose my mistress soon, and I amsad to think of it.""Nay, Lettice," interposed Manners, "thou shalt marry honest Will, andhe shall be my chamberlain. Thou shalt be near Dorothy yet."The maid's countenance flushed with joy at the prospect of such bliss."That were happiness, indeed," she cried, "for or! Master Manners, Ilove her; I cannot help it--who could? I love her dearly; to part fromher--""Aye," interrupted Manners, "who could help it indeed. Tell her Ishall see her, I shall be there.""And if it be 'yes,' my mistress will drop her fan upon the floor,"went on Lettice; "but if the answer is 'no' she will tie a blackribbon on it. Thou must watch well, but it will surely fall.""Amen," said Manners. "Then I should be the happiest man on all theearth.""But happen my lady will not be there," the maid went on.The lover groaned at the thought, and interrupted the maiden by sodoing."Well, then," she continued, "either will I give thee a letter, or,if that cannot be, thou must go to Bakewell Church to-morrow eve, andthou shalt find the letter squeezed behind the font. But there, I mustaway; the day will pass all too quickly for me, for I have much todo.""Stay," he exclaimed, and plucking a sprig of holly from the bushwhich grew beside the door, he placed it in the maiden's hand."Give her this," he said, "and tell her it came from me. Bid her keepa stout heart within her; she must smile to-night."Lettice took the little bunch of green and red, and making areverential curtsey to her lady's lover, she hastened away towards theHall; and, as Manners watched her retreating figure, he saw the formof a man step out from among the bushes and join her company. It washer lover, who had waited with an anxious heart to discover the effectof the promised mediation.True to his promise, Manners presented himself at the appointed timeat the door of the orchestra, though not without inward misgivings asto the character of the reception in store for him. He need, however,have had no apprehension on that score, for everything had beenconveniently arranged. The leader of the musicians (they wereprincipally hired Derby men) had been bribed, and when the esquirepresented himself for admittance he was warmly greeted."Well, Ralph!" exclaimed that worthy as he almost wrung Manners'hands off in the heartiness of his embrace; "thou hast come to thyold friend again, eh? We must cement the friendship this time witha tankard of Haddon-brewed ale, and if thou hast not greatly alteredsince I knew thee last, thou'lt not be averse to that.""Of course not," replied Manners, readily; "and these are all freshmen? I cannot see one of the old faces among them all.""They are good fellows, though," returned their leader, proudly, "andthey play right well. Ha! here comes a messenger."The musicians, most of whom had until now been idly leaning over thebalcony, gazing, with an interest of which they were not fully aware,at the servants below as they were putting the finishing strokes tothe preparation of the feast, immediately took their allotted places,and Manners found himself at the end of the row within the shadow ofthe wall, and separated from the rest by the intervening body of theleader."The baron sends this for the musicians," said the page, as hedeposited a large pitcher of ale upon the gallery floor. "They arecoming now, and he would like some merry tunes."Even as the lad spoke the guests came pouring into the room; laughing,joking, talking; almost all of them in the merriest possible mood.Manners scrutinised their faces keenly, and he thought with regret ofthe time not long ago, when he too had been one of the happiest of allthe merry guests of just such another party. But where was Doll? Hecould not see her anywhere, and so intent was he on searching for hisbeloved, that the blast of the trumpets by his side startled him andmade him fairly jump with surprise.Mechanically he took his instrument up. The tune was simple and heknew it well, but even as he played his eye wandered from the sheetbefore him to scan the merry throng below.Ha! there she was. He discovered her at last, but her gait was livelyand her dress was amongst the gayest of the gay; and as she enteredleaning upon Sir Edward Stanley's arm she wore a smile upon her face.His heart misgave him at the sight. Had Lettice deceived him? For amoment he entertained the thought, and he cursed the hope which shehad planted in his heart, and then in a fear of anxiety he lay thelute down and looked to find the fatal bow of black.What was it he saw? His gaze was rivetted upon her dress, by the sideof which hung the long fan. His eyes seemed to dance about, his headswam, and, before he could determine the question, Dorothy had passedby and taken her place at the table.Father Nicholas asked a blessing which was even longer and morewearisome than his predecessor had indulged in, and the occupants ofthe gallery took advantage of the long interval to quaff thegreater portion of the refreshing beverage which Sir George, withcharacteristic generosity, had sent up to them.The prayer had a conclusion though, and when the good father reachedit the fact was signalised by an unanimous, if not very sincere "amen"from the guests, while the band struck up another lively tune.Throughout the meal the musicians had little rest. One tune was playedand immediately another was struck up to take its place, and the gaycompany at the tables laughed and chattered the while with the utmostvivacity and glee.For Manners it was a weary time! There appeared to be no end to thesuccession of dishes, and he impatiently waited for the time when thesignal would be given which would give him unbounded joy or doom himto perpetual misery. To him, at least, the time dragged wearily along,the tunes were lifeless, the courses were inordinately long, andit was a positive relief to him when Nicholas rose up again andpronounced a benediction, equally as long and dreary as the openinggrace.The feast was over now, and as the guests defiled out of the room,another air took the place of the one just concluded. As for Manners,all his efforts were concentrated on watching Dorothy's everymovement. He ceased to play, for he had not the heart to continue,and, without making any pretence to be playing his instrument, he laidhis lute down and watched with eager eyes.He noticed that his rival sat by her side, nor did she repel him.When she arose he rose too, and together they started to go out of thechamber. Dorothy lingered; Stanley lingered too. What, O what couldshe be lingering for? In his anxiety Manners stood up to see thebetter. His pulse moved in jerks and bounds; his heart rose to histhroat, and he gasped for very breath.The lively tune pursued the even tenour of its way; the burly form ofthe leader screened him well from view, and that functionary was toomuch engrossed in the execution of the piece to remark the peculiarconduct of his companion.Dorothy lingered to look at the pictures she knew so well; but SirEdward tarried at her side. It was evident he was not at all disposedto leave her, and Dorothy herself at last gave up all hopes of hisdoing so.Sir Edward said something to her, but the noise drowned the sound ofhis voice, and Manners could not hear what it was he had said, but thenext moment she permitted Stanley to lead her towards the door.The poor minstrel's heart sank at the sight. Was this, then, thefulfilment of Lettice's promise? Had he so misjudged the characterof his beloved? He dismissed the thought, for he could not believe iteven then.No, it was not so. Dorothy paused and turned back. Mannersinvoluntarily stood up and followed her with his eyes. Margaret andher betrothed were behind, and to them she went. His spirits revivedagain.She laughingly raised her fan and pointed to the carving on the wall.Was the black knot on? He gasped for breath as he anxiously looked tosee. It surely was not there. At all events he could not see it, butthen his eyes might be deceiving him, for she was at the further endof the room. Ah! would she only drop the fan which was held up in hertrembling hand, and then--With a clatter the fan dropped upon the pavement. Sir Edward gallantlystooped down and returned it to its fair owner, but Manners waited tosee no more. She was his; the signal had been given, and pickingup his instrument he set to and contributed as good a share to thegladsome melody as any of his fellows.CHAPTER XXXII.PLAIN JOHN MANNERS WINS HIS BRIDE.  One touch of her hand, and one word in her ear,  When they reached the hall-door the charger stood near:  So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,  So light to the saddle before her he sprung!  "She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur,  They'll have fleet steeds that follow," quoth young Lochinvar.  SCOTT.Fast waxed the fun at Haddon, and loud above the strains of music rosethe sounds of merriment in the grand old Hall.It was the bridal night. Margaret Vernon had redeemed hertroth-plight, given to Sir Thomas Stanley early in the summer, and inthe former part of the day she had been joined in holy wedlock withher lover by Father Nicholas Bury, with more of the Roman Catholicritual than Queen Elizabeth's ministers would have approved of hadthey known it.Never had Haddon been so full of visitors before. Never had it been sogay. None who came had been turned away. The baron kept an open house,and whilst the rooms of the Hall were strained to the uttermost tofind accommodation for the numerous guests, the gate had been throngedthroughout the livelong day by an eager crowd of expectant beggars,none of whom had gone away with empty hands.But now the night was closing in, and the visitors were determined tomake the most of it. Sir George was almost ubiquitous. Here, there,wherever the mirth was loudest, there the form of the jovial baron wassure to be found. Old knights and equally elderly dames congregatedtogether in the capacious oriel windows, and, with the tapestrycurtains drawn aside, talked of the good old times of "Bluff KingHal," and pointed out with pride of superiority of their own happyage to these degenerate days. Middle-aged matrons sat proudly watchingtheir offspring as they flitted to and fro, and noted with muchsatisfaction the matchless beauty of their own daughters, and themediocrity of the rest; or, were they so inclined, footed it, as ofold, with equally middle-aged gallants. Sir Benedict a Woode soonretired from the scene, and taking advantage of his intimate knowledgeof the building, he led a few convivial spirits, like himself, intothe wine-cellar, which they did their utmost to empty, until, havingimbibed too much, they were fain to lie down, through sheer inabilityto stand.It was from the rising generation, however, that the greatestmerriment arose. These, paired off in ever changing couples, whirledfrom one end of the room to the other, and then, without a pause,returned again, heedless alike of the gratulations of their elderfriends as they passed them by, and of the indifferent gaze of thosewho were not their friends who looked at them with jealous eyes.Dorothy, with a heavy load at her heart, wore a bright and evensmiling face. She received the flattering service of her admirers asof old, and danced impartially with all who asked for the privilege.Even Sir Edward Stanley, although she cordially disliked him, camein for a goodly share of her favours. He had noted a change in herconduct of late, and that change was for the better. He imagined thatshe was readier to accept his advances, and when he had communicatedhis thoughts to his brother, they were confirmed in almost everyrespect. Sir Thomas had remarked exactly the same change, and theyreadily ascribed it to a yielding of the maiden's spirit.Little did they suspect that this alteration in her bearing was dueto any other cause than that Manners was being forgotten, and inhis happiness at the change, Sir Edward was content to let her enjoyherself as she listed, feeling sure that ere the end of another monththere would be another bridal party, in which Dorothy Vernon andhimself would be the principal actors.When the merriment was at its highest, and the boisterousness was atits climax, Dorothy remembered that the time was fast approaching whenshe would have to depart. Her lover--he who had risked so much for hersake--would be waiting in the cold meadow with the horses waiting forher! and she sank down to rest, well knowing the terrible strain shewould soon be called upon to endure."Fair Mistress Dorothy is tired, I perceive," quoth a young knight, ashe approached her, longing for her company in another dance."Aye," she answered. "I have danced too much, sir knight, and my shoepinches too," she added, with perfect truth."Then by my troth," responded the gallant youth, "I swear you have afull small shoe.""Come, Dorothy," said Margaret as she came up to her sister's side,"here is a gentle knight who would dance with thee," and she gravelyintroduced the veteran cavalier De Lacey."You will forgive me awhile, will you not, Sir John?" said Dorothy,"for I am wearied and the room is over hot," and smiling back at thegracious reply of the old knight, who accepted her excuse, she retiredto the corner of the room, while the disappointed De Lacey proceededto join company with Sir Benedict a Woode, and found solace inquaffing the baron's wine.Dorothy's heart was beating fast; the critical moment had come. Shewas close beside the door which led into the ante-chamber, and aslight noise in that apartment recalled to her memory the fact thather faithful maid Lettice was waiting for her there.She lingered, and her resolution wavered. It was hard to go andleave behind the scenes of merry childhood and all the pleasantrecollections connected with the home; and as she sat there undecided,many pleasant recollections rushed back into her memory and pleadedpowerfully with her tender heart. But the greatest pang of all was theparting from the baron. She loved him sincerely, and she knew that heloved her dearly in return. This it was which now held her back, butthe movements of her maid in the adjoining room continually remindedher that her lover would be waiting for her with an anxious heart.The struggle which raged in her breast was bitter, but shortand decisive. The love she bore to Manners outweighed all otherconsiderations, and casting a last fond look at the scene from whichshe was about to tear herself, she chose a moment when a peal oflaughter at the further end of the room attracted the attention of thecompany, and slipping behind the tapestry curtain, she pushed the doorgently open and stole quietly through.It was a desperate thing to do, and required all the nerve thatDorothy had at her command. How the door creaked as she closed itafter her. It must, surely, call attention to the fact that she hadpassed through. But no one came, and she flung herself into the armsof her maid, trembling like an aspen leaf with fear."Oh, Lettice," she sobbed, "tell the baron I love him still, andMargaret, too. Poor Meg! 'tis hard to be severed thus.""Hush, my lady," replied the maid. "This is no time for weeping.Master Manners hath been here awaiting thee. I bade him go, for thatwere neither safe for him nor thee.""You shall join us soon, Lettice. But, O! give my duty to the baron. Ishould care naught were it not for him--and Meg; but Margaret is happynow.""And so shalt thou be soon. But haste! moments are precious now. Thygown and everything has gone, and the brave Master Manners waits forthee alone. There, go. Hark! someone is coming," and throwing a shawlover the graceful shoulders of her mistress, Lettice affectionatelyembraced her, and watching her hasten down the steps she waited untilDorothy was out of sight before shutting and barring the doors behindher.As Dorothy passed the ballroom, she could hear distinctly the soundsof merriment within, but she heeded them not. The lights shone throughthe open oriel windows right upon her path, but she crept under theshadow of the wall and passed hastily on. It was a trying time, butshe safely passed through it, and quickly found herself at the littlelatchet gate below the bowling green. It stood open, and through itshe hastened, casting neither a look to the right nor to the left, noryet behind her, but only anxious that her escape should be unknown.Down the slope she ran, nor did she stop until she found herselfclasped in the fond embrace of her lover, upon the footbridge."My darling," murmured Manners, "thou art come at last. God blessthee, my love," and he kissed the tear-stained face over and overagain."I am ready, John," she murmured; "but quick, hasten! our start willbe short, for they will mark my absence soon."Bestowing another shower of kisses upon her, Manners led her acrossthe narrow bridge. How gaily the water danced and sparkled and mademelody amongst the stones! How the wind sighed sweetly and whisperedamong the trees, and how the strains of music and the sounds ofrevelry sounded through the open windows of the Hall. But of all thesounds that Manners heard there was none which thrilled him so much,or caused him so much happiness, as the sound of Dorothy's dress asit rustled against the walls of the narrow bridge when they passedthrough.Once on the other side there was no delay. The horses were in waiting,and seizing the bridle of one, Manners helped Dorothy to mount intothe saddle, and then lightly springing into another, he set spurs tohis steed and away they started.The most sequestered roads were chosen, for they wished to see as fewpeople as possible, and to be seen by none. But Manners did not trustto this alone. He felt the preciousness of his charge, and had broughthorses and men with him, whom he sent off in couples by differentroads, to lead their pursuers on a false scent if pursuit were made.All through the night they rode. Scenes which charmed them beforethey now passed by unnoticed, and their grandeur was ignored. Masson'sheights, up which they had often wandered together, instilled nopleasant thoughts within their breasts now; their one object, whichengrossed all their attention, was to hasten forward to gain a havenof safety.As the grey light of the morning broke upon them, and the rising sunbegan to make its appearance, they crossed the border, and passed outof the county of Derby into the neighbouring shire of Leicester. Stillthey pushed on, for there was no telling how soon their pursuers mightbe upon them; nor did they draw rein until well into the morning,when, though Dorothy, animated for the time being with a wonderfulamount of endurance, gave her voice for hastening forward, Mannersdeemed it advisable, for her sake, to stay.They stopped their steeds at a wayside inn, but here so unusual asight as two travellers on horseback--one a maiden of surpassingbeauty, clothed in rare and costly silks, and the other a gallantyoung knight--soon caused a little crowd of curious rustics tocongregate around the house."Poor lady," exclaimed one tender-hearted matron, as she watchedDorothy dismount. "She is of gentle blood; just see how weary shelooks.""Didst ever see the likes of such a riding dress afore?" asked herneighbour, as she eyed Doll's dress admiringly."Beshrew me," added an onlooker of the sterner sex, "'tis a runawaymatch, I'll warrant me. These horses are ridden to death."Neither Dorothy nor Manners was disposed to stay any longer than wasnecessary amid such a curious people, and after partaking of a goodbreakfast, and indulging in a little rest, they started on their wayagain, with a fresh relay of horses.This time they never stopped until they rode up to the little church,within which the shivering clergyman sat, anxiously awaiting thecouple whom he had engaged to marry.He was ignorant of the plot, and though he might have guessedit pretty well, he was by no means anxious to lose byover-inquisitiveness the handsome fee which the young man hadpromised. He only chafed at their delay, and when at length theyarrived and entered the sacred edifice he proceeded straightway withthe service, quite as anxious to get it over, so that he might partakeof his breakfast, as were the couple before him, and almost as quicklyas they could have wished."Wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife?" said the parson, ashe gabbled on with the service."Aye, I will!" responded Manners, in a clear ringing voice which wasechoed among the rafters of the roof, and he took her to his bosom andsealed the pledge with a kiss--a proceeding so unusual and peculiarthat the good clergyman opened his eyes and mouth, until finally hecame to a full stop."I will!" repeated Manners, addressing the parson, "but why do youstop?" and he looked suspiciously behind to see if his pursuers hadcome to rob him of his prize. There was no one there, however, save afew rustics, who, prompted by sheer curiosity, had entered the churchand stood lingering just within the sacred portal, and in a fewminutes more the lovers emerged from the little church, safely joinedtogether in the bonds of holy wedlock, followed by the parson, whowore a smiling face, inasmuch as he had been rewarded with a gift farbeyond his utmost expectations. But the two lovers were far happierthan he, and with the certificate of marriage, signed, sealed, andentered in the register, they remounted their steeds and proceeded ata steady pace to Nottingham Castle, where, the Earl of Rutland havingunexpectedly returned, he extended a right hearty welcome to hisnephew and his beautiful bride.CHAPTER XXXIII.PEACE AT LAST.  Nor was she to be found! Her father cried,  "'Tis but to make a trial of his love!"  And filled his glass to all, but his hand shook,  And soon from guest to guest the panic spread.  ROGERS.Still at Haddon the fun maintained its uproarious course, and amid thewhirl of festivity Dorothy's absence was not remarked.Sir Edward Stanley was far too elated with the vision of success whichhad opened out before him to bore Dorothy with his presence on thisoccasion, but in spite of this he rarely let his eyes depart fromwatching her."Hi, Sir Edward," cried an inquisitive old dame from one of the deepwindow recesses. "Hither, good knight, for I would talk with theeawhile."He could not very well resist such a direct appeal, but he took hisseat beside her unwillingly enough."I hear, Sir Edward," confidentially began the dame, "that in a monthyou are to wed Mistress Dorothy Vernon; is that so?""It is," he replied, curtly."You are a lucky knight, then," she replied, "for, except my Isabel,Dorothy is the fairest maiden I have ever clapt eyes on. But then,Isabel, forsooth, is not so rich. We cannot all be Vernons, you know,though if everybody had their deserts we--""Yes, I trow that she is rich and fair; but for neither of these do Icare so much as her love," gallantly responded Stanley."Tut, now, Sir Edward," pursued his tormentor, "both you and I knowfull well that people marry for riches and rank, not for beauty. Youmarry for riches, I suppose, and she for rank. Now, sir knight, am Inot right?" she asked triumphantly."Nay, my lady, you are far from it. You will excuse me now, I amsure; I am promised a dance with Dorothy shortly," and he got up anddeparted, glad to get away so quickly, and deaf to her entreaty toreturn.His temper was ruffled, and he walked away to look for his partner, tolose his irritation in the sunshine of her company.But Dorothy was nowhere to be seen.He paced up and down the length of the room, chafing at her absence,and peering into every corner and recess as he wandered along. Thedining-room and banqueting-hall were searched equally in vain, andat last the baffled lover concluded that she had retired for a littlerest.He waited, irritated not a little at the long delay. His eye scannedeach passing figure again and again, and rigorously searched eachgroup, but it was all "love's labour lost;" Dorothy could not befound; and finally, unable any longer to control the forebodings ofhis suspicious heart, he hastened to the baron and acquainted him withall his fears."Tush, man," replied Sir George gaily; "maybe she is feeling somewhatout of sorts, or happen she is tired. Margaret!" he called, as thenewly-married maiden was passing along, "do thou seek for Dorothy, myLady Stanley. Thy new brother, Sir Edward, is jealous of her absence.""Ah, prithee do, good Margaret," added that unhappy knight. "Herabsence just at this time bodes no good, I fear, and makes me feeluneasy.""She shall be here soon," replied Lady Stanley, and she went away toseek the truant sister, leaving her husband to beguile the tediousnessof the time by engaging in conversation with his brother. Sir Thomaswas in high glee, and could find no sympathy with the miserableforebodings of his younger brother."I tell thee what, Edward," he said, "thou must let her have morefreedom. You are too rash; you must be astute an you would succeed.Dorothy is drawn by affection, not driven by ill words or sour looks.It had been better for thee, I trow, an thou hadst not pressed for themarriage so soon; but thou hast done it now.""Lady Maude advised me in it, and I cannot say I repent it now, thoughmy heart does misgive ever and again," he replied."That John Manners," continued the elder Stanley, "is a good enoughman, a likely fellow, and would have done well for Dorothy; aye, andhad not you been in the way, he would have won her, too. Thou art nomatch for him, Edward; thou art too impatient."Edward hung down his head, and gazed uncomfortably upon the floor. Hewas conscious of the truth of his brother's statement, and could notwell refute it. He paused in silence, hoping that the subject would bepursued no further."Here comes Margaret," he said, lifting up his head and feelingmightily relieved that the awkward pause had come to an end; butsorely dismayed to see no Dorothy following behind."Where is she?--she has gone!" he almost screamed as he saw the lookof consternation on her face."I cannot find her," Margaret replied, addressing herself to SirThomas. "I have searched her rooms, but all in vain; and no one knowsaught of her, no one has seen her.""Said I not so?" furiously exclaimed Sir Edward. "She has gone; thebird has flown.""What bird?" asked the baron, coming up."Dorothy, Sir George. Dorothy has fled.""Fled; nay it cannot be," returned the baron, stoutly. He had too muchfaith in Dorothy to believe that."They are searching for her now," said Margaret. "Nobody knows whereshe is, and Sir Edward has missed her long. I cannot understand it.""Her clothes are gone. Her riding habit has gone," exclaimed one ofthe domestics, rushing breathlessly up to the group. "Father Nicholashath just come in and he says two horses, galloping, passed him on theAshbourne road. One, he thinks might have been a lady, but it was toodark to see distinctly."This she gasped out in jerks, but her news was intelligible enough,and it threw the whole assembly at once into a ferment of confusion,amid which could be heard the voice of Sir Edward Stanley exclaiming,in a tone far above the rest of the babel--"That was Dorothy.""Gone!" exclaimed the baron, aghast. "Nay, search the Hall.""Out; to your saddles, ye gallant knights," commanded Sir ThomasStanley, promptly. "Here is a prize worth the capturing. She must bestopped!" and he quickly led the way to the stables, and in a veryshort space of time was mounted and urging his steed to the utmostalong the Ashbourne road.Sir George stayed behind; he could not believe that Dorothy hadreally gone; but when a thorough investigation of the Hall, and theoutbuildings also, revealed the fact that she was nowhere there, hewas stricken with dismay, and succumbed, for a time, to a feeling ofdespair."Nicholas," he said, as the worthy father approached to comfort him,"thou art sure that one was a lady?""It was dark, Sir George," the priest replied. "I was unsuspicious,and deep in meditation, but I fear it was so.""Was it my Doll?""I cannot say," he replied. "I never saw the face, and did butimperfectly see the form."The baron sank back, regardless of the ladies who crowded round him,commiserating his ill fortune. He remained silent, with a bowed headand bleeding heart.All night long the pursuit was kept up. Every lane was searched, everyinnkeeper was severely catechised, and although in several instancesthey had the satisfaction of hearing that couples, either on horses orin conveyances, had passed, yet when the quarry was hunted down, if itdid not turn out to be an inoffensive market gardener and his worthyspouse returning from Derby Christmas market, in almost every otherinstance the horsemen were the decoys that Manners had so carefullyprovided.At last the chase was given up. Dorothy had proved one too many forthem, and with mingled feelings her pursuers turned their steeds againtowards Haddon, curious to learn if any of the others had been morefortunate than themselves.The two Stanleys were the last to return, but after having been out inthe saddle for more than a whole day, and that upon the right scent,they were obliged to return without having met with success.The next day was spent in searching the neighbourhood. Every inn andevery house was visited, but the night falling, they returned againempty-handed, and very disconsolate.News came with the next day's courier, for Dorothy dutifullyacquainted her father, in a touching letter, with all the details ofthe engagement, the elopement, and the marriage. Manners, too, sent anote to the baron, in which he pathetically pleaded Dorothy'scause. "And sure," the epistle concluded, "so doting a father as youundoubtedly are would not force so loving a daughter to wed againsther will. You clearly sought her welfare and, in choosing Sir EdwardStanley, thought you were doing well for her, but it was a sadmistake. I have her undivided love, and even if we are for everbanished from 'dear old Haddon,' as Doll delights to call it, we shallbe happy in each other's confidence and love; though I confess thatDorothy hath a tender heart and grieves to think how you must regardher. None but myself, she declares, could ever have led her to leavethee. I feel for thee, but I feel for my sweet Doll, too. At thybidding, whenever given, we will gladly visit thee. Till then--adieu.""Married!" cried Lady Vernon, aghast, as Sir Thomas Stanley read theletter aloud. She was speechless with rage and could say no more, buther looks betokened the feelings of her heart.""Married!" echoed Sir Edward, in dismay."Aye, married," responded Sir Thomas. "You have lost her, Edward; itis as I said.""Poor, foolish Dorothy," exclaimed the baron, in a decidedlysympathetic frame of mind. "Poor Doll.""Poor Dorothy, indeed," retorted Lady Maude, sharply. "Wicked,perverse Dorothy, you mean, Sir George. I shall never look at heragain. We must make her undo the marriage bond again, Sir Edward," shecontinued, turning to the disappointed lover.Even that rash knight could see the futility of such advice, and hedespondently shook his head."Nay," he said, "I fear that cannot be easily done.""Easily done, sir knight," tauntingly replied the dame. "Who talks ofease in a matter like this? It must--it shall be done.""It cannot be done," replied Sir Thomas, promptly. "Manners will havebeen too careful to allow of that. We must resign ourselves to theloss; and you, Edward, will have to seek elsewhere for a bride.""'Resign' and 'cannot,'" continued Lady Vernon, contemptuously."Did'st ever hear the like of it, Margaret?"But Margaret was mercifully inclined, and by siding with Dorothy shewould be supporting her husband. Therefore she could not agree withthe angry declamations of her stepmother."Poor Dorothy," she exclaimed, "I pity her, but she has done foolishlyindeed."Lady Vernon was astonished; she had counted upon Margaret's support atleast."Pity her, indeed!" she scornfully laughed. "She shall have littleenough of my pity if ever I clap my eyes on her again," replied LadyVernon. "She shall never come here again.""Hush, Maude," interrupted the baron, "I shall settle that."Lady Vernon had never been spoken to in such a manner since she hadwedded Sir George, and she staggered back in surprise as though shehad been struck by an invisible hand."You will--!" she began, but checked herself. The baron's brow wasforbidding. She had never seen him look so threatening before, and shecowered back in fear and kept a discreet silence."I am furious," the baron burst out, with a sudden revulsion offeeling. "To think that my Dorothy should serve me thus! and as shehas chosen, so shall it be. She prefers Manners to me, then she shallhave him. I disown her, she is none of mine. She shall never return."Flesh and blood, however, is very human, and, in spite of his sternresolve never to see Dorothy again, the baron's naturally kind heartsoon began to soften, and in a short space of time his feelings hadentirely undergone a change. He longed to clasp his lost darling tohis heart again, and tell her she was forgiven, but he was proud, andhis pride held him back from declaring his sentiments.It was not long to be endured. He became anxious. Dorothy was ill. SirRonald Bury had sent him word of that in a letter which was calculatedto stab the baron to the very heart. He grew restless; his consciencepricked him day and night, until, unable to bear it any longer, hedeclared himself."Maude," he said, as together they sat in the lonely dining-room,"Dorothy has been a month gone now.""Yes," she carelessly replied."And I hear she is sorely ill.""Like enough," said Lady Vernon, not unwilling to make the knightsuffer a little, for she had not forgiven him yet. "She was ill enoughwhen she went.""Then," returned the baron, "she shall come back; we cannot do withouther."Lady Vernon turned sharply round to expostulate with her lord, butseeing his forbidding countenance, she desisted, and her silence SirGeorge tacitly construed as acquiescence."I shall send for her this very day," pursued the good old knight, "wemust try to forget the past, Maude--for, in good sooth, we have alldone amiss--and begin again. We have no Margaret now, and withoutDoll, gone in such a fashion withal, we were miserable indeed.""We must have more balls and feasts," quickly suggested Lady Maude."They will heal our wounds.""Balls and feasts!" repeated the baron. "Nay, we are too old for thosenow. We should only get Benedict and old De Lacey to come, for, by myhalidame, squires and knights won't come to see us now Meg and Dollare gone, and then, Maude, after all, you know," he continued slyly,"love will have its own way, and you trow full well that folk blamedme enough when I wedded."Lady Maude blushed. The comments on her marriage with the baron hadbeen by no means what she might have wished, as the remembrance ofthem was not particularly pleasant to her even now, so she discreetlyheld her peace."We cannot blame her, Maude," went on Sir George, waxing enthusiasticas the love of Dorothy asserted itself more and more within him. "Weare all alike to blame, and had I been John Manners myself, I shouldmaybe have done just what he has done. Who could help it, eh, Maude?Not I, in truth; and then, Manners has done us good service, too. Wemust welcome them back, and make them happy if we can. I shall send amessage off now."Before his feelings had found time to change--even had he sowished--he scrawled a note of forgiveness to the fugitives, prayingthem to return, and before he returned to his wife the messenger wason his way.       *       *       *       *       *A warm welcome awaited gallant John Manners and his beautiful lady as,a week later, they were met by the fond father just outside Haddon.Impatiently, the baron had awaited their return. For two whole dayshe had done little else than watch for their coming, from the loftiestportion of the tall eagle tower, and when at last the little cavalcadecould be distinguished in the far distance, wending its way with allpossible haste towards the Hall, he started off to meet them.It was a glad reunion. Even Lady Maude was touched, as she met them inthe courtyard, and with much more kindliness than she had been wontto treat Doll for some time, she kissed the upraised face; Mannersreceived a stately bow. He, at all events, had much to be forgivenyet; but the baron, casting the last particle of pride to the winds,warmly and repeatedly embraced his daughter, and frankly greeted herhusband.The menials with one accord united to welcome back the youthfulcouple, for Dorothy was universally beloved, and somehow or otherthe story of Manners' disguise had got abroad and had made hosts ofadmiring friends for him, both high and low.Even Lady Maude melted at last and regarded him with favour, butwhether this was because she learned that his uncle, the earl,favoured his nephew and petted his bride, or whether the highlysatisfactory conduct of Master Manners himself gained her esteem, mustbe left for the courteous reader to determine.Happiness now reigned once more in Haddon. The old Hall rung againwith shouts of gladness, and in a short space of time Manners hadthe satisfaction of promoting Lettice's husband to a more honourableposition than he had formerly occupied.At the end of a year, as the oft-falling snows betokened the comingof another Christmas, sad news reached Haddon. Margaret was dead. Thedampness of Castle Rushen had brought on a fever, to which she soonhad succumbed. Thus the whole estates of Haddon fell, ultimately,to Dorothy's share, which she presented to her faithful lover as herdowry. John Manners' descendants, the Rutlands, have had reason to bethankful for this, for it added largely to their riches, but Mannershimself declared that had she brought him all the wealth that "GoodQueen Bess" possessed, he had not been one whit the happier. He couldsee nothing he prized so highly as his wife, and in her he found hisall in all.It is only necessary to add that discord, never again invaded thedomain of Haddon. The marriage proved a happy one; and no one, exceptthe Stanleys, regretted it inTHE END.End of Project Gutenberg's Heiress of Haddon, by William E.

Crowell & CompanyPublishersARCRAOIBH CONNARTHA NA GAEDHILGEI NGLEANN FHAIDHLE BRONNAIM AN LEABHAR SEO:BEANNACHT AGUS BUAIDHLIBHSE GO DEOPrefaceThe romantic tales here retold for the English reader belong neitherto the category of folk-lore nor of myth, although most of themcontain elements of both. They belong, like the tales of Cuchulain,which have been similarly presented by Miss Hull,[1] to the bardicliterature of ancient Ireland, a literature written with an artisticpurpose by men who possessed in the highest degree the native cultureof their land and time. The aim with which these men wrote is alsothat which has been adopted by their present interpreter. I have nottried, in this volume, to offer to the scholar materials for the studyof Celtic myth or folk-lore. My aim, however I may have fulfilled it,has been artistic, not scientific. I have tried, while carefullypreserving the main outline of each story, to treat it exactly as theancient bard treated his own material, or as Tennyson treated thestories of the MORT D'ARTHUR, that is to say, to present it as a freshwork of poetic imagination. In some cases, as in the story of theChildren of Lir, or that of mac Datho's Boar, or the enchanting taleof King Iubdan and King Fergus, I have done little more than retellthe bardic legend with merely a little compression; but in others acertain amount of reshaping has seemed desirable. The object in allcases has been the same, to bring out as clearly as possible formodern readers the beauty and interest which are either manifest orimplicit in the Gaelic original.   [1] CUCHULAIN, THE HOUND OF ULSTER. By Eleanor Hull.For stories which are only found in MSS. written in the older forms ofthe language, I have been largely indebted to the translationspublished by various scholars. Chief among these (so far as thepresent work is concerned) must be named Mr Standish HayesO'Grady--whose wonderful treasure-house of Gaelic legend, SILVAGADELICA, can never be mentioned by the student of these matterswithout an expression of admiration and of gratitude; Mr A.H. Leahy,author of HEROIC ROMANCES OF IRELAND; Dr Whitly Stokes, Professor KunoMeyer, and M. d'Arbois de Jubainville, whose invaluable CYCLEMYTHOLOGIQUE IRLANDAIS has been much in my hands, both in the originaland in the excellent English translation of Mr R.I. Best. Particularsof the source of each story will be found in the Notes on the Sourcesat the end of this volume. In the same place will also be found apronouncing-index of proper names. I have endeavoured, in the text, toavoid or to modify any names which in their original form would bafflethe English reader, but there remain some on the pronunciation ofwhich he may be glad to have a little light.The two most conspicuous figures in ancient Irish legend areCuchulain, who lived--if he has any historical reality--in the reignof Conor mac Nessa immediately before the Christian era, and Finn sonof Cumhal, who appears in literature as the captain of a kind ofmilitary order devoted to the service of the High King of Irelandduring the third century A.D. Miss Hull's volume has been named afterCuchulain, and it is appropriate that mine should bear the name ofFinn, as it is mainly devoted to his period; though, as will be seen,several stories belonging to other cycles of legend, which did notfall within the scope of Miss Hull's work, have been included here.[2]All the tales have been arranged roughly in chronological order. Thisdoes not mean according to the date of their composition, which inmost cases is quite indiscoverable, and still less, according to thedates of the MSS. in which they are contained. The order is given bythe position, in real or mythical history, of the events they dealwith. Of course it is not practicable to dovetail them into oneanother with perfect accuracy. Where a story, like that of theChildren of Lir, extends over nearly a thousand years, beginning withthe mythical People of Dana and ending in the period of Christianmonasticism, one can only decide on its place by considering where itwill throw most light on those which come nearest to it. In this, asin the selection and treatment of the tales, there is of course roomfor much difference of opinion. I can only ask the critic to believethat nothing has been done in the framing of this collection of Gaelicromances without the consideration and care which the value of thematerial demands and which the writer's love of it has inspired.T.W. ROLLESTON   [2] There is one important tale of the Finn cycle, the _Pursuit   of Dermot and Grania_, which I have not included. I have   omitted it, partly because it presents the character of Finn in   a light inconsistent with what is said of him elsewhere, and   partly because it has in it a certain sinister and depressing   element which renders it unsuitable for a collection intended   largely for the young.CONTENTS   INTRODUCTION      COIS NA TEINEADH   BARDIC ROMANCES         I.

Joyce in his OLDCELTIC ROMANCES, and by Standish O'Grady for the whole story ofCuchulain, but in this case with so large an imitation of the Homericmanner that the Celtic spirit of the story was in danger of beinglost. This was the fault I had to find with that inspiring book,[3]but it was a fault which had its own attraction.   [3] I gave this book--_The History of Ireland_ (HEROIC   PERIOD)--to Burne-Jones in order to interest him in Irish myth   and legend. "I'll try and read it," he said. A week afterwards   he came and said--"It is a new world of thought and pleasure   you have opened to me. I knew nothing of this, and life is   quite enlarged. But now, I want to see all the originals. Where   can I get them?"I have only spoken of prose writing above. But in poetry (and inPoetry well fitted to the tales), this work had already been donenobly, and with a fine Celtic splendour of feeling and expression, bySir Samuel Ferguson.Since then, a number of writers have translated into literary Englisha host of the Irish tales, and have done this with a just reverencefor their originals. Being, in nearly every case, Irish themselves,they have tried, with varying success, to make their readers realizethe wild scenery of Ireland, her vital union with the sea and thegreat ocean to the West, those changing dramatic skies, that mysticweather, the wizard woods and streams which form the constantbackground of these stories; nor have they failed to allure theirlisteners to breathe the spiritual air of Ireland, to feel itspathetic, heroic, imaginative thrill.They have largely succeeded in their effort. The Irish bardic taleshave now become a part of English literature and belong not only togrown up persons interested in early poetry, in mythology andfolk-customs, but to the children of Ireland and England. Our newimaginative stories are now told in nurseries, listened to at eveningwhen the children assemble in the fire-light to hear tales from theirparents, and eagerly read by boys at school. A fresh world ofstory-telling has been opened to the imagination of the young.This could not have been done in the right way if it had not been forthe previous work of Celtic scholars in Ireland, and particularly onthe Continent, in France and Germany. Having mastered medieval Irish,they have translated with careful accuracy many of the ancient tales,omitting and changing nothing; they have edited them critically,collating and comparing them with one another, and with other forms ofthe same stories. We have now in English, French, and German the exactrepresentation of the originals with exhaustive commentaries.When this necessary work was finished--and it was absolutelynecessary--it had two important results on all work of the kind MrRolleston has performed in this book--on the imaginative recasting andmodernizing of the ancient tales. First, it made it lawful and easyfor the modern artist--in sculpture, painting, poetry, or imaginativeprose--to use the stories as he pleased in order to give pleasure tothe modern world. It made it lawful because he could reply to thosewho objected that what he produced was not the real thing--"The realthing exists; you will find it, when you wish to see it, accuratelyand closely translated by critical and competent scholars. I refer youto the originals in the notes to this book. I have found the materialsof my stories in these originals; and it is quite lawful for me, nowthat they have been reverently preserved, to use them as I please forthe purpose of giving pleasure to the modern world--to make out ofthem fresh imaginative work, as the medieval writers did out of theoriginal stories of Arthur and his men." This is the defence anyre-caster of the ancient tales might make of the _lawfulness_ of hiswork, and it is a just defence; having, above all, this use--that itleaves the imagination of the modern artist free, yet withinrecognized and ruling limits, to play in and around his subject.One of those limits is the preservation, in any remodelling of thetales, of the Celtic atmosphere. To tell the Irish stories in themanner of Homer or Apuleius, in the manner of the Norse sagas, or inthe manner of Malory, would be to lose their very nature, their soul,their nationality. We should no longer understand the men and womenwho fought and loved in Ireland, and whose characters were moulded byIrish surroundings, customs, thoughts, and passions. We should not seeor feel the landscape of Ireland or its skies, the streams, the woods,the animals and birds, the mountain solitudes, as we feel and seethem in the original tales. We should not hear, as we hear in theirfirst form, the stormy seas between Scotland and Antrim, or the greatwaves which roar on the western isles, and beat on cliffs which stillbelong to another world than ours. The genius of Ireland would desertour work.And it would be a vast pity to lose the Irish atmosphere in thetelling of the Irish tales, because it is unique; not only distinctfrom that of the stories of other races, but from that of the otherbranches of the Celtic race. It differs from the atmosphere of thestories of Wales, of Brittany, of the Highlands and islands ofScotland. It is more purely Celtic, less mixed than any of them. Ahundred touches in feeling, in ways of thought, in sensitiveness tobeauty, in war and voyaging, and in ideals of life, separate it fromthat of the other Celtic races.It is owing to the careful, accurate, and critical work of continentaland Irish scholars on the manuscript materials of Irish Law, History,Bardic Tales, and Poetry; on customs, dress, furniture, architecture,ornament, on hunting and sailing; on the manners of men and women inwar and peace, that the modern re-teller of the Irish tales is enabledto conserve the Irish atmosphere. And this conservation of the specialIrish atmosphere is the second result which the work of the criticalscholars has established. If the re-writer of the tales does not usethe immense materials made ready to his hand for illustration,expansion, ornament and description in such a way that Ireland, andonly Ireland, lives in his work from line to line, he is greatly to beblamed.Mr Rolleston has fulfilled these conditions with the skill and thefeeling of an artist. He has clung closely to his originals with anaffectionate regard for their ancientry, their ardour and theirdistinction, and yet has, within this limit, used and modified themwith a pleasant freedom. His love of Ireland has instilled into hisrepresentation of these tales a passion akin to that which gave thembirth. We feel, as we read, how deep his sympathy has been with theirintensity, their love of wild nature, their desire for beauty, theirinterest in humanity and in character, their savagery and theirtenderness, their fairy magic and strange imaginations that suddenlysurprise and charm. Whenever anything lovely emerges in the tale, hedoes not draw attention to it, but touches it with so artistic apencil that its loveliness is enhanced. And he has put into Englishverse the Irish poems scattered through the tales with the skill andthe temper of a poet. I hope his book will win what it deserves--theglad appreciation of old and young in England, and the gratitude ofIreland.The stories told in this book belong to three distinct cycles of Irishstory-telling. The first are mythological, and are concerned with theearly races that are fabled to have dwelt and fought in Ireland Amongthese the Tuatha De Danaan were the final conquerors, and held theland for two hundred years They were, it is supposed, of the Celticstock, but they were not the ancestors of the present Irish. Thesewere the Milesians (Irish, Scots or Gaelic who, conquering the TuathaDe Danaan, ruled Ireland till they were overcome by the English.) Thestories which have to do with the Tuatha De Danaan are mythical and ofa great antiquity concerning men and women, the wisest and the best ofwhom became gods, and who appear as divine beings in the cycle oftales which follow after them They were always at war with a fierceand savage people called Fomorians, whom they finally defeated and thestrife between them may mythically represent the ancient war betweenthe good and evil principles in the world.In the next cycle we draw nearer to history, and are in the world notof myth but of legend. It is possible that some true history may behidden underneath its sagas, that some of its personages may behistorical, but we cannot tell. The events are supposed to occur aboutthe time of the birth of Christ, and seventeen hundred years afterthose of the mythical period. This is the cycle which collects itswars and sorrows and splendours around the dominating figure ofCuchulain, and is called the Heroic or the Red Branch or the Ultoniancycle. Several sagas tell of the birth, the life, and the death ofCuchulain, and among them is the longest and the most important--theTain--the _Cattle Raid of Cooley_.Others are concerned with the great King Conor mac Nessa, and the mostknown and beautiful of these is the sorrowful tale of Deirdre. Thereare many others of the various heroes and noble women who belonged tothe courts of Conor and of his enemy Queen Maev of Connaght. The_Carving of mac Datho's Boar_, the story of _Etain and Midir_, and the_Vengeance of Mesgedra_, contained in this book belong to thesemiscellaneous tales unconnected with the main saga of Cuchulain.The second cycle is linked to the first, not by history or race, butby the fact that the great personages in the first have now become thegods who intervene in the affairs of the wars and heroes of thesecond. They take part in them as the gods do in the Iliad and theOdyssey. Lugh, the Long-Handed, the great Counsellor of the Tuatha DeDanaan, is now a god, and is the real father of Cuchulain, heals himof his wounds in the Battle of the Ford, warns him of his comingdeath, and receives him into the immortal land. The Morrigan, whodescends from the first cycle, is now the goddess of war, and is atfirst the enemy and afterwards the lover of Cuchulain. Angus, TheDagda, Mananan the sea-god, enter not only into the sagas of thesecond cycle, but into those of the third, of the cycle of Finn. Andall along to the very end of the stories, and down indeed to thepresent day, the Tuatha De Danaan appear in various forms, slowlylessening in dignity and power, until they end in the fairy folk inwhom the Irish peasants still believe. They are alive and stillpowerful in the third--the Fenian--cycle of stories, some of which arecontained and adorned in this book. In their continued presence is theonly connexion which exists between the three cycles. No personages ofthe first save these of the gods appear in the Heroic cycle, none ofthe Heroic cycle appears in the Fenian cycle. Seventeen hundred years,according to Irish annalists, separate the first from the second, morethan two hundred years separate the second from the beginning of thethird.The third cycle is called Fenian because its legends tell, for themost part, of the great deeds of the Feni or Fianna, who were themilitia employed by the High King to support his supremacy, to keepIreland in order, to defend the country from foreign invasion. Theywere, it seems, finally organized by Cormac mac Art, 227 A.D.(?) thegrandson of Conn the Hundred Fighter. But they had loosely existedbefore in the time of Conn and his son Art, and like all mercenarybodies of this kind were sometimes at war with the kings who employedthem. Finally, at the battle of Gowra, they and their power were quitedestroyed. Long before this destruction, they were led in the reignof Cormac by Finn the son of Cumhal, and it is around Finn and Oisinthe son of Finn, that most of the romances of the Fenian cycle aregathered. Others which tell of the battles and deeds of Conn and Artand Cormac and Cairbre of the Liffey, Cormac's son, are more or lesslinked on to the Fenians. On the whole, Finn and his warriors, each ofa distinct character, warlike skill and renown, are the mainpersonages of the cycle, and though Finn is not the greatest warrior,he is their head and master because he is the wisest; and thismasterdom by knowledge is for the first time an element in Irishstories.If the tales of the first cycle are mythological and of the secondheroic, these are romantic. The gods have lost their dreadful, eventheir savage character, and have become the Fairies, full often ofgentleness, grace, and humour. The mysterious dwelling places of thegods in the sea, in unknown lands, in the wandering air, are now inpalaces under the green hills of Ireland, or by the banks of swiftclear rivers, like the palace of Angus near the Boyne, or across theseas in Tir-na-n-Og, the land of immortal youth, whither Niam bringsOisin to live with her in love, as Morgan le Fay brought Ogier theDane to her fairyland. The land of the Immortals in the heroic cycle,to which, in the story of _Etain and Midir_ in this book, Midir bringsback Etain after she has sojourned for a time on earth, is quitedifferent in conception from the Land of Youth over the far seas wheredelightfulness of life and love is perfect. This, in its conception ofan unknown world where is immortal youth, where stormless skies, happyhunting, strange adventure, gentle manners dwell, where love is freeand time is unmarked, is pure romance. So are the adventures of Finnagainst enchanters, as in the story of the _Birth of Oisin_, of_Dermot in the Country under the Seas_, in the story of the _Pursuitof the Gilla Dacar_, of the wild love-tale of _Dermot and Grania_,flying for many years over all Ireland from the wrath of Finn, and ofa host of other tales of enchantments and battle, and love, andhunting, and feasts, and discoveries, and journeys, invasions,courtships, and solemn mournings. No doubt the romantic atmosphere hasbeen deepened in these tales by additions made to them by successivegenerations of bardic singers and storytellers, but for all that theoriginal elements in the stories are romantic as they are not in theprevious cycles.Again, these Fenian tales are more popular than the others. DouglasHyde has dwelt on this distinction. "For 1200 years at least, theyhave been," he says, "intimately bound up with the thought andfeelings of the whole Gaelic race in Ireland and Scotland." Even atthe present day new forms are given to the tales in the cottage homesof Ireland. And it is no wonder. The mysterious giant forms of themythological period, removed by divinity from the sympathy of men; thevast heroic figures of Cuchulain and his fellows and foes, their closerelation to supernatural beings and their doings, are far apart fromthe more natural humanity of Cormac and Finn, of Dermot and Goll, ofOisin and Oscar, of Keelta, and last of Conan, the coward, boaster andvenomous tongue, whom all the Fenians mocked and yet endured. They area very human band of fighting men, and though many of them, like Oisinand Finn and Dermot, have adventures in fairyland, they preserve inthese their ordinary human nature. The Connacht peasant has nodifficulty in following Finn into the cave of Slieve Cullinn, wherethe witch turned him into a withered old man, for the village where helives has traditions of the same kind; the love affairs of Finn, ofDermot and Grania, and of many others, are quite in harmony with ahundred stories, and with the temper, of Irish lovers. A closer, asimpler humanity than that of the other cycles pervades the Feniancycle, a greater chivalry, a greater courtesy, and a greatertenderness. We have left the primeval savagery behind, themultitudinous slaughtering, the crude passions of the earlier men andwomen; we are nearer to civilization, nearer to the common temper andcharacter of the Irish people. No one can doubt this who will comparethe _Vengeance of Mesgedra_ with the _Chase of the Gilla Dacar_.The elaborate courtesy with which Finn and his chief warriors receiveall comers, as in the story of Vivionn the giantess, is quite new,even medieval in its chivalry; so is the elaborate code of honour; soalso is, on the whole, the treatment of women and their relation tomen. How far this resemblance to medieval romance has been intrudedinto the stories--(there are some in which there is not a trace ofit)--by the after editors and re-editors of the tales, I cannot tell,but however that may be, their presence in the Fenian cycle is plain;and this brings the stories into a kindlier and more pleasurableatmosphere for modern readers than that which broods in thunderousskies and fierce light over dreadful passions and battles thick andbloody in the previous cycles. We are in a gentler world.Another more modern romantic element in the Fenian legends is thedelight in hunting, and that more affectionate relation of men toanimals which always marks an advance in civilization. Hunting, as inmedieval romance, is one of the chief pleasures of the Fenians. Sixmonths of the year they passed in the open, getting to know every partof the country they had to defend, and hunting through the great woodsand over the hills for their daily food and their daily delight. Thestory of the _Chase of the Gilla Dacar_ tells, at its beginning, of agreat hunting and of Finn's men listening with joy to the cries of thehunters and the loud chiding of the dogs; and many tales celebrate thefollowing of the stag and the wild boar from early dawn to theevening. Then Finn's two great hounds, Bran and Sceolaun, are loved byFinn and his men as if they were dear friends; and they, when theirmaster is in danger or under enchantment wail like human beings forhis loss or pain. It is true Cuchulain's horses weep tears of bloodwhen he goes forth to his last battle, foreknowing his death; but theyare immortal steeds and have divine knowledge of fate. The dogs ofFinn are only dogs, and the relation between him and them is a naturalrelation, quite unlike the relation between Cuchulain and the horseswhich draw his chariot. Yet Finn's dogs are not quite as other dogs.They have something of a human soul in them. They know that in themilk-white fawn they pursue there is an enchanted maiden, and theydefend her from the other hounds till Finn arrives. And it is told ofthem that sometimes, when the moon is high, they rise from theirgraves and meet and hunt together, and speak of ancient days. Thesupernatural has lessened since the heroic cycle. But it is stillthere in the Fenian.Again, the Fenian cycle of tales is more influenced by Christianitythan the others are. The mythological cycle is not only fully pagan,it is primeval. It has the vastness, the savagery, the relentlessnessof nature-myths, and what beauty there is in it is akin to terror.Gentleness is unknown. There is only one exception to this, so far asI know, and that is in the story of _The Children of Lir_. It isplain, however, that the Christian ending of that sorrowful story is alater addition to it. It is remarkably well done, and most tenderly. Ibelieve that the artist who did it imported into the rest of the talethe exquisite tenderness which fills it, and yet with so muchreverence for his original that he did not make the body of the storyChristian. He kept the definite Christian element to the very end, buthe filled the whole with its tender atmosphere.No Christianity and very little gentleness intrude into the heroiccycle. The story of Christ once touches it, but he who put it in didnot lose the pagan atmosphere, or the wild fierceness of the mannersof the time. How it was done may be read in this book at the end ofthe story of the _Vengeance of Mesgedra_. Very late in the redactionof these stories a Christian tag was also added to the tale of thedeath of Cuchulain, but it was very badly done.When we come to the Fenian cycle there is a well-defined borderlandbetween them and Christianity. The bulk of the stories is plainlypagan; their originals were frankly so. But the temper of theircomposers is more civilized than that of those who conceived the talesof the previous cycles; the manners, as I have already said, of theirpersonages are gentler, more chivalrous; and their atmosphere is somuch nearer to that of Christianity, that the new Christian elementswould find themselves more at home in them than in the terriblevengeance of Lugh, the savage brutality of Conor to Deirdre, or theraging slaughterings of Cuchulain. So much was this the case that astory was skilfully invented which linked in imagination the Feniancycle to a Christianized Ireland. This story--_Oisin in the Land ofYouth_--is contained in this book. Oisin, or Ossian, the son of Finn,in an enchanted story, lives for 300 years, always young, with hislove in Tir-na-n-Og, and finds on his return, when he becomes awithered old man, St Patrick and Christianity in Ireland. He tells toPatrick many tales of the Fenian wars and loves and glories, and inthe course of them paganism and Christianity are contrasted andintermingled. A certain sympathy with the pagan ideas of honour andcourage and love enters into the talk of Patrick and the monks, andsoftens their pious austerity. On the other hand, the Fenian legendsare gentled and influenced by the Christian elements, in spite of thescorn with which Oisin treats the rigid condemnation of his companionsand of Finn to the Christian hell, and the ascetic and unwarlike lifeof the monks.[4] There was evidently in the Fenian cycle ofstory-telling a transition period in which the bards ran Christianityand paganism in and out of one another, and mingled the atmosphere ofboth, and to that period the last editing of the story of _Lir and hisChildren_ may be referred. A lovely story in this book, put into fineform by Mr Rolleston, is as it were an image of this transitiontime--the story or _How Ethne quitted Fairyland_. It takes us back tothe most ancient cycle, for it tells of the great gods Angus andMananan, and then of how they became, after their conquest by the racewho live in the second cycle, the invisible dwellers in a Fairycountry of their own during the Fenian period, and, afterwards, whenPatrick and the monks had overcome paganism. Thus it mingles togetherelements from all the periods. The mention of the great caldron andthe swine which always renew their food is purely mythological. Thecows which come from the Holy Land are Christian. Ethne herself isborn in the house of a pagan god who has become a Fairy King, butloses her fairy nature and becomes human; and the reason given forthis is an interesting piece of psychology which would never haveoccurred to a pagan world. She herself is a transition maiden, and,suddenly finding herself outside the fairy world and lost, happens ona monastery and dies on the breast of St Patrick. But she dies becauseof the wild wailing for her loss of the fairy-host, whom she can hearbut cannot see, calling to her out of the darkened sky to come back toher home. And in her sorrow and the battle in her between the love ofChrist and of Faerie, she dies. That is a symbol, not intended as suchby its conceiver, but all the more significant, of the transitiontime. Short as it is, few tales, perhaps, are more deeply charged withspiritual meaning.   [4] I speak here of the better known of the two versions of   this encounter of the pagan with the Christian spirit. There   are others in which the reconciliation is carried still   further. One example is to be found in the _Colloquy of the   Ancients_ (SILVA GADELICA). Here Finn and his companions are   explicitly pronounced to be saved by their natural virtues, and   the relations of the Church and the Fenian warriors are most   friendly.Independent of these three cycles, but often touching them here andthere, and borrowing from them, there are a number of miscellaneoustales which range from the earliest times till the coming of theDanes. The most celebrated of these are the _Storming of the Hostel_with the death of Conary the High King of Ireland, and the story ofthe Boru tribute. Two examples of these miscellaneous tales of a highantiquity are contained in this book--_King Iubdan and King Fergus_and _Etain and Midir_. Both of them have great charm anddelightfulness.Finally, the manner in which these tales grew into form must beremembered when we read them. At first, they were not written down,but recited in hall and with a harp's accompaniment by the variousbardic story-tellers who were attached to the court of the chieftain,or wandered singing and reciting from court to court. Each bard, if hewas a creator, filled up the original framework of the tale withornaments of his own, or added new events or personages to the tale,or mixed it up with other related tales, or made new tales altogetherattached to the main personages of the original tale--episodes intheir lives into which the bardic fancy wandered. If these new formsof the tales or episodes were imaginatively true to the charactersround which they were conceived and to the atmosphere of the time,they were taken up by other bards and became often separate tales, orif a great number attached themselves to one hero, they finally formedthemselves into one heroic story, such as that which is gathered roundCuchulain, which, as it stands, is only narrative, but might in timehave become epical. Indeed, the Tain approaches, though at somedistance, an epic. In this way that mingling of elements out of thethree cycles into a single Saga took place.Then when Christianity came, the Irish who always, Christians or not,loved their race and its stories, would not let them go. They tookthem and suffused them with a Christian tenderness, even a Christianforgiveness. Or they inserted Christian endings, while they left therest of the stories as pagan as before. Later on, while the storieswere still learned by the bards and recited, they were written down,and somewhat spoiled by a luxurious use of ornamental adjectives, andby the weak, roving and uninventive fancy of men and monks aspiring toliterature but incapable of reaching it.However, in spite of all this intermingling and of the different formsof the same story, it is possible for an intelligent and sensitivecriticism, well informed in comparative mythology and folklore, toisolate what is very old in these tales from that which is less old,and that in turn from that which is still less old, and that from whatis partly historical, medieval or modern. This has been done, withendless controversy, by those excellent German, French, and Irishscholars who have, with a thirsty pleasure, recreated the ancientliterature of Ireland, and given her once more a literary name amongthe nations--a name which, having risen again, will not lose butincrease its brightness.       *       *       *       *       *As to the stories themselves, they have certain well-markedcharacteristics, and in dwelling on these, I shall chiefly refer, forillustration, to the stories in this book. Some of thesecharacteristic elements belong to almost all mythological tales, andarise from human imagination, in separated lands, working in the sameor in a similar way on the doings of Nature, and impersonating them.The form, however, in which these original ideas are cast is, in eachpeople, modified and varied by the animal life, the climate, theconfiguration of the country, the nearness of mountain ranges and ofthe sea, the existence of wide forests or vast plains, of swift riversand great inland waters.The earliest tales of Ireland are crowded with the sea that wrapt theisland in its arms; and on the west and north the sea was the mightyand mysterious Ocean, in whose far infinities lay for the Irish theland of Immortal Youth. Between its shining shores and Ireland,strange islands--dwelt in by dreadful or by fair and graciouscreatures, whose wonders Maeldun and Brendan visited--lay like jewelson the green and sapphire waters. Out of this vast ocean emerged alsotheir fiercest enemies. Thither, beyond these islands into theUnknown, over the waves on a fairy steed, went Oisin with Niam;thither, in after years, sailed St Brendan, till it seemed he touchedAmerica. In the ocean depths were fair cities and well-grassed landsand cattle, which voyagers saw through water thin and clear. There,too, Brian, one of the sons of Turenn, descended in his water-dressand his crystal helmet, and found high-bosomed maidens weaving in ashining hall. Into the land beneath the wave, Mananan, the proud godof the sea brought Dermot and Finn and the Fianna to help him in hiswars, as is told in the story of the _Gilla Dacar_. On these westernseas, near the land, Lir's daughters, singing and floating, passedthree hundred years. On other seas, in the storm and in the freezingsleet that trouble the dark waves of Moyle, between Antrim and theScottish isles, they spent another three centuries. Half the story ofthe Sons of Usnach has to do with the crossing of seas and with thecoast. Even Cuchulain, who is a land hero, in one of the versions ofhis death, dies fighting the sea-waves. The sound, the restlessness,the calm, the savour and the infinite of the sea, live in a host ofthese stories; and to cap all, the sea itself and Mananan its godsympathise with the fates of Erin. When great trouble threatensIreland, or one of her heroes is near death, there are three hugewaves which, at three different points, rise, roaring, out of theocean, and roll, flooding every creek and bay and cave and river roundthe whole coast with tidings of sorrow and doom. Later on, in theFenian tales, the sea is not so prominent. Finn and his clan are moreconcerned with the land. Their work, their hunting and adventurescarry them over the mountains and plains, through the forests, and bythe lakes and rivers. In the stories there is scarcely any part ofIreland which is not linked, almost geographically, with its scenery.Even the ancient gods have retired from the coast to live in thepleasant green hills or by the wooded shores of the great lakes or inhearing of the soft murmur of the rivers. This business of the sea,this varied aspect of the land, crept into the imagination of theIrish, and were used by them to embroider and adorn their poems andtales. They do not care as much for the doings of the sky. There doesnot seem to be any supreme god of the heaven in their mythology.Neither the sun nor the moon are specially worshipped. There aresun-heroes like Lugh, but no isolated sun-god. The great beauty of thecloud-tragedies of storm, the gorgeous sunrises and sunsets, sodramatic in Ireland, or the magnificence of the starry heavens, arescarcely celebrated. But the Irish folk have heard the sound of thewind in the tree-tops and marked its cold swiftness over the moor, andwatched with fear or love the mists of ocean and the bewilderment ofthe storm-driven snow and the sweet falling of the dew. These arefully celebrated.These great and small aspects of Nature are not only celebrated, theyare loved. One cannot read the stories in this book without feelingthat the people who conceived and made them observed Nature and herways with a careful affection, which seems to be more developed in theCeltic folk than elsewhere in modern Europe. There is nothing whichresembles it in Teutonic story-telling. In the story of _The Childrenof Lir_, though there is no set description of scenery, we feel thespirit of the landscape by the lake where Lir listened for threehundred years to the sweet songs of his children. And, as we read oftheir future fate, we are filled with the solitude and mystery, theruthlessness and beauty of the ocean. Even its gentleness on quietdays enters from the tale into our imagination. Then, too, themountain-glory and the mountain-gloom are again and againimaginatively described and loved. The windings and recesses, thedarkness and brightness of the woods and the glades therein, enchantthe Fenians even when they are in mortal danger. And the waters of thegreat lakes, the deep pools of the rivers, the rippling shallows, thegreen banks, the brown rushing of the torrents, are all alive in theprose and song of Ireland. How deep was the Irish love of thesedelightful things is plain from their belief that "the place of therevealing of poetry was always by the margin of water." And the Salmonof Knowledge, the eating of which gave Finn his pre-eminence, swam ina green pool, still and deep, over which hung a rowan tree that shedits red berries on the stream. Lovely were the places whence Art andKnowledge came.Then, as to all good landscape lovers, the beasts, birds, and insectsof Nature were dear to these ancient people. One of the things Finnmost cared for was not only his hounds, but the "blackbird singing onLetterlee"; and his song, on page 114, in the praise of May, tells ushow keen was his observant eye for animal life and how much itdelighted him. The same minute realisation of natural objects isillustrated in this book when King Iubdan explains to the servant thedifferent characteristics of the trees of the forest, and the mysticelements that abide in them. It was a habit, even of Teutonic poets,to tell of the various trees and their uses in verse, and Spenser andDrayton have both done it in later times. But few of them have added,as the Irish story does, a spiritual element to their description, andmade us think of malign or beneficent elements attached to them. Thewoodbine, and this is a strange fancy, is the king of the woods. Therowan is the tree of the magicians, and its berries are for poets. Thebramble is inimical to man, the alder is full of witchcraft, and theelder is the wood of the horses of the fairies. Into every tree aspiritual power is infused; and the good lords of the forest are lovedof men and birds and bees.Thus the Irish love of nature led them to spiritualise, in another waythan mythical, certain things in nature, and afterwards to humanise,up to a certain point, the noble implements wrought by human skill outof natural materials. And this is another element in all thesestories, as it is in the folk-lore also of other lands. In the tale ofthe Sons of Turenn, the stones of the wayside tell to Lugh the storyof the death of his father Kian, and the boat of Mananan, indwelt by aspirit, flies hither and thither over the seas, obeying the commands,even the thought, of its steersman. The soul of some famed spears isso hot for slaughter that, when it is not being used in battle, itspoint must stand in a bath of blood or of drowsy herbs, lest itshould slay the host. The swords murmur and hiss and cry out for thebattle; the shield of the hero hums louder and louder, vibrating forthe encouragement of the warrior. Even the wheels of Cuchulain'schariot roar as they whirl into the fight. This partial life given tothe weapons of war is not specially Celtic. Indeed, it is more commonin Teutonic than in Celtic legend, and it seems probable that it wasowing to the Norsemen that it was established in the Hero tales ofIreland.This addition of life, or of some of the powers of life, to tree andwell and boulder-stone, to river and lake and hill, and sword andspear, is common to all mythologies, but the special character of eachnation or tribe modifies the form of the life-imputing stories. InIreland the tree, the stream were not dwelt in by a separate livingbeing, as in Grecian story; the half-living powers they had were givento them from without, by the gods, the demons, the fairies; and in thecase of the weapons, the powers they had of act or sound arose fromthe impassioned thoughts and fierce emotions of their forger or theirwielder, which, being intense, were magically transferred to them. TheCeltic nature is too fond of reality, too impatient of illusion, tobelieve in an actual living spirit in inanimate things. At least, thatis the case in the stories of the Hero and the Fenian Cycles.[5]   [5] Everything, on the contrary, in the Mythological Cycle is   gifted with life, all the doings and things of nature are   represented as the work of living creatures; but it is quite   possible that those in Ireland who made these myths were not   Celts at all.What the Irish of the Heroic, and still more of the Fenian Cycle, didmake in their imagination was a world, outside of themselves, ofliving spiritual beings, in whose actuality they fully believed, andin whom a great number of them still believe. A nation, if I may usethis term, dwelt under the sea. Another dwelt in the far island of theocean, the Isle of the Ever-Young. Another dwelt in the land, in thegreen hills and by the streams of Ireland; and these were the ancientgods who had now lost their dominion over the country, but lived on,with all their courtiers and warriors and beautiful women in a countryunderground. As time went on, their powers were dwarfed, and theybecame small of size, less beautiful, and in our modern times are lessinclined to enter into the lives of men and women. But the Irishpeasant still sees them flitting by his path in the evening light, ordancing on the meadow round the grassy mound, singing and playingstrange melodies; or mourns for the child they have carried away tolive with them and forget her people, or watches with fear hisdreaming daughter who has been touched by them, and is never againquite a child of this earth, or quite of the common race of man.These were the invisible lands and peoples of the Irish imagination;and they live in and out of many of the stories. Cuchulain is luredinto a fairy-land, and lives for more than a year in love with Fand,Mananan's wife. Into another fairy-land, through zones of mist,Cormac, as is told here, was lured by Mananan, who now has left thesea to play on the land. Oisin, as I have already said, flies withNiam over the sea to the island of Eternal Youth. Etain, out of theimmortal land, is born into an Irish girl and reclaimed and carriedback to her native shore by Midir, a prince of the Fairy Host. Ethne,whose story also is here, has lived for all her youth in the court ofAngus, deep in the hill beside the rushing of the Boyne.These stories are but a few out of a great number of the loves andwars between the men and women of the human and the fairy races.Curiously enough, as the stories become less ancient, the relationsbetween men and the fairies are more real, more close, even moreaffectionate. Finn and the Fianna seem to be almost in dailycompanionship with the fairy host--much nearer to them than the men ofthe Heroic Cycle are to the gods. They interchange love and music andbattle and adventure with one another. They are, for the most part,excellent friends; and their intercourse suffers from no doubt. It isas real as the intercourse between Welsh and English on theBorderland.There was nothing illusive, nothing merely imaginary, in these fairyworlds for the Irish hero or the Irish people. They believed the landsto be as real as their own, and the indwellers of fairyland to havelike passions with themselves. Finn is not a bit surprised whenVivionn the giantess sits beside him on the hill, or Fergus when KingIubdan stands on his hand; or St Patrick when Ethne, out of fairyland,dies on his breast, or when he sees, at his spell, Cuchulain, deadsome nine hundred years, come forth out of the dark gates of Sheol,high in his chariot, grasping his deadly spear, driven as of old byhis well-loved charioteer, drawn by the immortal steeds through themist, and finally talking of his deeds and claiming a place in theChristian heaven--a place that Patrick yields to him. The invisibleworlds lived, loved, and thought around this visible world, and were,it seems, closer and more real to the Celtic than to other races.But it was not only these agreeable and lovely folk in pleasanthabitations whom the Irish made, but also spirits of another sort, oflesser powers and those chiefly malignant, having no fixeddwelling-place, homeless in the air and drifting with it, embodyingthe venomous and deadly elements of the earth and the angers andcruelty of the sea, and the hypocrisy of them all--demons, some ofwhom, like the stepmother of the children of Lir, have been changedfrom men or women because of wicked doings, but the most part born ofthe evil in Nature herself. They do what harm they can to innocentfolk; they enter into, support, and direct--like Macbeth'switches--the evil thoughts of men; they rejoice in the battle, in thewounds and pain and death of men; they shriek and scream and laugharound the head of the hero when he goes forth, like Cuchulain, to anunwearied slaughter of men. They make the blight, the deadly mist, thecruel tempest. To deceive is their pleasure; to discourage, to baffle,to ruin the hero is their happiness. Some of them are monsters ofterrific aspect who abide in lakes or in desolate rocks, as theterrible tri-formed horse whom Fergus mac Leda conquered and by whomhe died.Naturally, as a link between these supernatural worlds and the naturalworld, there arose a body of men and women in Irish legend who, byyears of study, gained a knowledge of, and power over, thesupernatural beings, and used these powers for hurt to the enemies oftheir kingdom, or for help to their own people. Some were wise,learned, and statesmanlike, and used their powers for good. These werethe high Druids, and every king had a band of them at his court and inhis wars. They practiced what the Middle Ages called white magic.Others were wizards, magicians, witches, who, like the children ofCailitin, the foes of Cuchulain, or the three mutilated women whomMaev educated in evil craft to do evil to her foes, or the dread bandthat deceived Cuchulain into his last ride of death, practised blackmagic--evil, and the ministers of evil. Magic, and the doing of it,runs through the whole of Irish story-telling, and not only into paganbut also into Christian legend; for it was easy to change the old godsinto devils, to keep the demonic creatures as demons, to replace thewise Druids by the priests and saints, and the wizards by the hereticswho gave themselves to sorcery. Thus the ancient supernaturalism ofthe Irish has continued, with modern modifications, to the presentday. The body of thought is much the same as it was in the days ofConor and Finn; the clothing is a bit different.Another characteristic of the stories, especially in the mythologicalperiod, is the barbaric brutality which appears in them. Curiouslymingled with this, in direct contrast, is their tenderness. Theseextreme contrasts are common in the Celtic nature. A Gael, whether ofIreland or the Western Isles, will pass in a short time from thewildest spirits, dancing and singing and drinking, into deep and grimdepression--the child of the present, whether in love or war; and inthe tales of Ireland there is a similar contrast between theirbrutality and their tenderness. The sudden fierce jealousy and thepitiless cruelty of their stepmother to the children of Lir is setover against the exquisite tenderness of Fionnuala, which pervades thestory like an air from heaven. The noble tenderness of Deirdre, ofNaisi and his brothers, in life and death, to one another, is lovelierin contrast with the savage and treacherous revenge of Conor. Thegreat pitifulness of Cuchulain's fight with his dear friend Ferdia,whom he is compelled to slay; the crowning tenderness of Emer'srecollective love in song before she dies on Cuchulain's dead body,are in full contrast with the savage hard-heartedness and cruelties ofMaev, and with the ruthless slaughters Cuchulain made of his foes, outof which he seems often to pass, as it were, in a moment, intotenderness and gracious speech. Even Finn, false for once to hisconstant courtesy, revenges himself on Dermot so pitilessly that bothhis son and grandson cry shame upon him.Of course this barbaric cruelty is common to all early periods inevery nation; and, whenever fierce passion is aroused, to civilisednations also. What is remarkable in the Irish tales is thecontemporary tenderness. The Vikings were as savage as the Irish, butthe savagery is not mingled with the Irish tenderness. At last, whenwe pass from the Hero Cycle into the Cycle of Finn, there is scarcelyany of the ancient brutality to be found in the host of romanticstories which gather round the chivalry of the Fenians.There are other characteristics of these old tales on which I mustdwell. The first is the extra-ordinary love of colour. This is not acharacteristic of the early German, English or Scandinavian poems andtales. Its remarkable presence in Scottish poetry, at a time when itis scarcely to be found in English literature, I have traced elsewhereto the large admixture of Celtic blood in the Lowlands of Scotland. Inearly Irish work it is to be found everywhere. In descriptions ofNature, which chiefly appear in the Fenian Cycle and in Christiantimes, colour is not as much dwelt on as we should expect, for nowherethat I have seen is it more delicate and varied than under the Irishatmosphere. Yet, again and again, the amber colour of the streams asthey come from the boglands, and the crimson and gold of thesunsetting, and the changing green of the trees, and the blue as itvaries and settles down on the mountains when they go to their rest,and the green crystal of the sea in calm and the dark purple of it instorm, and the white foam of the waves when they grow black in thesquall, and the brown of the moors, and the yellow and rose andcrimson of the flowers, and many another interchanging of colour, areseen and spoken of as if it were a common thing always to dwell oncolour. This literary custom I do not find in any other Westernliterature. It is even more remarkable in the descriptions of thedress and weapons of the warriors and kings. They blaze with colour;and as gold was plentiful in Ireland in those far-off days, yellow andred are continually flashing in and out of the blue and green and richpurple of their dress. The women are dressed in as rich colours as themen. When Eochy met Etain by the spring of pure water, as told in thisbook, she must have flashed in the sunlight like a great jewel. Then,the halls where they met and the houses of the kings are representedas glorious with colour, painted in rich patterns, hung with wovencloths dyed deep with crimson and blue and green and yellow. Thecommon things in use, eating and drinking implements, the bags theycarry, the bed-clothing, the chess-men, the tables, are embroidered orchased or set with red carbuncles or white stones or with interlacingof gold. Colour is everywhere and everywhere loved. And where colouris loved the arts flourish, as the decorative arts flourished inIreland.Lastly, on this matter, the Irish tale-tellers, even to the presentday, dwell with persistence on the colour of the human body as aspecial loveliness, and with as much love of it as any Venetian whenhe painted it. And they did this with a comparison of its colour tothe colours they observed in Nature, so that the colour of one washarmonised with the colour of the other. I might quote many suchdescriptions of the appearance of the warriors--they aremultitudinous--but the picture of Etain is enough to illustrate what Isay--"Her hair before she loosed it was done in two long tresses,yellow like the flower of the waterflag in summer or like red gold.Her hands were white as the snow of a single night, and her eyes asblue as the dark hyacinth, and her lips red as the berries of therowan-tree, and her body as white as the foam of the sea-waves. Theradiance of the moon was in her face and the light of wooing in hereyes." So much for the Irish love of colour.[6]   [6] I give one example of the way colour was laid on to animals   just for the pleasure of it. "And the eagle and cranes were red   with green heads, and their eggs were pure crimson and blue";   and deep in the wood the travellers found "strange birds with   white bodies and purple heads and golden beaks," and afterwards   three great birds, "one blue and his head crimson, and another   crimson and his head green, and another speckled and his head   gold."Their love of music was equally great; and was also connected withNature. "The sound of the flowing of streams," said one of theirbardic clan, "is sweeter than any music of men." "The harp of thewoods is playing music," said another. In Finn's Song to May, thewaterfall is singing a welcome to the pool below, the loudness ofmusic is around the hill, and in the green fields the stream issinging. The blackbird, the cuckoo, the heron and the lark are themusicians of the world. When Finn asks his men what music they thoughtthe best, each says his say, but Oisin answers, "The music of thewoods is sweetest to me, the sound of the wind and of the blackbird,and the cuckoo and the soft silence of the heron." And Finn himself,when asked what was his most beloved music, said first that it was"the sharp whistling of the wind as it went through the upliftedspears of the seven battalions of the Fianna," and this was fittingfor a hero to say. But when the poet in him spoke, he said his musicwas the crying of the sea-gull, and the noise of the waves, and thevoice of the cuckoo when summer was at hand, and the washing of thesea against the shore, and of the tide when it met the river of theWhite Trout, and of the wind rushing through the cloud. And many othersayings of the same kind this charming and poetic folk has saidconcerning those sweet, strong sounds in Nature out of which the musicof men was born.Again, there is not much music in the Mythological Tales. Lugh, it istrue, is a great harper, and the harp of the Dagda, into which he hasbound his music, plays a music at whose sound all men laugh, andanother so that all men weep, and another so enthralling that all fallasleep; and these three kinds of music are heard through all theCycles of Tales. Yet when the old gods of the mythology became theSidhe,[7] the Fairy Host, they--having left their barbaric lifebehind--became great musicians. In every green hill where the tribesof fairy-land lived, sweet, wonderful music was heard all day--suchmusic that no man could hear but he would leave all other music tolisten to it, which "had in it sorrows that man has never felt, andjoys for which man has no name, and it seemed as if he who heard itmight break from time into eternity and be one of the immortals." Andwhen Finn and his people lived, they, being in great harmony and unionwith the Sidhe, heard in many adventures with them their lovely music,and it became their own. Indeed, Finn, who had twelve musicians, hadas their chief one of the Fairy Host who came to dwell with him, alittle man who played airs so divine that all weariness and sorrowfled away. And from him Finn's musicians learnt a more enchanted artthan they had known before. And so it came to pass that as in everyfairy dwelling there was this divine art, so in every palace andchieftain's hall, and in every farm, there were harpers harping ontheir harps, and all the land was full of sweet sounds andairs--shaping in music, imaginative war, and sorrows, and joys, andaspiration. Nor has their music failed. Still in the west and south ofIreland, the peasant, returning home, hears, as the evening falls fromthe haunted hills, airs unknown before, or at midnight a wildtriumphant song from the Fairy Host rushing by, or wakes with a dreammelody in his heart. And these are played and sung next day to thefolk sitting round the fire. Many who heard these mystic sounds becamethemselves the makers of melodies, and went about the land singing andmaking and playing from village to village and cabin to cabin, tillthe unwritten songs of Ireland were as numerous as they were various.Moore collected a hundred and twenty of them, but of late more thanfive hundred he knew not of have been secured from the people and frommanuscripts for the pleasure of the world. And in them lives on thespirit of the Fianna, and the mystery of the Fairy Host, and the longsorrow and the fleeting joy of the wild weather in the heart of theIrish race.   [7] This word is pronounced Shee, and means "the folk of the   fairy mounds."As to the poetry of Ireland, that other Art which is illustrated inthis book, so fully has it been dwelt on by many scholars and criticsthat it needs not be touched here other than lightly and briefly. Thehonour and dignity of the art of poetry goes back in Irish mythologyto a dim antiquity. The ancient myth said that the nine hazels ofwisdom grew round a deep spring beneath the sea, and the hazels werethe hazels of inspiration and of poetry--so early in Ireland wereinspiration and poetry made identical with wisdom. Seven streams ofwisdom flowed from that fountain-head, and when they had fed the worldreturned to it again. And all the art-makers of mankind, and of allarts, have drunk of their waters. Five salmon in the spring ate of thehazel nuts, and some haunted the rivers of Ireland; and whosoever,like Finn, tasted the flesh of these immortal fish, was possessed ofthe wisdom which is inspiration and poetry. Such was the ancient Irishconception of the art of poetry.It is always an art which grows slowly into any excellence, and itneeds for such growth a quieter life than the Irish lived for manycenturies. Poems appear but rarely in the mythological or heroiccycles, and are loosely scattered among the prose of the bardic tales.A few are of war, but they are chiefly dirges like the Song of Emerover the dead body of Cuchulain, or that of Deirdre overNaisi--pathetic wailings for lost love. There is an abrupt and pitifulpain in the brief songs of Fionnuala, but I fancy these were made andinserted in Christian times. Poetry was more at home among the Fianna.The conditions of life were easier; there was more leisure and moreromance. And the other arts, which stimulate poetry, were more widelypractised than in the earlier ages. Finn's Song to May, heretranslated, is of a good type, frank and observant, with a fresh airin it, and a fresh pleasure in its writing. I have no doubt that atthis time began the lyric poetry of Ireland, and it reached, underChristian influences, a level of good, I can scarcely say excellent,work, at a time when no other lyrical poetry in any vernacular existedin Europe or the Islands. It was religious, mystic, and chieflypathetic--prayers, hymns, dirges, regrets in exile, occasional storiesof the saints whose legendary acts were mixed with pagan elements, andmost of these were adorned with illustrations drawn from naturalbeauty or from the doings of birds and beasts--a great affection forwhom is prominent in the Celtic nature. The Irish poets sent thislyric impulse into Iceland, Wales, and Scotland, and from Scotlandinto England; and the rise of English vernacular poetry instead ofLatin in the seventh and eighth centuries is due to the impulse givenby the Irish monasteries at Whitby and elsewhere in Northumbria. Thefirst rude lyric songs of Caedmon were probably modelled on the hymnsof Colman.One would think that poetry, which arose so early in a nation's life,would have developed fully. But this was not the case in Ireland. Nonarrative, dramatic, didactic, or epic poetry of any importance arose,and many questions and answers might be made concerning this curiousrestriction of development. The most probable solution of this problemis that there was never enough peace in Ireland or continuity ofnational existence or unity, to allow of a continuous development ofany one of the arts into all its forms. Irish poetry never advancedbeyond the lyric. In that form it lasted all through the centuries; itlasts still at the present day, and Douglas Hyde has proved how muchcharm belongs to it in his book on the _Love Songs of Connacht_.It has had a long, long history; it has passed through many phases; ithas sung of love and sorrow, of national wars and hopes, of Irelandherself as the Queen of Sorrow, of exile regrets from alien shores, ofrebellion, of hatred of England, of political strife, in ballads sungin the streets, of a thousand issues of daily life and death--but ofworld-wide affairs, of great passions and duties and fates evolving inepic or clashing in drama, of continuous human lives in narrative(except in prose), of the social life of cities or of philosophicthought enshrined in stately verse, it has not sung. What it may do inthe future, if Irish again becomes a tongue of literature in loftypoetry, lies on the knees of the gods. I wish it well, but such adevelopment seems now too late. The Irish genius, if it is to speak indrama, in narrative poetry or in an epic, must speak, if it is toinfluence or to charm the world beyond the Irish shore, in aworld-language like English, and of international as well as of Irishhumanity.These elements on which I have dwelt seem to me the most distinctive,the most Irish, in the Tales in this book. There are many others onwhich a more minute analysis might exercise itself, phases of feelingconcerning war or love or friendship or honour or the passions, butthese are not specially Irish. They belong to common human nature, andhave their close analogies in other mythologies, in other Folk-tales,in other Sagas. I need not touch them here. But there is one elementin all the Irish tales which I have not yet mentioned, and it bringsall the others within its own circumference, and suffuses them withits own atmosphere. It is the love of Ireland, of the land itself forits own sake--a mystic, spiritual imaginative passion which in thesoul of the dweller in the country is a constant joy, and in the heartof the exile is a sick yearning for return. There are not many directexpressions of this in the stories; but it underlies the whole ofthem, and it is also in the air they breathe. But now and again itdoes find clear expression, and in each of the cycles we havediscussed. When the sons of Turenn are returning, wounded to death,from the Hill of Mochaen, they felt but one desire. "Let us but see,"said Iuchar and Iucharba to their brother Brian, "the land of Erinagain, the hills round Telltown, and the dewy plain of Bregia and thequiet waters of the Boyne and our father's Dun thereby, and healingwill come to us; or if death come, we can endure it after that." ThenBrian raised them up; and they saw that they were now near by underBen Edar; and at the strand of the Bull they came to land. That isfrom the Mythological Cycle.In the Heroic Cycle it appears in the longing cry for return toIreland of Naisi and his brothers, which drives them out of Alba totheir death; but otherwise it is rarely expressed. In the Fenian Cycleit exists, not in any clear words, but in a general delight in therivers, lakes, woods, valleys, plains, and mountains of Ireland. Everydescription of them, and of life among them, is done with a loving,observant touch; and moreover, the veil of magic charm is thrown overall the land by the creation in it of the life and indwelling of thefairy host. The Fianna loved their country well.When Christianity came, this deep-set sentiment did not lessen. Itgrew even stronger, and in exile it became a passion. It isillustrated by the songs of deep regret and affection Columba made inIona, from whose rocky shores he looked day after day towards the westwhile the mists rose over Ireland. One little story of great beautyenshrines his passion. One morning he called to his side one of hismonks, and said, "Go to the margin of the sea on the western side ofour isle; and there, coming from the north of Ireland, you will see avoyaging crane, very weary and beaten by the storms, and it will fallat your feet on the beach. Lift it up with pity and carry it to thehut, nourish it for three days, and when it is refreshed and strongagain it will care no more to stay with us in exile, but to fly backto sweet Ireland, the dear country where it was born. I charge youthus, for it comes from the land where I was born myself." And whenhis servant returned, having done as he was ordered, Columba said,"May God bless you, my son. Since you have well cared for our exiledguest, you will see it return to its own land in three days." And soit was. It rose, sought its path for a moment through the sky, andtook flight on a steady wing for Ireland. The spirit of that story hasnever died in the soul of the Irish and in their poetry up to thepresent day.Lastly, as we read these stories, even in a modern dress, animpression of great ancientry is made upon us, so much so that somescholars have tried to turn Finn into a mythical hero--but if he be asold as that implies, of how great an age must be the clearly mythictales which gather round the Tuatha de Danaan? However this may be,the impression of ancientry is deep and agreeable. All myths in anynation are, of course, of a high antiquity, but as they treat of thebeginning of things, they mingle an impression of youth with one ofage. This is very pleasant to the imagination, and especially so ifthe myths, as in Ireland, have some poetic beauty or strangeness, asin the myth I have referred to--of the deep spring of clear water andthe nine hazels of wisdom that encompass it. This mingling of thebeauty of youth and the honour of ancientry runs through all the Irishtales. Youth and the love of it, of its beauty and strength, adorn andvitalize their grey antiquity. But where, in their narrative, thehero's youth is over and the sword weak in his hand, and the passionless in his and his sweetheart's blood, life is represented asscarcely worth the living. The famed men and women die young--the sonsof Turenn, Cuchulain, Conall, Dermot, Emer, Deirdre, Naisi, Oscar.Oisin has three hundred years of youth in that far land in theinvention of which the Irish embodied their admiration of love andyouth. His old age, when sudden feebleness overwhelms him, is made bythe bardic clan as miserable, as desolate as his youth was joyous.Again, Finn lives to be an old man, but the immortal was in him, andeither he has been born again in several re-incarnations (for theIrish held from time to time the doctrine of the transmigration ofsouls), or he sleeps, like Barbarossa, in a secret cavern, with allhis men around him, and beside him the mighty horn of the Fianna,which, when the day of fate and freedom comes, will awaken with threeloud blasts the heroes and send them forth to victory. Old as she is,Ireland does not grow old, for she has never reached her maturity. Herfull existence is before her, not behind her. And when she reaches ither ancientry and all its tales will be dearer to her than they havebeen in the past. They will be an inspiring national asset. In themand in their strange admixture of different and successive periods ofcustoms, thoughts and emotions (caused by the continuous editing andre-editing of them, first in oral recitation and then at the hands ofscribes), Ireland will see the record of her history, not the historyof external facts, but of her soul as it grew into consciousness ofpersonality; as it established in itself love of law, of moral right,of religion, of chivalry, of courtesy in war and daily life; as itrejoiced, and above all, as it suffered and was constant, in sufferingand oppression, to its national ideals.It seems as if, once at least, this aspect of the tales of Ireland wasseen by men of old, for there is a story which tells that heavenitself desired their remembrance, and that we should be diverted andinspired by them. In itself it is a record of the gentleness of IrishChristianity to Irish heathendom, and of its love of the heroic past.For one day when Patrick and his clerks were singing the Mass at theRath of the Red Ridge, where Finn was wont to be, he saw Keelta, achief of the Fianna, draw near with his companions, and Keelta's hugehounds were with him. They were men so tall and great that fear fellon the clerks, but Patrick met with and asked their chieftain's name."I am Keelta," he answered, "son of Ronan of the Fianna." "Was it nota good lord you were with," said Patrick, "Finn, son of Cumhal?" AndKeelta said, "If the brown leaves falling in the wood were gold, ifthe waves of the sea were silver, Finn would have given them allaway." "What was it kept you through your lifetime?" said Patrick."Truth that was in our hearts, and strength in our hands, andfulfilment in our tongues," said Keelta. Then Patrick gave them foodand drink and good treatment, and talked with them. And in the morningthe two angels who guarded him came to him, and he asked them if itwere any harm before God, King of heaven and earth, that he shouldlisten to the stories of the Fianna. And the angels answered, "HolyClerk, these old fighting men do not remember more than a third oftheir tales by reason of the forgetfulness of age, but whatever theytell write it down on the boards of the poets and in the words of thepoets, for it will be a diversion to the companies and the high peopleof the latter times to listen to them."[8] So spoke the angels, andPatrick did as he bade them, and the stories are in the world to thisday.   [8] This is quoted with a few omissions, from Lady Gregory's   delightful version, in her _Book of Saints and Wonders_, of an   episode in _The Colloquy of the Ancients_ (Silva Gadelica).STOPFORD A. BROOKEST PATRICK'S DAY, 1910COIS NA TEINEADH(_By the Fireside._)   Where glows the Irish hearth with peat     There lives a subtle spell--   The faint blue smoke, the gentle heat,     The moorland odours, tell   Of long roads running through a red     Untamed unfurrowed land,   With curlews keening overhead,     And streams on either hand;   Black turf-banks crowned with whispering sedge,     And black bog-pools below;   While dry stone wall or ragged hedge     Leads on, to meet the glow   From cottage doors, that lure us in     From rainy Western skies,   To seek the friendly warmth within,     The simple talk and wise;   Or tales of magic, love and arms     From days when princes met   To listen to the lay that charms     The Connacht peasant yet.   There Honour shines through passions dire,     There beauty blends with mirth--   Wild hearts, ye never did aspire     Wholly for things of earth!   Cold, cold this thousand years--yet still     On many a time-stained page   Your pride, your truth, your dauntless will,     Burn on from age to age.   And still around the fires of peat     Live on the ancient days;   There still do living lips repeat     The old and deathless lays.   And when the wavering wreaths ascend,     Blue in the evening air,   The soul of Ireland seems to bend     Above her children there.BARDIC ROMANCESCHAPTER IThe Story of the Children of LirLong ago there dwelt in Ireland the race called by the name of DeDanaan, or People of the Goddess Dana. They were a folk who delightedin beauty and gaiety, and in fighting and feasting, and loved to gogloriously apparelled, and to have their weapons and household vesselsadorned with jewels and gold. They were also skilled in magic arts,and their harpers could make music so enchanting that a man who heardit would fight, or love, or sleep, or forget all earthly things, asthey who touched the strings might will him to do. In later times theDanaans had to dispute the sovranty of Ireland with another race, theChildren of Miled, whom men call the Milesians, and after muchfighting they were vanquished. Then, by their sorceries andenchantments, when they could not prevail against the invaders, theymade themselves invisible, and they have dwelt ever since in the FairyMounds and raths of Ireland, where their shining palaces are hiddenfrom mortal eyes. They are now called the Shee, or Fairy Folk ofErinn, and the faint strains of unearthly music that may be heard attimes by those who wander at night near to their haunts come from theharpers and pipers who play for the People of Dana at their revels inthe bright world underground.At the time when the tale begins, the People of Dana were still thelords of Ireland, for the Milesians had not yet come. They weredivided it is said, into many families and clans; and it seemed goodto them that their chiefs should assemble together, and choose one tobe king and ruler over the whole people. So they met in a greatassembly for this purpose, and found that five of the greatest lordsall desired the sovranty of Erin. These five were Bov the Red, andIlbrech of Assaroe, and Lir from the Hill of the White Field, which ison Slieve Fuad in Armagh; and Midir the Proud, who dwelt at SlieveCallary in Longford; and Angus of Brugh na Boyna, which is nowNewgrange on the river Boyne, where his mighty mound is still to beseen. All the Danaan lords saving these five went into counciltogether, and their decision was to give the sovranty to Bov the Red,partly because he was the eldest, partly because his father was theDagda, mightiest of the Danaans, and partly because he was himself themost deserving of the five.All were content with this, save only Lir, who thought himself thefittest for royal rule; so he went away from the assembly in anger,taking leave of no one. When this became known, the Danaan lords wouldhave pursued Lir, to burn his palace and inflict punishment andwounding on himself for refusing obedience and fealty to him whom theassembly had chosen to reign over them. But Bov the Red forbade them,for he would not have war among the Danaans; and he said, "I am nonethe less King of the People of Dana because this man will not dohomage to me."Thus it went on for a long time. But at last a great misfortune befellLir, for his wife fell ill, and after three nights she died. Sorelydid Lir grieve for this, and he fell into a great dejection of spirit,for his wife was very dear to him and was much thought of by all folk,so that her death was counted one of the great events of that time.Now Bov the Red came ere long to hear of it, and he said, "If Lirwould choose to have my help and friendship now, I can serve him well,for his wife is no longer living, and I have three maidens, daughtersof a friend, in fosterage with me, namely, Eva and Aoife[9] and Elva,and there are none fairer and of better name in Erin; one of these hemight take to wife." And the lords of the Danaans heard what he said,and answered that it was true and well bethought. So messengers weresent to Lir, to say that if he were willing to yield the sovranty toBov the Red, he might make alliance with him and wed one of hisfoster-children. To Lir, having been thus gently entreated, it seemedgood to end the feud, and he agreed to the marriage. So the followingday he set out with a train of fifty chariots from the Hill of theWhite Field and journeyed straight for the palace of Bov the Red,which was by Lough Derg on the river Shannon.   [9] Pronounced Eefa.Arriving there, he found about him nothing but joy and glad faces, forthe renewal of amity and concord; and his people were welcomed, andwell entreated, and handsomely entertained for the night.[Illustration: "There sat the three maidens with the Queen"]And there sat the three maidens on the same couch with the DanaanQueen, and Bov the Red bade Lir choose which one he would have towife."The maidens are all fair and noble," said Lir, "but the eldest isfirst in consideration and honour, and it is she that I will take, ifshe be willing.""The eldest is Eva," said Bov the Red, "and she will wed thee if it bepleasing to thee." "It is pleasing," said Lir, and the pair werewedded the same night. Lir abode for fourteen days in the palace ofBov the Red, and then departed with his bride, to make a greatwedding-feast among his own people.In due time after this Eva, wife of Lir, bore him two fair children ata birth, a daughter and a son. The daughter's name was calledFionnuala of the Fair Shoulder, and the son's name was Hugh. Andagain she bore him two sons, Fiachra and Conn; and at their birth shedied. At this Lir was sorely grieved and afflicted, and but for thegreat love he bore to his four children he would gladly have died too.When the folk at the palace of Bov the Red heard that, they also weresorely grieved at the death of their foster-child, and they lamentedher with keening and with weeping. Bov the Red said, "We grieve forthis maiden on account of the good man we gave her to, and for hisfriendship and fellowship; howbeit our friendship shall not besundered, for we shall give him to wife her sister, namely Aoife."Word of this was brought to Lir, and he went once more to Lough Dergto the palace of Bov the Red and there he took to wife Aoife, the fairand wise, and brought her to his own home. And Aoife held the childrenof Lir and of her sister in honour and affection; for indeed no onecould behold these four children without giving them the love of hissoul.For love of them, too, came Bov the Red often to the house of Lir, andhe would take them to his own house at times and let them spend awhile there, and then to their own home again. All of the People ofDana who came visiting and feasting to Lir had joy and delight in thechildren, for their beauty and gentleness; and the love of theirfather for them was exceeding great, so that he would rise very earlyevery morning to lie down among them and play with them.Only, alas! a fire of jealousy began to burn at last in the breast ofAoife, and hatred and bitter ill-will grew in her mind towards thechildren of Lir. And she feigned an illness, and lay under it for themost of a year, meditating a black and evil deed. At last she saidthat a journey from home might recover her, and she bade her chariotbe yoked and set out, taking with her the four children. Fionnuala wassorely unwilling to go with her on that journey, for she had amisgiving, and a prevision of treachery and of kin-slaying against herin the mind of Aoife. Yet she was not able to avoid the mischief thatwas destined for her.So Aoife journeyed away from the Hill of the White Field, and when shehad come some way she spoke to her people and said, "Kill me, I prayye, the four children of Lir, who have taken the love of their fatherfrom me, and ye may ask of me what reward ye will." "Not so," saidthey, "by us they shall never be killed; it is an evil deed that youhave thought of, and evil it is but to have spoken of it."When they would not consent to her will, she drew a sword and wouldhave slain the children herself, but her womanhood overcame her andshe could not. So they journeyed on westward till they came to theshores of Loch Derryvaragh, and there they made a halt and the horseswere outspanned. Aoife bade the children bathe and swim in the lake,and they did so. Then Aoife by Druid spells and witchcraft put uponeach of the children the form of a pure white swan, and she cried tothem:--  "Out on the lake with you, children of Lir!  Cry with the water-fowl over the mere!  Breed and seed of you ne'er shall I see;  Woeful the tale to your friends shall be."Then the four swans turned their faces towards the woman, andFionnuala spoke to her and said, "Evil is thy deed, Aoife, to destroyus thus without a cause, and think not that thou shalt escapepunishment for it. Assign us even some period to the ruin anddestruction that thou hast brought upon us.""I shall do that," said Aoife, "and it is this: in your present formsshall ye abide, and none shall release you till the woman of the Southbe mated with the man of the North. Three hundred years shall ye beupon the waters of Derryvaragh, and three hundred upon the Straits ofMoyle between Erinn and Alba,[10] and three hundred in the seas byErris and Inishglory, and then shall the enchantment have an end."   [10] Scotland. Inishglory is an island in the Bay of Erris, on   the Mayo coast.Upon this, Aoife was smitten with repentance, and she said, "Since Imay not henceforth undo what has been done, I give you this, that yeshall keep your human speech, and ye shall sing a sad music such as nomusic in the world can equal, and ye shall have your reason and yourhuman will, that the bird-shape may not wholly destroy you." Then shebecame as one possessed, and cried wildly like a prophetess in hertrance:--  "Ye with the white faces! Ye with the stammering      Gaelic on your tongues!  Soft was your nurture in the King's house--  Now shall ye know the buffeting wind!  Nine hundred years upon the tide.  "The heart of Lir shall bleed!  None of his victories shall stead him now!  Woe to me that I shall hear his groan,  Woe that I have deserved his wrath!"Then they caught and yoked her horses, and Aoife went on her way tillshe reached the palace of Bov the Red. Here she and her folk werewelcomed and entertained, and Bov the Red inquired of her why she hadnot brought with her the children of Lir."I brought them not," she replied, "because Lir loves thee not, and hefears that if he sends his children to thee, thou wouldst capture themand hold them for hostages.""That is strange," said Bov the Red, "for I love those children as ifthey were my own." And his mind misgave him that some treachery hadbeen wrought; and he sent messengers privily northwards to the Hill ofthe White Field. "For what have ye come?" asked Lir. "Even to bringyour children to Bov the Red," said they. "Did they not reach you withAoife?" said Lir. "Nay," said the messengers, "but Aoife said youwould not permit them to go with her."Then fear and trouble came upon Lir, for he surmised that Aoife hadwrought evil upon the children. So his horses were yoked and he setout upon his road south-westward, until he reached the shores of LochDerryvaragh. But as he passed by that water, Fionnuala saw the trainof horsemen and chariots, and she cried to her brothers to come nearto the shore, "for," said she, "these can only be the company of ourfather who have come to follow and seek for us."Lir, by the margin of the lake, saw the four swans and heard themtalking with human voices, and he halted and spoke to them. Then saidFionnuala: "Know, O Lir, that we are thy four children, and that shewho has wrought this ruin upon us is thy wife and our mother's sister,through the bitterness of her jealousy." Lir was glad to know thatthey were at least living, and he said, "Is it possible to put yourown forms upon you again?" "It is not possible," said Fionnuala, "forall the men on earth could not release us until the woman of the Southbe mated with the man of the North." Then Lir and his people criedaloud in grief and lamentation, and Lir entreated the swans to come onland and abide with him since they had their human reason and speech.But Fionnuala said, "That may not be, for we may not company with menany longer, but abide on the waters of Erinn nine hundred years. Butwe have still our Gaelic speech, and moreover we have the gift ofuttering sad music, so that no man who hears it thinks aught worth inthe world save to listen to that music for ever. Do you abide by theshore for this night and we shall sing to you."So Lir and his people listened all night to the singing of the swans,nor could they move nor speak till morning, for all the high sorrowsof the world were in that music, and it plunged them in dreams thatcould not be uttered.Next day Lir took leave of his children and went on to the palace ofBov the Red. Bov reproached him that he had not brought with him hischildren. "Woe is me," said Lir, "it was not I that would not bringthem; but Aoife there, your own foster-child and their mother'ssister, put upon them the forms of four snow-white swans, and therethey are on the Loch of Derryvaragh for all men to see; but they havekept still their reason and their human voice and their Gaelic."Bov the Red started when he heard this, and he knew that what Lir hadsaid was true. Fiercely he turned to Aoife, and said, "This treacherywill be worse, Aoife, for you than for them, for they shall bereleased in the end of time, but thy punishment shall be for ever."Then he smote her with a druid wand and she became a Demon of the Air,and flew shrieking from the hall, and in that form she abides to thisday.[Illustration: "They made an encampment and the swans sang to them"]As for Bov the Red, he came with his nobles and attendants to theshores of Loch Derryvaragh, and there they made an encampment, and theswans conversed with them and sang to them. And as the thing becameknown, other tribes and clans of the People of Dana would also comefrom every part of Erinn and stay awhile to listen to the swans anddepart again to their homes; and most of all came their own friendsand fellow-pupils from the Hill of the White Field. No such music astheirs, say the historians of ancient times, ever was heard in Erinn,for foes who heard it were at peace, and men stricken with pain orsickness felt their ills no more; and the memory of it remained withthem when they went away, so that a great peace and sweetness andgentleness was in the land of Erinn for those three hundred years thatthe swans abode in the waters of Derryvaragh.But one day Fionnuala said to her brethren, "Do ye know, my dearones, that the end of our time here is come, all but this night only?"Then great sorrow and distress overcame them, for in the converse withtheir father and kinsfolk and friends they had half forgotten thatthey were no longer men, and they loved their home on LochDerryvaragh, and feared the angry waves of the cold northern sea. Butearly next day they came to the lough-side to speak with Bov the Redand with their father, and to bid them farewell, and Fionnuala sang tothem her last lament. Then the four swans rose in the air and flewnorthward till they were seen no more, and great was the grief amongthose they left behind; and Bov the Red let it be proclaimedthroughout the length and breadth of Erin that no man shouldhenceforth presume to kill a swan, lest it might chance to be one ofthe children of Lir.Far different was the dwelling-place which the swans now came to, fromthat which they had known on Loch Derryvaragh. On either side of them,to north and south, stretched a wide coast far as the eye could see,beset with black rocks and great precipices, and by it ran fiercelythe salt, bitter tides of an ever-angry sea, cold, grey, and misty;and their hearts sank to behold it and to think that there they mustabide for three hundred years.Ere long, one night, there came a thick murky tempest upon them, andFionnuala said, "In this black and violent night, my brothers, we maybe driven apart from each other; let us therefore appoint ameeting-place where we may come together again when the tempest isoverpast." And they settled to meet at the Seal Rock, for this rockthey had now all learned to know.By midnight the hurricane descended upon the Straits of Moyle, and thewaves roared upon the coast with a deafening noise, and thunderbellowed from the sky, and lightning was all the light they had. Theswans were driven apart by the violence of the storm, and when at lastthe wind fell and the seas grew calm once more, Fionnuala foundherself alone upon the ocean-tide not far from the Seal Rock. And thusshe made her lament:--   "Woe is me to be yet alive!   My wings are frozen to my sides.   Wellnigh has the tempest shattered my heart,   And my comely Hugh parted from me!   "O my beloved ones, my Three,   Who slept under the shelter of my feathers,   Shall you and I ever meet again   Until the dead rise to life?   "Where is Fiachra, where is Hugh?   Where is my fair Conn?   Shall I henceforth bear my part alone?   Woe is me for this disastrous night!"Fionnuala remained upon the Seal Rock until the morrow morn, watchingthe tossing waters in all directions around her, until at last she sawConn coming towards her, and his head drooping and feathers drenchedand disarrayed. Joyfully did the sister welcome him; and ere long,behold, Fiachra also approaching them, cold and wet and faint, and thespeech was frozen in him that not a word he spake could be understood.So Fionnuala put her wings about him, and said, "If but Hugh came now,how happy should we be!"In no long time after that they saw Hugh also approaching them acrossthe sea, and his head was dry and his feathers fair and unruffled, forhe had found shelter from the gale. Fionnuala put him under herbreast, and Conn under her right wing and Fiachra under her left, andcovered them wholly with her feathers. "O children," she said to them,"evil though ye think this night to have been, many such a one shallwe know from this time forward."So there the swans continued, suffering cold and misery upon the tidesof Moyle; and one while they would be upon the coast of Alba andanother upon the coast of Erinn, but the waters they might not leave.At length there came upon them a night of bitter cold and snow suchas they had never felt before, and Fionnuala sang this lament:--  "Evil is this life.  The cold of this night,  The thickness of the snow,  The sharpness of the wind--  "How long have they lain together,  Under my soft wings,  The waves beating upon us,  Conn and Hugh and Fiachra?  "Aoife has doomed us,  Us, the four of us,  To-night to this misery--  Evil is this life."Thus for a long time they suffered, till at length there came upon theStraits of Moyle a night of January so piercing cold that the like ofit had never been felt. And the swans were gathered together upon theSeal Rock. The waters froze into ice around them, and each of thembecame frozen in his place, so that their feet and feathers clung tothe rock; and when the day came and they strove to leave the place,the skin of their feet and the feathers of their breasts clove to therock, they came naked and wounded away."Woe is me, O children of Lir," said Fionnuala, "we are now indeed inevil case, for we cannot endure the salt water, yet we may not be awayfrom it; and if the salt water gets into our sores we shall perish ofit." And thus she sang:--   "To-night we are full of keening;   No plumage to cover our bodies;   And cold to our tender feet   Are the rough rocks all awash.   "Cruel to us was Aoife,   Who played her magic upon us,   And drove us out to the ocean,   Four wonderful, snow-white swans.   "Our bath is the frothing brine   In the bay by red rocks guarded,   For mead at our father's table   We drink of the salt blue sea.   "Three sons and a single daughter--   In clefts of the cold rocks dwelling,   The hard rocks, cruel to mortals.   --We are full of keening to-night."So they went forth again upon the Straits of Moyle, and the brine wasgrievously sharp and bitter to them, but they could not escape it norshelter themselves from it. Thus they were, till at last theirfeathers grew again and their sores were healed.On one day it happened that they came to the mouth of the river Bannin the north of Erinn, and there they perceived a fair host ofhorsemen riding on white steeds and coming steadily onward from thesouth-west "Do ye know who yon riders are, children of Lir?" askedFionnuala. "We know not," said they, "but it is like they are someparty of the People of Dana." Then they moved to the margin of theland, and the company they had seen came down to meet them; andbehold, it was Hugh and Fergus, the two sons of Bov the Red, and theirnobles and attendants with them, who had long been seeking for theswans along the coast of the Straits of Moyle.Most lovingly and joyfully did they greet each other and the swansinquired concerning their father Lir, and Bov the Red, and the rest oftheir kinsfolk."They are well," said the Danaans; "and at this time they are allassembled together in the palace of your father at the Hill of theWhite Field, where they are holding the Festival of the Age ofYouth.[11] They are happy and gay and have no weariness or trouble,save that you are not among them, and that they have not known whereyou were since you left them at Lough Derryvaragh."   [11] A magic banquet which had the effect of preserving for   ever the youth of the People of Dana."That is not the tale of our lives," said Fionnuala.After that the company of the Danaans departed and brought word of theswans to Bov the Red and to Lir, who were rejoiced to hear that theywere living, "for," said they, "the children shall obtain relief inthe end of time." And the swans went back to the tides of Moyle andabode there till their time to be in that place had expired.When that day had come, Fionnuala declared it to them, and they roseup wheeling in the air, and flew westward across Ireland till theycame to the Bay of Erris, and there they abode as was ordained. Hereit happened that among those of mortal MEN whose dwellings bordered onthe bay was a young man of gentle blood, by name Evric, who havingheard the singing of the swans came down to speak with them, andbecame their friend. After that he would often come to hear theirmusic, for it was very sweet to him; and he loved them greatly, andthey him. All their story they told him, and he it was who set itdown in order, even as it is here narrated.Much hardship did they suffer from cold and tempest in the waters ofthe Western Sea, yet not so much as they had to bear by the coasts ofthe ever-stormy Moyle, and they knew that the day of redemption wasnow drawing near. In the end of the time Fionnuala said, "Brothers,let us fly to the Hill of the White Field, and see how Lir our fatherand his household are faring." So they arose and set forward on theirairy journey until they reached the Hill of the White Field, and thusit was that they found the place: namely, desolate and thorny beforethem, with nought but green mounds where once were the palaces andhomes of their kin, and forests of nettles growing over them, andnever a house nor a hearth. And the four drew closely together andlamented aloud at that sight, for they knew that old times and thingshad passed away in Erinn, and they were lonely in a land of strangers,where no man lived who could recognise them when they came to theirhuman shapes again. They knew not that Lir and their kin of the Peopleof Dana yet dwelt invisible in the bright world within the FairyMounds, for their eyes were holden that they should not see, sinceother things were destined for them than to join the Danaan folk andbe of the company of the immortal Shee.So they went back again to the Western Sea until the holy Patrickcame into Ireland and preached the Faith of the One God and of theChrist. But a man of Patrick's men, namely the Saint Mochaovog,[12]came to the Island of Inishglory in Erris Bay, and there built himselfa little church of stone, and spent his life in preaching to the folkand in prayer. The first night he came to the island the swans heardthe sound of his bell ringing at matins on the following morn, andthey leaped in terror, and the three brethren left Fionnuala and fledaway. Fionnuala cried to them, "What ails you, beloved brothers?" "Weknow not," said they, "but we have heard a thin and dreadful voice,and we cannot tell what it is." "That is the voice of the bell ofMochaovog," said Fionnuala, "and it is that bell which shall deliverus and drive away our pains, according to the will of God."   [12] Pronounced Mo-chweev-ogue.Then the brethren came back and hearkened to the chanting of thecleric until matins were performed. "Let us chant our music now," saidFionnuala. So they began, and chanted a solemn, slow, sweet, fairysong in adoration of the High King of Heaven and of Earth.Mochaovog heard that, and wondered, and when he saw the swans he spoketo them and inquired them. They told him they were the children ofLir. "Praised be God for that," said Mochaovog. "Surely it is for yoursakes that I have come to this island above every other island that isin Erinn. Come to land now, and trust in me that your salvation andrelease are at hand."So they came to land, and dwelt with Mochaovog in his own house, andthere they kept the canonical hours with him and heard mass. AndMochaovog caused a good craftsman to make chains of silver for theswans, and put one chain between Fionnuala and Hugh and anotherbetween Conn and Fiachra; and they were a joy and solace of mind tothe Saint, and their own woe and pain seemed to them dim and far offas a dream.Now at this time it happened that the King of Connacht was Lairgnen,son of Colman, and he was betrothed to Deoca, daughter of the King ofMunster. And so it was that when Deoca came northward to be wedded toLairgnen she heard the tale of the swans and of their singing, and sheprayed the king that he would obtain them for her, for she longed topossess them. But Lairgnen would not ask them of Mochaovog. Then Deocaset out homeward again, and vowed that she would never return toLairgnen till she had the swans; and she came as far as the church ofDalua, which is now called Kildaloe, in Clare. Then Lairgnen sentmessengers for the birds to Mochaovog, but he would not give them up.At this Lairgnen was very wroth, and he went himself to Mochaovog, andhe found the cleric and the four birds at the altar. But Lairgnenseized upon the birds by their silver chains, two in each hand draggedthem away to the place where Deoca was; and Mochaovog followed them.But when they came to Deoca and she had laid her hands upon thebirds, behold, their covering of feathers fell off and in their placeswere three shrunken and feeble old men and one lean and withered oldwoman, fleshless and bloodless from extreme old age. And Lairgnen wasstruck with amazement and fear, and went out from that place.Then Fionnuala said to Mochaovog, "Come now and baptize us quickly,for our end is near. And if you are grieved at parting from us, knowthat also to us it is a grief. Do thou make our grave when we aredead, and place Conn at my right side and Fiachra at my left, and Hughbefore my face, for thus they were wont to be when I sheltered them onmany a winter night by the tides of Moyle."So Mochaovog baptized the three brethren and their sister; and shortlyafterwards they found peace and death, and they were buried even asFionnuala had said. And over their tomb a stone was raised, and theirnames and lineage graved on it in branching Ogham[13]; and lamentationand prayers were made for them, and their souls won to heaven.   [13] See p. 133, _note_.But Mochaovog was sorrowful, and grieved after them so long as helived on earth.CHAPTER IIThe Quest of the Sons of TurennLong ago, when the people of Dana yet held lordship in Erinn, theywere sorely afflicted by hordes of sea-rovers named Fomorians who usedto harry the country and carry off youths and maidens into captivity.They also imposed cruel and extortionate taxes upon the people, forevery kneading trough, and every quern for grinding corn, and everyflagstone for baking bread had to pay its tax. And an ounce of goldwas paid as a poll-tax for every man, and if any man would not orcould not pay, his nose was cut off. Under this tyranny the wholecountry groaned, but they had none who was able to band them togetherand to lead them in battle against their oppressors.Now before this it happened that one of the lords of the Danaans namedKian had married with Ethlinn, daughter of Balor, a princess of theFomorians. They had a son named Lugh Lamfada, or Lugh of the Long Arm,who grew up into a youth of surpassing beauty and strength. And if hisbody was noble and mighty, no less so was his mind, for lordship andauthority grew to him by the gift of the Immortals, and whatever hepurposed that would he perform, whatever it might cost in time ortoil, in tears or in blood. Now this Lugh was not brought up in Erinnbut in a far-off isle of the western sea, where the sea-god Manananand the other Immortals nurtured and taught him, and made him fitalike for warfare or for sovranty, when his day should come to worktheir will on earth. Hither in due time came the report of thegrievous and dishonouring oppression wrought by the Fomorians upon thepeople of Dana, and that report was heard by Lugh. Then Lugh said tohis tutors "It were a worthy deed to rescue my father and the peopleof Erinn from this tyranny; let me go thither and attempt it." Andthey said to him, "Go, and blessing and victory be with thee." So Lugharmed himself and mounted his fairy steed, and called his friends andfoster-brothers about him, and across the bright and heaving surfaceof the waters they rode like the wind, until they took land in Erinn.Now the chiefs of the Danaan folk were assembled upon the Hill ofUsnach, which is upon the western side of Tara in Meath, in order tomeet there the stewards of the Fomorians and to pay them theirtribute. As they awaited the arrival of the Fomorians they becameaware of a company on horseback, coming from the west, before whomrode a young man who seemed to command them all, and whose countenancewas as radiant as the sun upon a dry summer's day, so that the Danaanscould scarcely gaze upon it. He rode upon a white horse and was armedwith a sword, and on his head was a helmet set with precious stones.The Danaan folk welcomed him as he came among them, and asked him ofhis name and his business among them. As they were thus talkinganother band drew near, numbering nine times nine persons, who werethe stewards of the Fomorians coming to demand their tribute. Theywere men of a fierce and swarthy countenance, and as they camehaughtily and arrogantly forward, the Danaans all rose up to do themhonour. Then Lugh said:"Why do ye rise up before that grim and ill-looking band and notbefore us?"Said the King of Erinn, "We needs must do so, for if they saw but achild of a month old sitting down when they came near they would holdit cause enough to attack and slay us.""I am greatly minded to slay them," said Lugh; and he repeated it,"very greatly minded.""That would be bad for us," said the King, "for our death anddestruction would surely follow.""Ye are too long under oppression," said Lugh, and gave the word foronset. So he and his comrades rushed upon the Fomorians, and in amoment the hillside rang with blows and with the shouting of warriors.In no long time all of the Fomorians were slain save nine men, andthese were taken alive and brought before Lugh."Ye also should be slain," said Lugh, "but that I am minded to sendyou as ambassadors to your King. Tell him that he may seek homage andtribute where he will henceforth, but Ireland will pay him none forever."Then the Fomorians went northwards away, and the people of Dana madethem ready for war, and made Lugh their captain and war-lord, for thesight of his face heartened them, and made them strong, and theymarvelled that they had endured their slavery so long.In the meantime word was brought to Balor of the Mighty Blows, King ofthe Fomorians, and to his queen Kethlinn of the Twisted Teeth, of theshame and destruction that had been done to their stewards, and theyassembled a great host of the sea-rovers and manned their war-ships,and the Northern Sea was white with the foam of their oarblades asthey swept down upon the shores of Erinn. And Balor commanded them,saying, "When ye have utterly destroyed and subdued the people ofDana, then make fast your ships with cables to the land of Erinn, andtow it here to the north of us into the region of ice and snow, and itshall trouble us no longer." So the host of Balor took land by theFalls of Dara[14] and began plundering and devastating the province ofConnacht.   [14] Ballysodare = the Town of the Falls of Dara, in Co. Sligo.Then Lugh sent messengers abroad to bring his host together, andamong them was his own father, Kian, son of Canta. And as Kian wentnorthwards on his errand to rouse the Ulster men, and was now come tothe plain of Murthemny near by Dundealga,[15] he saw three warriorsarmed and riding across the plain. Now these three were the sons ofTurenn, by name Brian and Iuchar and Iucharba. And there was anancient blood-feud between the house of Canta and the house of Turenn,so that they never met without bloodshed.   [15] Dundalk.Then Kian thought to himself, "If my brothers Cu and Kethan were herethere might be a pretty fight, but as they are three to one I would dobetter to fly." Now there was a herd of wild swine near by; and Kianchanged himself by druidic sorceries into a wild pig and fell torooting up the earth along with the others.When the sons of Turenn came up to the herd, Brian said, "Brothers,did ye see the warrior wh' just now was journeying across the plain?""We saw him," said they."What is become of him?" said Brian."Truly, we cannot tell," said the brothers."It is good watch ye keep in time of war!" said Brian; "but I knowwhat has taken him out of our sight, for he struck himself with amagic wand, and changed himself into the form of one of yonder swine,and he is rooting the earth among them now. Wherefore," said Brian, "Ideem that he is no friend to us.""If so, we have no help for it," said they, "for the herd belongs tosome man of the Danaans; and even if we set to and begin to kill theswine, the pig of druidism might be the very one to escape.""Have ye learned so little in your place of studies," said Brian,"that ye cannot distinguish a druidic beast from a natural beast?" Andwith that he smote his two brothers with a magic wand, and changedthem into two slender, fleet hounds, and they darted in among theherd. Then all the herd scattered and fled, but the hounds separatedthe druidic pig and chased it towards a wood where Brian awaited it.As it passed, Brian flung his spear, and it pierced the chest of thepig and brought it down. The pig screamed, "Evil have you done to castat me."Brian said, "That hath the sound of human speech!""I am in truth a man," said the pig, "and I am Kian, son of Canta, andI pray you show me mercy.""That will we," said Iuchar and Iucharba, "and sorry are we for whathas happened.""Nay," said Brian, "but I swear by the Wind and the Sun that if thouhadst seven lives I would take them all.""Grant me a favour then," said Kian."We shall grant it," said Brian."Let me," said Kian, "return into my own form that I may die in theshape of a man.""I had liefer kill a man than a pig," said Brian. Then Kian became aman again and stood before them, the blood trickling from his breast."I have outwitted you now," cried he, "for if ye had killed a pig yewould have paid a pig's eric,[16] but now ye shall pay the eric of aman. Never was greater eric in the land of Erinn than that which yeshall pay; and I swear that the very weapons with which ye slay meshall tell the tale to the avenger of blood."   [16] Blood-fine."Then you shall be slain with no weapons at all," said Brian; and theypicked up the stones on the Plain of Murthemny and rained them uponhim till he was all one wound, and he died. So they buried him asdeep as the height of a man, and went their way to join the host ofLugh.When the host was assembled, Lugh led them into Connacht and smote theFomorians and drove them to their ships, but of this the tale tellsnot here. But when the fight was done, Lugh asked of his comrades ifthey had seen his father in the fight and how it fared with him. Theysaid they had not seen him. Then Lugh made search among the dead, andthey found not Kian there. "Were Kian alive he would be here," saidLugh, "and I swear by the Wind and the Sun that I will not eat ordrink till I know what has befallen him."On their return the Danaan host passed by the Plain of Murthemny, andwhen they came near the place of the murder the stones cried aloud toLugh. And Lugh listened, and they told him of the deed of the sons ofTurenn. Then Lugh searched for the place of a new grave, and when hehad found it he caused it to be dug, and the body of his father wasraised up, and Lugh saw that it was but a litter of wounds. And hecried out: "O wicked and horrible deed!" and he kissed his father andsaid, "I am sick from this sight, my eyes are blind from it, my earsare deaf from it, my heart stands still from it. Ye gods that I adore,why was I not here when this crime was done? a man of the children ofDana slain by his fellows." And he lamented long and bitterly. ThenKian was again laid in his grave, and a mound was heaped over it and apillar-stone set thereon and his name written in Ogham, and a dirgewas sung for him.After that Lugh departed to Tara, to the Court of the High King, andhe charged his people to say nothing of what had happened until hehimself had made it known.When he reached Tara with his victorious host the King placed Lugh athis own right hand before all the princes and lords of the Danaanfolk. Lugh looked round about him, and saw the sons of Turenn sittingamong the assembly; and they were among the best and strongest and thehandsomest of those who were present at that time; nor had any bornethemselves better in the fight with the sea-rovers. Then Lugh asked ofthe King that the chain of silence might be shaken; and the assemblyheard it, and gave their attention to Lugh. And Lugh said:"O King, and ye princes of the People of Dana, I ask what vengeancewould each of you exact upon a man who had foully murdered yourfather?"Then they were all astonished, and the King answered and said:"Surely it is not the father of Lugh Lamfada who has thus been slain?""Thou hast said it," said Lugh, "and those who did the deed arelistening to me now, and know it better than I."The King said, "Not in one day would I slay the murderer of my father,but I would tear from him a limb day by day till he were dead."And so spake all the lords of the Danaans, and the Sons of Turennamong the rest."They have sentenced themselves, the murderers of my father," saidLugh. "Nevertheless I shall accept an eric from them, and if they willpay it, it shall be well; but if not, I shall not break the peace ofthe King's Assembly and of his sanctuary, but let them beware how theyleave the Hall Tara until they have made me satisfaction.""Had I slain your father," said the High King, "glad should I be tohave an eric accepted for his blood."Then the Sons of Turenn whispered among themselves. "It is to us thatLugh is speaking," said Iuchar and Iucharba, "let us confess and havethe eric assessed upon us, for he has got knowledge of our deed.""Nay," said Brian, "but he may be seeking for an open confession, andthen perchance he would not accept an eric."But the two brethren said to Brian, "Do thou confess because thou artthe eldest, or if thou do not, then we shall."So Brian, son of Turenn, rose up and said to Lugh: "It is to us thouhast spoken, Lugh, since thou knowest there is enmity of old timebetween our houses; and if thou wilt have it that we have slain thyfather, then declare our eric and we shall pay it.""I will take an eric from you," said Lugh, "and if it seem too great,I will remit a portion of it.""Declare it, then," said the Sons of Turenn."This it is," said Lugh."Three apples."The skin of a pig."A spear."Two steeds and a chariot."Seven swine."A whelp of a dog."A cooking spit."Three shouts on a hill.""We would not consider heavy hundreds or thousands of these things,"said the Sons of Turenn, "but we misdoubt thou hast some secretpurpose against us.""I deem it no small eric," said Lugh, "and I call to witness the HighKing and lords of the Danaans that I shall ask no more; and do ye onyour side give me guarantees for the fulfilment of it."So the High King and the lords of the Danaans entered into bonds withLugh and with the Sons of Turenn that the eric should be paid andshould wipe out the blood of Kian."Now," said Lugh, "it is better forme to give you fuller knowledge ofthe eric. The three apples that I have demanded of you are the applesthat grow in the garden of the Hesperides, in the east of the world,and none but these will do. Thus it is with them: they are the colourof bright gold, and as large as the head of a month-old child; thetaste of them is like honey; if he who eats them has any running soreor evil disease it is healed by them; they may be eaten and eaten andnever be less. I doubt, O young heroes, if ye will get these apples,for those who guard them know well an ancient prophecy that one daythree knights from the western world would come to attempt them."As for the skin of the pig, that is a treasure of Tuish, the King ofGreece. If it be laid upon a wounded man it will make him whole andwell, if only it overtake the breath of life in him. And do ye knowwhat is the spear that I demanded?""We do not," said they."It is the poisoned spear of Peisear, the King of Persia, and sofierce is the spirit of war in it that it must be kept in a pot ofsoporific herbs or it would fly out raging for death. And do ye knowwhat are the two horses and the chariot ye must get?""We do not know," said they."The steeds and the chariot belong to Dobar, King of Sicily. They aremagic steeds and can go indifferently over land and sea, nor can theybe killed by any weapon unless they be torn in pieces and their bonescannot be found. And the seven pigs are the swine of Asal, King of theGolden Pillars, which may be slain and eaten every night and the nextmorning they are alive again."And the hound-whelp I asked of you is the whelp of the King ofIorroway, that can catch and slay any beast in the world; hard it isto get possession of that whelp."The cooking spit is one of the spits that the fairy women of theIsland of Finchory have in their kitchen."And the hill on which ye must give three shouts is the hill wheredwells Mochaen in the north of Lochlann. Now Mochaen and his sons haveit as a sacred ordinance that they permit not any man to raise a shoutupon their hill. With him it was that my father was trained to arms,and if I forgave ye his death, yet would Mochaen not forgive it."And now ye know the eric which ye have to pay for the slaying ofKian, son of Canta."Astonishment and despair overcame the Sons of Turenn when they learnedthe meaning of the eric of Lugh, and they went home to tell thetidings to their father."This is an evil tale," said Turenn; "I doubt but death and doom shallcome from your seeking of that eric, and it is but right they should.Yet it may be that ye shall obtain the eric if Lugh or Mananan willhelp you to it. Go now to Lugh, and ask him for the loan of the fairysteed of Mananan, which was given him to ride over the sea into Erinn.He will refuse you, for he will say that the steed is but lent to himand he may not make a loan of a loan. Then ask him for the loan ofOcean Sweeper, which is the magic boat of Mananan, and that he mustgive, for it is a sacred ordinance with Lugh not to refuse a secondpetition."So they went to Lugh, and it all fell out as Turenn had told them, andthey went back to Turenn."Ye have done something towards the eric," said Turenn, "but not much.Yet Lugh would be well pleased that ye brought him whatever mightserve him when the Fomorians come to the battle again, and wellpleased would he be that ye might get your death in bringing it. Gonow, my sons, and blessing and victory be with you."Then the Sons of Turenn went down to the harbour on the Boyne riverwhere the Boat of Mananan was, and Ethne their sister with them. Andwhen they reached the place, Ethne broke into lamentations andweeping; but Brian said, "Weep not, dear sister, but let us go forthgaily to great deeds. Better a hundred deaths in the quest of honourthan to live and die as cowards and sluggards." But Ethne said, "yeare banished from Erinn--never was there a sadder deed." Then theyput forth from the river-mouth of the Boyne and soon the fair coastsof Erinn faded out of sight. "And now," said they among themselves,"what course shall we steer?"[Illustration: "'Bear us swiftly, Boat of Mananan, to the Garden ofthe Hesperides'"]"No need to steer the Boat of Mananan," said Brian; and he whisperedto the Boat, "Bear us swiftly, Boat of Mananan, to the Garden of theHesperides"; and the spirit of the Boat heard him and it leapedeagerly forward, lifting and dipping over the rollers and throwing upan arch of spray each side of its bows wherein sat a rainbow when thesun shone upon it; and so in no long time they drew nigh to the coastwhere was the far-famed garden of the Golden Apples."And now, how shall we set about the capture of the apples?" saidBrian."Draw sword and fight for them," said Iuchar and Iucharba, "and if weare the stronger, we shall win them, and if not, we shall fall, asfall we surely must ere the eric for Kian be paid.""Nay," said Brian, "but whether we live or die, let not men say of usthat we went blind and headlong to our tasks, but rather that we madethe head help the hand, and that we deserved to win even though welost. Now my counsel is that we approach the garden in the shape ofthree hawks, strong of wing, and that we hover about until the Wardensof the Tree have spent all their darts and javelins in casting at us,and then let us swoop down suddenly and bear off each of us an appleif we may."So it was agreed; and Brian struck himself and each of the brotherswith a druid wand, and they became three beautiful, fierce, andstrong-winged hawks. When the Wardens perceived them, they shouted andthrew showers of arrows and darts at them, but the hawks evaded all ofthese until the missiles were spent, and then seized each an apple inhis talons. But Brian seized two, for he took one in his beak as well.Then they flew as swiftly as they might to the shore where they hadleft their boat. Now the King of that garden had three fair daughters,to whom the apples and the garden were very dear, and he transformedthe maidens into three griffins, who pursued the hawks. And thegriffins threw darts of fire, as it were lightning, at the hawks."Brian!" then cried Iuchar and his brother, "we are being burnt bythese darts--we are lost unless we can escape them."On this, Brian changed himself and his brethren into three swans, andthey plunged into the sea, and the burning darts were quenched. Thenthe griffins gave over the chase, and the Sons of Turenn made fortheir boat, and they embarked with the four apples. Thus their firstquest was ended.After that they resolved to seek the pigskin from the King of Greece,and they debated how they should come before him. "Let us," saidBrian, "assume the character and garb of poets and men of learning,for such are wont to come from Ireland and to travel foreign lands,and in that character shall the Greeks receive us best, for such menhave honour among them." "It is well said," replied the brothers, "yetwe have no poems in our heads, and how to compose one we know not."Howbeit they dressed their hair in the fashion of the poets of Erinn,and went up to the palace of Tuish the King. The doorkeeper asked ofthem who they were, and what was their business."We are bards from Ireland," they said, "and we have come with a poemto the King.""Let them be admitted," said the King, when the doorkeeper brought himthat tale; "they have doubtless come thus far to seek a powerfulpatron."So Brian and Iuchar and Iucharba came in and were made welcome, andwere entertained, and then the minstrels of the King of Greece chantedthe lays of that country before them. After that came the turn of thestranger bards, and Brian asked his brethren if they had anything torecite."We have not," said they; "we know but one art--to take what we wantby the strong hand if we may, and if we may not, to die fighting.""That is a difficult art too," said Brian; "let us see how we thrivewith the poetry."So he rose up and recited this lay:--   "Mighty is thy fame, O King,   Towering like a giant oak;   For my song I ask no thing   Save a pigskin for a cloak.   "When a neighbour with his friend   Quarrels, they are ear to ear;   Who on us their store shall spend   Shall be richer than they were.   "Armies of the storming wind--   Raging seas, the sword's fell stroke--   Thou hast nothing to my mind   Save thy pigskin for a cloak.""That is a very good poem," said the King, "but one word of itsmeaning I do not understand.""I will interpret it for you," said Brian:--  "Mighty is thy fame, O King,  Towering like a giant oak.""That is to say, as the oak surpasses all the other trees of theforest, so do you surpass all the kings of the world in goodness, innobleness, and in liberality.  "A pigskin for a cloak.""That is the skin of the pig of Tuish which I would fain receive asthe reward for my lay."   "When a neighbour with his friend   Quarrels, they are ear to ear.""That is to signify that you and I shall be about each other's earsover the skin, unless you are willing to give it to me. Such is thesense of my poem," said Brian, son of Turenn."I would praise your poem more," said the King, "if there were not somuch about my pigskin in it. Little sense have you, O man of poetry,to make that request of me, for not to all the poets, scholars, andlords of the world would I give that skin of my own free will. Butwhat I will do is this--I will give the full of that skin of red goldthrice over in reward for your poem.""Thanks be to you," said Brian, "for that. I knew that I asked toomuch, but I knew also thou wouldst redeem the skin amply andgenerously. And now let the gold be duly measured out in it, forgreedy am I, and I will not abate an ounce of it."The servants of the King were then sent with Brian and his brothers tothe King's treasure-chamber to measure out the gold. As they did so,Brian suddenly snatched the skin from the hands of him who held it,and swiftly wrapped it round his body. Then the three brothers drewsword and made for the door, and a great fight arose in the King'spalace. But they hewed and thrust manfully on every side of them, andthough sorely wounded they fought their way through and escaped tothe shore, and drove their boat out to sea, when the skin of the magicpig quickly made them whole and sound again. And thus the second questof the Sons of Turenn had its end."Let us now," said Brian, "go to seek the spear of the King ofPersia.""In what manner of guise shall we go before the King of Persia?" saidhis brothers."As we did before the King of Greece," said Brian."That guise served us well with the King of Greece," replied they;"nevertheless, O Brian, this business of professing to be poets, whenwe are but swordsmen, is painful to us."However, they dressed their hair in the manner of poets and went upboldly to the palace of King Peisear of Persia, saying, as before,that they were wandering bards from Ireland who had a poem to recitebefore the King; and as they passed through the courtyard they markedthe spear drowsing in its pot of sleepy herbs. They were made welcome,and after listening to the lays of the King's minstrel, Brian rose andsang:--   "'Tis little Peisear cares for spears,   Since armies, when his face they see,   All overcome with panic fears   Without a wound they turn and flee.   "The Yew is monarch of the wood,   No other tree disputes its claim.   The shining shaft in venom stewed   Flies fiercely forth to kill and maim.""'Tis a very good poem," said the King, "but, O bard from Erinn, I donot understand your reference to my spear.""It is merely this," replied Brian, "that I would like your spear as areward for my poem."Then the King stared at Brian, and his beard bristled with anger, andhe said, "Never was a greater reward paid for any poem than not toadjudge you guilty of instant death for your request."Then Brian flung at the king the fourth golden apple which he hadtaken from the Garden of the Hesperides, and it dashed out his brains.Immediately the brothers all drew sword and made for the courtyard.Here they seized the magic spear, and with it and with their swordsthey fought their way clear, not without many wounds, and escaped totheir boat. And thus ended the third quest of the Sons of Turenn.Now having come safely and victoriously through so many straits andperils, they began to be merry and hoped that all the eric might yetbe paid. So they sailed away with high hearts to the Island of Sicily,to get the two horses and the chariot of the King, and the Boat ofMananan bore them swiftly and well.Having arrived here, they debated among themselves as to how theyshould proceed; and they agreed to present themselves as Irishmercenary soldiers--for such were wont in those days to take servicewith foreign kings--until they should learn where the horses and thechariot were kept, and how they should come at them. Then they wentforward, and found the King and his lords in the palace garden takingthe air.The Sons of Turenn then paid homage to him, and he asked them of theirbusiness."We are Irish mercenary soldiers," they said, "seeking our wages fromthe kings of the world." "Are ye willing to take service with me?"said the King. "We are," said they, "and to that end are we come."Then their contract of military service was made, and they remained atthe King's court for a month and a fortnight, and did not in all thattime come to see the steeds or the chariot. At last Brian said,"Things are going ill with us, my brethren, in that we know no more atthis day of the steeds or of the chariot than when we first arrived atthis place.""What shall we do, then?" said they."Let us do this," said Brian. "Let us gird on our arms and all ourmarching array, and tell the King that we shall quit his serviceunless he show us the chariot."And so they did; and the King said, "To-morrow shall be a gatheringand parade of all my host, and the chariot shall be there, and yeshall see it if ye have a mind."So the next day the steeds were yoked and the chariot was driven rounda great plain before the King and his lords. Now these steeds couldrun as well on sea as on dry land, and they were swifter than thewinds of March. As the chariot came round the second time, Brian andhis brothers seized the horses' heads, and Brian took the charioteerby the foot and flung him out over the rail, and they all leaped intothe chariot and drove away. Such was the swiftness of their drivingthat they were out of sight ere the King and his men knew rightlywhat had befallen. And thus ended the fourth quest of the Sons ofTurenn.Next they betook themselves to the court of Asal, King of the GoldenPillars, to get the seven swine which might be eaten every night andthey would be whole and well on the morrow morn.But it had now been noised about every country that three young heroesfrom Erinn were plundering the kings of the world of their treasuresin payment of a mighty eric; and when they arrived at the Land of theGolden Pillars they found the harbour guarded and a strait watch kept,that no one who might resemble the Sons of Turenn should enter.But Asal the King came to the harbour-mouth and spoke with the heroes,for he was desirous to see those who had done the great deeds that hehad heard of. He asked them if it were true that they had done suchthings, and why. Then Brian told him the story of the mighty ericwhich had been laid upon them, and what they had done and suffered infulfilling it. "Why," said King Asal, "have ye now come to mycountry?""For the seven swine," said Brian, "to take them with us as a part ofthat eric.""How do you mean to get them?" asked the King."With your goodwill," replied Brian, "if so it may be, and to pay youtherefore with all the wealth we now have, which is thanks and love,and to stand by your side hereafter in any strait or quarrel you mayenter into. But if you will not grant us the swine, and we may not bequit of our eric without them, we shall even take them as we may, andas we have beforetime taken mighty treasures from mighty kings."Then King Asal went into counsel with his lords, and he advised thatthe swine be given to the Sons of Turenn, partly for that he was movedwith their desperate plight and the hardihood they had shown, andpartly that they might get them whether or no. To this they allagreed, and the Sons of Turenn were invited to come ashore, where theywere courteously and hospitably entertained in the King's palace. Onthe morrow the pigs were given to them, and great was their gladness,for never before had they won a treasure without toil and blood. Andthey vowed that, if they should live, the name of Asal should be madeby them a great and shining name, for his compassion and generositywhich he had shown them. This, then, was the fifth quest of the Sonsof Turenn."And whither do ye voyage now?" said Asal to them."We go," said they, "to Iorroway for the hound's whelp which isthere.""Take me with you, then," said Asal, "for the King of Iorroway ishusband to my daughter, and I may prevail upon him to grant you thehound without combat."So the King's ship was manned and provisioned, and the Sons of Turennlaid up their treasures in the Boat of Mananan, and they all sailedjoyfully forth to the pleasant kingdom of Iorroway.But here, too, they found all the coasts and harbours guarded, andentrance was forbidden them. Then Asal declared who he was, and himthey allowed to land, and he journeyed to where his son-in-law, theKing of Iorroway, was. To him Asal related the whole story of the sonsof Turenn, and why they were come to that kingdom."Thou wert a fool," said the King of Iorroway, "to have come on such amission. There are no three heroes in the world to whom the Immortalshave granted such grace that they should get my hound either by favouror by fight.""That is not a good word," said Asal, "for the treasures they nowpossess have made them yet stronger than they were, and these they wonin the teeth of kings as strong as thou." And much more he said to himto persuade him to yield up the hound, but in vain. So Asal took hisway back to the haven where the Sons of Turenn lay, and told them histidings.Then the Sons of Turenn seized the magic spear, and the pigskin, andwith a rush like that of three eagles descending from a high cliffupon a lamb-fold they burst upon the guards of the King of Iorroway.Fierce and fell was the combat that ensued, and many times thebrothers were driven apart, and all but overborne by the throng oftheir foes. But at last Brian perceived where the King of Iorroway wasdirecting the fight, and he cut his way to him, and having smitten himto the ground, he bound him and carried him out of the press to thehaven-side where Asal was."There," he said, "is your son-in-law for you Asal, and I swear by mysword that I had more easily killed him thrice than once to bring himthus bound to you.""That is very like," said Asal; "but now hold him to ransom."So the people of Iorroway gave the hound to the Sons of Turenn as aransom for their King, and the King was released, and friendship andalliance were made between them. And with joyful hearts the Sons ofTurenn bade farewell to the King of Iorroway and to Asal, and departedon their way. Thus was the sixth of their quests fulfilled.Now Lugh Lamfada desired to know how the Sons of Turenn had fared, andwhether they had got any portion of the great eric that might beserviceable to him when the Fomorians should return for one morestruggle. And by sorcery and divination it was revealed to him howthey had thriven, and that nought remained to be won save thecooking-spit of the sea-nymphs, and to give the three shouts upon thehill. Lugh then by druidic art caused a spell of oblivion andforgetfulness to descend upon the Sons of Turenn, and put into theirhearts withal a yearning and passion to return to their native land ofErinn. They forgot, therefore, that a portion of the eric was still towin, and they bade the Boat of Mananan bear them home with theirtreasures, for they deemed that they should now quit them of all theirdebt for the blood of Kian and live free in their father's home,having done such things and won such fame as no three brothers hadever done since the world began.At the Brugh of Boyne, where they had started on their quest, theirboat came ashore again, and as they landed they wept for joy, andfalling on their knees they kissed the green sod of Erinn. Then theytook up their treasures and journeyed to Ben Edar,[17] where the HighKing of Ireland, and Lugh with him, were holding an Assembly of thePeople of Dana. But when Lugh heard that they were on their way he puton his cloak of invisibility and withdrew privily to Tara.   [17] The Hill of Howth.When the brethren arrived at Ben Edar, the High King of the lords ofthe Danaans gave them welcome and applause, for all were rejoiced thatthe stain of ancient feud and bloodshed should be wiped out, and thatthe Children of Dana should be at peace within their borders. Thenthey sought for Lugh to deliver over the eric, but he was not to befound. And Brian said, "He has gone to Tara to avoid us, having heardthat we were coming with our treasures and weapons of war."Word was then sent to Lugh at Tara that the Sons of Turenn were at BenEdar, and the eric with them."Let them pay it over to the High King," said Lugh.So it was done; and when Lugh had tidings that the High King had theeric, he returned to Ben Edar.Then the eric was laid before him, and Brian said, "Is the debt paid,O Lugh, son of Kian?"Lugh said, "Truly there is here the price of any man's death; but itis not lawful to give a quittance for an eric that is not complete.Where is the cooking-spit from the Island of Finchory? and have yegiven the three shouts upon the Hill of Mochaen?"At this word Brian and Iuchar and Iucharba fell prone upon theground, and were speechless awhile from grief and dismay. After awhile they left the Assembly like broken men, with hanging heads andwith heavy steps, and betook themselves to Dun Turenn, where theyfound their father, and they told him all that had befallen them sincethey had parted with him and set forth on the Quest. Thus they passedthe night in gloom and evil forebodings, and on the morrow they wentdown once more to the place where the Boat of Mananan was moored. AndEthne their sister accompanied them, wailing and lamenting, but nowords of cheer had they now to say to her, for now they began tocomprehend that a mightier and a craftier mind had caught them in thenet of fate. And whereas they had deemed themselves heroes and victorsin the most glorious quest whereof the earth had record, they now knewthat they were but as arrows in the hands of a laughing archer, whoshoots one at a stag and one at the heart of a foe, and one, it maybe, in sheer wantonness, and to try his bow, over a cliff edge intothe sea.[Illustration: "There dwelt the red-haired ocean-nymphs"]However, they put forth in their magic boat, but in no wise could theydirect it to the Isle of Finchory, and a quarter of a year theytraversed the seaways and never could get tidings of that island. Atlast Brian fashioned for himself by magic art a water-dress, with ahelmet of crystal, and into the depths of the sea he plunged. Here,the story tells, he searched hither and thither for a fortnight, tillat last he found that island, which was an island indeed with the seaover it and around it and beneath it. There dwelt the red-hairedocean-nymphs in glittering palaces among the sea-flowers, and theywrought fair embroidery with gold and jewels, and sang, as theywrought, a fairy music like the chiming of silver bells. Three fiftiesof them sat or played in their great hall as Brian entered, and theygazed on him but spoke no word. Then Brian strode to the wide hearth,and without a word he seized from it a spit that was made of beatengold, and turned again to go. But at that the laughter of thesea-maidens rippled through the hall and one of them said:"Thou art a bold man, Brian, and bolder than thou knowest; for ifthy two brothers were here, the weakest of us could vanquish all thethree. Nevertheless, take the spit for thy daring; we had nevergranted it for thy prayers."So Brian thanked them and bade farewell, and he rose to the surface ofthe water. Ere long his brethren perceived him as he shouldered thewaves on the bosom of the deep, and they sailed to where he was andtook him on board. And thus ended the quest for the seventh portion ofthe eric of Kian.After that their hopes revived a little, and they set sail for theland of Lochlann, in which was the Hill of Mochaen. When they hadarrived at the hill Mochaen came out to meet them with his three sons,Corc and Conn and Hugh; nor did the Sons of Turenn ever behold a bandof grimmer and mightier warriors than those four."What seek ye here?" asked Mochaen of them They told him that it hadbeen laid upon them to give three shouts upon the hill."It hath been laid upon me," said Mochaen, "to prevent this thing."Then Brian and Mochaen drew sword and fell furiously upon each other,and their fighting was like that of two hungry lions or two wildbulls, until at last Brian drove his sword into the throat of Mochaen,and he died.With that the Sons of Mochaen and the Sons of Turenn rushed fiercelyupon each other. Long and sore was the strife that they had, and theblood that fell made red the grassy place wherein they fought. Not oneof them but received wounds that pierced him through and through, andthat heroes of less hardihood had died of a score of times. But in theend the sons of Mochaen fell, and Brian, Iuchar, and Iucharba lay overthem in a swoon like death.After a while Brian's senses came back to him, and he said, "Do yelive, dear brothers, or how is it with you?" "We are as good as dead,"said they; "let us be.""Arise," then said Brian, "for truly I feel death coming swiftly uponus, and we have yet to give the three shouts upon the hill.""We cannot stir," said Iuchar and Iucharba. Then Brian rose to hisknees and to his feet, and he lifted up his two brothers while theblood of all three streamed down to their feet, and they raised theirvoices as best they might, and gave three hoarse cries upon the Hillof Mochaen. And thus was the last of the epic fulfilled.Then they bound up their wounds, and Brian placed himself between thetwo brothers, and slowly and painfully they made their way to theboat, and put out to sea for Ireland. And as they lay in the stupor offaintness in the boat, one murmured to himself, "I see the Cape of BenEdar and the coast of Turenn, and Tara of the Kings." Then Iuchar andIucharba entreated Brian to lift their heads upon his breast. "Let usbut see the land of Erinn again," said they, "the hills aroundTailtin, and the dewy plain of Bregia, and the quiet waters of theBoyne and our father's Dun thereby, and healing will come to us; or ifdeath come we can endure it after that." Then Brian raised them up;and they saw that they were now near by under Ben Edar; and at theStrand of the Bull[18] they took land. They were then conveyed to theDun of Turenn, and life was still in them when they were laid in theirfather's hall.   [18] Cluan Tarbh, Clontarf; so called from the roaring of the   waves on the strand.And Brian said to Turenn, "Go now, dear father, with all speed to Lughat Tara. Give him the cooking-spit, and tell how thou hast found usafter giving our three shouts upon the Hill of Mochaen. Then beseechhim that he yield thee the loan of the pigskin of the King of Greece,for if it be laid upon us while the life is yet in us, we shallrecover. We have won the eric, and it may be that he will not pursueus to our death."Turenn went to Lugh and gave him the spit of the sea-nymphs, andbesought him for the lives of his sons.Lugh was silent for a while, but his countenance did not change, andhe said, "Thou, old man, seest nought but the cloud of sorrow whereinthou art encompassed. But I hear from above it the singing of theImmortal Ones, who tell to one another the story of this land. Thysons must die; yet have I shown to them more mercy than they showed toKian. I have forgiven them; nor shall they live to slay their ownimmortality, but the royal bards of Erinn and the old men in thechimney corners shall tell of their glory and their fate as long asthe land shall endure."Then Turenn bowed his white head and went sorrowfully back to DunTurenn; and he told his sons of the words that Lugh had said. Andwith that the sons of Turenn kissed each other, and the breath of lifedeparted from them, and they died. And Turenn died also, for his heartwas broken in him; and Ethne his daughter buried them in one grave.Thus, then, ends the tale of the Quest of the Eric and the Fate of theSons of Turenn.CHAPTER IIIThe Secret of LabraIn very ancient days there was a King in Ireland named Labra, who wascalled Labra the Sailor for a certain voyage that he made. Now Labrawas never seen save by one man, once a year, without a hood thatcovered his head and ears. But once a year it was his habit to let hishair be cropped, and the person to do this was chosen by lot, for theKing was accustomed to put to death instantly the man who had croppedhim. And so it happened that on a certain year the lot fell on a youngman who was the only son of a poor widow, who dwelt near by the palaceof the King. When she heard that her son had been chosen she fell onher knees before the King and besought him, with tears, that her son,who was her only support and all she had in the world, might notsuffer death as was customary. The King was moved by her grief and herentreaties, and at last he consented that the young man should not beslain provided that he vowed to keep secret to the day of his deathwhat he should see. The youth agreed to this and he vowed by the Sunand the Wind that he would never, so long as he lived, reveal to manwhat he should learn when he cropped the King's hair.So he did what was appointed for him and went home. But when he did sohe had no peace for the wonder of the secret that he had learnedpreyed upon his mind so that he could not rest for thinking of it andlonging to reveal it, and at last he fell into a wasting sickness fromit, and was near to die. Then there was brought to see him a wisedruid, who was skilled in all maladies of the mind and body, and afterhe had talked with the youth he said to his mother, "Thy son is dyingof the burden of a secret which he may not reveal to any man, butuntil he reveals it he will have no ease. Let him, therefore, walkalong the high way till he comes to a place where four roads meet. Lethim then turn to the right, and the first tree that he shall meet onthe roadside let him tell the secret to it, and so it may be he shallbe relieved, and his vow will not be broken."The mother told her son of the druid's advice, and next day he wentupon his way till he came to four cross roads, and he took the roadupon the right, and the first tree he found was a great willow-tree.So the young man laid his cheek against the bark, and he whispered thesecret to the tree, and as he turned back homeward he felt lightenedof his burden, and he leaped and sang, and ere many days were past hewas as well and light hearted as ever he had been in his life.Some while after that it happened that the King's harper, namelyCraftiny, broke the straining-post of his harp and went out to seekfor a piece of wood wherewith to mend it. And the first timber hefound that would fit the purpose was the willow-tree by the crossroads. He cut it down, therefore, and took as much as would give him anew straining-post, and he bore it home with him and mended his harpwith it. That night he played after meat before the King and his lordsas he was wont, but whatever he played and sang the folk that listenedto him seemed to hear only one thing, "Two horse's ears hath Labra theSailor."Then the King plucked off his hood, and after that he made no secretof his ears and none suffered on account of them thenceforward.CHAPTER IVKing Iubdan and King FergusIt happened on a day when Fergus son of Leda was King of Ulster, thatIubdan, King of the Leprecauns or Wee Folk, of the land of Faylinn,held a great banquet and assembly of the lords and princes of the WeeFolk. And all their captains and men of war came thither, to showtheir feats before the King, among whom was the strong man, namelyGlowar, whose might was such that with his battle-axe he could hewdown a thistle at one stroke. Thither also came the King'sheir-apparent. Tiny, son of Tot, and the Queen Bebo with her maidens;and there were also the King's harpers and singing-men, and the chiefpoet of the court, who was called Eisirt.All these sat down to the feast in due order and precedence, with Beboon the King's right hand and the poet on his left, and Glowar kept thedoor. Soon the wine began to flow from the vats of dark-red yew-wood,and the carvers carved busily at great haunches of roast hares andribs of field-mice; and they all ate and drank, and loudly the hallrang with gay talk and laughter, and the drinking of toasts, andclashing of silver goblets.At last when they had put away desire of eating and drinking, Iubdanrose up, having in his hand the royal goblet of gold inlaid withprecious many-coloured jewels, and the heir-apparent rose at the otherend of the table, and they drank prosperity and victory to Faylinn.Then Iubdan's heart swelled with pride, and he asked of the company,"Come now, have any of you ever seen a king more glorious and powerfulthan I am?" "Never, in truth," cried they all. "Have ye ever seen astronger man than my giant, Glowar?" "Never, O King," said they. "Orbattle-steeds and men-at-arms better than mine?" "By our words," theycried, "we never have." "Truly," went on Iubdan, "I deem that he whowould assail our kingdom of Faylinn, and carry away captives andhostages from us, would have his work cut out for him, so fierce andmighty are our warriors; yea, any one of them hath the stuff ofkingship in him."On hearing this, Eisirt, in whom the heady wine and ale had done theirwork, burst out laughing; and the King turned to him, saying, "Eisirt,what hath moved thee to this laughter?" "I know a province in Erinn,"replied Eisirt, "one man of whom would harry Faylinn in the teeth ofall four battalions of the Wee Folk." "Seize him," cried the King tohis attendants; "Eisirt shall pay dearly in chains and in prison forthat scornful speech against our glory."Then Eisirt was put in bonds, and he repented him of his brag; but erethey dragged him away he said, "Grant me, O mighty King, but threedays' respite, that I may travel to Erinn to the court of Fergus macLeda, and if I bring not back some clear token that I have utterednought but the truth, then do with me as thou wilt."So Iubdan bade them release him, and he fared away to Erinn oversea.[Illustration: "They all trooped out, lords and ladies, to view thewee man"]After this, one day, as Fergus and his lords sat at the feast, thegatekeeper of the palace of Fergus in Emania heard outside a sound ofringing; he opened the gate, and there stood a wee man holding in hishand a rod of white bronze hung with little silver bells, by whichpoets are wont to procure silence for their recitations. Most nobleand comely was the little man to look on, though the short grass ofthe lawn reached as high as to his knee. His hair was twisted infour-ply strands after the manner of poets and he wore agold-embroidered tunic of silk and an ample scarlet cloak with afringe of gold. On his feet he wore shoes of white bronze ornamentedwith gold, and a silken hood was on his head. The gatekeeper wonderedat the sight of the wee man, and went to report the matter to KingFergus. "Is he less," asked Fergus, "than my dwarf and poet AEda?""Verily," said the gatekeeper, "he could stand upon the palm of AEda'shand and have room to spare." Then with much laughter and wonder theyall trooped out, lords and ladies, to the great gate to view the weeman and to speak with him. But Eisirt, when he saw them, waved themback in alarm, crying, "Avaunt, huge men; bring not your heavy breathso near me; but let yon man that is least among you approach me andbear me in." So the dwarf AEda put Eisirt on his palm and bore him intothe banqueting hall.Then they set him on the table, and Eisirt declared his name andcalling. The King ordered that meat and drink should be given him, butEisirt said, "I will neither eat of your meat nor drink of ale." "Byour word," said Fergus, "'tis a haughty wight; he ought to be droppedinto a goblet that he might at least drink all round him." Thecupbearer seized Eisirt and put him into a tankard of ale, and he swamon the surface of it. "Ye wise men of Ulster," he cried, "there ismuch knowledge and wisdom ye might get from me, yet ye will let me bedrowned!" "What, then?" cried they. Then Eisirt, beginning with theKing, set out to tell every hidden sin that each man or woman haddone, and ere he had gone far they with much laughter and chidingfetched him out of the ale-pot and dried him with fair satin napkins."Now ye have confessed that I know somewhat to the purpose," saidEisirt, "and I will even eat of your food, but do ye give heed to mywords, and do ill no more."Fergus then said, "If thou art a poet, Eisirt, give us now a taste ofthy delightful art." "That will I," said Eisirt, "and the poem that Ishall recite to you shall be an ode in praise of my king, Iubdan theGreat." Then he recited this lay:--   "A monarch of might   Is Iubdan my king.   His brow is snow-white,   His hair black as night;   As a red copper bowl   When smitten will sing,   So ringeth the voice   Of Iubdan the king.   His eyen, they roll   Majestic and bland   On the lords of his land   Arrayed for the fight,   A spectacle grand!   Like a torrent they rush   With a waving of swords   And the bridles all ringing   And cheeks all aflush,   And the battle-steeds springing,   A beautiful, terrible, death-dealing band.   Like pines, straight and tall,   Where Iubdan is king,   Are the men one and all.   The maidens are fair--   Bright gold is their hair.   From silver we quaff   The dark, heady ale   That never shall fail;   We love and we laugh.   Gold frontlets we wear;   And aye through the air   Sweet music doth ring--   O Fergus, men say   That in all Inisfail   There is not a maiden so proud or so wise   But would give her two eyes   Thy kisses to win--   But I tell thee, that there   Thou canst never compare   With the haughty, magnificent King of Faylinn!"At this they all applauded, and Fergus said, "O youth and blamelessbard, let us be friends henceforth." And they all heaped before him,as a poet's reward, gifts of rings and jewels and gold cups andweapons, as high as a tall man standing. Then Eisirt said, "Truly agenerous and a worthy reward have ye given me, O men of Ulster; yettake back these precious things I pray you, for every man in myking's household hath an abundance of them." But the Ulster lordssaid, "Nothing that we have given may we take back." Eisirt then badetwo-thirds of his reward be given to the bards and learned men ofUlster, and one-third to the horse-boys and jesters; and so it wasdone.Three days and nights did Eisirt abide in Emania, and all the King'scourt loved him and made much of him. Then he wished them blessing andvictory, and prepared to depart to his own country. Now AEda, theKing's dwarf and minstrel, begged Eisirt to take him with him on avisit to the land of Faylinn; and Eisirt said, "I shall not bid theecome, for then if kindness and hospitality be shown thee, thou wiltsay it is only what I had undertaken; but if thou come of thine ownmotion, thou wilt perchance be grateful."So they went off together; but Eisirt could not keep up with AEda, andAEda said, "I perceive that Eisirt is but a poor walker." At thisEisirt ran off like a flash and was soon an arrow flight in front ofAEda. When the latter at last came up with him, he said, "The rightthing, Eisirt, is not too fast and not too slow." "Since I have beenin Ulster," Eisirt replied, "I have never before heard ye measure outthe right."By and by they reached the margin of the sea. "And what are we to donow?" asked AEda. "Be not troubled, AEda," said Eisirt, "the horse ofIubdan will bear us easily over this." They waited awhile on thebeach, and ere long they saw it coming toward them skimming over thesurface of the waves. "Save and protect us!" cried AEda at that sight;and Eisirt asked him what he saw. "A red-maned hare," answered AEda."Nay, but that is Iubdan's horse," said Eisirt, and with that thecreature came prancing to land with flashing eyes and waving tail anda long russet-coloured mane; a bridle beset with gold it had. Eisirtmounted and bade AEda come up behind him. "Thy boat is little enoughfor thee alone," said AEda. "Cease fault-finding and grumbling," thensaid Eisirt, "for the weight of wisdom that is in thee will not bearhim down."So AEda and Eisirt mounted on the fairy horse and away they sped overthe tops of the waves and the deeps of the ocean till at last theyreached the Kingdom of Faylinn, and there were a great concourse ofthe Wee Folk awaiting them. "Eisirt is coming! Eisirt is coming!"cried they all, "and a Fomorian giant along with him."Then Iubdan went forth to meet Eisirt, and he kissed him, and said,"Why hast thou brought this Fomorian with thee to slay us?" "He is noFomor," said Eisirt, "but a learned man and a poet from Ulster. He ismoreover the King of Ulster's dwarf, and in all that realm he is thesmallest man. He can lie in their great men's bosoms and stand upontheir hands as though he were a child; yet for all that you would dowell to be careful how you behave to him." "What is his name?" saidthey then. "He is the poet AEda," said Eisirt. "Uch," said they, "whata giant thou hast brought us!""And now, O King," said Eisirt to Iubdan, "I challenge thee to go andsee for thyself the region from which we have come, and make trial ofthe royal porridge which is made for Fergus King of Ulster this verynight."At this Iubdan was much dismayed, and he betook himself to Bebo hiswife and told her how he was laid under bonds of chivalry by Eisirt togo to the land of the giants; and he bade her prepare to accompanyhim. "I will go," said she, "but you did an ill deed when youcondemned Eisirt to prison."So they mounted, both of them, on the fairy steed, and in no long timethey reached Emania, and it was now past midnight. And they weregreatly afraid, and said Bebo, "Let us search for that porridge andtaste it, as we were bound, and make off again ere the folk awake."They made their way into the palace of Fergus, and soon they found agreat porridge pot, but the rim was too high to be reached from theground. "Get thee up upon thy horse," said Bebo, "and from thence tothe rim of this cauldron." And thus he did, but having gained the rimof the pot his arm was too short to reach the silver ladle that wasin it. In straining downward to do so, however, he slipped and in hefell, and up to his middle in the thick porridge he stuck fast. Andwhen Bebo heard what a plight he was in, she wept, and said, "Rash andhasty wert thou, Iubdan, to have got into this evil case, but surelythere is no man under the sun that can make thee hear reason." And hesaid, "Rash indeed it was, but thou canst not help me, Bebo, now, andit is but folly to stay; take the horse and flee away ere the daybreak." "Say not so," replied Bebo, "for surely I will not go till Isee how things fall out with thee."At last the folk in the palace began to be stirring, and ere long theyfound Iubdan in the porridge pot.So they picked him out with great laughter bore him off to Fergus."By my conscience," said Fergus, "but this is not the little fellowthat was here before, for he had yellow hair, but this one hath ashock of the blackest; who art thou at all, wee man?""I am of the Wee Folk," said Iubdan, "and am indeed king over them,and this woman is my wife and queen, Bebo.""Take him away," then said Fergus to his varlets, "and guard himwell"; for he misdoubted some mischief of Faery was on foot."Nay, nay," cried Iubdan, "but let me not be with these coarsefellows. I pledge thee my word that I will not quit this place tillthou and Ulster give me leave.""Could I believe that," said Fergus, "I would not put thee in bonds.""I have never broken my word," said Iubdan, "and I never will."Then Fergus set him free and allotted him a fair chamber for himself,and a trusty servingman to wait upon him. Soon there came in a gilliewhose business it was to see to the fires, and he kindled the fire forIubdan, throwing on it a woodbine together with divers other sorts oftimber. Then Iubdan said, "Man of smoke, burn not the king of thetrees, for it is not meet to burn him. Wouldst thou but take counselfrom me thou mightest go safely by sea or land." Iubdan then chantedto him the following recital of the duties of his office:--"O fire-gillie of Fergus of the Feasts, never by land or sea burn theKing of the woods, High King of the forests of Inisfail, whom none maybind, but who like a strong monarch holds all the other trees in hardbondage. If thou burn the twining one, misfortune will come of it,peril at the point of spear, or drowning in the waves."Burn not the sweet apple-tree of drooping branches, of the whiteblossoms, to whose gracious head each man puts forth his hand."The stubborn blackthorn wanders far and wide, the good craftsmanburns not this timber; little though its bushes be, yet flocks ofbirds warble in them."Burn not the noble willow, the unfailing ornament of poems; beesdrink from its blossoms, all delight in the graceful tent."The delicate, airy tree of the druids, the rowan with its berries,this burn; but avoid the weak tree, burn not the slender hazel."The ash-tree of the black buds burn not--timber that speeds thewheel, that yields the rider his switch; the ashen spear is thescale-beam of battle."The tangled, bitter bramble, burn him, the sharp and green; he flaysand cuts the foot; he snares you and drags you back."Hottest of timber is the green oak; he will give you a pain in thehead if you use him overmuch, a pain in the eyes will come from hisbiting fumes."Full-charged with witchcraft is the alder, the hottest tree in thefight; burn assuredly both the alder and the whitehorn at your will."Holly, burn it in the green and in the dry; of all trees in theworld, holly is absolutely the best."The elder-tree of the rough brown bark, burn him to cinders, thesteed of the Fairy Folk."The drooping birch, by all means burn him too, the tree oflong-lasting bloom."And lay low, if it pleases you, the russet aspen; late or early, burnthe tree with the quaking plumage."The yew is the venerable ancestor of the wood as the companion offeasts he is known; of him make goodly brown vats for ale and wine."Follow my counsel, O man of the smoke, and it shall go well with you,body and soul."So Iubdan continued in Emania free to go and come as he pleased; andall the Ulstermen delighted to watch him and to hear his conversation.One day it chanced that he was in the chamber of the Queen, and sawher putting on her feet a very dainty and richly embroidered pair ofshoes. At this Iubdan gave a laugh. "Why dost thou laugh?" saidFergus. "Meseems the healing is applied very far from the hurt,"replied Iubdan. "What meanest thou by that?" said Fergus. "Because theQueen is making her feet fine in order, O Fergus, that she may attractthee to her lips," said Iubdan.Another time it chanced that Iubdan overheard one of the King'ssoldiers complaining of a pair of new brogues that had been served outto him, and grumbling that the soles were too thin. At this Iubdanlaughed again, and being asked why, he said, "I must need laugh tohear yon fellow grumbling about his brogues, for the soles of thesebrogues, thin as they are, he will never wear out." And this was atrue prophecy, for the same night this and another of the King's menhad a quarrel, and fought, and killed each the other.At last the Wee Folk determined to go in search of their king, andseven battalions of them marched upon Emania and encamped upon thelawn over against the King's Dun. Fergus and his nobles went out toconfer with them. "Give us back our king," said the Wee Folk, "and weshall redeem him with a great ransom." "What ransom, then?" askedFergus. "We shall," said they, "cause this great plain to stand thickwith corn for you every year, and that without ploughing or sowing.""I will not give up Iubdan for that," said Fergus. "Then we shall doyou a mischief," said the Wee Folk.That night every calf in the Province of Ulster got access to its dam,and in the morn there was no milk to be had for man or child, for thecows were sucked dry.Then said the Wee Folk to Fergus, "This night, unless we get Iubdan,we shall defile every well and lake and river in Ulster." "That is atrifle," said Fergus, "and ye shall not get Iubdan."The Wee Folk carried out this threat, and once more they came anddemanded Iubdan, saying, "To-night we shall burn with fire the shaftof every mill in Ulster." "Yet not so shall ye get Iubdan," saidFergus.This being done, they came again, saying, "We shall have vengeanceunless Iubdan be delivered to us." "What vengeance?" said Fergus. "Weshall snip off every ear of corn in thy kingdom," said they. "Evenso," replied Fergus, "I shall not deliver Iubdan."So the Wee Folk snipped off every ear of standing corn in Ulster, andonce more they returned and demanded Iubdan. "What will ye do next?"asked Fergus. "We shall shave the hair of every man and every woman inUlster," said they, "so that ye shall be shamed and disgraced for everamong the people of Erinn." "By my word," said Fergus, "if ye do thatI shall slay Iubdan."Then Iubdan said, "I have a better counsel than that, O King; let mehave liberty to go and speak with them, and I shall bid them make goodwhat mischief they have done, and they shall return home forthwith."Fergus granted that; and when the Wee Folk saw Iubdan approachingthem, they set up a shout of triumph that a man might have heard abowshot off, for they believed they had prevailed and that Iubdan wasreleased to them. But Iubdan said, "My faithful people, you must nowbegone, and I may not go with you; make good also all the mischiefthat ye have done, and know that if ye do any more I must die."Then the Wee Folk departed, very downcast and sorrowful, but they didas Iubdan had bidden them.Iubdan, however, went to Fergus and said, "Take, O King, the choicestof my treasures, and let me go.""What is thy choicest treasure?" said Fergus.Iubdan then began to recite to Fergus the list of his possessions,such as druidic weapons, and love-charms, and instruments of musicthat played without touch of human hand, and vats of ale that couldnever be emptied; and he named among other noble treasures a pair ofshoes, wearing which a man could go over or under the sea as readilyas on dry land.At the same time AEda, the dwarf and poet of Ulster, returned hale andwell from the land of Faylinn, and much did he entertain the King andall the court with tales of the smallness of the Wee Folk, and theirmarvel at his own size, and their bravery and beauty, and their marblepalaces and matchless minstrelsy.So the King, Fergus mac Leda, was well content to take a ransom,namely the magic shoes, which he desired above all the treasures ofFaylinn, and to let Iubdan go. And he gave him rich gifts, as did alsothe nobles of Ulster, and wished him blessing and victory; and Iubdanhe departed, with Bebo his wife, having first bestowed upon Fergus themagical shoes. And of him the tale hath now no more to say.But Fergus never tired of donning the shoes of Iubdan and traversingthe secret depths of the lakes and rivers of Ulster. Thereby, too, inthe end he got his death, for as the wise say that the gifts of Faerymay not be enjoyed without peril by mortal men, so in this case tooit proved. For, one day as Fergus was exploring the depths of LochRury he met the monster, namely the river-horse, which inhabited thatlake. Horrible of form it was, swelling and contracting like ablacksmith's bellows, and with eyes like torches, and glitteringtusks, and a mane of coarse hair on its crest and neck. When it sawFergus it laid back its ears, and its neck arched like a rainbow overhis head, and the vast mouth gaped to devour him. Then Fergus rosequickly to the surface and made for the land, and the beast after him,driving before it a huge wave of foam. Barely did he escape with hislife; but with the horror of the sight his features were distorted andhis mouth was twisted around to the side of his head, so that he wascalled Fergus Wry-mouth from that day forth. And the gillie that waswith him told the tale of the adventure.Now there was a law in Ireland that no man might be king who wasdisfigured by any bodily blemish. His people, therefore, lovingFergus, kept from him all knowledge of his condition, and the Queenlet all mirrors that were in the palace be put away. But one day itchanced that a bondmaid was negligent in preparing the bath, andFergus being impatient, gave her a stroke with a switch which he hadin his hand. The maid in anger turned upon him, and cried, "It wouldbetter become thee to avenge thyself on the riverhorse that hathtwisted thy mouth, than to do brave deeds on women."Fergus then bade a mirror be fetched, and when he saw his face in it,he said, "The woman spake truth; the riverhorse of Loch Rury has donethis thing."[Illustration: "Fergus goes down into the lake"]The next day Fergus put on the shoes of Iubdan and went forth to LochRury, and with him went the lords of Ulster. And when he reached themargin of the lake he drew his sword and went down into it, and soonthe waters covered him.After a while those that watched upon the bank saw a bubbling and amighty commotion in the waters, now here, now there, and waves ofbloody froth broke at their feet. At last, as they strained their eyesupon the tossing water, they saw Fergus rise to his middle from it,pale and bloody. In his right hand he waved aloft his sword, his leftwas twisted in the coarse hair of the monster's head, and they sawthat his countenance was fair and kingly as of old. "Ulstermen, I haveconquered," he cried; and as he did so he sank down again, dead withhis dead foe, into their red grave in Loch Rury.And the Ulster lords went back to Emania, sorrowful yet proud, forthey knew that a seed of honour had been sown that day in their landfrom which should spring a breed of high-hearted fighting men for manya generation to come.CHAPTER VThe Carving of mac Datho's BoarOnce upon a time there dwelt in the province of Leinster a wealthyhospitable lord named Mesroda, son of Datho. Two possessions had he;namely, a hound which could outrun every other hound and every wildbeast in Erinn, and a boar which was the finest and greatest in sizethat man had ever beheld.Now the fame of this hound was noised all about the land, and manywere the princes and lords who longed to possess it. And it came topass that Conor, King of Ulster, and Maev, Queen of Connacht, sentmessengers to mac Datho to ask him to sell them the hound for a price,and both the messengers arrived at the Dun of mac Datho on the sameday. Said the Connacht messenger, "We will give thee in exchange forthe hound six hundred milch cows, and a chariot with two horses, thebest that are to be found in Connacht, and at the end of a year thoushalt have as much again." And the messenger of King Conor said, "Wewill give no less than Connacht, and the friendship and alliance ofUlster, and that will be better for thee than the friendship ofConnacht."Then Mesroda mac Datho fell silent, and for three days he would noteat nor drink, nor could he sleep o' nights, but tossed restlessly onhis bed. His wife observed his condition, and said to him, "Thy fasthath been long, Mesroda, though good food is by thee in plenty; and atnight thou turnest thy face to the wall, and well I know thou dost notsleep. What is the cause of thy trouble?""There is a saying," replied mac Datho, "'Trust not a thrall withmoney, nor a woman with a secret.'""When should a man talk to a woman," said his wife, "but whensomething were amiss? What thy mind cannot solve perchance another'smay."Then mac Datho told his wife of the request for his hound both fromUlster and from Connacht at one and the same time, "and whichever ofthem I deny," he said, "they will harry my cattle and slay my people.""Then hear my counsel," said the woman. "Give it to both of them, andbid them come and fetch it; and if there be any harrying to be done,let them even harry each other; but in no way mayest thou keep thehound."On that, mac Datho rose up and shook himself, and called for food anddrink, and made merry with himself and his guests. Then he sentprivately for the messenger of Queen Maev, and said to him, "Long haveI doubted what to do, but now I am resolved to give the hound toConnacht. Let ye send for it on such a day with a train of your noblesor warriors and bear him forth nobly and proudly, for he is worth it;and ye shall all have drink and food and royal entertainment in myDun." So the messenger departed, well pleased.To the Ulster messenger mac Datho said, "After much perplexity I haveresolved to give my hound to Conor. Let the best of the Ulstermen cometo fetch him, and they shall be welcomed and entertained as isfitting." And for these he named the same day as he had done for theembassy from Connacht.When the appointed day came round, the flower of the fighting men oftwo provinces of Ireland were assembled before the Dun of the son ofDatho, and there were also Conor, King of Ulster, and Ailill, thehusband of Maev, Queen of Connacht. Mac Datho went forth to meet them."Welcome, warriors," he said to them, "albeit for two armies at oncewe were not prepared." Then he bade them into the Dun, and in thegreat hall they sat down. Now in this hall there were seven doors, andbetween every two doors were benches for fifty men. Not as friendsbidden to a feast did the men of Ulster and of Connacht look upon oneanother, since for three hundred years the provinces had ever been atwar."Let the great boar be killed," said mac Datho, and it was done. Forseven years had that boar been nourished on the milk of fifty cows;yet rather on venom should it have been nourished, such was themischief that was to come from the carving of it.When the boar was roasted it was brought in, and many other kinds offood as side dishes, "and if more be wanting to the feast," said macDatho, "it shall be slain for you before the morning.""The boar is good," said Conor."It is a fine boar," said Ailill; "and now, O mac Datho, how shall itbe divided among us?"There was among the Ulster company one Bricru, son of Carbad, whosedelight was in biting speeches and in fomenting strife, though hehimself was never known to draw sword in any quarrel. He now spokefrom his couch in answer to Ailill:"How should the boar be divided, O son of Datho, except by appointingto carve it him who is best in deeds of arms? Here be all the valiantmen of Ireland assembled; have none of us hit each other a blow on thenose ere now?""Good," said Ailill, "so let it be done.""We also agree," said Conor; "there are plenty of our lads in thehouse that have many a time gone round the border of the Provinces.""You will want them to-night, Conor," said an old warrior from Conladin the West. "They have often been seen on their backs on the roads ofrushy Dedah, and many a fat steer have they left with me.""It was a fat bullock thou didst have with thee once upon a day,"replied Moonremar of Ulster, "even thine own brother, and by the rushyroad of Conlad he came and went not back.""'Twas a better man than he, even Irloth, son of Fergus mac Leda, whofell by the hand of Echbael in Tara Luachra," replied Lugad ofMunster."Echbael?" cried Keltchar, son of Uthecar Hornskin of Ulster. "Is itof him ye boast, whom I myself slew and cut off his head?"And thus the heroes bandied about the tales and taunts of theirvictories, until at length Ket, son of Maga of the Connachtmen, aroseand stood over the boar and took the knife into his hand. "Now," hecried, "let one man in Ulster match his deeds with mine, or else holdye your peace and let me carve the boar!"For a while there was silence, and then Conor King of Ulster, said toLogary the Triumphant, "Stay that for me." So Logary arose and said,"Ket shall never carve the boar for all of us.""Not so fast, Logary," said Ket. "It is the custom among you Ulstermenthat when a youth first takes arms he comes to prove himself on us. Sodidst thou, Logary, and we met thee at the border. From that meeting Ihave thy chariot and horses, and thou hadst a spear through thy ribsNot thus wilt thou get the boar from me." Then Logary sat down on hisbench."Ket shall never divide that pig," spake then a tall fair-hairedwarrior from Ulster, coming down the hall. "Whom have we here?" askedKet. "A better man than thou," shouted the Ulstermen, "even Angus, sonof Lama Gabad." "Indeed?" said Ket, "and why is his father called LamaGabad [wanting a hand]?" "We know not," said they. "But I know it,"said Ket. "Once I went on a foray to the East, and was attacked by atroop, Lama Gabad among them. He flung a lance at me. I seized thesame lance and flung it back, and it shore off his hand, and it laythere on the field before him. Shall that man's son measure himselfwith me?" And Angus went to his bench and sat down."Keep up the contest," then cried Ket tauntingly, "or let me dividethe boar." "That thou shalt not," cried another Ulster warrior ofgreat stature. "And who is this?" said Ket. "Owen Mor, King of Fermag,"said the Ulstermen. "I have seen him ere now," said Ket. "I took adrove of cattle from him before his own house. He put a spear throughmy shield and I flung it back and it tore out one of his eyes, andone-eyed he is to this day." Then Owen Mor sat down."Have ye any more to contest the pig with me?" then said Ket. "Thouhast not won it yet," said Moonremar, son of Gerrkind, rising up. "Isthat Moonremar?" said Ket, "It is," they cried."It is but three days," said Ket, "since I was the last man who wonrenown of thee. Three heads of thy fighting men did I carry off fromDun Moonremar, and one of the three was the head of thy eldest son."Moonremar then sat down."Still the contest," said Ket, "or I shall carve the boar." "Contestthou shalt have," said Mend, son of Sword-heel. "Who is this?" saidKet. "'Tis Mend," cried all the Ulstermen."Shall the sons of fellows with nicknames come here to contend withme?" cried Ket. "I was the priest who christened thy father that name.'Twas I who cut the heel off him, so that off he went with only one.What brings the son of that man to contend with me?" Mend then satdown in his seat."Come to the contest," said Ket, "or I shall begin to carve." Thenarose from the Ulstermen a huge grey and terrible warrior. "Who isthis?" asked Ket. '"Tis Keltcar, son of Uthecar," cried they all."Wait awhile, Keltcar," said Ket, "do not pound me to pieces just yet.Once, O Keltcar, I made a foray on thee and came in front of Dun. Allthy folk attacked me, and thou amongst them. In a narrow pass wefought, and thou didst fling a spear at me and I at thee, but my spearwent through thy loins and thou hast never been the better of itsince." Then Keltcar sat down in his seat."Who else comes to the contest," cried Ket "or shall I at last dividethe pig?" Up rose then the son of King Conor, named Cuscrid theStammerer "Whom have we here?" said Ket. "'Tis Cuscrid son of Conor,"cried they all. "He has the stuff of a king in him," said Ket. "Nothanks to thee for that," said the youth."Well, then," said Ket, "thou madest thy first foray against usConnachtmen, and on the border of the Provinces we met thee. A thirdof thy people, thou didst leave behind thee, and came away with myspear through thy throat, so that thou canst not speak rightly eversince, for the sinews of thy throat were severed. And hence is Cuscridthe Stammerer thy byname ever since."So thus Ket laid shame and defeat on the whole Province of Ulster, norwas there any other warrior in the hall found to contend with him.[Illustration: "A mighty shout of exultation arose from theUlstermen"]Then Ket stood up triumphing, and took the knife in his hand andprepared to carve the boar when a noise and trampling were heard atthe great door of the hall, and a mighty shout of exultation arosefrom the Ulstermen. When the press parted, Ket saw coming up thecentre of the hall Conall of the Victories, and Conor the King dashedthe helmet from his head and sprang up for joy."Glad we are," cried Conall, "that all is ready for feast; and who iscarving the boar for us?""Ket, son of Maga," replied they, "for none could contest the place ofhonour with him.""Is that so, Ket?" says Conall Cearnach."Even so," replied Ket. "And now welcome to thee, O Conall, thou ofthe iron heart and fiery blood; keen as the glitter of ice,ever-victorious chieftain; hail mighty son of Finnchoom!"And Conall said, "Hail to thee, Ket, flower of heroes, lord ofchariots, a raging sea in battle; a strong, majestic bull; hail, sonof Maga!""And now," went on Conall, "rise up from the boar and give me place.""Why so?" replied Ket."Dost thou seek a contest from me?" said Conall; "verily thou shalthave it. By the gods of my nation I swear that since I first tookweapons in my hand I have never passed one day that I did not slay aConnachtman, nor one night that I did not make a foray on them, norhave I ever slept but I had the head of a Connachtman under my knee.""I confess," then, said Ket, "that thou art a better man than I, and Iyield thee the boar. But if Anluan my brother were here, he wouldmatch thee deed for deed, and sorrow and shame it is that he is not.""Anluan is here," shouted Conall, and with that he drew from hisgirdle the head of Anluan and dashed it in the face of Ket.Then all sprang to their feet and a wild shouting and tumult arose,and the swords flew out of themselves, and battle raged in the hall ofmac Datho. Soon the hosts burst out through the doors of the Dun andsmote and slew each other in the open field, until the Connacht hostwere put to flight. The hound of mac Datho pursued them along with theUlstermen, and it came up with the chariot in which King Ailill wasdriving, and seized the pole of the chariot, but the charioteer dealtit a blow that cut off its head. When Ailill drew rein they found thehound's head still clinging to the pole, whence that place is calledIbar Cinn Chon, or the Yew Tree of the Hound's Head.Now when Conor pursued hard upon King Ailill, Ferloga, the charioteerof Ailill, lighted down and hid himself in the heather; and as Conordrove past, Ferloga leaped up behind him in the chariot and grippedhim by the throat."What will thou have of me?" said Conor."Give over the pursuit," said Ferloga, "and take me with thee toEmania,[19] and let the maidens of Emania so long as I am there singa serenade before my dwelling every night."   [19] The ancient royal residence of Ulster, near to the present   town of Armagh."Granted," said Conor. So he took Ferloga with him to Emania, and atthe end of a year sent him back to Connacht, escorting him as far asto Athlone; and Ferloga had from the King of Ulster two noble horseswith golden bridles, but the serenade from the maidens of Ulster hedid not get, though he got the horses instead. And thus ends the taleof the contention between Ulster and Connacht over the Carving of macDatho's Boar.CHAPTER VIThe Vengeance of MesgedraAtharna the Bard, surnamed the Extortionate, was the chief poet andsatirist of Ulster in the reign of Conor mac Nessa. Greed andarrogance were in his heart and poison on his tongue, and the kingsand lords of whom he asked rewards for his poems dared not refuse himaught, partly because of the poisonous satires and lampoons which hewould otherwise make upon them for their niggardliness, and partly forthat in Ireland at that day it was deemed shameful to refuse to a bardwhatsoever he might ask. Once it was said that he asked of a sub-king,namely Eochy mac Luchta, who was famed for hospitality and generosity,the single thing that Eochy would have been grieved to give, namelyhis eye, and Eochy had but one eye. But the King plucked it out by theroots and gave it to him; and Atharna went away disappointed, for hehad looked that Eochy would ransom his eye at a great price.Now Conor mac Nessa, King of Ulster, and all the Ulster lords, havinggrown very powerful and haughty, became ill neighbours to all theother kingdoms in Ireland. On fertile Leinster above all they fixedtheir eyes, and sought for an opportunity to attack and plunder theprovince. Conor resolved at last to move Atharna to go to the King ofLeinster, in the hope that he himself might be rid of Atharna, by theKing of Leinster killing him for his insolence and his exactions, andthat he might avenge the death of his bard by the invasion ofLeinster.Atharna therefore set out for Leinster accompanied by his train ofpoets and harpers and gillies and arrived at the great Dun of Mesgedrathe King, at Naas in Kildare. Here he dwelt for twelve months wastingthe substance of the Leinstermen and in the end when he was minded toreturn to Ulster he went before the King Mesgedra and the lords ofLeinster and demanded his poet's fee."What is thy demand, Atharna?" asked Mesgedra."So many cattle and so many sheep," answered Atharna, "and store ofgold and raiment, and of the fairest dames and maidens of Leinsterforty-five, to grind at my querns in Dun Atharna.""It shall be granted thee," said the King. Then Atharna feared somemischief, for the King and the nobles of Leinster had not seemed likemen on whom shameful conditions are laid, nor had they offered toransom their women. Atharna therefore judged that the Leinstermenmight fall upon him to recover their booty when he was once beyond theborder, for within their own borders they might not affront a guest.He sent, therefore, a swift messenger to Conor mac Nessa, bidding himcome with a strong escort as quickly as he might, to meet Atharna'sband on the marches of Leinster, and convey him safely home.Atharna then departed from Naas with a great herd of sheep and cattleand other spoils, and with thrice fifteen of the noble women ofLeinster. He went leisurely, meaning to strike the highroad to Emaniafrom Dublin; but when he came thither the Liffey was swollen withrain, and the ford at Dublin might not be crossed. He caused,therefore, many great hurdles to be made, and these were set in theriver, and over them a causeway of boughs was laid, so that hiscattle and spoils came safely across. Hence is the town of that placecalled to this day in Gaelic the City of the Hurdle Ford.On the next day Conor and the Ulstermen met him, but a great force ofthe men of Leinster was also marching from Naas to the border, torecover their womenfolk, even as Atharna had expected. The Leinstermenthen broke the battle on the company from Ulster, and defeated them,driving them with the cows of Atharna on to the sea cape of Ben Edar(Howth), but they recovered the women. On Ben Edar did King Conor withthe remnant of his troop then fortify themselves, making a great fosseacross the neck of land by which Ben Edar is joined to the mainland,and here they were besieged, with hard fighting by day and night,expecting that help should come to them from Ulster, whither they hadsent messengers to tell of their distress.Now Conall of the Victories was left behind to rule in Emania whenConor set forth to Leinster, and he now, on hearing how the King wasbeset, assembled a great host and marched down to Ben Edar. Here heattacked the host of Leinster, and a great battle was fought, manybeing slain on both sides, and the King of Leinster, Mesgedra, losthis left hand in the fight. In the end the men of Leinster wererouted, and fled, and Mesgedra drove in his chariot past the City ofthe Hurdle Ford and Naas to the fords of Liffey at Clane. Here therewas a sacred oak tree where druid rites and worship were performed,and that oak tree was sanctuary, so that within its shadow, guarded bymighty spells, no man might be slain by his enemy.Now Conall Cearnach had followed hard on the track of Mesgedra, andwhen he found him beneath the oak, he drove his chariot round andround the circuit of the sanctuary, bidding Mesgedra come forth and dobattle with him, or be counted a dastard among the kings of Erinn. ButMesgedra said, "Is it the fashion of the champions of Ulster tochallenge one-armed men to battle?"Then Conall let his charioteer bind one of his arms to his side, andagain he taunted Mesgedra and bade him come forth.Mesgedra then drew sword, and between him and Conall there was afierce fight until the Liffey was reddened with their blood. At last,by a chance blow of the sword of Mesgedra, the bonds of Conall's leftarm were severed."On thy head be it," said Conall, "if thou release me again."Then he caused his arm to be bound up once more, and again they met,sword to sword, and again in the fury of the fight Mesgedra cut thethongs that bound Conall's arm. "The gods themselves have doomedthee," shouted Conall then, and he rushed upon Mesgedra and in nolong time he wounded him to death."Take my head," said Mesgedra then, "and add my glory to thy glory,but be well assured this wrong shall yet be avenged by me uponUlster," and he died.Then Conall cut off the head of Mesgedra and put it in his chariot,and took also the chariot of Mesgedra and fared northwards. Ere longhe met a chariot and fifty women accompanying it. In it was Buan theQueen, wife of Mesgedra, returning from a visit to Meath."Who art thou, woman?" said Conall."I am Buan, wife of Mesgedra the King.""Thou art to come with me," then said Conall."Who hath commanded this?" said Buan."Mesgedra the King," said Conall."By what token dost thou lay these commands upon me?""Behold his chariot and his horses," said Conall."He gives rich gifts to many a man," answered the Queen.Then Conall showed her the head of her husband."This is my token," said he."It is enough," said Buan. "But give me leave to bewail him ere I gointo captivity."Then Buan rose up in her chariot and raised for Mesgedra a keen ofsorrow so loud and piercing that her heart broke with it, and she fellbackwards on the road and died.Conall Cearnach then buried her there, and laid the head of herhusband by her side; and the fair hazel tree that grew from her graveby the fords of Clane was called Coll Buana, or the Hazel Tree ofBuan.But ere Conall buried the head of Mesgedra he caused the brain to betaken out and mixed with lime to make a bullet for a sling, for so itwas customary to do when a great warrior had been killed; and thebrain-balls thus made were accounted to be the deadliest of missiles.So when Leinster had been harried and plundered and its king and queenthus slain, the Ulstermen drew northward again, and the brain-ball waslaid up in the Dun of King Conor at Emania.Years afterwards it happened that the Wolf of Connacht, namely Ket,son of Maga, came disguised within the borders of Ulster in search ofprey, and he entered the palace precincts of Conor in Emania. There hesaw two jesters of the King, who had gotten the brain-ball from theshelf where it lay, and were rolling it about the courtyard. Ket knewit for what it was, and put it out of sight of the jesters and took itaway with him while they made search for it. Thenceforth Ket carriedit ever about with him in his girdle, hoping that he might yet use itto destroy some great warrior among the Ulstermen.One day thereafter Ket made a foray on the men of Ross, and carriedaway a spoil of cattle. The host of Ulster and King Conor with themovertook him as he went homeward. The men of Connacht had alsomustered to the help of Ket, and both sides made them ready forbattle.Now a river, namely Brosna, ran between them, and on a hill at oneside of this were assembled a number of the noble women of Connacht,who desired greatly to look on the far-famed Ultonian warriors, andabove all on Conor the King, whose presence was said to be royal andstately beyond any man that was then living in Erinn. Among thebushes, close to the women, Ket hid himself, and lay still butwatchful.Now Conor, seeing none but womenfolk close to him at this point, andbeing willing to show them his splendour, drew near to the bank on hisside of the stream. Then Ket leaped up, whirling his sling, and thebullet hummed across the river and smote King Conor on the temple. Andhis men carried him off for dead, and the men of Connacht broke thebattle on the Ulstermen, slaying many, and driving the rest of themback to their own place. This battle was thenceforth called the Battleof the Ford of the Sling-cast, or Athnurchar; and so the place iscalled to this day.When Conor was brought home to Emania his chief physician, Fingen,found the ball half buried in his temple. "If the ball be taken out,"said Fingen, "he will die; if it remain he will live, but he will bearthe blemish of it.""Let him bear the blemish," said the Ulster lords, "that is a smallmatter compared with the death of Conor."Then Fingen stitched the wound over with a thread of gold, for Conorhad curling golden hair, and bade him keep himself from all violentmovements and from all vehement passions, and not to ride onhorseback, and he would do well.After that Conor lived for seven years, and he went not to war duringthat time, and all cause of passion was kept far from him. Then oneday at broad noon the sky darkened, and the gloom of night seemed tospread over the world, and all the people feared, and looked for somecalamity. Conor called to him his chief druid, namely Bacarach, andinquired of him as to the cause of the gloom.The druid then went with Conor into a sacred grove of oaks andperformed the rites of divination, and in a trance he spoke to Conor,saying, "I see a hill near a great city, and three high crosses on it.To one of them is nailed the form of a young man who is like unto oneof the Immortals. Round him stand soldiers with tall spears, and agreat crowd waiting to see him die.""Is he, then, a malefactor?""Nay," said the druid, "but holiness, innocence, and truth have cometo earth in him, and for this cause have the druids of his land doomedhim to die, for his teaching was not as theirs. And the heavens aredarkened for wrath and sorrow at the sight."Then Conor leaped up in a fury, crying, "They shall not slay him,they shall not slay him! Would I were there with the host of Ulster,and thus would I scatter his foes"; and with that he snatched hissword and began striking at the trees that stood thickly about him inthe druid grove. Then with the heat of his passion the sling-ballburst from his head, and he fell to the ground and died.Thus was fulfilled the vengeance of Mesgedra upon Conor mac Nessa,King of Ulster.CHAPTER VIIThe Story of Etain and MidirOnce upon a time there was a High King of the Milesian race in Irelandnamed Eochy Airem, whose power and splendour were very great, and allthe sub-Kings, namely, Conor of Ulster, and Mesgedra of Leinster, andCuroi of Munster, and Ailill and Maev of Connacht, were obedient tohim. But he was without a wife; and for this reason the sub-Kings andPrinces of Ireland would not come to his festivals at Tara, "for,"said they, "there is no noble in Ireland who is a wifeless man, and aKing is no king without a queen." And they would not bring their ownwives to Tara without a queen there to welcome them, nor would theycome themselves and leave their womenfolk at home.So Eochy bade search be made through all the boundaries of Ireland fora maiden meet to be wife of the High King. And in time his messengerscame back and said that they had found in Ulster, by the Bay ofCichmany, the fairest and most accomplished maiden in Ireland, and hername was Etain, daughter of Etar, lord of the territory called Echrad.So Eochy, when he had heard their report, went forth to woo themaiden.When he drew near his journey's end he passed by a certain spring ofpure water where it chanced that Etain and her maids had come downthat she might wash her hair. She held in her hand a comb of silverinlaid with gold, and before her was a bason of silver chased withfigures of birds, and around the rim of it red carbuncles were set.Her mantle was purple with a fringe of silver, and it was fastenedwith a broad golden brooch. She wore also a tunic of green silk, stiffwith embroidery of gold that glittered in the sun. Her hair before sheloosed it was done in two mighty tresses, yellow like the flower ofthe waterflag, each tress being plaited in four strands, and at theend of each strand a little golden ball. When she laid aside hermantle her arms came through the armholes of her tunic, white as thesnow of a single night, and her cheeks were ruddy as the foxglove.Even and small were her teeth, as if a shower of pearls had fallen inher mouth. Her eyes were hyacinth-blue, her lips scarlet as therowan-berry, her shoulders round and white, her fingers were long andher nails smooth and pink. Her feet also were slim, and white assea-foam. The radiance of the moon was in her face, pride in herbrows, the light of wooing in her eyes. Of her it was said that therewas no beauty among women compared with Etain's beauty, no sweetnesscompared with the sweetness of Etain.When the King saw her his heart burned with love for her, and when hehad speech with her he besought her to be his bride. And she consentedto that, and said, "Many have wooed me, O King, but I would none ofthem, for since I was a little child I have loved thee, for the hightales that I heard of thee and of thy glory." And Eochy said, "Thinealone will I be if thou wilt have me." So the King paid a greatbride-price for her, and bore her away to Tara, and there they werewedded, and all men welcomed and honoured the Queen. Nor had she dweltlong in Tara before the enchantment of her beauty and her grace hadworked upon the hearts of all about her, so that the man to whom shespoke grew pale at the womanly sweetness of her voice, and felthimself a king for that day. All fair things and bright she loved,such as racing steeds and shining raiment, and the sight of Eochy'swarriors with their silken banners and shields decorated with richornament in red and blue. And she would have all about her happy andjoyous, and she gave freely of her treasure, and of her smiles andloving words, if she might see the light of joy on the faces of men,but from pain or sadness that might not be cured she would turn away.In one thing only was sadness endurable to her and that was in hermusic, for when she sang or touched the harp all hearts were piercedwith longing for they knew not what, and all eyes shed tears save hersalone, who looked as though she beheld, far from earth, some land morefair than words of man can tell; and all the wonder of that land andall its immeasurable distance were in her song.Now Eochy the King had a brother whose name was Ailill Anglounach, orAilill of the Single Stain, for one dark spot only was on his life,and it is of this that the story now shall tell. One day, when he hadcome from his own Dun to the yearly Assembly in the great Hall ofTara, he ate not at the banquet but gazed as it were at something afaroff, and his wife said to him, "Why dost thou gaze so, Ailill; so domen look who are smitten with love?" Ailill was wroth with himself andturned his eyes away, but he said nothing, for that on which he gazedwas the face of Etain.After that Assembly was over Ailill knew that the torment of love hadseized him for his brother's wife, and he was sorely shamed andwrathful, and the secret strife in his mind between his honour and thefierce and pitiless love that possessed him brought him into a soresickness. And he went home to his Dun in Tethba and there lay ill fora year. Then Eochy the King went to see him, and came near him andlaid his hand on his breast, and Ailill heaved a bitter sigh. Eochyasked, "Why art thou not better of this sickness, how goes it withthee now?" "By my word," said Ailill, "no better, but worse each dayand night." "What ails thee, then?" asked Eochy. Ailill said, "Verily,I know not." Then Eochy bade summon his chief physician, who mightdiscover the cause of his brother's malady, for Ailill was wasting todeath.So Fachtna the chief physician came and he laid his hand upon Ailill,and Ailill sighed. Then Fachtna said, "This is no bodily disease, buteither Ailill suffers from the pangs of envy or from the torment oflove." But Ailill was full of shame and he would not tell what ailedhim, and Fachtna went away.After this the time came that Eochy the High King should make a royalprogress throughout his realm of Ireland, but Etain he left behind atTara. Before he departed he charged her saying, "Do thou be gentle andkind to my brother Ailill while he lives, and should he die, let hisburial mound be heaped over him, and a pillar stone set up above it,and his name written thereon in letters of Ogham." Then the King tookleave of Ailill and looked to see him again on earth no more.After a while Etain bethought her and said, "Let us go to see how itfares with Ailill." So she went to where he lay in his Dun at Tethba.And seeing him wasted and pale she was moved with pity and distressand said,"What ails thee, young man? Long thou hast lain prostrate, in fairweather and in foul, thou who wert wont to be so swift and strong?"And Ailill said,"Truly, I have a cause for my suffering; and I cannot eat, nor listento the music makers; my affliction is very sore."Then said Etain,"Though I am a woman I am wise in many a thing; tell me what ails theeand thy healing shall be done."Ailill replied,"Blessing be with thee, O fair one; I am not worthy of thy speech; Iam torn by the contention of body and of soul."Then Etain deemed that she knew somewhat of his trouble, and she said,"If thy heart is set on any of the white maidens that are myhandmaids, tell me of it, and I shall court her for thee and she shallcome to thee," and then Ailill cried out,"Love indeed, O Queen, hath brought me low. It is a plague nearer thanthe skin, it overwhelms my soul as an earthquake, it is farther thanthe height of the sky, and harder to win than the treasures of theFairy Folk. If I contend with it, it is like a combat with a spectre;if I fly to the ends of the earth from it, it is there; if I seek toseize it, it is a passion for an echo. It is thou, O my love, who hastbrought me to this, and thou alone canst heal me, or I shall neverrise again."Then Etain went away and left him. But still in her palace in Tara shewas haunted by his passion and his misery, and, though she loved himnot, she could not endure his pain, nor the triumph of grim death overhis youth and beauty. So at last she went to him again and said, "Ifit lies with me, Ailill, to heal thee of thy sickness, I may not letthee die." And she made a tryst to meet him on the morrow at a houseof Ailill's between Dun Tethba and Tara, "but be it not at Tara," shesaid, "for that is the palace of the High King."All that night Ailill lay awake with the thought of his tryst withEtain. But on the morrow morn a heaviness came upon his eyelids, and adruid sleep overcame him, and there all day he lay buried in slumbersfrom which none could wake him, until the time of his meeting withEtain was overpast.But Etain, when she had come to the place of the tryst, looked out,and behold, a youth having the appearance and the garb of Ailill wasapproaching from Tethba. He entered the bower where she was; but nolover did she there meet, but only a sick and sorrowful man who spakecoldly to her and lamented the sufferings of his malady, and after ashort time he went away.Next day Etain went to see Ailill and to hear how he did. And Ailillentreated her forgiveness that he had not kept his tryst, "for," saidhe, "a druid slumber descended upon me, and I lay as one dead frommorn till eve. And morever," he added, "it seems as if the strangepassion that has befallen me were washed away in that slumber, fornow, Etain, I love thee no more but as my Queen and my sister, and Iam recovered as if from an evil dream." Then Etain knew that powersnot of earth were mingling in her fate, and she pondered much of thesethings, and grew less lighthearted than of old. And when the King cameback, he rejoiced to find his brother whole and sound and merry, asAilill had ever been, and he praised Etain for her gentleness andcare.Now after a time as Etain was by herself in her sunny bower she wasaware of a man standing by her, whom she had never seen before. Younghe was, and grey-eyed, with curling golden hair, and in his hand hebore two spears. His mantle was of crimson silk, his tunic of saffron,and a golden helmet was on his head. And as she gazed upon him,"Etain," he said, "the time is come for thee to return; we have missedthee and sorrowed for thee long enough in the Land of Youth." Etainsaid, "Of what land dost thou speak?" Then he chanted to her a song:--  "Come with me, Etain, O come away,     To that oversea land of mine!   Where music haunts the happy day,     And rivers run with wine;   Where folk are careless, and young, and gay,     And none saith 'mine' or 'thine.'   "Golden curls on the proud young head,     And pearls in the tender mouth;   Manhood, womanhood, white and red,     And love that grows not loth   When all the world's desires are dead,     And all the dreams of youth.   "Away from the cloud of Adam's sin!     Away from grief and care!   This flowery land thou dwellest in     Seems rude to us, and bare;   For the naked strand of the Happy Land     Is twenty times as fair."When Etain heard this she stood motionless and as one that dreamsawake, for it seemed to her as if she must follow that musicwhithersoever it went on earth or beyond the earth. But at lastremembrance came upon her and she said to the stranger, "Who art thou,that I, the High King's wife, should follow a nameless man and betraymy troth?" And he said, "Thy troth was due to me before it was due tohim, and, moreover, were it not for me thou hadst broken it already. Iam Midir the Proud, a prince among the people of Dana, and thyhusband, Etain. Thus it was, that when I took thee to wife in the Landof Youth, the jealousy of thy rival, Fuamnach, was awakened; andhaving decoyed me from home by a false report, she changed thee bymagical arts into a butterfly, and then contrived a mighty tempestthat drove thee abroad. Seven years wast thou borne hither and thitheron the blast till chance blew thee into the fairy palace of Angus mykinsman, by the waters of the Boyne. But Angus knew thee, for theFairy Folk may not disguise themselves from each other, and he builtfor thee a magical sunny bower with open windows, through which thoumightest pass, and about it were all manner of blossoming herbs andshrubs, and on the odour and honey of these thou didst live and growfair and well nourished. But in the end Fuamnach got tidings of thee,and again the druid tempest descended and blew thee forth for anotherseven years of wandering and woe. Then it chanced that thou wert blownthrough the roof-window of the Dun of Etar by the Bay of Cichmany, andfell into the goblet from which his wife was drinking, and thee shedrank down with that draught of ale. And in due time thou wast bornagain in the guise of a mortal maid and daughter to Etar the Warrior.But thou art no mortal, nor of mortal kin, for it is one thousand andtwelve years from the time when thou wast born in Fairy Land tillEtar's wife bore thee as a child on earth."Then Etain was bewildered, and her mind ran back on many ahalf-forgotten thing and she gazed as into a gulf of visions, full ofdim shapes, strange and glorious. And Midir as she looked at him againseemed transfigured, taller and mightier than before, and a lightflame flickered from his helmet's crest and moved like wings about hisshoulders.But at last she said, "I know not what thou sayest if it be truth ornot, but this I know, that I am the wife of the High King and I willnot break my troth." "It were broken already," said Midir, "but forme, for I it was who laid a druidic sleep on Ailill, and it was I whocame to thee in his shape that thy honour might not be stained." Etainsaid, "I learned then that honour is more than life." "But if Eochythe High King consent to let thee go," said Midir, "wilt thou thencome with me to my land and thine?" "In that case," said Etain "Iwill go."And the time went by, and Etain abode in Tara, and the High King didjustice and made war and held the great Assembly as he was used. Butone day in summer Eochy arose very early to breathe the morning air,and he stood by himself leaning on the rampart of his great Dun, andlooking over the flowery plain of Bregia. And as he thus gazed he wasaware of a young warrior standing by his side. Grey-eyed the youthwas, and golden-haired, and he was splendidly armed and apparelled asbeseemed the lord of a great clan of the Gael. Eochy bade him welcomecourteously, and asked him of the cause of his coming. "I am come," hesaid, "to play a game of chess with thee, O King, for thou artrenowned for thy skill in that game, and to test that skill am I come.And my name is Midir, of the People of Dana, whom they have called TheProud.""Willingly," said the King; "but I have here no chessboard, and mineis in the chamber where the Queen is sleeping.""That is easily remedied," said Midir, and he drew from his cloak afolding chessboard whose squares were alternate gold and silver. Froma men-bag made of brazen chainwork he drew out a set of men adornedwith flashing jewels, and he set them in array."I will not play," then said Eochy, "unless we play for a stake.""For what stake shall we play, then?" said Midir."I care not," said Eochy; "but do thou perform tasks for me if I winand I shall bestow of my treasures upon thee if I lose."So they played a game, and Eochy won. Then Eochy bade Midir clear theplains of Meath about Tara from rocks and stones, and Midir brought atnight a great host of the Fairy Folk, and it was done. And again heplayed with Eochy, and again he lost, and this time he cut down theforest of Breg. The third time Midir lost again, and his task was tobuild a causeway across the moor of Lamrach. Now at night, while Midirand the fairy host were labouring at the causeway and their oxendrawing to it innumerable loads of earth and gravel, the steward ofEochy stole out and hid himself to watch them, for it was aprohibition to see them at work. And he observed that the fairy oxenwere not harnessed with a thong across their foreheads, that the pullmight be upon their brows and necks, as was the manner with the Gael,but with yokes upon their shoulders. This he reported to Eochy, whofound it good; and he ordered that henceforth the children of the Gaelshould harness their plough-oxen with the yoke upon their shoulders;and so it was done from that day forth. Hence Eochy got his name of_Airem_, or "The Ploughman," for he was the first of the Gael to putthe yoke upon the shoulder of the ox.But it was said that because the Fairy Folk were watched as they madethat noble causeway, there came a breach in it at one place which nonecould ever rightly mend.When all their works were accomplished, Midir came again to Eochy, andthis time he bore a dark and fierce countenance and was high girt asfor war. And the King welcomed him, and Midir said, "Thou hast treatedme hardly and put slavish tasks upon me. All that seemed good to theehave I done, but now I am moved with anger against thee.""I return not anger for anger," said Eochy; "say what satisfaction Ican make thee.""Let us once more play at chess," said Midir."Good," said Eochy, "and what stake wilt thou have now?""The stake to be whatever the winner shall demand," said Midir.Then they played for the fourth time and Eochy lost."Thou hast won the game," said he."I had won long ago had I chosen," said Midir."What dost thou demand of me?" said Eochy."To hold Etain in my arms and obtain a kiss from her," replied Midir.The King was silent for a while and after that he said, "Come back inone month from this day and the stake which I have lost shall bepaid."But Eochy summoned together all the host of the heroes of the Gael,and they surrounded Tara, ring within ring; and the King himself andEtain were in the palace, with the outer court of it shut and locked.For they looked that Midir should come with a great host of the Danaanfolk to carry off the Queen. And on the appointed day, as the kingssat at meat, Etain and her handmaids were dispensing the wine to themas was wont. Then suddenly as they feasted and talked, behold, Midir,stood in the midst of them. If he was fair and noble to look on as hehad appeared before to the King and to Etain, he was fairer now, forthe splendour of the Immortals clothed him, and his jewels flamed ashe moved like eyes of living light. And all the kings and lords andchampions who were present gazed on him in amazement and were silent,as the King arose and gave him welcome."Thou hast received me as I expected to be received," said Midir,"and now let thy debt be paid, since I for my part faithfullyperformed all that I undertook.""I must consider the matter yet longer," said Eochy."Thou hast promised Etain's very self to me," said Midir; "that iswhat hath come from thee." And when she heard that word Etain blushedfor shame."Blush not," said Midir, "for all the treasures of the Land of Youthhave not availed to win thee from Eochy, and it is not of thine ownwill that thou art won, but because the time is come to return to thykin."Then said Eochy, "I have not promised Etain's self to thee, but totake her in thine arms and kiss her, and now do so if thou wilt."[Illustration: "They rose up in the air"]Then Midir took his weapons in his left hand and placed his rightaround Etain, and when he did so they rose up in the air over theheads of the host, and passed through a roof-window in the palace.Then all rose up, tumultuous and angry, and rushed out of doors, butnothing could they see save two white swans that circled high in airaround the Hill of Tara, and then flew southwards and away towardsthe fairy mountain of Slievenamon. And thus Etain the immortalrejoined the Immortals; but a daughter of Etain and of Eochy, who wasanother Etain in name and in beauty, became in due time a wife, andmother of kings.CHAPTER VIIIHow Ethne Quitted FairylandBy the banks of the River Boyne, where rises the great Fairy Mound nowcalled Newgrange, there stood long ago the shining Palace of a princeof the People of Dana, named Angus. Of him it is that the lines arewritten--  "By the dark rolling waters of the Boyne   Where Angus Og magnificently dwells."When the Milesian race invaded Ireland, and after long fightingsubdued the Danaans in spite of all their enchantments and all theirvalour, the Danaans wrought for themselves certain charms by whichthey and all their possessions became invisible to mortals, and thusthey continued to lead their old joyous life in the holy places of theland, and their palaces and dancing-places and folk-motes seem to thehuman eye to be merely a green mound or rath, or a lonely hillside, ora ruined shrine with nettles and foxgloves growing up among its brokenmasonry.Now, after Angus and his folk had thus retreated behind the veil ofinvisibility, it happened that the steward of his palace had adaughter born to him whose name was Ethne. On the same day Fand, thewife of Mananan the Sea God, bore him a daughter, and since Angus wasa friend of Mananan and much beloved by him, the child of the Sea Godwas sent to Brugh na Boyna, the noble dwelling-place of Angus, to befostered and brought up, as the custom was. And Ethne became thehandmaid of the young princess of the sea.In time Ethne grew into a fair and stately maiden Now in the Brugh ofAngus there were two magical treasures, namely, an ale-vat which couldnever be emptied, and two swine whereof one was ever roasted and readyto be eaten while the other lived, and thus they were, day and dayabout. There was therefore always a store of food of faery, chargedwith magical spells, by eating of which one could never grow old ordie. It came to be noticed that after Ethne had grown up she never ateor drank of the fairy food, or of any other, yet she continued to seemhealthy and well-nourished. This was reported to Angus, and by him toMananan, and Mananan by his wisdom discovered the cause of it. One ofthe lords of the Danaans, happening to be on a visit with Angus, wasrendered distraught by the maiden's beauty, and one day he laid handsupon her and strove to carry her away to his own dwelling. Ethneescaped from him, but the blaze of resentment at the insult that litup in her soul consumed in her the fairy nature, that knows not ofgood or evil, and the nature of the children of Adam took its place.Thenceforth she ate not of the fairy food, which is prohibited to man,and she was nourished miraculously by the will of the One God. Butafter a time it chanced that Mananan and Angus brought from the HolyLand two cows whose milk could never run dry. In this milk there wasnothing of the fairy spell, and Ethne lived upon it many long years,milking the cows herself, nor did her youth and beauty suffer anychange.Now it happened that on one very hot day the daughter of Mananan wentdown to bathe in the waters of the Boyne, and Ethne and her othermaidens along with her. After they had refreshed themselves in thecool, amber-coloured water, they arrayed themselves in their silkenrobes and trooped back to the Brugh again; but ere they entered it,they discovered that Ethne was not among them.So they went back, scattering themselves along the bank and searchingin every quiet pool of the river and in every dark recess among thegreat trees that bordered it, for Ethne was dearly loved by all ofthem; but neither trace nor tidings of her could they find, and theywent sorrowfully home without her, to tell the tale to Angus and toher father.What had befallen Ethne was this. In taking off her garments by theriverside she had mislaid her fairy charm, and was become as a mortalmaid. Nothing could she now see of her companions, and all around wasstrange to her. The fairy track that had led to the riverside wasovergrown with briars, the palace of Angus was but a wooded hill. Sheknew not where she was, and pierced with sudden terror she fled wildlyaway, seeking for the familiar places that she had known in the fairylife, but which were now behind the Veil. At length she came to a highwall wherein was a wicket gate, and through it she saw a garden fullof sweet herbs and flowers, which surrounded a steep-roofed buildingof stone. In the garden she saw a man in a long brown robe tied abouthis waist with a cord. He smiled at her and beckoned her to come inwithout fear. He was a monk of the holy Patrick, and the house was aconvent church.When the monk had heard her tale, he marvelled greatly and brought herto St Patrick himself, who instructed her in the Faith, and shebelieved and was baptized.[Illustration: "She heard her own name called again and again"]But not long thereafter, as she was praying in the church by theBoyne, the sky darkened and she heard a sound without like the rushingof a great wind, and mingled in it were cries and lamentations, andher own name called again and again in a multitude of voices, thin andfaint as the crying of curlews upon the moor. She sprang up and gazedaround, calling in return, but nothing could she see, and at last thestorm of cries died away, and everything was still again around thechurch except the singing voice of Boyne and the humming of the gardenbees.Then Ethne sank down swooning, and the monks bore her out into theair, and it was long until her heart beat and her eyes unclosed again.In that hour she fell into a sickness from which she never recovered.In no long time she died with her head upon the breast of the holyPatrick, and she was buried in the church where she had first beenreceived by the monk; and the church was called Killethne, or theChurch of Ethne, from that day forward until now.THE HIGH DEEDS OF FINNCHAPTER IXThe Boyhood of Finn mac CumhalIn Ireland long ago, centuries before the English appeared in thatcountry, there were kings and chiefs, lawyers and merchants, men ofthe sword and men of the book, men who tilled their own ground and menwho tilled the ground of others, just as there are now. But there wasalso, as ancient poets and historians tell us, a great company orbrotherhood of men who were bound to no fixed calling, unless it wasto fight for the High King of Ireland whenever foes threatened himfrom within the kingdom or without it. This company was called theFianna of Erinn. They were mighty hunters and warriors, and thoughthey had great possessions in land, and rich robes, and goldornaments, and weapons wrought with beautiful chasing and withcoloured enamels, they lived mostly a free out-door life in the lighthunting-booths which they made in the woods where the deer and thewolf ranged. There were then vast forests in Ireland, which are allgone now, and there were also, as there still are, many great andbeautiful lakes and rivers, swarming with fish and water-fowl. In theforests and on the mountain sides roamed the wild boar and the wolf,and great herds of deer, some of giant size, whose enormous antlersare sometimes found when bogs are being drained. The Fianna chasedthese and the wolves with great dogs, whose courage and strength andbeauty were famous throughout Europe, and which they prized and lovedabove all things. To the present day in Ireland there still remainsome of this breed of Irish hounds, but the giant deer and the wolfare gone, and the Fianna of Erinn live only in the ancient books thatwere written of them, and in the tales that are still told of them inthe winter evenings by the Irish peasant's fireside.The Fianna were under the rule of one great captain or chief, and atthe time I tell of his name was Cumhal, son of Trenmor. Now a tribe orfamily of the Fianna named the Clan Morna, or Sons of Morna, rose inrebellion against Cumhal, for they were jealous and greedy of hispower and glory, and sought to have the captaincy for themselves. Theydefeated and slew him at the battle of Cnucha, which is now calledCastleknock, near the City of the Hurdle Ford, which is the name thatDublin still bears in the Irish tongue. Goll, son of Morna, slewCumhal, and they spoiled him of the Treasure Bag of the Fianna, whichwas a bag made of a crane's skin and having in it jewels of greatprice, and magic weapons, and strange things that had come down fromfar-off days when the Fairy Folk and mortal men battled for thelordship of Ireland. The Bag with its treasures was given to Lia, thechief of Luachar in Connacht, who had the keeping of it before, for hewas the treasurer of Cumhal, and he was the first man who had woundedCumhal in the battle when he fell.Cumhal's wife was named Murna, and she bore him two sons. The elderwas named Tulcha, and he fled from the country for fear of Goll andtook service with the King of Scotland. The younger was born afterCumhal's death, and his name was called Demna. And because his motherfeared that the sons of Morna would find him out and kill him, shegave him to a Druidess and another wise woman of Cumhal's household,and bade them take him away and rear him as best they could. So theytook him into the wild woods on the Slieve Bloom Mountains, and therethey trained him to hunt and fish and to throw the spear, and he grewstrong, and as beautiful as a child of the Fairy Folk. If he were inthe same field with a hare he could run so that the hare could neverleave the field, for Demna was always before it. He could run down andslay a stag with no dogs to help him, and he could kill a wild duck onthe wing with a stone from his sling. And the Druidess taught him thelearning of the time, and also the story of his race and nation, andtold him of his right to be captain of the Fianna of Erinn when hisday of destiny should come.One day, while still a boy, he was roaming through the woods when hecame to the mansion of a great lord, where many boys, sons of thechief men of Ireland, were being trained in manly arts and exercises.He found them playing at hurling, and they invited him to join them.He did so, but the side he was on won too easily, so they dividedagain, and yet again, giving fewer and fewer to Demna's side, till atlast he alone drove the ball to the goal through them all, flashingamong them as a salmon among a shoal of minnows. And then their angerand jealousy rose and grew bitter against the stranger, and instead ofhonouring him as gallant lads of gentle blood should have done theyfell upon him with their hurling clubs and sought to kill him. ButDemna felled seven of them to the ground and put the rest to flight,and then went his way home. When the boys told what had happened thechief asked them who it was that had defeated and routed themsingle-handed. They said, "It was a tall shapely lad, and very fair(_finn_)." So the name of Finn, the Fair One, clung to himthenceforth, and by that name he is known to this day.By and by Finn gathered round him a band of youths who loved him forhis strength and valour and for his generous heart, and with them hewent hunting in the forests. And Goll, and the sons of Morna, who werenow captains of the Fianna under the High King, began to hear tales ofhim and his exploits, and they sent trackers to inquire about him, forthey had an inkling of who this wonderful fair-haired youth might be.Finn's foster mothers heard of this. "You must leave this place," theysaid to him, "and see our faces no more, for if Goll's men find youhere they will slay you. We have cherished the blood of Cumhal," theysaid, "and now our work is done. Go, and may blessing and victory gowith you." So Finn departed with naught but his weapons and hishunting gear, very sorrowful at leaving the wise and loving friendswho had fostered his childhood; but deep in his heart was a wild andfierce delight at the thought of the trackless ways he would travel,and the wonders he would see; and all the future looked to him asbeautiful and dim as the mists that fill a mountain glen under themorning sun.Now after the death of Cumhal, his brother Crimmal and a few others ofthe aged warriors of the Fianna, who had not fallen in the fight atCnucha, fled away into Connacht, and lived there in the deepestrecesses of a great forest, where they hoped the conquerors mightnever find them. Here they built themselves a poor dwelling of treebranches, plastered with mud and roofed with reeds from the lake, andhere they lived on what game they could kill or snare in the wildwood; and harder and harder it grew, as age and feebleness crept onthem, to find enough to eat, or to hew wood for their fire. In thisretreat, never having seen the friendly face of man, they were one daystartled to hear voices and the baying of hounds approaching themthrough the wood, and they thought that the sons of Morna were uponthem at last, and that their hour of doom was at hand. Soon theyperceived a company of youths coming towards their hut, with one infront who seemed to be their leader. Taller he was by a head than therest, broad shouldered, and with masses of bright hair clusteringround his forehead, and he carried in his hand a large bag made ofsome delicate skin and stained in patterns of red and blue. The oldmen thought when they saw him of a saying there was about the mightyLugh, who was brother to the wife of Cumhal, that when he came amonghis army as they mustered for battle, men felt as though they beheldthe rising of the sun. As they came near, the young men halted andlooked upon the elders with pity, for their clothing of skins wasragged and the weapons they strove to hold were rusted and blunt, andexcept for their proud bearing and the fire in their old eyes theylooked more like aged and worthless slaves in the household of aniggardly lord than men who had once been the flower of the fightingmen of Erinn.But the tall youth stepped in front of his band and cried aloud--"Which of ye is Crimmal, son of Trenmor?" And one of the elders said,"I am Crimmal." Then tears filled the eyes of the youth, and he kneltdown before the old man and put his hands in his."My lord and chief," he said, "I am Finn, son of Cumhal, and the dayof deliverance is come."[Illustration: "And that night there was feasting and joy in thelonely hut"]So the youths brought in the spoils of their hunting, and yet otherspoils than these; and that night there was feasting and joy in thelonely hut. And Crimmal said--"It was foretold to us that one day the blood of Cumhal should beavenged, and the race of Cumhal should rule the Fianna again. This wasthe sign that the coming champion should give of his birth anddestiny; he was to bear with him the Treasure Bag of Cumhal and thesacred things that were therein."Finn said, "Ye know the Bag and its treasures, tell us if these bethey." And he laid his skin bag on the knees of Crimmal.Crimmal opened it, and he took out the jewels of sovranty the magicspear-head made by the smiths of the Fairy Folk, and he said, "Thesebe the treasures of Cumhal; truly the ripeness of the time is come."And Finn then told the story of how he had won these things."But yesterday morning," he said, "we met on our way a woman of nobleaspect, and she knelt over the body of a slain youth. When she liftedher head as we drew near, tears of blood ran down her cheeks, and shecried to me, 'Whoever thou art, I bind thee by the bonds of the sacredordinances of the Gael that thou avenge my wrong. This was my sonGlonda,' she said, 'my only son, and he was slain to-day wantonly bythe Lord of Luachar and his men.' So we went, my company and I, to theDun of the Lord of Luachar, and found an earthen rampart with a fossebefore it, and on the top of the rampart was a fence of oaken postsinterlaced with wattles, and over this we saw the many-coloured thatchof a great dwelling-house, and its white walls painted with brightcolours under the broad eaves. So I stood forth and called to the Lordof Luachar and bade him make ready to pay an eric to the mother ofGlonda, whatsoever she should demand. But he laughed at us and cursedus and bade us begone. Then we withdrew into the forest, but returnedwith a great pile of dry brushwood, and while some of us shot stonesand arrows at whoever should appear above the palisade, others rushedup with bundles of brushwood and laid it against the palisade and setit on fire, and the Immortal Ones sent a blast of wind that set thebrushwood and palisade quickly in a blaze, and through that fiery gapwe charged in shouting. And half of the men of Luachar we killed andthe rest fled, and the Lord of Luachar I slew in the doorway of hispalace. We took a great spoil then, O Crimmal--these vessels of bronzeand silver, and spears and bows, smoked bacon and skins of Greek wine;and in a great chest of yewwood we found this bag. All these thingsshall now remain with you, and my company shall also remain to huntfor you and protect you, for ye shall know want and fear no longerwhile ye live."And Finn said, "I would fain know if my mother Murna still lives, orif she died by the sons of Morna."Crimmal said, "After thy father's death, Finn, she was wedded toGleor, Lord of Lamrigh, in the south, and she still lives in honourwith him, and the sons of Morna have let her be. Didst thou never seeher since she gave thee, an infant, to the wise women on the day ofCnucha?""I remember," said Finn, "when I was, as they tell me, but six yearsold, there came one day to our shieling in the woods of Slieve Bloom achariot with bronze-shod wheels and a bronze wolf's head at the end ofthe pole, and two horsemen riding with it, besides him who drove. Alady was in it, with a gold frontlet on her brow and her cloak wasfastened with a broad golden brooch. She came into our hut and spokelong with my foster-mothers, and me she clasped in her arms and kissedmany times, and I felt her tears on my face. And they told meafterwards that this was Murna of the White Neck, and my mother. Ifshe have suffered no harm at the hands of the sons of Morna, so muchthe less is the debt that they shall one day pay."Now it is to be told what happened to Finn at the house of Finegas theBard. Finn did not deem that the time had come for him to seize thecaptaincy of the Fianna until he had perfected himself in wisdom andlearning. So on leaving the shelter of the old men in the wood he wentto learn wisdom and the art of poetry from Finegas, who dwelt by theRiver Boyne, near to where is now the village of Slane. It was abelief among the poets of Ireland that the place of the revealing ofpoetry is always by the margin of water. But Finegas had anotherreason for the place where he made his dwelling, for there was an oldprophecy that whoever should first eat of the Salmon of Knowledge thatlived in the River Boyne, should become the wisest of men. Now thissalmon was called Finntan in ancient times and was one of theImmortals, and he might be eaten and yet live. But in the time ofFinegas he was called the Salmon of the Pool of Fec, which is theplace where the fair river broadens out into a great still pool, withgreen banks softly sloping upward from the clear brown water. Sevenyears was Finegas watching the pool, but not until after Finn had cometo be his disciple was the salmon caught. Then Finegas gave it to Finnto cook, and bade him eat none of it. But when Finegas saw him comingwith the fish, he knew that something had chanced to the lad, for hehad been used to have the eye of a young man but now he had the eye ofa sage. Finegas said, "Hast thou eaten of the salmon?""Nay," said Finn, "but it burnt me as I turned it upon the spit and Iput my thumb in my mouth" And Finegas smote his hands together and wassilent for a while. Then he said to the lad who stood by obediently,"Take the salmon and eat it, Finn, son of Cumhal, for to thee theprophecy is come. And now go hence, for I can teach thee no more, andblessing and victory be thine."With Finegas, Finn learned the three things that make a poet, and theyare Fire of Song, and Light of Knowledge, and the Art of ExtemporeRecitation. Before he departed he made this lay to prove his art, andit is called "The Song of Finn in Praise of May":--   May Day! delightful day!     Bright colours play the vales along.   Now wakes at morning's slender ray,     Wild and gay, the blackbird's song.   Now comes the bird of dusty hue,     The loud cuckoo, the summer-lover;   Branching trees are thick with leaves;     The bitter, evil time is over.   Swift horses gather nigh     Where half dry the river goes;   Tufted heather crowns the height;     Weak and white the bogdown blows.   Corncrake sings from eve till morn,     Deep in corn, a strenuous bard!   Sings the virgin waterfall,     White and tall, her one sweet word.   Loaded bees of little power     Goodly flower-harvest win;   Cattle roam with muddy flanks;     Busy ants go out and in.   Through, the wild harp of the wood     Making music roars the gale--   Now it slumbers without motion,     On the ocean sleeps the sail.   Men grow mighty in the May,     Proud and gay the maidens grow;   Fair is every wooded height;     Fair and bright the plain below.   A bright shaft has smit the streams,     With gold gleams the water-flag;   Leaps the fish, and on the hills     Ardour thrills the flying stag.   Carols loud the lark on high,     Small and shy, his tireless lay,   Singing in wildest, merriest mood     Of delicate-hued, delightful May.[20]   [20] I am much indebted to the beautiful prose translation of   this song, published by Dr Kuno Meyer in _Eriu_ (the Journal of   the School of Irish Learning), Vol. I. Part II. In my poetic   version an attempt has been made to render the riming and   metrical effect of the original, which is believed to date from   about the ninth century.CHAPTER XThe Coming of FinnAnd now we tell how Finn came to the captaincy of the Fianna of Erinn.At this time Ireland was ruled by one of the mightiest of her nativekings, Conn, son of Felimy, who was surnamed Conn of the HundredBattles. And Conn sat in his great banqueting hall at Tara, while theyearly Assembly of the lords and princes of the Gael went forward,during which it was the inviolable law that no quarrel should beraised and no weapon drawn, so that every man who had a right to cometo that Assembly might come there and sit next his deadliest foe inpeace. Below him sat at meat the provincial kings and the chiefs ofclans, and the High King's officers and fighting-men of the Fianna,with Goll and the sons of Morna at their head. And there, too, satmodestly a strange youth, tall and fair, whom no one had seen in thatplace before. Conn marked him with the eye of a king that isaccustomed to mark men, and by and by he sent him a horn full of winefrom his own table and bade the youth declare his name and lineage."I am Finn, son of Cumhal," said the youth, standing among them, tallas a warriors spear, and a start and a low murmur ran through theAssembly while the captains of the Fianna stared upon him like men whosee a vision of the dead. "What seek you here?" said Conn, and Finnreplied, "To be your man, O King, and to do you service in war as myfather did." "It is well," said the King. "Thou art a friend's son andthe son of man of trust." So Finn put his hand in the Kind's and sworefealty and service to him, and Conn set him beside his own son Art,and all fell to talking again and wondering what new things that daywould bring forth, and the feasting went merrily forward.Now at this time the people of the royal burg of Tara were sorelyafflicted by a goblin of the Fairy Folk, who was wont to approach theplace at night-fall, there to work what harm to man, or beast, ordwelling that he found in his evil mind to do. And he could not beresisted, for as he came he played on a magic harp a strain so keenand sweet, that each man who heard it must needs stand entranced andmotionless until the fairy music had passed away. The King proclaimeda mighty reward to any man who would save Tara from the goblin, andFinn thought in his heart, "I am the man to do that." So he said tothe King, "Shall I have my rightful heritage as captain of the Fiannaof Erin if I slay the goblin?" Conn said, "I promise thee that," andhe bound himself by the sureties of all the provincial Kings ofIreland and of the Druid Kithro and his magicians.Now there was among the following of Conn a man named Fiacha, who hadbeen as a youth a trusty friend and follower of Cumhal. He came toFinn and brought with him a spear having a head of dark bronze withglittering edges, and fastened with thirty rivets of Arabian gold, andthe spear-head was laced up within a leathern case. "By this weapon ofenchantment," said Fiacha, "you shall overcome the enchanter," and hetaught Finn what to do with it when the hour of need should come.So Finn took the spear, and left the strings of the case loose, and hepaced with it towards night-fall around the ramparts of royal Tara.And when he had once made the circuit of the rampart, and the lighthad now almost quite faded from the summer sky, and the wide lowplains around the Hill of Tara were a sea of white mist, he heard faroff in the deepening gloom the first notes of the fairy harp. Neversuch music was made by mortal hand, for it had in it sorrows that manhas never felt, and joys for which man has no name, and it seemed asif a man listening to that music might burst from time into eternityand be as one of the Immortals for evermore. And Finn listened, amazedand rapt, till at last as the triumphant melody grew nearer and louderhe saw dimly a Shadow Shape playing as it were on a harp, and comingswiftly towards him. Then with a mighty effort he roused himself fromdreams, and tore the cover from the spear-head and laid the metal tohis brow. And the demoniac energy that had been beaten into the bladeby the hammers of unearthly craftsmen in ancient days thrilledthrough him and made him fighting-mad, and he rushed forward shoutinghis battle-cry, and swinging the spear aloft. But the Shadow turnedand fled before him, and Finn chased it northward to the Fairy Moundof Slieve Fuad, and there he drove the spear through its back. Andwhat it was that fell there in the night, and what it was that passedlike the shadow of a shadow into the Fairy Mound, none can tell, butFinn bore back with him next day a pale, sorrowful head on the pointof Fiacha's spear, and the goblin troubled the folk of royal Tara nomore.But Conn of the Hundred Battles called the Fianna together, and he setFinn at his right hand and said, "Here is your Captain by birth-rightand by sword-right. Let who will now obey him hence-forward, and whowill not, let him go in peace and serve Arthur of Britain or Arist ofAlba, or whatsoever King he will." And Goll, son of Morna, said, "Formy part I will be Finn's man under thee, O King," and he sworeobedience and loyalty to Finn before them all. Nor was it hard for anyman to step where Goll had gone before, so they all took their oathsof Fian service to Finn mac Cumhal. And thus it was that Finn came tothe captaincy of the Fianna of Erinn, and he ruled the Fianna many ayear till he died in battle with the Clan Urgrenn at Brea upon theBoyne.CHAPTER XIFinn's Chief MenWith the coming of Finn did the Fianna of Erinn come to their glory,and with his life their glory passed away. For he ruled them as noother captain ever did, both strongly and wisely, and never bore agrudge against any, but freely forgave a man all offences savedisloyalty to his lord. Thus it is told that Conan, son of the Lord ofLuachar, him who had the Treasure Bag and whom Finn slew at RathLuachar, was for seven years an outlaw and marauder, harrying theFians, and killing here a man and there a hound, and firing theirdwellings, and raiding their cattle. At last they ran him to a cornerat Cam Lewy in Munster, and when he saw that he could escape no morehe stole upon Finn as he sat down after a chase, and flung his armsround him from behind, holding him fast and motionless. Finn knew whoheld him thus and said, "What wilt thou Conan?" Conan said, "To make acovenant of service and fealty with thee, for I may no longer evadethy wrath." So Finn laughed and said, "Be it so, Conan, and if thouprove faithful and valiant, I also will keep faith." And Conan servedhim for thirty years, and no man of all the Fianna was keener andhardier in fight. There was also another Conan, namely, mac Morna,who was big and bald, and unwieldy in manly exercises, but whosetongue was bitter and scurrilous; no high brave thing was done thatConan the Bald did not mock and belittle. It is said that when he wasstripped he showed down his back and buttocks a black sheep's fleeceinstead of a man's skin, and this is the way it came about. One daywhen Conan and certain others of the Fianna were hunting in the forestthey came to a stately Dun, white-walled, with coloured thatching onthe roof, and they entered it to seek hospitality. But when they werewithin they found! no man, but a great empty hall with pillars ofcedar wood and silken hangings about it, like the hall of a wealthylord. In the midst there was a table set forth with a sumptuous feastof boar's flesh and venison, and a great vat of yew wood full of redwine, and cups of gold and silver. So they set themselves gaily to eatand drink, for they were hungry from the chase, and talk and laughterwere loud around the board. But one of them ere long started to hisfeet with a cry of fear and wonder, and they all looked round, and sawbefore their eyes the tapestried walls changing to rough wooden balksand the ceiling to foul sooty thatch like that of a herdsman's hut. Sothey knew they were being entrapped by some enchantment of the FairyFolk, and all sprang to their feet and made for the doorway, that wasno longer high and stately but was shrinking to the size of a foxearth,--all but Conan the Bald, who was gluttonously devouring thegood things on the table, and heeded nothing else. Then they shoutedto him, and as the last of them went out he strove to rise and follow,but found himself limed to the chair so that he could not stir. Sotwo of the Fianna, seeing his plight, rushed back and seized his armsand tugged with all their might, and if they dragged him away, theyleft the most part of his raiment and his skin sticking to the chair.Then, not knowing what else to do with him in his sore plight theyclapped upon his back the nearest thing they could find, which was theskin of a black sheep that they took from a peasant's flock hard by,and it grew there, and Conan wore it till his death.Though Conan was a coward and rarely adventured himself in battle withthe Fianna, it is told that once a good man fell by his hand. This wason the day of the great battle with the pirate horde on the Hill ofSlaughter in Kerry.[21] For Liagan, one of the invaders, stood outbefore the hosts and challenged the bravest of the Fians to singlecombat, and the Fians, in mockery, thrust Conan forth to the fight.When he appeared, Liagan laughed, for he had more strength than wit,and he said, "Silly is thy visit, thou bald old man." And as Conanstill approached, Liagan lifted his hand fiercely, and Conan said,"Truly thou art in more peril from the man behind than from the man infront." Liagan looked round; and in that instant Conan swept off hishead and then threw down his sword and ran for shelter to the ranks ofthe laughing Fians. But Finn was very wroth because he had won thevictory by a trick.   [21] The hill still bears the name, Knockanar.And one of the chiefest of the friends of Finn was Dermot of the LoveSpot. He was so fair and noble to look on that no woman could refusehim love, and it was said that he never knew weariness, but his stepwas as light at the end of the longest day of battle or the chase asit was at the beginning. Between him and Finn there was great loveuntil the day when Finn, then an old man, was to wed Grania, daughterof Cormac the High King; but Grania bound Dermot by the sacredordinances of the Fian chivalry to fly with her on her wedding night,which thing, sorely against his will, he did, and thereby got hisdeath. But Grania went back to Finn, and when the Fianna saw her theylaughed through all the camp in bitter mockery, for they would nothave given one of the dead man's fingers for twenty such as Grania.Others of the chief men that Finn had were Keelta mac Ronan, who wasone of his house-stewards and a strong warrior as well as agolden-tongued reciter of tales and poems. And there was Oisin, theson of Finn, the greatest poet of the Gael, of whom more shall be toldhereafter. And Oisin had a son Oscar, who was the fiercest fighter inbattle among all the Fians. He slew in his maiden battle three kings,and in his fury he also slew by mischance his own friend andcondisciple Linne. His wife was the fair Aideen, who died of griefafter Oscar's death in the battle of Gowra, and Oisin buried her onBen Edar (Howth), and raised over her the great cromlech which isthere to this day.Another good man that Finn had was Geena, the son of Luga; his motherwas the warrior-daughter of Finn, and his father was a near kinsman ofhers. He was nurtured by a woman that bore the name of Fair Mane, whohad brought up many of the Fianna to manhood. When his time to takearms was come he stood before Finn and made his covenant of fealty,and Finn gave him the captaincy of a band. But mac Luga provedslothful and selfish, for ever vaunting himself and his weapon-skilland never training his men to the chase of deer or boar, and he usedto beat his hounds and his serving-men. At last the Fians under himcame with their whole company to Finn at Loch Lena in Killarney, andthere they laid their complaint against mac Luga, and said, "Choosenow, O Finn, whether you will have us, or the son of Luga by himself."Then Finn sent to mac Luga and questioned him, but mac Luga could saynothing to the point as to why the Fianna would none of him. Then Finntaught him the things befitting a youth of noble birth and a captainof men, and they were these:--"Son of Luga, if armed service be thy design, in a great man'shousehold be quiet, be surly in the narrow pass.""Without a fault of his beat not thy hound; until thou ascertain herguilt, bring not a charge against thy wife.""In battle, meddle not with a buffoon, for, O mac Luga, he is but afool.""Censure not any if he be of grave repute; stand not up to take partin a brawl; have nought to do with a madman or a wicked one.""Two-thirds of thy gentleness be shown to women and to those thatcreep on the floor (little children) and to poets, and be not violentto the common people.""Utter not swaggering speech, nor say thou wilt not yield what isright; it is a shameful thing to speak too stiffly unless that it befeasible to carry out thy words.""So long as thou shalt live, thy lord forsake not; neither for goldnor for other reward in the world abandon one whom thou art pledged toprotect.""To a chief do not abuse his people, for that is no work for agentleman.""Be no talebearer, nor utterer of falsehoods; be not talkative norrashly censorious. Stir not up strife against thee, however good a manthou be.""Be no frequenter of the drinking-house, nor given to carping at theold; meddle not with a man of mean estate.""Dispense thy meat freely, have no niggard for thy familiar.""Force not thyself upon a chief, nor give him cause to speak ill ofthee.""Stick to thy gear, hold fast to thy arms till the stern fight withits weapon-glitter be well ended.""Be more apt to give than to deny, and follow after gentleness, O sonof Luga."[22]   [22] I have in the main borrowed Standish Hayes O'Grady's vivid   and racy translation of these adages of the Fianna. (SILVA   GADELICA, Engl. transl., p. 115.)And the son of Luga, it is written, heeded these counsels and gave uphis bad ways, and he became one of the best of Finn's men.Such-like things also Finn taught to all his followers, and the bestof them became like himself in valour and gentleness and generosity.Each of them loved the repute of his comrades more than his own, andeach would say that for all noble qualities there was no man in thebreadth of the world worthy to be thought of beside Finn.It was said of him that "he gave away gold as if it were the leaves ofthe woodland, and silver as if it were the foam of the sea," and thatwhatever he had bestowed upon any man, if he fell out with himafterwards, he was never known to bring it against him.Sang the poet Oisin of him once to St Patrick:--  "These are the things that were dear to Finn--  The din of battle, the banquet's glee,  The bay of his hounds through the rough glen ringing.  And the blackbird singing in Letter Lee,  "The shingle grinding along the shore  When they dragged his war-boats down to sea,  The dawn-wind whistling his spears among,  And the magic song of his minstrels three."In the time of Finn no one was ever admitted to be one of the Fiannaof Erinn unless he could pass through many severe tests of hisworthiness. He must be versed in the Twelve Books of Poetry and musthimself be skilled to make verse in the rime and metre of the mastersof Gaelic poesy. Then he was buried to his middle in the earth, andmust, with a shield and a hazel stick, there defend himself againstnine warriors casting spears at him, and if he were wounded he wasnot accepted. Then his hair was woven into braids and he was chasedthrough the forest by the Fians. If he were overtaken, or if a braidof his hair were disturbed, or if a dry stick cracked under his foot,he was not accepted. He must be able to leap over a lath level withhis brow and to run at full speed under level with his knee, and hemust be able while running to draw out a thorn from his foot and neverslacken speed. He must take no dowry with a wife.It was said that one of the Fians, namely Keelta, lived on to a greatage, and saw St Patrick, by whom he was baptized into the faith of theChrist, and to whom he told many tales of Finn and his men, whichPatrick's scribe wrote down. And once Patrick asked him how it wasthat the Fianna became so mighty and so glorious that all Ireland sangof their deeds, as Ireland has done ever since. Keelta answered,"Truth was in our hearts and strength in our arms, and what we said,that we fulfilled."This was also told of Keelta after he had seen St Patrick and receivedthe Faith. He chanced to be one day by Leyney in Connacht, where theFairy Folk of the Mound of Duma were wont to be sorely harassed andspoiled every year by pirates from oversea. They called Keelta totheir aid, and by his counsel and valour the invaders were overcomeand driven home, but Keelta was sorely wounded. Then Keelta askedthat Owen the seer of the Fairy Folk might foretell him how long hehad to live, for he was already a very aged man. Owen said, "It willbe seventeen years, O Keelta of fair fame, till thou fall by the poolof Tara, and grievous that will be to all the King's household." "Evenso did my chief and lord, my guardian and loving Protector, Finn,foretell to me," said Keelta. "And now what fee will ye give me for myrescue of you from the worst affliction that ever befell you?" "Agreat reward," said the Fairy Folk, "even youth; for by our art weshall change you into young man again with all the strength andactivity of your prime." "Nay, God forbid," said Keelta "that I shouldtake upon me a shape of sorcery, or any other than that which myMaker, the true and glorious God, hath bestowed upon me." And theFairy Folk said, "It is the word of a true warrior and hero, and thething that thou sayest is good." So they healed his wounds, and everybodily evil that he had, and he wished them blessing and victory, andwent his way.CHAPTER XIIThe Tale of Vivionn the GiantessOne day Finn and Goll, Keelta and Oscar, and others of the Fianna,were resting after the hunt on a certain hill now called the Ridge ofthe Dead Woman, and their meal was being got ready, when a girl of thekin of the giants came striding up and sat down among them. "Didstthou ever see a woman so tall?" asked Finn of Goll. "By my troth,"said Goll, "never have I or any other seen a woman so big." She tookher hand out of her bosom and on her long slender fingers there werethree gold rings each as thick as an ox's yoke. "Let us question her,"said Goll, and Finn said, "If we stood up, perchance she might hearus."So they all rose to their feet, but the giantess, on that, rose uptoo. "Maiden," said Finn, "if thou have aught to say to us or to hearfrom us, sit down and lean thine elbow on the hill-side." So she laydown and Finn bade her say whence she came and what was her will withthem. "Out of the World Oversea where the sun sets am I come," shesaid, "to seek thy protection, O mighty Finn." "And what is thy name?""My name is Vivionn of the Fair Hair, and my father Treon is calledKing of the Land of Lasses, for he has but three sons and nine andseven score daughters, and near him is a King who hath one daughterand eight score sons. To one of these, AEda, was I given in marriagesorely against my will. Three times now have I fled from him. And thistime it was fishermen whom the wind blew to us from off this land whotold us of a mighty lord here, named Finn, son of Cumhal, who wouldlet none be wronged or oppressed, but he would be their friend andchampion. And if thou be he, to thee am I come." Then she laid herhand in Finn's, and he bade her do the same with Goll mac Morna, whowas second in the Fian leadership, and she did so.Then the maiden took from her head a jewelled golden helmet, andimmediately her hair flowed out in seven score tresses, fair, curlyand golden, at the abundance of which all stood amazed; and Finn said,"By the Immortals that we adore, but King Cormac and the poetess Ethneand the fair women-folk of the Fianna would deem it a marvel to seethis girl. Tell us now, maiden, what portion wilt thou have of meatand drink? will that of a hundred of us suffice thee?" The girl thensaw Cnu, the dwarf harper of Finn, who had just been playing to them,and she said, "Whatever thou givest to yon little man that bears theharp, be it much or little, the same, O Finn, will suffice for me."Then she begged a drink from them, and Finn called his gillie,Saltran, and bade him fetch the full of a certain great goblet withwater from the ford; now this goblet was of wood, and it held as muchas nine of the Fianna could drink. The maiden poured some of the waterinto her right hand and drank three sips of it, and scattered the restover the Fianna, and she and they burst out laughing. Finn said, "Onthy conscience, girl, what ailed thee not to drink out of the goblet?""Never," she replied, "have I drunk out of any vessel but there was arim of gold to it, or at least of silver."And now Keelta looking up perceived a tall youth coming swiftlytowards them, who, when he approached, seemed even bigger than was themaiden. He wore a rough hairy cape over his shoulder and beneath thata green cloak fastened by a golden brooch; his tunic was of royalsatin, and he bore a red shield slung over his shoulders, and a spearwith a shaft as thick as a man's leg was in his hand; a gold-hiltedsword hung by his side. And his face, which was smooth-shaven, wascomelier than that of any of the sons of men.When he came near, seeing among the Fians a stir of alarm at thisapparition, Finn said, "Keep every one of you his place, let neitherwarrior nor gillie address him. Know any of you this champion?" "Iknow him," said the maiden; "that is even he to escape from whom I amcome to thee, O Finn." And she sat down between Finn and Goll. But thestranger drew near, and spake never a word, but before any one couldtell what he would be at he thrust fiercely and suddenly with hisspear at the girl, and the shaft stood out a hand's breadth at herback. And she fell gasping, but the young man drew his weapon out andpassed rapidly through the crowd and away.[Illustration: "They ran him by hill and plain"]Then Finn cried, red with wrath, "Ye have seen! Avenge this wickeddeed, or none of you aspire to Fianship again." And the whole companysprang to their feet and gave chase to that murderer, save only Finnand Goll, who stayed by the dying maiden. And they ran him by hill andplain to the great Bay of Tralee and down to the Tribute Point, wherethe traders from oversea were wont to pay their dues, and there he sethis face to the West and took the water. By this time four of theFianna had outstripped the rest, namely, Keelta, and Dermot, and Glas,and Oscar, son of Oisin. Of these Keelta was first, and just as thegiant was mid-leg in the waves he hurled his spear and it severed thethong of the giant's shield so that it fell off in the water. And asthe giant paused, Keelta seized his spear and tore it from him. Butthe giant waded on, and soon the Fians were floundering in deep waterwhile the huge form, thigh deep, was seen striding towards the settingsun. And a great ship seemed to draw near, and it received him, andthen departed into the light, but the Fians returned in the greyevening, bearing the spear and the great shield to Finn. There theyfound the maiden at point of death, and they laid the weapons beforeher. "Goodly indeed are these arms," she said, "for that is theThunder Spear of the King Oversea and the shield is the Red BranchShield," for it was covered with red arabesques. Then she bestowed herbracelets on Finn's three harpers, the dwarf Cnu, and Blanit his wife,and the harper Daira. And she bade Finn care for her burial, that itshould be done becomingly, "for under thy honour and protection I gotmy death, and it was to thee I came into Ireland." So they buried herand lamented her, and made a great far-seen mound over her grave,which is called the Ridge of the Dead Woman, and set up a pillar stoneupon it with her name and lineage carved in Ogham-crave.[23]   [23] Ogham-craobh = "branching Ogham," so called because the   letters resembled the branching of twigs from a stem. The Ogham   alphabet was in use in Ireland in pre-Christian times, and many   sepulchral inscriptions in it still remain.CHAPTER XIIIThe Chase of the Gilla DacarIn the reign of Cormac mac Art, grandson of Conn of the HundredBattles, the order of precedence and dignity in the court of the HighKing at Tara was as follows: First came great Cormac, the kingly, thehospitable, warrior and poet, and he was supreme over all. Next inorder came the five kings of the five Provinces of Ireland, namely,Ulster, Munster, Connacht, Leinster, and Mid-Erinn. After these rankedthe captains of the royal host, of whom Finn, son of Cumhal, was thechief.Now the privileges of the Fianna of Erinn were many and great; to wit,in every county in Ireland one townland, and in every townland acartron of land, and in the house of every gentleman the right tohave a young deer-hound or a beagle kept at nurse from November toMay, together with many other taxes and royalties not to be recountedhere. But if they had these many and great privileges, yet greaterthan these were the toils and hardships which they had to endure, inguarding the coasts of all Ireland from oversea invaders andmarauders, and in keeping down all robbers and outlaws and evil folkwithin the kingdom, for this was the duty laid upon them by their bondof service to the King.Now the summer half of the year was wont to be ended by a greathunting in one of the forests of Ireland, and so it was that oneAll-hallowtide, when the great banquet of Finn in his Dun on the Hillof Allen was going forward, and the hall resounded with cheerful talkand laughter and with the music of tympan and of harp, Finn asked ofthe assembled captains in what part of Erinn they should proceed tobeat up game on the morrow. And it was agreed among them to repair tothe territory of Thomond and Desmond in Munster; and from Allen theyset out accordingly and came to the Hill of Knockany. Thence theythrew out the hunt and sent their bands of beaters through many agloomy ravine and by many a rugged hill-pass and many a fair openplain. Desmond's high hills, called now Slievelogher, they beat, andthe smooth, swelling hills of Slievenamuck, and the green slopes ofgrassy Slievenamon, and the towering rough crags of the Decies, andthence on to the dark woods of Belachgowran.While the great hunt was going forward Finn with certain of his chiefcaptains sat on a high mound to overlook it. There, with Finn, wereGoll and Art mac Morna, and Liagan the swift runner, and Dermot of theLove Spot, and Keelta, son of Ronan, and there also was Conan theBald, the man of scurrilous tongue, and a score or so more. Sweet itwas to Finn and his companions to hear from the woods and wildernessesaround them the many-tongued baying of the hounds and the cries andwhistling of the beaters, the shouting of the strong men and the notesof the Fian hunting-horn.When they had sat there awhile one of Finn's men came running quicklytowards him and said--"A stranger is approaching us from the westward, O Finn, and I muchmislike his aspect."With that all the Fians looked up and beheld upon the hillside a hugeman, looking like some Fomorian marauder, black-visaged and ugly, witha sour countenance and ungainly limbs. On his back hung a dingy blackshield, on his misshapen left thigh he wore a sharp broad-bladedsword; projecting over his shoulder were two long lances with broadrusty heads. He wore garments that looked as if they had been buriedin a cinder heap, and a loose ragged mantle. Behind him there shambleda sulky, ill-shapen mare with a bony carcase and bowed knees, and onher neck a clumsy iron halter. With a rope her master hauled heralong, with violent jerks that seemed as if they would wrench her headfrom her scraggy neck, and ever and anon the mare would stand and jib,when the man laid on her ribs such blows from a strong ironshod cudgelthat they sounded like the surges of the sea beating on a rocky coast.Short as was the distance from where the man and his horse were firstperceived to where Finn was standing, it was long ere they traversedit. At last, however, he came into the presence of Finn and loutedbefore him, doing obeisance. Finn lifted his hand over him and badehim speak, and declare his business and his name and rank. "I knownot," said the fellow, "of what blood I am, gentle or simple, but onlythis, that I am a wight from oversea looking for service and wages.And as I have heard of thee, O Finn, that thou art not wont to refuseany man, I came to take service with thee if thou wilt have me.""Neither shall I refuse thee," said Finn; "but what brings thee herewith a horse and no horseboy?""Good enough reason," said the stranger. "I have much ado to get meatfor my own belly, seeing that I eat for a hundred men; and I will nothave any horseboy meddling with my ration.""And what name dost thou bear?""I am called the Gilla Dacar (the Hard Gillie)," replied he."Why was that name given thee?" asked Finn."Good enough reason for that also," spake the stranger, "for of allthe lads in the world there is none harder than I am for a lord to getany service and obedience from." Then turning to Conan the Bald hesaid, "Whether among the Fianna is a horseman's pay or a footman's thehighest?""A horseman's surely," said Conan, "seeing that he gets twice the payof a footman.""Then I am a horseman in thy service, Finn," said the gillie. "I callthee to observe that I have here a horse, and moreover that as ahorseman I came among the Fianna. Have I thy authority," he went on,"to turn out my steed among thine?""Turn her out," quoth Finn.Then the big man flung his mare the rope and immediately she gallopedoff to where the Fian horses were grazing. Here she fell to biting andkicking them, knocking out the eye of one and snapping off another'sear and breaking the leg of another with a kick."Take away thy mare, big man," cried Conan then, "or by Heaven andEarth were it not that Finn told thee to let her loose I would letloose her brains. Many a bad bargain has Finn made but never a worsethan thou.""By Heaven and Earth," said the gillie, "that I never will, for I haveno horseboy, and I will do no horseboy's work."Then Conan mac Morna took the iron halter and laid it on thestranger's horse and brought the beast back to Finn and held it there.Said Finn to Conan, "I have never seen thee do horseboy's service evento far better men than this gillie. How now if thou wert to leap onthe brute's back and gallop her to death over hill and dale in paymentfor the mischief she hath wrought among our steeds?"At this word Conan clambered up on the back of the big man's mare, andwith all his might he smote his two heels into her, but the mare neverstirred."I perceive what ails her," said Finn. "She will never stir till shehas a weight of men on her equal to that of her own rider."Then thirteen men of the Fianna scrambled up laughing behind Conan,and the mare lay down under them, and then got up again, they stillclinging to her. At this the big man said,"It appears that you are making a sport and mockery of my mare, andthat even I myself do not escape from it. It is well for me that Ihave not spent the rest of the year in your company, seeing what ajest ye have made of me the very first day; and I perceive, O Finn,that thou art very unlike the report that is made of thee. And now Ibid thee farewell, for of thy service I have had enough."So with downcast head and despondent looks the big gillie shambledslowly away until he had passed out of view of the Fianna, behind theshoulder of the hill. Having arrived here he tucked up his coat to hiswaist, and fast though be the flight of the swallow, and fast that ofthe roe-deer, and fast the rush of a roaring wind over a mountain topin mid-March, no faster are these than the bounding speed and furiousflight of the big man down the hillside toward the West.No sooner did the mare see that her master had departed than she toodashed uncontrollably forward and flew down the hillside after him.And as the Fians saw Conan the Bald and his thirteen companions thuscarried off, willy nilly, they broke into a roar of laughter and ranalongside mocking them. But Conan, seeing that they were being carriedoff in the wake of the big man of evil aspect, of whom none knewwhence or who he was, he was terrified and began reviling and cursing,and shouted to Finn, "A palsy seize thee, Finn; may some rascallychurl, that is if possible of worse blood than thyself, have thy head,unless thou follow and rescue us wheresoever this monster shall bringus." So Finn and the Fianna ran, and the mare ran, over bare hills andby deep glens, till at last they came to Corcaguiny in Kerry, wherethe gillie set his face to the blue ocean, and the mare dashed inafter him. But ere he did so, Liagan the Swift got two hands on thetail of the mare, though further he could not win, and he was towedin, still clinging to his hold, and over the rolling billows away theywent, the fourteen Fians on the wild mare's back, and Liagan haledalong by her tail."What is to be done now?" said Oisin to Finn when they had arrived atthe beach."Our men are to be rescued," said Finn, "for to that we are bound bythe honour of the Fianna. Whithersoever they are gone, thither must wefollow and win them back by fair means or foul; but to that end wemust first fit out a galley."So in the end it was agreed that Finn and fourteen men of his bravestand best champions should sail oversea in search of the Gilla Dacarand his captives, while Oisin remained in Erinn and exercised ruleover the Fianna in the place of his father.After a while, then, a swift galley was made ready by Finn and storedwith victual, and with arms, and also with gold and raiment to makegifts withal if need should be. And into the ship came the fifteenvaliant men, and gripped their oars, while Finn steered; and soon thesea whitened around their oarblades, and over the restless, rollingmasses of the many-hued and voiceful billows, the ship clove her wayto the West. And the Fians, who were wont to be wakened by thetwittering of birds over their hunting booths in the greenwood, nowdelighted to hear, day after day as they roused themselves at morn,the lapping of the wide waters of the world against their vessel'sbows, or the thunder of pounding surges when the wind blew hard.At length after many days the sharpest-eyed of the men of Finn sawfar-off what seemed a mountain rising from the sea, and to it theyshaped their course. When they had come to that land they foundthemselves under the shadow of a great grey cliff, and beneath itslippery rocks covered with seaweed.Then Dermot, who was the most active of the company, was bidden tomount the cliff and to procure means of drawing up the rest of theparty, but of what land might lie on the top of that wall of rock noneof them could discover anything. Dermot, descending from the ship,then climbed with difficulty up the face of the cliff, while theothers made fast their ship among the rocks. But Dermot having arrivedat the top saw no habitation of man, and could compass no way ofhelping his companions to mount. He went therefore boldly forward intothe unknown land, hoping to obtain some help, if any friendly andhospitable folk could there be found.[Illustration: "Dermot took the horn and would have filled it"]Before he had gone far he came into a wild wood, thick and tangled,and full of the noise of streams, and the sough of winds, andtwittering of birds, and hum of bees. After he had traversed thiswilderness for a while he came to a mighty tree with denselyinterwoven branches, and beneath it a pile of rocks, having on itssummit a pointed drinking horn wreathed with rich ornament, and at itsfoot a well of pure bright water. Dermot, being now thirsty, took thehorn and would have filled it at the well, but as he stooped down todo so he heard a loud, threatening murmur which seemed to rise fromit. "I perceive," he said to himself, "that I am forbidden to drinkfrom this well" Nevertheless thirst compelled him, and he drank hisfill.In no long time thereafter he saw an armed warrior of hostile aspectcoming towards him through the wood. No courteous greeting did he giveto Dermot, but began to revile him for roaming in his wood andwilderness, and for drinking his water. Thereupon they fought, andfor the rest of the afternoon they took and gave hard blows neithersubduing the other, till at last as darkness began to fall the warriorsuddenly dived into the well and was seen no more. Dermot, vexed atthis ending of the combat, then made him ready to spend the night inthat place, but first he slew a deer in the wood, and made a fire,whereat he roasted pieces of the deer's flesh on spits of white hazel,and drank abundantly of the well-water, and then slept soundly throughthe night.Next morning when he awakened and went to the well he found theChampion of the Well standing there and awaiting him. "It is notenough, Dermot," said he angrily, "for thee to traverse my woods atwill and to drink my water, but thou must even also slay my deer."Then they closed in combat again, and dealt each other blow for blowand wound for wound till evening parted them, and the champion divedinto the well as before.On the third day it went even so; but as evening came on Dermot,watching closely, rushed at the champion just as he was about toplunge into the well, and gripped him in his arms. But none the lessthe Champion of the Well made his dive, and took down Dermot with him.And a darkness and faintness came over Dermot, but when he awoke, hefound himself in a wide, open country, flowery and fair, and beforehim the walls and towers of a royal city. Thither the champion, sorelywounded, was now borne off, while a crowd of his people came roundDermot, and beat and wounded him, leaving him on the ground for dead.After night had fallen, when all the people of the city in the LandUndersea had departed, a stalwart champion, well-armed and of boldappearance, came upon Dermot and stirred him with his foot. Dermotthereon awoke from his swoon and, warrior-like, reached out his handfor his arms. But the champion said, "Wait awhile, my son, I have notcome to do thee hurt or harm. Thou hast chosen an ill place to restand slumber in, before the city of thine enemy. Rise and follow me,and I shall bestow thee far better than that." Dermot then rose andfollowed the champion, and long and far they journeyed until they cameto a high-towered fortress, wherein were thrice fifty valiantmen-at-arms and fair women; and the daughter of that champion, awhite-toothed, rosy-cheeked, smooth-handed, and black-eyebrowed maid,received Dermot, kindly and welcomefully, and applied healing herbs tohis wounds, and in no long time he was made as good a man as ever. Andthus he remained, and was entertained most royally with the best ofviands and of liquors. The first part of every night those in that Dunwere wont to spend in feasting, and the second in recreation andentertainment of the mind, with music and with poetry and bardictales, and the third part in sound and healthful slumber, till the sunin his fiery journey rose over the heavy-clodded earth on the morrowmorn.And the King of that country, who was the champion that had arousedDermot, told him this was the land of Sorca, and that he had showedthis kindness to Dermot for that he himself had once been on wage andservice with Finn, son of Cumhal "and a better master," said he, "mannever had."Now the story turns to tell of what befell Finn and the remainder ofhis companions when Dermot left them in the ship. After a while,seeing that he did not return, and being assured that some mischief orhindrance must have befallen him, they made an attempt to climb thecliff after him, having noted which way he went. With much toil andperil they accomplished this, and then journeying forward andfollowing on Dermot's track, they came at last to the well in the wildwood, and saw near by the remains of the deer, and the ashes of thefire that Dermot had kindled to cook it. But from this place theycould discover no track of his going. While they were debating on whatshould next be done, they saw riding towards them a tall warrior on adark grey horse with a golden bridle, who greeted them courteously.From him they enquired as to whether he had seen aught of theircompanion, Dermot, in the wilderness. "Follow me," said the warrior,"and you shall shortly have tidings of him."Then they followed the strange horseman into the forest by many darkand winding ways, until at last they came into a rocky ravine, wherethey found the mouth of a great cavern opening into the hillside.Into this they went, and the way led them downward until it seemed asif they were going into the bowels of the earth, until at last thelight began to shine round them, and they came out into a lovely landof flowery plains and green woods and singing streams. In no long timethereafter they came to a great royal Dun, where he who led them washailed as king and lord, and here, to their joy, they found theircomrade, Dermot of the Love Spot, who told them of all his adventuresand heard from them of theirs. This ended, and when they had beenentertained and refreshed, the lord of that place spoke to Finn andsaid:--"I have now, O Finn, within my fortress the fifteen stoutest heroesthat the world holds. To this end have I brought you here, that yemight make war with me upon mine enemy the Champion of the Well, whois king of the land bordering on mine, and who ceases not to persecuteand to harry my people because, in his arrogance, he would have allthe Under World country subject to himself alone. Say now if ye willembrace this enterprise and help me to defend my own: and if not Ishall set you again upon the land of Erinn."Finn said, "What of my fifteen men that were carried away on the wildmare's back oversea?" "They are guarding the marches of my kingdom,"said the King of Sorca, "and all is well with them and shall be well."Then Finn agreed to take service with the King of Sorca, and next daythey arrayed themselves for fight and went out at the head of thehost. Ere long they came upon the army of the King of the Well, andwith him was the King of the Greeks and a band of fierce mercenaries,and also the daughter of the Greek King, by name Tasha of the WhiteSide, a maiden who in beauty and grace surpassed all other women ofthe world, as the Shannon surpasses all rivers of Erinn and the eaglesurpasses all birds of the air. Now the stories of Finn and hisgenerosity and great deeds had reached her since she was a child, andshe had set her love on him, though she had never seen his face tillnow.When the hosts were met, the King of the Greeks said, "Who of my menwill stand forth and challenge the best of these men of Erinn tosingle combat that their metal may be proved, for to us it is unknownwhat manner of men they be." The son of the King of the Greeks said,"I will go."So on the side of Finn, Oscar, son of Oisin, was chosen to match theson of the Greek King, and the two hosts sat down peacefully togetherto watch the weapon-play. And Tasha the princess sat by Finn, son ofCumhal.Then Oscar and the King's son stepped into their fighting place, andfierce was the combat that arose between them, as when two roaringsurges of the sea dash against each other in a fissure of the rocks,and the spray-cloud bursts from them high into the air. Long theyfought, and many red wounds did each of them give and receive, till atlast Oscar beat the Greek prince to the earth and smote off his head.Then one host groaned for woe and discouragement, while the othershouted for joy of victory, and so they parted for the night, each totheir own camp.And in the camp of the folk of Sorca they found Conan the Bald and thefourteen men that had gone with him on the mare's back.But when night had fallen, Tasha stole from the wizard of the GreekKing his branch of silver bells that when shaken would lay asleep ahost of men, and with the aid of this she passed from the camp of theGreeks, and through the sentinels, and came to the tent of Finn.On the morrow morn the King of the Greeks found that his daughter hadfled to be the wife of Finn, son of Cumhal, and he offered a mightyreward to whosoever would slay Finn and bring Tasha back. But when thetwo armies closed in combat the Fians and the host of the King ofSorca charged so fiercely home, that they drove their foes before themas a winter gale drives before it a cloud of madly whirling leaves,and those that were not slain in the fight and the pursuit went totheir own lands and abode there in peace; and thus was the war endedof the King of Sorca and the Lord of the Well.Then the King of Sorca had Finn and his comrades before him and gavethem praise and thanks for their valour. "And what reward," he said,"will ye that I make you for the saving of the kingdom of Sorca?""Thou wert in my service awhile," said Finn, "and I mind not that Ipaid thee any wage for it. Let that service even go against this, andso we are quits.""Nay, then," cried Conan the Bald, "but what shall I have for my rideon the mare of the Gilla Dacar?""What wilt thou have?" said the King of Sorca."This," said Conan, "and nothing else will I accept. Let fourteen ofthe fairest women of the land of Sorca be put on that same mare, andthy wife, O King, clinging to its tail, and let them be thus haledacross the sea until they come to Corcaguiny in the land of Erinn. Iwill have none of thy gold and silver, but the indignity that has beenput upon me doth demand an honourable satisfaction."Then the King of Sorca smiled, and he said, "Behold thy men, Finn."[Illustration: "'Follow me now to the Hill of Allen'"]Finn turned his head to look round, and as he did so the plain and theencampment of the Fairy Host vanished from his sight, and he sawhimself standing on the shingly strand of a little bay, with rockyheights to right and left, crowned with yellow whin bushes whoseperfume mingled with the salt sea wind. It was the spot where he hadseen the Gilla Dacar and his mare take water on the coast of Kerry.Finn stared over the sea, to discover, if he might, by what means hehad come thither, but nothing could he see there save the sunlitwater, and nothing hear but what seemed a low laughter from thetwinkling ripples that broke at his feet. Then he looked for his men,who stood there, dazed like himself and rubbing their eyes; and theretoo stood the Princess Tasha, who stretched out her white arms to him.Finn went over and took her hands. "Shoulder your spears, good lads!"he called to his men. "Follow me now to the Hill of Allen, and to thewedding feast of Tasha and of Finn mac Cumhal."CHAPTER XIVThe Birth of OisinOne day as Finn and his companions and dogs were returning from thechase to their Dun on the Hill of Allen, a beautiful fawn started upon their path and the chase swept after her, she taking the way whichled to their home. Soon, all the pursuers were left far behind saveonly Finn himself and his two hounds Bran and Sceolaun. Now thesehounds were of strange breed, for Tyren, sister to Murna, the motherof Finn, had been changed into a hound by the enchantment of a womanof the Fairy Folk, who loved Tyren's husband Ullan; and the two houndsof Finn were the children of Tyren, born to her in that shape. Of allhounds in Ireland they were the best, and Finn loved them much, sothat it was said he wept but twice in his life, and once was for thedeath of Bran.At last, as the chase went on down a valley side, Finn saw the fawnstop and lie down, while the two hounds began to play round her and tolick her face and limbs. So he gave commandment that none should hurther, and she followed them to the Dun of Allen, playing with thehounds as she went.The same night Finn awoke and saw standing by his bed the fairestwoman his eyes had ever beheld."I am Saba, O Finn," she said, "and I was the fawn ye chased to-day.Because I would not give my love to the Druid of the Fairy Folk, whois named the Dark, he put that shape upon me by his sorceries, and Ihave borne it these three years. But a slave of his, pitying me, oncerevealed to me that if I could win to thy great Dun of Allen, O Finn,I should be safe from all enchantments and my natural shape would cometo me again. But I feared to be torn in pieces by thy dogs, or woundedby thy hunters, till at last I let myself be overtaken by thee aloneand by Bran and Sceolaun, who have the nature of man and would do meno hurt." "Have no fear, maiden," said Finn, "we the Fianna, are freeand our guest-friends are free; there is none who shall put compulsionon you here."So Saba dwelt with Finn, and he made her his wife; and so deep was hislove for her that neither the battle nor the chase had any delight forhim, and for months he never left her side. She also loved him asdeeply, and their joy in each other was like that of the Immortals inthe Land of Youth. But at last word came to Finn that the warships ofthe Northmen were in the bay of Dublin, and he summoned his heroes tothe fight, "for," said he to Saba, "the men of Erinn give us tributeand hospitality to defend them from the foreigner, and it were shameto take it from them and not to give that to which we, on our side,are pledged." And he called to mind that great saying of Goll macMorna when they were once sore bested by a mighty host--"a man," saidGoll, "lives after his life but not after his honour."Seven days was Finn absent, and he drove the Northmen from the shoresof Erinn. But on the eighth day he returned, and when he entered hisDun he saw trouble in the eyes of his men and of their fair womenfolk,and Saba was not on the rampart expecting his return. So he bade themtell him what had chanced, and they said--"Whilst thou, our father and lord, wert afar off smiting theforeigner, and Saba looking ever down the pass for thy return, we sawone day as it were the likeness of thee approaching, and Bran andSceolaun at thy heels. And we seemed also to hear the notes of theFian hunting call blown on the wind. Then Saba hastened to the greatgate, and we could not stay her, so eager was she to rush to thephantom. But when she came near, she halted and gave a loud and bittercry, and the shape of thee smote her with a hazel wand, and lo, therewas no woman there any more, but a deer. Then those hounds chased it,and ever as it strove to reach again the gate of the Dun they turnedit back. We all now seized what arms we could and ran out to driveaway the enchanter, but when we reached the place there was nothing tobe seen, only still we heard the rushing of flying feet and the bayingof dogs, and one thought it came from here, and another from there,till at last the uproar died away and all was still. What we could do,O Finn, we did; Saba is gone."Finn then struck his hand on his breast but spoke no word, and he wentto his own chamber. No man saw him for the rest of that day, nor forthe day after. Then he came forth, and ordered the matters of theFianna as of old, but for seven years thereafter he went searching forSaba through every remote glen and dark forest and cavern of Ireland,and he would take no hounds with him save Bran and Sceolaun. But atlast he renounced all hope of finding her again, and went hunting asof old. One day as he was following the chase on Ben Gulban in Sligo,he heard the musical bay of the dogs change of a sudden to a fiercegrowling and yelping as though they were in combat with some beast,and running hastily up he and his men beheld, under a great tree, anaked boy with long hair, and around him the hounds struggling toseize him, but Bran and Sceolaun fighting with them and keeping themoff. And the lad was tall and shapely, and as the heroes gatheredround he gazed undauntedly on them, never heeding the rout of dogs athis feet. The Fians beat off the dogs and brought the lad home withthem, and Finn was very silent and continually searched the lad'scountenance with his eyes. In time, the use of speech came to him, andthe story that he told was this:--He had known no father, and no mother save a gentle hind with whom helived in a most green and pleasant valley shut in on every side bytowering cliffs that could not be scaled, or by deep chasms in theearth. In the summer he lived on fruits and such-like, and in thewinter, store of provisions was laid for him in a cave. And there cameto them sometimes a tall dark-visaged man, who spoke to his mother,now tenderly, and now in loud menace, but she always shrunk away infear, and the man departed in anger. At last there came a day when theDark Man spoke very long with his mother in all tones of entreaty andof tenderness and of rage, but she would still keep aloof and give nosign save of fear and abhorrence. Then at length the Dark Man drewnear and smote her with a hazel wand; and with that he turned and wenthis way, but she, this time, followed him, still looking back at herson and piteously complaining. And he, when he strove to follow, foundhimself unable to move a limb; and crying out with rage and desolationhe fell to the earth and his senses left him. When he came to himselfhe was on the mountain side, on Ben Gulban, where he remained somedays, searching for that green and hidden valley, which he never foundagain. And after a while the dogs found him; but of the hind hismother and of the Dark Druid, there is no man knows the end.Finn called his name Oisin, and he became a warrior of fame, but farmore famous for the songs and tales that he made; so that of allthings to this day that are told of the Fianna of Erinn, men are wontto say, "So sang the bard, Oisin, son of Finn."CHAPTER XVOisin in the Land of YouthIt happened that on a misty summer morning as Finn and Oisin with manycompanions were hunting on the shores of Loch Lena they saw comingtowards them a maiden, beautiful exceedingly, riding on a snow-whitesteed. She wore the garb of a queen; a crown of gold was on her head,and a dark brown mantle of silk, set with stars of red gold, fellaround her and trailed on the ground. Silver shoes were on her horse'shoofs, and a crest of gold nodded on his head. When she came near shesaid to Finn, "From very far away I have come, and now at last I havefound thee, Finn, son of Cumhal."Then Finn said, "What is thy land and race, maiden, and what dost thouseek from me?""My name," she said, "is Niam of the Golden Hair. I am the daughter ofthe King of the Land of Youth, and that which has brought me here isthe love of thy son Oisin." Then she turned to Oisin and she spoke tohim in the voice of one who has never asked anything but it wasgranted to her, "Wilt thou go with me, Oisin, to my father's land?"And Oisin said, "That will I, and to the world's end"; for the fairyspell had so wrought upon his heart that he cared no more for anyearthly thing but to have the love of Niam of the Head of Gold.Then the maiden spoke of the Land Oversea to which she had summonedher lover, and as she spoke a dreamy stillness fell on all things, nordid a horse shake his bit nor a hound bay, nor the least breath ofwind stir in the forest trees till she had made an end. And what shesaid seemed sweeter and more wonderful as she spoke it than anythingthey could afterwards remember to have heard, but so far as they couldremember it, it was this:--   "Delightful is the land beyond all dreams,   Fairer than aught thine eyes have ever seen.   There all the year the fruit is on the tree,   And all the year the bloom is on the flower.   "There with wild honey drip the forest trees;   The stores of wine and mead shall never fail.   Nor pain nor sickness knows the dweller there,   Death and decay come near him never more.   "The feast shall cloy not, nor the chase shall tire,   Nor music cease for ever through the hall;   The gold and jewels of the Land of Youth   Outshine all splendours ever dreamed by man.   "Thou shalt have horses of the fairy breed,   Thou shalt have hounds that can outrun the wind;   A hundred chiefs shall follow thee in war,   A hundred maidens sing thee to thy sleep.   "A crown of sovranty thy brow shall wear,   And by thy side a magic blade shall hang.   Thou shalt be lord of all the Land of Youth,   And lord of Niam of the Head of Gold."As the magic song ended, the Fians beheld Oisin mount the fairy steedand hold the maiden in his arms, and ere they could stir or speak sheturned her horse's head and shook the ringing bridle and down theforest glade they fled, as a beam of light flies over the land whenclouds drive across the sun; and never did the Fianna behold Oisin,son of Finn, on earth again.Yet what befell him afterwards is known. As his birth was strange sowas his end, for he saw the wonders of the Land of Youth with mortaleyes and lived to tell them with mortal lips.When the white horse with its riders reached the sea it ran lightlyover the waves and soon the green woods and headlands of Erinn fadedout of sight. And now the sun shone fiercely down, and the riderspassed into a golden haze in which Oisin lost all knowledge of wherehe was or if sea or dry land were beneath his horse's hoofs. Butstrange sights sometimes appeared to them in the mist, for towers andpalace gateways loomed up and disappeared, and once a hornless doebounded by them chased by a white hound with one red ear, and againthey saw a young maid ride by on a brown steed, bearing a golden applein her hand, and close behind her followed a young horseman on a whitesteed, a purple cloak floating at his back and a gold-hilted sword inhis hand. And Oisin would have asked the princess who and what theseapparitions were, but Niam bade him ask nothing nor seem to notice anyphantom they might see until they were come to the Land of Youth.[Illustration: "They rode up to a stately palace"]At last the sky gloomed above them, and Niam urged their steed faster.The wind lashed them with pelting rain, thunder roared across the seaand lightning blazed, but they held on their way till at length theycame once more into a region of calm and sunshine. And now Oisin sawbefore him a shore of yellow sand, lapped by the ripples of a summersea. Inland, there rose before his eye wooded hills amid which hecould discern the roofs and towers of a noble city. The white horsebore them swiftly to the shore and Oisin and the maiden lighted down.And Oisin marvelled at everything around him, for never was water soblue or trees so stately as those he saw, and the forest was alivewith the hum of bees and the song of birds, and the creatures that arewild in other lands, the deer and the red squirrel and the wood-dove,came, without fear, to be caressed. Soon, as they went forward, thewalls of a city came in sight, and folk began to meet them on theroad, some riding, some afoot, all of whom were either youths ormaidens, all looking as joyous as if the morning of happy life hadjust begun for them, and no old or feeble person was to be seen. Niamled her companion through a towered gateway built of white and redmarble, and there they were met by a glittering company of a hundredriders on black steeds and a hundred on white, and Oisin mounted ablack horse and Niam her white, and they rode up to a stately palacewhere the King of the Land of Youth had his dwelling. And there hereceived them, saying in a loud voice that all the folk could hear,"Welcome, Oisin, son of Finn. Thou art come to the Land of Youth,where sorrow and weariness and death shall never touch thee. This thouhast won by thy faithfulness and valour and by the songs that thouhast made for the men of Erinn, whereof the fame is come to us, for wehave here indeed all things that are delightful and joyous, but poesyalone we had not. But now we have the chief poet of the race of men tolive with us, immortal among immortals, and the fair and cloudlesslife that we lead here shall be praised in verses as fair; even asthou, Oisin, did'st praise and adorn the short and toilsome andchequered life that men live in the world thou hast left forever. AndNiam my daughter shall be thy bride, and thou shalt be in all thingseven as myself in the Land of Youth."Then the heart of Oisin was filled with glory and joy, and he turnedto Niam and saw her eyes burn with love as she gazed upon him. Andthey were wedded the same day, and the joy they had in each other grewsweeter and deeper with every day that passed. All that Niam hadpromised in her magic song in the wild wood when first they met,seemed faint beside the splendour and beauty of the life in the Landof Youth. In the great palace they trod on silken carpets and ate offplates of gold; the marble walls and doorways were wrought with carvedwork, or hung with tapestries, where forest glades, and still lakes,and flying deer were done in colours of unfading glow. Sunshine bathedthat palace always, and cool winds wandered through its dim corridors,and in its courts there played fountains of bright water set aboutwith flowers. When Oisin wished to ride, a steed of fiery but gentletemper bore him wherever he would through the pleasant land; when helonged to hear music, there came upon his thought, as though borne onthe wind, crystal notes such as no hand ever struck from the stringsof any harp on earth.But Oisin's hand now never touched the harp, and the desire of singingand of making poetry never waked in him, for no one thing seemed somuch better than the rest, where all perfection bloomed and glowedaround him, as to make him long to praise it and to set it apart.When seven days had passed, he said to Niam, "I would fain goa-hunting." Niam said, "So be it, dear love; to-morrow we shall takeorder for that." Oisin lay long awake that night, thinking of thesound of Finn's hunting-horn, and of the smell of green boughs whenthey kindled them to roast the deer-flesh in Fian ovens in thewildwood.So next day Oisin and Niam fared forth on horseback, with theircompany of knights and maidens, and dogs leaping and barking witheagerness for the chase. Anon they came to the forest, and the hunterswith the hounds made a wide circuit on this side and on that, till atlast the loud clamour of the hounds told that a stag was on foot, andOisin saw them streaming down an open glen, the stag with its greatantlers laid back and flying like the wind. So he shouted the Fianhunting-cry and rode furiously on their track. All day long theychased the stag through the echoing forest, and the fairy steed borehim unfaltering over rough ground and smooth, till at last as darknessbegan to fall the quarry was pulled down, and Oisin cut its throatwith his hunting-knife. Long it seemed to him since he had felt gladand weary as he felt now, and since the woodland air with its odoursof pine and mint and wild garlic had tasted so sweet in his mouth; andtruly it was longer than he knew. But when he bade make ready thewood-oven for their meal, and build a bothy of boughs for theirrepose, Niam led him seven steps apart and seven to the left hand, andyet seven back to the place where they had killed the deer, and lo,there rose before him a stately Dun with litten windows and smokedrifting above its roof. When they entered, there was a table spreadfor a great company, and cooks and serving-men busy about a widehearth where roast and boiled meats of every sort were being prepared.Casks of Greek wine stood open around the walls, and cups of gold wereon the board. So they all ate and drank their sufficiency, and allnight Oisin and Niam slept on a bed softer than swans-down in achamber no less fair than that which they had in the City of the Landof Youth.Next day, at the first light of dawn, they were on foot; and soonagain the forest rang to the baying of hounds and the music of thehunting-horn. Oisin's steed bore him all day, tireless and swift asbefore, and again the quarry fell at night's approach, and again apalace rose in the wilderness for their night's entertainment, and allthings in it even more abundant and more sumptuous than before. And sofor seven days they fared in that forest, and seven stags were slain.Then Oisin grew wearied of hunting, and as he plunged his sharp blackhunting-knife into the throat of the last stag, he thought of thesword of magic temper that hung idle by his side in the City of Youth,or rested from its golden nail in his bed-chamber, and he said toNiam, "Has thy father never a foe to tame, never a wrong to avenge?Surely the peasant is no man whose hand forgets the plough, nor thewarrior whose hand forgets the sword hilt." Niam looked on himstrangely for a while and as if she did not understand his words, orsought some meaning in them which yet she feared to find. But at lastshe said, "If deeds of arms be thy desire, Oisin, thou shalt have thysufficiency ere long." And so they rode home, and slept that night inthe palace of the City of Youth.At daybreak on the following morn Niam roused Oisin, and she buckledon him his golden-hilted sword and his corselet of blue steel inlaidwith gold. Then he put on his head a steel and gold helmet with dragoncrest, and slung on his back a shield of bronze wrought all over withcunning hammer-work of serpentine lines that swelled and sank upon thesurface, and coiled in mazy knots, or flowed in long sweeping curveslike waves of the sea when they gather might and volume for their leapupon the sounding shore. In the glimmering dawn, through the emptystreets of the fair city, they rode forth alone and took their waythrough fields of corn and by apple orchards where red fruit hung downto their hands. But by noontide their way began to mount upwards amongblue hills that they had marked from the city walls toward the west,and of man's husbandry they saw no more, but tall red-stemmed pinetrees bordered the way on either side, and silence and lonelinessincreased. At length they reached a broad table-land deep in the heartof the mountains, where nothing grew but long coarse grass, droopingby pools of black and motionless water, and where great boulders,bleached white or stained with slimy lichens of livid red, layscattered far and wide about the plain. Against the sky the mountainline now showed like a threat of bared and angry teeth, and as theyrode towards it Oisin perceived a huge fortress lying in the throat ofa wide glen or mountain pass. White as death was the stone of which itwas built, save where it was streaked with black or green from thefoulness of wet mosses that clung to its cornices and battlements, andnone seemed stirring about the place nor did any banner blow from itstowers.Then said Niam, "This, O Oisin, is the Dun of the giant Fovor of theMighty Blows. In it he keeps prisoner a princess of the Fairy Folkwhom he would fain make his bride, but he may not do so, nor may sheescape, until Fovor has met in battle a champion who will undertakeher cause. Approach, then, to the gate, if thou art fain to undertakethis adventure, and blow the horn which hangs thereby, and then lookto thy weapons, for soon indeed will the battle be broken upon thee."Then Oisin rode to the gate and thrice he blew on the great horn whichhung by it, and the clangour of it groaned drearily back from thecliffs that overhung the glen. Not thus indeed sounded the _Dord_ ofFinn as its call blew lust of fighting and scorn of death into thehearts of the Fianna amid the stress of battle. At the third blast therusty gates opened, grinding on their hinges, and Oisin rode into awide courtyard where servitors of evil aspect took his horse andNiam's, and led them into the hall of Fovor. Dark it was and low, withmouldering arras on its walls, and foul and withered rushes on thefloor, where dogs gnawed the bones thrown to them at the last meal,and spilt ale and hacked fragments of flesh littered the bare oakentable. And here rose languidly to greet them a maiden bound with sevenchains, to whom Niam spoke lovingly, saying that her champion was comeand that her long captivity should end. And the maiden looked uponOisin, whose proud bearing and jewelled armour made the mean placeseem meaner still, and a light of hope and of joy seemed to glimmerupon her brow. So she gave them refreshment as she could, andafterwards they betook them once more to the courtyard, where theplace of battle was set.Here, at the further side, stood a huge man clad in rusty armour, whowhen he saw Oisin rushed upon him, silent and furious, and swinging agreat battleaxe in his hand. But doubt and langour weighed uponOisin's heart, and it seemed to him as if he were in an evil dream,which he knew was but a dream, and would be less than nothing when thehour of awakening should come. Yet he raised his shield and grippedthe fairy sword, striving to shout the Fian battle-cry as he closedwith Fovor. But soon a heavy blow smote him to the ground, and hisarmour clanged harshly on the stones. Then a cloud seemed to pass fromhis spirit, and he leaped to his feet quicker than an arrow flies fromthe string, and thrusting fiercely at the giant his sword-point gashedthe under side of Fovor's arm when it was raised to strike, and Oisinsaw his enemy's blood. Then the fight raged hither and thither aboutthe wide courtyard, with trampling of feet and clash of steel andringing of armour and shouts of onset as the heroes closed; Oisin,agile as a wild stag, evading the sweep of the mighty axe and rushingin with flickering blade at every unguarded moment, his whole soulbent on one fierce thought, to drive his point into some gap atshoulder or neck in Fovor's coat of mail. At length, when both wereweary and wounded men, with hacked and battered armour, Oisin's bladecut the thong of Fovor's headpiece and it fell clattering to theground. Another blow laid the giant prostrate, and Oisin leaned, dizzyand panting, upon his sword, while Fovor's serving-men took off theirmaster in a litter, and Niam came to aid her lord. Then Oisin strippedoff his armour in the great hall, and Niam tended to his wounds,healing them with magic herbs and murmured incantations, and they sawthat one of the seven rusty chains that had bound the princess hungloose from its iron staple in the wall.All night long Oisin lay in deep and healing slumber, and next day hearose, whole and strong, and hot to renew the fray. And the giant waslikewise healed and his might and fierceness returned to him. So theyfought till they were breathless and weary, and then to it again, andagain, till in the end Oisin drove his sword to the hilt in thegiant's shoulder where it joins the collar bone, and he fell aswoon,and was borne away as before. And another chain of the seven fell fromthe girdle of the captive maiden.Thus for seven days went on the combat, and Oisin had seven nights ofhealing and rest, with the tenderness and beauty of Niam about hiscouch; and on the seventh day the maiden was free, and her folkbrought her away, rejoicing, with banners and with music that made abrightness for a while in that forlorn and evil place.But Oisin's heart was high with pride and victory, and a longinguprose in his heart with a rush like a springtide for the days whensome great deed had been done among the Fianna, and the victors werehailed and lauded by the home-folk in the Dun of Allen, men and womenleaving their toil or their pleasure to crowd round the heroes, and toquestion again and again, and to learn each thing that had passed; andthe bards noting all to weave it into a glorious tale for after days;and more than all the smile and the look of Finn as he learned how hischildren had borne themselves in the face of death. And so Oisin saidto Niam, "Let me, for a short while, return to the land of Erinn, thatI may see there my friends and kin and tell them of the glory and joythat are mine in the Land of Youth." But Niam wept and laid her whitearms about his neck, entreating him to think no more of the sad worldwhere all men live and move under a canopy of death, and where summeris slain by winter, and youth by old age, and where love itself, if itdie not by falsehood and wrong, perishes many a time of too completea joy. But Oisin said, "The world of men compared with thy world islike this dreary waste compared with the city of thy father; yet inthat city, Niam, none is better or worse than another, and I hunger totell my tale to ignorant and feeble folk that my words can move, aswords of mine have done of old, to wonder and delight. Then I shallreturn to thee, Niam, and to thy fair and blissful land; and havingbrought over to mortal men a tale that never man has told before, Ishall be happy and at peace for ever in the Land of Youth."So they fared back to the golden city, and next day Niam brought toOisin the white steed that had borne them from Erinn, and bade himfarewell. "This our steed," she said, "will carry thee across the seato the land where I found thee, and whithersoever thou wilt, and whatfolk are there thou shalt see, and what tale thou hast to tell can betold. But never for even a moment must thou alight from his back, forif thy foot once touch again the soil of earth, thou shalt never winto me and to the Land of Youth again. And sorely do I fear some evilchance. Was not the love of Niam of the Head of Gold enough to fill amortal's heart? But if thou must go, then go, and blessing and victorybe thine."Then Oisin held her long in his arms and kissed her, and vowed to makeno long stay and never to alight from the fairy steed. And then heshook the golden reins and the horse threw its head aloft and snortedand bore him away in a pace like that of flowing water for speed andsmoothness. Anon they came to the margin of the blue sea, and stillthe white steed galloped on, brushing the crests of the waves intoglittering spray. The sun glared upon the sea and Oisin's head swamwith the heat and motion, and in mist and dreams he rode where no daywas, nor night, nor any thought of time, till at last his horse'shoofs ploughed through wet, yellow sands, and he saw black rocksrising up at each side of a little bay, and inland were fields greenor brown, and white cottages thatched with reeds, and men and women,toil-worn and clad in earth-coloured garments, went to and fro abouttheir tasks or stopped gazing at the rider in his crimson cloak and atthe golden trappings of his horse. But among the cottages was a smallhouse of stone such as Oisin had never seen in the land of Erinn;stone was its roof as well as the walls, very steep and high, andnear-by from a rude frame of timber there hung a bell of bronze. Intothis house there passed one whom from his shaven crown Oisin guessedto be a druid, and behind him two lads in white apparel. The druidhaving seen the horseman turned his eyes again to the ground andpassed on, regarding him not, and the lads did likewise. And Oisinrode on, eager to reach the Dun upon the Hill of Allen and to see thefaces of his kin and his friends.[Illustration: "The white steed had vanished from their eyes like awreath of mist"]At length, coming from the forest path into the great clearing wherethe Hill of Allen was wont to rise broad and green, with its rampartenclosing many white-walled dwellings, and the great hall toweringhigh in the midst, he saw but grassy mounds overgrown with rank weedsand whin bushes, and among them pastured a peasant's kine.Then a strange horror fell upon him, and he thought some enchantmentfrom the land of Faery held his eyes and mocked him with falsevisions. He threw his arms abroad and shouted the names of Finn andOscar, but none replied, and he thought that perchance the houndsmight hear him, and he cried upon Bran and Sceolaun, and strained hisears if they might catch the faintest rustle or whisper of the worldfrom the sight of which his eyes were holden, but he heard only thesigh of the wind in the whins. Then he rode in terror from that place,setting his face towards the eastern sea, for he meant to traverseIreland from side to side and end to end in the search of some escapefrom his enchantment. But when he came near to the eastern sea and wasnow in the place which is called the Valley of the Thrushes,[24] hesaw in a field upon the hillside a crowd of men striving to roll asidea great boulder from their tilled land, and an overseer directingthem. Towards them he rode, meaning to ask them concerning Finn andthe Fianna. As he came near, they all stopped their work to gaze uponhim, for to them he appeared like a messenger of the Fairy Folk or anangel from heaven. Taller and mightier he was than the men-folk theyknew, with sword-blue eyes and brown ruddy cheeks; in his mouth, asit were, a shower of pearls, and bright hair clustered beneath the rimof his helmet. And as Oisin looked upon their puny forms, marred bytoil and care, and at the stone which they feebly strove to heave fromits bed, he was filled with pity, and thought to himself, "not suchwere even the churls of Erinn when I left them for the Land of Youth,"and he stooped from his saddle to help them. His hand he set to theboulder, and with a mighty heave he lifted it from where it lay andset it rolling down the hill. And the men raised a shout of wonder andapplause, but their shouting changed in a moment into cries of terrorand dismay, and they fled, jostling and overthrowing each other toescape from the place of fear; for a marvel horrible to see had takenplace. For Oisin's saddle-girth had burst as he heaved the stone, andhe fell headlong to the ground. In an instant the white steed hadvanished from their eyes like a wreath of mist, and that which rose,feeble and staggering, from the ground was no youthful warrior but aman stricken with extreme old age, white-bearded and withered, whostretched out groping hands and moaned with feeble and bitter cries.And his crimson cloak and yellow silken tunic were now but coarsehomespun stuff tied with a hempen girdle, and the gold-hilted swordwas a rough oaken staff such as a beggar carries who wanders the roadsfrom farmer's house to house.   [24] Glanismole, near Dublin.When the people saw that the doom that had been wrought was not forthem they returned, and found the old man prone on the ground withhis face hidden in his arms. So they lifted him up and asked who hewas and what had befallen him. Oisin gazed round on them with dimeyes, and at last he said, "I was Oisin the son of Finn, and I pray yetell me where he now dwells, for his Dun on the Hill of Allen is now adesolation, and I have neither seen him nor heard his hunting hornfrom the Western to the Eastern Sea." Then the men gazed strangely oneach other and on Oisin, and the overseer asked, "Of what Finn dostthou speak, for there be many of that name in Erinn?" Oisin said,"Surely of Finn mac Cumhal mac Trenmor, captain of the Fianna ofErinn." Then the overseer said, "Thou art daft, old man, and thou hastmade us daft to take thee for a youth as we did a while agone. But weat least have now our wits again, and we know that Finn son of Cumhaland all his generation have been dead these three hundred years. Atthe battle of Gowra fell Oscar, son of Oisin, and Finn at the battleof Brea, as the historians tell us; and the lays of Oisin, whose deathno man knows the manner of, are sung by our harpers at great men'sfeasts. But now the Talkenn,[25] Patrick, has come into Ireland andhas preached to us the One God and Christ His Son, by whose mightthese old days and ways are done away with, and Finn and his Fianna,with their feasting and hunting and songs of war and of love, have nosuch reverence among us as the monks and virgins of holy Patrick, andthe psalms and prayers that go up daily to cleanse us from sin and tosave us from the fire of judgment." But Oisin replied, half hearingand still less comprehending what was said to him, "If thy God haveslain Finn and Oscar, I would say that God is a strong man." Then theyall cried out upon him, and some picked up stones, but the overseerbade them let him be until the Talkenn had spoken with him, and tillhe should order what was to be done.   [25] Talkenn or "Adze-head" was a name given to St Patrick by   the Irish. Probably it referred to the shape of his tonsure.So they brought him to Patrick, who entreated him gently andhospitably, and to Patrick he told the story of all that had befallenhim. But Patrick bade his scribes write all carefully down, that thememory of the heroes whom Oisin had known, and of the joyous and freelife they had led in the woods and glens and wild places of Erinn,should never be forgotten among men. And Oisin, during the short spanof life that yet remained to him, told to Patrick many tales of theFianna and their deeds, but of the three hundred years that he hadspent with Niam in the Land of Youth he rarely spoke, for they seemedto him but as a vision or a dream of the night, set between a sunnyand a rainy day.THE HISTORY OF KING CORMACCHAPTER XVIITHE BIRTH OF CORMACOf all the kings that ruled over Ireland, none had a better and moreloyal servant than was Finn mac Cumhal, and of all the captains andcounsellors of kings none ever served a more glorious and a noblermonarch than did Finn, for the time that he served Cormac, son of Art,son of Conn of the Hundred Battles. At the time at which this monarchlived and reigned, the mist of sixteen centuries hangs between us andthe history of Ireland, but through this mist there shine a few greatand sunlike figures whose glory cannot be altogether hidden, and ofthese figures Cormac is the greatest and the brightest. Much that istold about him may be true, and much is certainly fable, but thefables themselves are a witness to his greatness; they are like formsseen in the mist when a great light is shining behind it, and wecannot always say when we are looking at the true light and when atthe reflected glory.The birth of Cormac was on this wise. His father, as we have said, wasArt, son of Conn, and his mother was named Achta, being the daughterof a famous smith or ironworker of Connacht. Now before the birth ofCormac, Achta had a strange dream, namely, that her head was struckoff from her body and that out of her neck there grew a great treewhich extended its branches over all Ireland and flourishedexceedingly, but a huge wave of the sea burst upon it and laid it low.Then from the roots of this tree there grew up another, but it did notattain the splendour of the first, and a blast of wind came from theWest and overthrew it. On this the woman started from her sleep, andshe woke her husband, Art, and told him her vision. "It is a truedream," said Art. "I am thy head, and this portends that I shall beviolently taken from thee. But thou shalt bear me a son who shall beKing of all Ireland, and shall rule with great power and glory untilsome disaster from the sea overtake him. But from him shall come yetanother king, my grandson and thine, who shall also be cut down, and Ithink that the cause of his fall shall be the armies of the Fian host,who are swift and keen as the wind."Not long thereafter Art, son of Conn, fell in battle with the Pictsand Britons at the Plain of the Swine, which is between Athenry andGalway in Connacht. Now the leader of the invaders then was mac Con, anephew to Art, who had been banished out of Ireland for rising againstthe High King; and when he had slain Art he seized the sovranty ofIreland and reigned there unlawfully for many years.But before the battle, Art had counselled his wife:"If things go ill with us in the fight, and I am slain, seek out myfaithful friend Luna who dwells in Corann in Connacht, and he willprotect thee till thy son be born." So Achta, with one maid, fled inher chariot before the host of mac Con and sought to go to the Dun ofLuna. On her way thither, however, the hour came when her child shouldbe born, and the maid turned the chariot aside into the wild wood atthe place called Creevagh (the Place of the Twigs), and there, on acouch of twigs and leaves, she gave birth to a noble son.Then Achta, when she had cherished her boy and rejoiced over him, badeher handmaid keep watch over both of them, and they fell asleep. Butthe maid's eyes were heavy with weariness and long travelling, and erelong she, too, was overpowered by slumber, and all three slept a deepsleep while the horses wandered away grazing through the wood.By and by there came a she-wolf roaming through the wood in search ofprey for her whelps, and it came upon the sleeping woman and thelittle child. It did not wake the woman, but very softly it picked upthe infant and bore it off to the stony cave that is hard by toCreevagh in the hill that was afterwards called Mount Cormac.After a while the mother waked up and found her child gone. Then sheuttered a lamentable cry, and woke her handmaid, and both the womensearched hither and thither, but no trace of the child could theyfind; and thus Luna found them; for he had heard news of the battleand the death of his King, and he had come to succour Achta as he hadpledged his word to do. Luna and his men also made search for theinfant, but in vain; and at last he conveyed the two sorrowing womento his palace; but Achta was somewhat comforted by her propheticdream. Luna then proclaimed that whoever should discover the King'sson, if he were yet alive, might claim of him what reward he would.And so the time passed, till one day a man named Grec, a clansman ofLuna the lord of Corann, as he ranged the woods hunting, came on astony cavern in the side of a hill, and before it he saw wolf-cubs atplay, and among them a naked child on all fours gambolling with them,and a great she-wolf that mothered them all. "Right," cried Grec, andoff he goes to Luna his lord. "What wilt thou give me for the King'sson?" said he. "What wilt thou have?" said Luna. So Grec asked forcertain lands, and Luna bound himself to give them to him and to hisposterity, and there lived and flourished the Clan Gregor for many ageneration to come. So Luna, guided by Grec, went to the cave on MountCormac, and took the child and the wolf-cubs all together and broughtthem home. And the child they called Cormac, or the Chariot-Child. Nowthe lad grew up very comely and strong, and he abode with Luna inConnacht, and no one told him of his descent.IITHE JUDGMENT OF CORMACOnce upon a time it happened that Cormac was at play with the two sonsof Luna, and the lads grew angry in their play and came to blows, andCormac struck one of them to the ground. "Sorrow on it," cried thelad, "here I have been beaten by one that knows not his clan orkindred, save that he is a fellow without a father." When Cormac heardthat he was troubled and ashamed, and he went to Luna and told himwhat had been said.And Luna seeing the trouble of the youth, and also that he was strongand noble to look on, and wise and eloquent in speech, held that thetime was now come to reveal to him his descent. "Thou hadst indeed aclan and kindred," he said, "and a father of the noblest, for thou artthe son of Art, the High King of Ireland, who was slain anddispossessed by mac Con. But it is foretold that thou shalt yet cometo thy father's place, and the land pines for thee even now, for thereis no good yield from earth or sea under the unlawful rule of him whonow sits on the throne of Art.""If that be so," said Cormac, "let us go to Tara, and bide our timethere in my father's house."So the two of them set out for Tara on the morrow morn. And this wasthe retinue they had with them: a body-guard of outlawed men that hadrevolted against mac Con and other lords and had gathered themselvestogether at Corann under Luna, and four wolves that had been cubs withCormac when the she-wolf suckled him.When they came to Tara, the folk there wondered at the fierce-eyedwarriors and the grey beasts that played like dogs around Cormac, andthe lad was adopted as a pupil by the King, to be taught arms andpoetry and law. Much talk there was of his coming, and of his strangecompanions that are not wont to be the friends of man, and as the ladgrew in comeliness and in knowledge the eyes of all were turned to himmore and more, because the rule of mac Con was not good.So the time wore on, till one day a case came for judgment before theKing, in which the Queen sued a certain wealthy woman and an owner ofherds named Benna, for that the sheep of Benna had strayed into theQueen's fields and had eaten to the ground a crop of woad[26] that wasgrowing there. The King gave judgment, that the sheep which had eatenthe woad were to be given to the Queen in compensation for what theyhad destroyed. Then Cormac rose up before the people and said, "Nay,but let the wool of the sheep, when they are next shorn, be given tothe Queen, for the woad will grow again and so shall the wool." "Atrue judgment, a true judgment," cried all the folk that were presentin the place; "a very king's son is he that hath pronounced it." Andthey murmured so loudly against mac Con that his druids counselled himto quit Tara lest a worse thing befall him. So he gave up the sovrantyto Cormac and went southward into Munster to rally his friends thereand recover the kingdom, and there he was slain by Cormac's men as hewas distributing great largesse of gold and silver to his followers,in the place called The Field of the Gold.   [26] Woad is a cruciferous plant, _Isatis tinctoria_, used for   dyeing.So Cormac, son of Art, ruled in Tara and was High King of all Ireland.And the land, it is said, knew its rightful lord, and yielded harvestssuch as never were known, while the forest trees dripped with theabundance of honey and the lakes and rivers were alive with fish. Somuch game was there, too, that the folk could have lived on that aloneand never put a ploughshare in the soil. In Cormac's time the autumnwas not vexed with rain, nor the spring with icy winds, nor the summerwith parching heat, nor the winter with whelming snows. His rule inErinn, it is said, was like a wand of gold laid on a dish of silver.Also he rebuilt the ramparts of Tara and made it strong, and heenlarged the great banqueting hall and made pillars of cedar in itornamented with plates of bronze, and painted its lime-white walls inpatterns of red and blue. Palaces for the women he also made there,and store-houses, and halls for the fighting men--never was Tara sopopulous or so glorious before or since. And for his wisdom andrighteousness knowledge was given to him that none other in Irelandhad as yet, for it was revealed to him that the Immortal Ones whom theGael worshipped were but the names of One whom none can name, and thathis message should ere long come to Ireland from over the eastern sea,calling the people to a sweeter and diviner faith.And to the end of his life it was his way to have wolves about him,for he knew their speech and they his, and they were friendly and tamewith him and his folk, since they were foster-brothers together in thewild wood.IIITHE MARRIAGE OF KING CORMACIt happened that in Cormac's time there was a very wealthy farmernamed Buicad[27] who dwelt in Leinster, and had vast herds of cattleand sheep and horses. This Buicad and his wife had no children, butthey adopted a foster-child named Ethne, daughter of one Dunlang. NowBuicad was the most hospitable of men, and never refused aught toanyone, but he kept open house for all the nobles of Leinster whocame with their following and feasted there as they would, day afterday; and if any man fancied any of the cattle or other goods ofBuicad, he might take them home with him, and none said him nay. ThusBuicad lived in great splendour, and his Dun was ever full toprofusion with store of food and clothing and rich weapons, until intime it was all wasted away in boundless hospitality and generosity,and so many had had a share in his goods that they could never berecovered nor could it be said of any man that he was the cause ofBuicad's undoing. But undone he was at last, and when there remainedto him but one bull and seven cows he departed by night with his wifeand Ethne from Dun Buicad, leaving his mansion desolate. And hetravelled till he came to a place where there was a grove of oak treesby a little stream in the county of Meath, near where Cormac had asummer palace, and there he built himself a little hut and tended hisfew cattle, and Ethne waited as a maid-servant upon him and his wife.   [27] Pronounced Bwee-cad. His name is said to be preserved in   the townland of Dunboyke, near Blessington, Co. Wicklow.Now on a certain day it happened that King Cormac rode out onhorseback from his Dun in Meath, and in the course of his ride he cameupon the little herd of Buicad towards evening, and he saw Ethnemilking the cows. And this was the way she milked them: first shemilked a portion of each cow's milk into a certain vessel, then shetook a second vessel and milked into it the remaining portion, inwhich was the richest cream, and these two vessels she kept apart.Cormac watched all this. She then bore the vessels of milk into thehut, and came out again with two other vessels and a small cup. Theseshe bore down to the river-side; and one of the vessels she filled bymeans of the cup from the water at the brink of the stream, but theother vessel she bore out into the middle of the stream and therefilled it from the deepest of the running water. After this she took asickle and began cutting rushes by the river-side, and Cormac saw thatwhen she cut a wisp of long rushes she would put it on one side, andthe short rushes on the other, and she bore them separately into thehouse. But Cormac stopped her and saluted her, and said:"For whom, maiden, art thou making this careful choice of the milk andthe rushes and the water?""I am making it," said she, "for one who is worthy that I should dofar more than that for him, if I could.""What is his name?""Buicad, the farmer," said Ethne."Is it that Buicad, who was the rich farmer in Leinster that allIreland has heard of?" asked the King."It is even so.""Then thou art his foster-child, Ethne the daughter of Dunlang?" saidCormac."I am," said Ethne."Wilt thou be my wife and Queen of Erinn?" then said Cormac."If it please my foster-father to give me to thee, O King, I amwilling," replied Ethne.Then Cormac took Ethne by the hand and they went before Buicad, and heconsented to give her to Cormac to wife. And Buicad was given richlands and great store of cattle in the district of Odran close byTara, and Ethne the Queen loved him and visited him so long as hislife endured.IVTHE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE KINGEthne bore to Cormac a son, her firstborn, named Cairbry, who was Kingof Ireland after Cormac. It was during the lifetime of Cormac thatCairbry came to the throne, for it happened that ere he died Cormacwas wounded by a chance cast of a spear and lost one of his eyes, andit was forbidden that any man having a blemish should be a king inIreland. Cormac therefore gave up the kingdom into the hands ofCairbry, but before he did so he told his son all the wisdom that hehad in the governing of men, and this was written down in a book whichis called _The Instructions of Cormac_.[28] These are among the thingswhich are found in it, of the wisdom of Cormac:--   [28] _The Instructions of Cormac_ (Tecosa Cormaic) have been   edited with a translation by Dr. Kuno Meyer in the Todd Lecture   Series of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. xv., April 1909.  "Let him (the king) restrain the great,   Let him exalt the good,   Let him establish peace,   Let him plant law,   Let him protect the just,   Let him bind the unjust,   Let his warriors be many and his counsellors few,   Let him shine in company and be the sun of the mead-hall,   Let him punish with a full fine wrong done knowingly,    and with a half-fine wrong done in ignorance."Cairbry said, "What are good customs for a tribe to pursue?" "They areas follows," replied Cormac:--   "To have frequent assemblies,    To be ever enquiring, to question the wise men,    To keep order in assemblies,    To follow ancient lore,    Not to crush the miserable,    To keep faith in treaties,    To consolidate kinship,    Fighting-men not to be arrogant,    To keep contracts faithfully,    To guard the frontiers against every ill.""Tell me, O Cormac," said Cairbry, "what are good customs for thegiver of a feast?" and Cormac said:--  "To have lighted lamps,   To be active in entertaining the company,   To be liberal in dispensing ale,   To tell stories briefly,   To be of joyous countenance,   To keep silence during recitals.""Tell me, O Cormac," said his son once, "what were thy habits whenthou wert a lad?" And Cormac said:--   "I was a listener in woods,    I was a gazer at stars,    I pried into no man's secrets,    I was mild in the hall,    I was fierce in the fray,    I was not given to making promises,    I reverenced the aged,    I spoke ill of no man in his absence,    I was fonder of giving than of asking.""If you listen to my teaching," said Cormac:--  "Do not deride any old person though you be young   Nor any poor man though you be rich,   Nor any naked though you be well-clad,   Nor any lame though you be swift,   Nor any blind though you be keen-sighted,   Nor any invalid though you be robust,   Nor any dull though you be clever,   Nor any fool though you be wise."Yet be not slothful, nor fierce, nor sleepy, nor niggardly, norfeckless nor envious, for all these are hateful before God and men."Do not join in blasphemy, nor be the butt of an assembly; be notmoody in an alehouse, and never forget a tryst.""What are the most lasting things on earth?" asked Cairbry."Not hard to tell," said Cormac; "they are grass, copper, and ayew-tree.""If you will listen to me," said Cormac, "this is my instruction forthe management of your household and your realm:--  "Let not a man with many friends be your steward,  Nor a woman with sons and foster-sons your housekeeper,  Nor a greedy man your butler,  Nor a man of much delay your miller,  Nor a violent, foul-mouthed man your messenger,  Nor a grumbling sluggard your servant,  Nor a talkative man your counsellor,  Nor a tippler your cup-bearer,  Nor a short-sighted man your watchman,  Nor a bitter, haughty man your doorkeeper,  Nor a tender-hearted man your judge,  Nor an ignorant man your leader,  Nor an unlucky man your counsellor."Such were the counsels that Cormac mac Art gave to his son Cairbry.And Cairbry became King after his father's abdication, and reignedseven and twenty years, till he and Oscar, son of Oisin, slew oneanother at the battle of Gowra.VCORMAC SETS UP THE FIRST MILL IN ERINNDuring the reign of Cormac it happened that some of the lords ofUlster made a raid upon the Picts in Alba[29] and brought home manycaptives. Among them was a Pictish maiden named Kiernit, daughter of aking of that nation, who was strangely beautiful, and for that theUlstermen sent her as a gift to King Cormac. And Cormac gave her as ahousehold slave to his wife Ethne, who set her to grinding corn with ahand-quern, as women in Erinn were used to do. One day as Cormac wasin the palace of the Queen he saw Kiernit labouring at her task andweeping as she wrought, for the toil was heavy and she was unused toit. Then Cormac was moved with compassion for the women that groundcorn throughout Ireland, and he sent to Alba for artificers to comeover and set up a mill, for up to then there were no mills in Ireland.Now there was in Tara, as there is to this day, a well of watercalled _The Pearly_, for the purity and brightness of the water thatsprang from it, and it ran in a stream down the hillside, as it stillruns, but now only in a slender trickle. Over this stream Cormac badethem build the first mill that was in Ireland, and the bright waterturned the wheel merrily round, and the women in Tara toiled at thequern no more.   [29] Scotland.VIA PLEASANT STORY OF CORMAC'S BREHONAmong other affairs which Cormac regulated for himself and all kingswho should come after him was the number and quality of the officerswho should be in constant attendance on the King. Of these he ordainedthat there should be ten, to wit one lord, one brehon, one druid, onephysician, one bard, one historian, one musician and three stewards.The function of the brehon, or judge, was to know the ancient customsand the laws of Ireland, and to declare them to the King whenever anymatter relating to them came before him. Now Cormac's chief brehon wasat first one Fithel. But Fithel's time came to die, and his sonFlahari,[30] a wise and learned man, trained by his father in all thelaws of the Gael, was to be brehon to the High King in his father'sstead. Fithel then called his son to his bedside and said:--   [30] Pronounced Fla'-haree--accent on the first syllable."Thou art well acquainted, my son, with all the laws and customs ofthe Gael, and worthy to be the chief brehon of King Cormac. But wisdomof life thou hast not yet obtained, for it is written in no law-book.This thou must learn for thyself, from life itself; yet somewhat of itI can impart unto thee, and it will keep thee in the path of safety,which is not easily trodden by those who are in the counsels of greatkings. Mark now these four precepts, and obey them, and thou wiltavoid many of the pit-falls in thy way:--  "Take not a king's son in fosterage,[31]  Impart no dangerous secret to thy wife,  Raise not the son of a serf to a high position,  Commit not thy purse or treasure to a sister's keeping."   [31] The institution of fosterage, by which the children of   kings and lords were given to trusted persons among their   friends or followers to bring up and educate, was a marked   feature of social life in ancient Ireland, and the bonds of   affection and loyalty between such foster-parents and their   children were held peculiarly sacred.Having said this Fithel died, and Flahari became chief brehon in hisstead.After a time Flahari thought to himself, "I am minded to test myfather's wisdom of life and to see if it be true wisdom or butwise-seeming babble. For knowledge is no knowledge until it be triedby life."So he went before the King and said, "If thou art willing, Cormac, Iwould gladly have one of thy sons in fosterage." At this Cormac waswell pleased, and a young child of the sons of Cormac was given toFlahari to bring up, and Flahari took the child to his own Dun, andthere began to nurture and to train him as it was fitting.After a time, however, Flahari one day took the child by the hand andwent with him into the deep recesses of the forest where dwelt one ofthe swine-herds who minded the swine of Flahari. To him Flahari handedover the child and bade him guard him as the apple of his eye, and tobe ready deliver him up again when he was required. The Flahari wenthome, and for some days went about like a man weighed down by gloomyand bitter thoughts. His wife marked that, and sought to know thereason, but Flahari put her off. At last when she continually pressedhim to reveal the cause of his trouble, he said "If them must needslearn what ails me, and if thou canst keep a secret full of danger tome and thee, know that I am gloomy and distraught because I havekilled the son of Cormac." At this the woman cried out, "Murdererparricide, hast thou spilled the King's blood, and shall Cormac notknow it, and do justice on thee?" And she sent word to Cormac that heshould come and seize her husband for that crime.But before the officers came, Flahari took a young man, the son of hisbutler, and placed him in charge of his lands to manage them, whileFlahari was away for his trial at Tara. And he also gave to his sistera treasure of gold and silver to keep for him, lest it should be madea spoil of while he was absent. Then he went with the officers toTara, denying his offence and his confession, but when Cormac hadheard all, and the child could not be found, he sentenced him to beput to death.Flahari then sent a messenger to his sister, begging her to send himat once a portion of the treasure he had left with her, that he mightuse it to make himself friends among the folk at court, and perchanceobtain a remission of his sentence; but she sent the messenger backagain empty, saying she knew not of what he spoke.On this Flahari deemed that the time was come to reveal the truth, sohe obtained permission from the King to send a message to hisswineherd before he died, and to hear the man's reply. And the messagewas this, that Murtach the herd should come without delay to Tara andbring with him the child that Flahari had committed to him. Howbeitthis messenger also came back empty, and reported that on reaching DunFlahari he had been met by the butler's son that was over the estate,who had questioned him of his errand, and had then said, "Murtach theserf has run away as soon as he heard of his lord's downfall, and ifhe had any child in his care he has taken it away with him, and hecannot be found." This he said because, on hearing of the child, heguessed what this might mean, and he had been the bitterest of all inurging Flahari's death, hoping to be rewarded with a share of hislands.Then Flahari said to himself, "Truly the proving of my father's wisdomof life has brought me very near to death." So he sent for the Kingand entreated him that he might be suffered to go himself to thedwelling of Murtach the herd, promising that the King's son should bethen restored to him, "or if not," said he, "let me then be slainthere without more ado." With great difficulty Cormac was moved toconsent to this, for he believed it was but a subterfuge of Flahari'sto put off the evil day or perchance to find a way of escape. But nextday Flahari was straitly bound and set in a chariot, and, with a guardof spearmen about him and Cormac himself riding behind, they set outfor Dun Flahari. Then Flahari guided them through the wild wood tillat last they came to the clearing where stood the dwelling of Murtachthe swineherd, and lo! there was the son of Cormac playing merrilybefore the door. And the child ran to his foster-father to kiss him,but when he saw Flahari in bonds he burst out weeping and would not beat peace until he was set free.Then Murtach slew one of the boars of his herd and made an oven in theearth after the manner of the Fianna, and made over it a fire ofboughs that he had drying in a shed. And when the boar was baked heset it before the company with ale and mead in methers of beechwood,and they all feasted and were glad of heart.Cormac then asked of Flahari why he had suffered himself to bebrought into this trouble. "I did so," said Flahari, "to prove thefour counsels which my father gave them ere he died, and I have provedthem and found them to be wise. In the first place, it is not wise forany man that is not a king to take the fosterage of a king's son, forif aught shall happen to the lad, his own life is in the king's handsand with his life he shall answer for it. Secondly, the keeping of asecret, said my father, is not in the nature of women in general,therefore no dangerous secret should be entrusted to them. The thirdcounsel my father gave me was not to raise up or enrich the son of aserf, for such persons are apt to forget benefits conferred on them,and moreover it irks them that he who raised them up should know thepoor estate from which they sprang. And good, too, is the fourthcounsel my father gave me, not to entrust my treasure to my sister,for it is the nature of most women to regard as spoil any valuablesthat are entrusted to them to keep for others."VIITHE JUDGMENT CONCERNING CORMAC'S SWORDWhen Cormac, son of Art, son of Conn of the Hundred Battles, was HighKing in Erinn, great was the peace and splendour of his reign, and noprovincial king or chief in any part of the country lifted up hishead against Cormac. At his court in Tara were many noble youths, whowere trained up there in all matters befitting their rank and station.One of these youths was named Socht, son of Fithel. Socht had awonderful sword, named "The Hard-headed Steeling," which was said tohave been long ago the sword of Cuchulain. It had a hilt of gold and abelt of silver, and its point was double-edged. At night it shone likea candle. If its point were bent back to the hilt it would fly backagain and be as straight as before. If it was held in running waterand a hair were floated down against the edge, it would sever thehair. It was a saying that this sword would make two halves of a man,and for a while he would not perceive what had befallen him. Thissword was held by Socht for a tribal possession from father andgrandfather.There was at this time a famous steward to the High King in Tara whosename was Dubdrenn. This man asked Socht to sell him the sword. Hepromised to Socht such a ration as he, Dubdrenn, had every night, andfour men's food for the family of Socht, and, after that, Socht tohave the full value of the sword at his own appraisement. "No," saidSocht. "I may not sell my father's treasures while he is alive."And thus they went on, Dubdrenn's mind ever running on the sword. Atlast he bade Socht to a drinking-bout, and plied him so with wine andmead that Socht became drunken, and knew not where he was, andfinally fell asleep.Then the steward takes the sword and goes to the King's brazier, byname Connu."Art thou able," says Dubdrenn, "to open the hilt of this sword?" "Iam that," says the brazier.Then the brazier took apart the hilt, and within, upon the tang of theblade, he wrote the steward's name, even Dubdrenn, and the stewardlaid the sword again by the side of Socht.So it was for three months after that, and the steward continued toask Socht to sell him the sword, but he could not get it from him.Then the steward brought a suit for the sword before the High King,and he claimed that it was his own and that it had been taken fromhim. But Socht declared that the sword was his by long possession andby equity, and he would not give it up.Then Socht went to his father, Fithel the brehon, and begged him totake part in the action and to defend his claim. But Fithel said,"Nay, thou art too apt to blame the pleadings of other men; plead forthyself."So the court was set, and Socht was called upon to prove that thesword was his. He swore that it was a family treasure, and thus it hadcome down to him.The steward said, "Well, O Cormac, the oath that Socht has uttered isa lie.""What proof hast thou of that?" asked Cormac."Not hard to declare," replied the steward. "If the sword be mine, myname stands graved therein, concealed within the hilt of the sword.""That will soon be known," says Cormac, and therewith he had thebrazier summoned. The brazier comes and breaks open the hilt and thename of Dubdrenn stands written within it. Thus a dead thing testifiedin law against a living man.Then Socht said, "Hear ye, O men of Erinn and Cormac the King! Iacknowledge that this man is the owner of the sword." And to Dubdrennhe said, "The property therein and all the obligations of it pass fromme to thee."Dubdrenn said, "I acknowledge property in the sword and all itsobligations."Then said Socht, "This sword was found in the neck of my grandfatherAngus, and till this day it never was known who had done that murder.Do justice, O King, for this crime."Said the King to Dubdrenn, "Thou art liable for more than the sword isworth." So he awarded to Socht the price of seven bondwomen asblood-fine for the slaying of Angus, and restitution of the sword toSocht. Then the steward confessed the story of the sword, and Cormaclevied seven other cumals from the brazier. But Cormac said, "This isin truth the sword of Cuchulain, and by it was slain my grandfather,even Conn of the Hundred Battles, at the hands of the King of Ulster,of whom it is written:--"With a host, with a valiant band Well did he go into Connacht. Alas,that he saw the blood of Conn On the side of Cuchulain's sword!"Then Cormac and Fithel agreed that the sword be given to Cormac asblood-fine for the death of Conn, and his it was; and it was the thirdbest of the royal treasures that were in Erin: namely, Cormac's Cup,that broke if a falsehood were spoken over it and became whole if atruth were spoken; and the Bell Branch that he got in Fairyland, whosemusic when it was shaken would put to sleep wounded men, and women intravail; and the Sword of Cuchulain, against which, and against theman that held it in his hand, no victory could ever be won.VIIITHE DISAPPEARANCE OF CORMACIn the chronicle of the Kings of Ireland that was written by Tiernathe Historian in the eleventh century after Christ's coming, there isnoted down in the annals of the year 248, "Disappearance of Cormac,grandson of Conn, for seven months." That which happened to Cormacduring these seven months is told in one of the bardic stories ofIreland, being the Story of Cormac's Journey to Fairyland, and thiswas the manner of it.One day Cormac, son of Art, was looking over the ramparts of his royalDun of Tara, when he saw a young man, glorious to look on in hisperson and his apparel, coming towards him across the plain of Bregia.The young man bore in his hand, as it were, a branch, from which hungnine golden bells formed like apples. When he shook the branch thenine apples beat against each other and made music so sweet that therewas no pain or sorrow in the world that a man would not forget whilehe hearkened to it."Does this branch belong to thee?" asked Cormac of the youth."Truly it does," replied the youth."Wilt thou sell it to me?" said Cormac."I never had aught that I would not sell for a price," said the youngman."What is thy price?" asked Cormac."The price shall be what I will," said the young man."I will give thee whatever thou desirest of all that is mine," saidCormac, for he coveted the branch exceedingly, and the enchantment washeavy upon him.So the youth gave him the bell-branch, and then said, "My price is thywife and thy son and thy daughter."Then they went together into the palace and found there Cormac's wifeand his children. "That is a wonderful jewel thou hast in thy hand,Cormac," said Ethne."It is," said Cormac, "and great is the price I have paid for it.""What is that price?" said Ethne."Even thou and thy children twain," said the King."Never hast thou done such a thing," cried Ethne, "as to prefer anytreasure in the world before us three!" And they all three lamentedand implored, but Cormac shook the branch and immediately their sorrowwas forgotten, and they went away willingly with the young man acrossthe plain of Bregia until a mist hid them from the eyes of Cormac. Andwhen the people murmured and complained against Cormac, for Ethne andher children were much beloved of them, Cormac shook the bell-branchand their grief was turned into joy.A year went by after this, and then Cormac longed for his wife andchildren again, nor could the bell-branch any longer bring himforgetfulness of them. So one morning he took the branch and went outalone from Tara over the plain, taking the direction in which they hadpassed away a year agone; and ere long little wreathes of mist beganto curl about his feet, and then to flit by him like long trailingrobes, and he knew no more where he was. After a time, however, hecame out again into sunshine and clear sky, and found himself in acountry of flowery meadows and of woods filled with singing-birdswhere he had never journeyed before. He walked on, till at last hecame to a great and stately mansion with a crowd of builders at workupon it, and they were roofing it with a thatch made of the wings ofstrange birds. But when they had half covered the house, their supplyof feathers ran short, and they rode off in haste to seek for more.While they were gone, however, a wind arose and whirled away thefeathers already laid on, so that the rafters were left bare asbefore. And this happened again and again, as Cormac gazed on them forhe knew not how long. At last his patience left him and he said, "Isee with that ye have been doing this since the beginning of theworld, and that ye will still be doing it in the end thereof," andwith that he went on his way.And many other strange things he saw, but of them we say nothing now,till he came to the gateway of a great and lofty Dun, where he enteredin and asked hospitality. Then there came to him a tall man clad in acloak of blue that changed into silver or to purple as its folds wavedin the light, and with him was a woman more beautiful than thedaughters of men, even she of whom it was said her beauty was as thatof a tear when it drops from the eyelid, so crystal-pure it was andbright.[32] They greeted Cormac courteously and begged him to staywith them for the night.   [32] See Miss Hull's CUCHULAIN, THE HOUND OF ULSTER, p. 175.   The pair were Mananan, god of the sea, and Fand his wife, of   whom a tale of great interest is told in the Cuchulain Cycle of   legends. The sea-cloak of Mananan is the subject of a   magnificent piece of descriptive poetry in Ferguson's CONGAL.Cormac then entered a great hall with pillars of cedar andmany-coloured silken hangings on the walls. In the midst of it was afire-place whereon the host threw a huge log, and shortly afterwardsbrought in a young pig which Cormac cut up to roast before the fire.He first put one quarter of the pig to roast, and then his host saidto him,"Tell us a tale, stranger, and if it be a true one the quarter will bedone as soon as the tale is told.""Do thou begin," said Cormac, "and then thy wife, and after that myturn will come.""Good," said the host. "This is my tale. I have seven of these swine,and with their flesh the whole world could be fed. When one of them iskilled and eaten, I need but put its bones into the pig-trough and onthe morrow it is alive and well again." They looked at the fireplace,and behold, the first quarter of the pig was done and ready to beserved.Then Cormac put on the second quarter, and the woman took up her tale."I have seven white cows," she said, "and seven pails are filled withthe milk of them each day. Though all the folk in the world weregathered together to drink of this milk, there would be enough and tospare for all." As soon as she had said that, they saw that the secondquarter of the pig was roasted.Then Cormac said: "I know you now, who you are; for it is Mananan thatowns the seven swine of Faery, and it is out of the Land of Promisethat he fetched Fand his wife and her seven cows." Then immediatelythe third quarter of the pig was done."Tell us now," said Mananan, "who thou art and why thou art comehither."Cormac then told his story, of the branch with its nine golden applesand how he had bartered for it his wife and his children, and he wasnow-seeking them through the world. And when he had made an end, thelast quarter of the pig was done."Come, let us set to the feast," then said Mananan; but Cormac said,"Never have I sat down to meat in a company of two only." "Nay," saidMananan, "but there are more to come." With that he opened a door inthe hall and in it appeared Queen Ethne and her two children. And whenthey had embraced and rejoiced in each other Mananan said, "It was Iwho took them from thee, Cormac, and who gave thee the bell-branch,for I wished to bring thee hither to be my guest for the sake of thynobleness and thy wisdom."Then they all sat down to table and feasted and made merry, and whenthey had satisfied themselves with meat and drink, Mananan showed thewonders of his household to King Cormac. And he took up a golden cupwhich stood on the table, and said: "This cup hath a magical property,for if a lie be spoken over it, it will immediately break in pieces,and if a truth be spoken it will be made whole again." "Prove this tome," said Cormac. "That is easily done," said Mananan. "Thy wife hathhad a new husband since I carried her off from thee." Straightway thecup fell apart into four pieces. "My husband has lied to thee,Cormac," said Fand, and immediately the cup became whole again.Cormac then began to question Mananan as to the things he had seen onhis way thither, and he told him of the house that was being thatchedwith the wings of birds, and of the men that kept returning ever andagain to their work as the wind destroyed it. And Mananan said,"These, O Cormac, are the men of art, who seek to gather together muchmoney and gear of all kinds by the exercise of their craft, but asfast as they get it, so they spend it, or faster and the result isthat they will never be rich." But when he had said this it is relatedthat the golden cup broke into pieces where it stood. Then Cormacsaid, "The explanation thou hast given of this mystery is not true."Mananan smiled, and said, "Nevertheless it must suffice thee, O King,for the truth of this matter may not be known, lest the men of artgive over the roofing of the house and it be covered with commonthatch."So when they had talked their fill, Cormac and his wife and childrenwere brought to a chamber where they lay down to sleep. But when theywoke up on the morrow morn, they found themselves in the Queen'schamber in the royal palace of Tara, and by Cormac's side were foundthe bell-branch and the magical cup and the cloth of gold that hadcovered the table where they sat in the palace of Mananan. Sevenmonths it was since Cormac had gone out from Tara to search for hiswife and children, but it seemed to him that he had been absent butfor the space of a single day and night.IXDESCRIPTION OF CORMAC[33]   [33] The original from the BOOK OF BALLYMOTE (14th century) is   given in O'Curry's MS. MATERIALS OF IRISH HISTORY, Appendix   xxvi. I have in the main followed O'Curry's translation."A noble and illustrious king assumed the sovranty and rule of Erinn,namely Cormac, grandson of Conn of the Hundred Battles. The world wasfull of all goodness in his time; there were fruit and fatness of theland, and abundant produce of the sea, with peace and ease andhappiness. There were no killings or plunderings in his time, buteveryone occupied his land in happiness."The nobles of Ireland assembled to drink the Banquet of Tara withCormac at a certain time.... Magnificently did Cormac come to thisgreat Assembly; for no man, his equal in beauty, had preceded him,excepting Conary Mor or Conor son of Caffa, or Angus Og son of theDagda.[34] Splendid, indeed, was Cormac's appearance in that Assembly.His hair was slightly curled, and of golden colour; a scarlet shieldhe had, with engraved devices, and golden bosses and ridges of silver.A wide-folding purple cloak was on him with a gem-set gold brooch overhis breast; a golden torque round his neck; a white-collared shirtembroidered with gold was on him; a girdle with golden buckles andstudded with precious stones was around him; two golden net-worksandals with golden buckles upon his feet; two spears with goldensockets and many red bronze rivets in his hand; while he stood in thefull glow of beauty, without defect or blemish. You would think it wasa shower of pearls that was set in his mouth, his lips were rubies,his symmetrical body was as white as snow, his cheek was ruddy as theberry of the mountain-ash, his eyes were like the sloe, his brows andeye-lashes were like the sheen of a blue-black lance."   [34] Angus Og was really a deity or fairy king. He appears also   in the story of Midir and Etain. _q.v._XTHE DEATH AND BURIAL OF CORMACStrange was the birth and childhood of Cormac strange his life andstrange the manner of his death and burial, as we now have to narrate.Cormac, it is said, was the third man in Ireland who heard of theChristian Faith before the coming of Patrick. One was Conor mac Nessa,King of Ulster, whose druid told him of the crucifixion of Christ andwho died of that knowledge.[35] The second was the wise judge, Morann,and the third Cormac, son of Art. This knowledge was revealed to himby divine illumination, and thenceforth he refused to consult thedruids or to worship the images which they made as emblems of theImmortal Ones.   [35] See the conclusion of the _Vengeance of Mesgedra_.One day it happened that Cormac after he had laid down the kingship ofIreland, was present when the druids and a concourse of people wereworshipping the great golden image which was set up in the plaincalled Moy Slaught. When the ceremony was done, the chief druid, whosename was Moylann, spoke to Cormac and said: "Why, O Cormac, didst thounot bow down and adore the golden image of the god like the rest ofthe people?"And Cormac said: "Never will I worship a stock[36] that my owncarpenter has made. Rather would I worship the man that made it, forhe is nobler than the work of his hands."   [36] The image was doubtless of wood overlaid with gold.Then it is told that Moylann by magic art caused the image to move andleap before the eyes of Cormac. "Seest thou that?" said Moylann."Although I see," said Cormac, "I will do no worship save to the Godof Heaven and Earth and Hell."Then Cormac went to his own home at Sletty on the Boyne, for there helived after he had given up the kingdom to his son Cairbry. But thedruids of Erinn came together and consulted over this matter, and theydetermined solemnly to curse Cormac and invoke the vengeance of theirgods upon him lest the people should think that any man could despiseand reject their gods, and suffer no ill for it.So they cursed Cormac in his flesh and bones, in his waking andsleeping, in his down sitting and his uprising, and each day theyturned over the Wishing Stone upon the altar of their god,[37] andwove mighty spells against his life. And whether it was that thesetook effect, or that the druids prevailed upon some traitorous servantof Cormac's to work their will, so it was that he died not longthereafter; and some say that he was choked by a fish bone as he satat meat in his house at Sletty on the Boyne.   [37] There are still Wishing Stones, which are used in   connexion with petitions for good or ill, on the ancient altars   of Inishmurray and of Caher Island, and possibly other places   on the west coast of Ireland.But when he felt his end approaching, and had still the power tospeak, he said to those that gathered round his bed:--"When I am goneI charge you that ye bury me not at Brugh of the Boyne where is theroyal cemetery of the Kings of Erinn.[38] For all these kings paidadoration to gods of wood or stone, or to the Sun and the Elements,whose signs are carved on the walls of their tombs, but I have learnedto know the One God, immortal, invisible, by whom the earth andheavens were made. Soon there will come into Erinn one from the Eastwho will declare Him unto us, and then wooden gods and cursing priestsshall plague us no longer in this land. Bury me then not atBrugh-na-Boyna, but on the hither-side of Boyne, at Ross-na-ree, wherethere is a sunny, eastward-sloping hill, there would I await thecoming of the sun of truth."   [38] This famous cemetery of the kings of pagan Ireland lies on   the north bank of the Boyne and consists of a number of   sepulchral mounds, sometimes of great extent, containing, in   their interior, stone walled chambers decorated with symbolic   and ornamental carvings. The chief of these mounds, now known   as Newgrange, has been explored and described by Mr George   Coffey in his valuable work NEWGRANGE, published by the Royal   Irish Academy. _Brugh_=mansion.So spake Cormac, and he died, and there was a very great mourning forhim in the land. But when the time came for his burial, the princesand lords of the Gael vowed that he should lie in Brugh with Art, hisfather, and Conn of the Hundred Battles, and many another king, in thegreat stone chambers of the royal dead. For Ross-na-ree, they said, isbut a green hill of no note; and Cormac's expectation of the messageof the new God they took to be but the wanderings of a dying man.Now Brugh-na-Boyna lay at the farther side of the Boyne from Sletty,and near by was a shallow ford where the river could be crossed. Butwhen the funeral train came down to the ford, bearing aloft the bodyof the King, lo! the river had risen as though a tempest had burstupon it at its far-off sources in the hills, and between them and thefarther bank was now a broad and foaming flood, and the stakes thatmarked the ford were washed clean away. Even so they made trial of theford, and thrice the bearers waded in and thrice they were forced toturn back lest the flood should sweep them down. At length six of thetallest and mightiest of the warriors of the High King took up thebier upon their shoulders, and strode in. And first the watchers onthe bank saw the brown water swirl about their knees, and then theysank thigh-deep, and at last it foamed against their shoulders, yetstill they braced themselves against the current, moving forward veryslowly as they found foothold among the slippery rocks in theriver-bed. But when they had almost reached the mid-stream it seemedas if a great surge overwhelmed them, and caught the bier from theirshoulders as they plunged and clutched around it, and they must needsmake back for the shore as best they could, while Boyne swept down thebody of Cormac to the sea.On the following morning, however, shepherds driving their flocks topasture on the hillside of Ross-na-ree found cast upon the shore thebody of an aged man of noble countenance, half wrapped in a silkenpall; and knowing not who this might be they dug a grave in the grassyhill, and there laid the stranger, and laid the green sods over himagain.There still sleeps Cormac the King, and neither Ogham-lettered stonenor sculptured cross marks his solitary grave. But he lies in theplace where he would be, of which a poet of the Gael in our day haswritten:--  "A tranquil spot: a hopeful sound     Comes from the ever-youthful stream,   And still on daisied mead and mound     The dawn delays with tenderer beam.   "Round Cormac, spring renews her buds:     In march perpetual by his side   Down come the earth-fresh April floods,     And up the sea-fresh salmon glide;   "And life and time rejoicing run     From age to age their wonted way;   But still he waits the risen sun,     For still 'tis only dawning day."[39]   [39] These lines are taken from Sir S. Ferguson's noble poem,   _The Burial of King Cormac_, from which I have also borrowed   some of the details of the foregoing narrative.       *       *       *       *       *Notes on the Sources_The Story of the Children of Lir_ and _The Quest of the Sons ofTurenn_ are two of the three famous and popular tales entitled "TheThree Sorrows of Storytelling." The third is the _Tragedy of the Sonsof Usna_, rendered by Miss Eleanor Hull in her volume CUCHULAIN. Ihave taken the two stories which are given here from the versions inmodern Irish published by the Society for the Preservation of theIrish Language, with notes and translation. Neither of them is foundin any very early MS., but their subject-matter certainly goes back tovery primitive times._The Secret of Labra_ is taken from Keating's FORUS FEASA AR EIRINN,edited with translation by the Rev. P.S. Dineen for the Irish TextsSociety, vol. i. p. 172._The Carving of mac Datho's Boar_. This is a clean, fierce, fightingstory, notable both for its intensely dramatic _denouement_, and forthe complete absence from it of the magical or supernatural elementwhich is so common a feature in Gaelic tales. It has been edited andtranslated from one MS. by Dr Kuno Meyer, in _Hibernica Minora_(ANECDOTA OXONIENSIA), 1894, and translated from THE BOOK OF LEINSTER(twelfth century) in Leahy's HEROIC ROMANCES._The Vengeance of Mesgedra_. This story, as I have given it, is acombination of two tales, _The Siege of Howth_ and _The Death of KingConor_. The second really completes the first, though they are notfound united in Irish literature. Both pieces are given in O'Curry'sMS. MATERIALS OF IRISH HISTORY, and Miss Hull has printed translationsof them in her CUCHULLIN SAGA, the translation of the _Siege_ being byDr Whitly Stokes and that of the _Death of Conor_ by O'Curry. Theseare very ancient tales and contain a strong barbaric element. Versionsof both of them are found in the great MS. collection known as theBOOK OF LEINSTER (twelfth century)._King Iubdan and King Fergus_ is a brilliant piece of fairyliterature. The imaginative grace, the humour, and, at the close, thetragic dignity of this tale make it worthy of being much more widelyknown than it has yet become. The original, taken from one of theEgerton MSS. in the British Museum, will be found with a translationin O'Grady's SILVA GADELICA. For the conclusion, I have in the mainfollowed another version (containing the death of Fergus only), givenin the SEANCUS MOR and finely versified by Sir Samuel Ferguson in hisPOEMS, 1880._The Story of Etain and Midir_. This beautiful and very ancientromance is extant in two distinct versions, both of which aretranslated by Mr A.H. Leahy in his HEROIC ROMANCES. The tale is foundin several MSS., among others, in the twelfth century BOOK OF THE DUNCOW (LEABHAR NA H-UIDHRE). It has been recently made the subject of adramatic poem by "Fiona Macleod."_How Ethne quitted Fairyland_ is taken from D'Arbois de Jubainville'sCYCLE MYTHOLOGIQUE IRLANDAIS, ch. xii. 4. The original is to be foundin the fifteenth century MS., entitled THE BOOK OF FERMOY._The Boyhood of Finn_ is based chiefly on the MACGNIOMHARTHA FHINN,published in 1856, with a translation, in the _TRANSACTIONS OF THEOSSIANIC SOCIETY_, vol. iv. I am also indebted, particularly for thetranslation of the difficult _Song of Finn in Praise of May_, to DrKuno Meyer's translation published in _Eriu_ (the Journal of theSchool of Irish Learning), vol. i. pt. 2._The Coming of Finn_, _Finns Chief Men_, the _Tale of Vivionn_ and_The Chase of the Gilla Dacar_, are all handfuls from that rich mineof Gaelic literature, Mr Standish Hayes O'Grady's SILVA GADELICA. Inthe _Gilla Dacar_ I have modified the second half of the story ratherfreely. It appears to have been originally an example of a well-knownclass of folk-tales dealing with the subject of the Rescue ofFairyland. The same motive occurs in the famous tale called _TheSickbed of Cuchulain_. The idea is that some fairy potentate, whoserealm is invaded and oppressed, entices a mortal champion to come tohis aid and rewards him with magical gifts. But the eighteenthcentury narrator whose MS. was edited by Mr S.H. O'Grady, apparentlyhad not the clue to the real meaning of his material, and after goingon brilliantly up to the point where Dermot plunges into the magicwell, he becomes incoherent, and the rest of the tale is merely astring of episodes having no particular connexion with each other orwith the central theme. The latter I have here endeavoured to restoreto view. The _Gilla Dacar_ is given from another Gaelic version by DrP.W. Joyce in his invaluable book, OLD CELTIC ROMANCES._The Birth of Oisin_ I have found in Patrick Kennedy's LEGENDARYFICTIONS OF THE IRISH CELTS. I do not know the Gaelic original._Oisin in the Land of Youth_ is based, as regards the outlines of thisremarkable story, on the LAOI OISIN AR TIR NA N-OG, written by MichaelComyn about 1750, and edited with a translation by Thomas Flannery in1896 (Gill & Son, Dublin). Comyn's poem was almost certainly based onearlier traditional sources, either oral or written or both, but thesehave not hitherto been discovered._The History of King Cormac_. The story of the birth of Cormac and hiscoming into his kingdom is to be found in SILVA GADELICA, where it isedited from THE BOOK OF BALLYMOTE, an MS. dating from about the year1400.The charming tale, of his marriage with Ethne ni Dunlaing is takenfrom Keating's FORUS FEASA. From this source also I have taken thetales of the Brehon Flahari, of Kiernit and the mill, and of Cormac'sdeath and burial. The _Instructions of Cormac_ have been edited andtranslated by Dr Kuno Meyer in the Todd Lecture Series of the RoyalIrish Academy, xiv., April 1909. They are found in numerous MSS., andtheir date is fixed by Dr Meyer about the ninth century. With someother Irish matter of the same description they constitute, says MrAlfred Nutt, "the oldest body of gnomic wisdom" extant in any Europeanvernacular. (_FOLK-LORE_, Sept. 30, 1909.)The story of Cormac's adventures in Fairyland has been published witha translation by Standish Hayes O'Grady in the _TRANSACTIONS OF THEOSSIANIC SOCIETY_, vol. iii., and is also given very fully by d'Arboisde Jubainvilie in his CYCLE MYTHOLOGIQUE IRLANDAIS. The tale is found,among other MSS., in the BOOK OF BALLYMOTE, but is known to have beenextant at least as early as the tenth century, since in that year itfigures in a list of Gaelic tales drawn up by the historian Tierna.The ingenious story of the _Judgment concerning Cormac's Sword_ isfound in the BOOK OF BALLYMOTE, and is printed with a translation byDr Whitly Stokes in _IRISCHE TEXTE_, iii. Serie, 7 Heft, 1891.Pronouncing IndexThe correct pronunciation of Gaelic proper names can only be learnedfrom the living voice. It cannot be accurately represented by anycombination of letters from the English alphabet. I have spared thereader as much trouble as possible on this score by simplifying, asfar as I could, the forms of the names occurring in the text, and ifthe reader will note the following general rules, he will get quite asnear to the pronunciation intended as there is any necessity for himto do. A few names which might present some unusual difficulty aregiven with their approximate English pronunciations in the Index.The chief rule to observe is that vowels are pronounced as in theContinental languages, not according to the custom peculiar toEngland. Thus _a_ is like _a_ in _father_, never like _a_ in _fate,I_(when long) is like _ee_, _u_ like _oo_, or like _u_ in _put_ (neverlike _u_ in _tune_). An accent implies length, thus _Dun_, a fortressor mansion, is pronounced _Doon_. The letters _ch_ are never to bepronounced with a _t_ sound, as in the word _chip_, but like a rough_h_ or a softened _k_, rather as in German. _Gh_ is silent as inEnglish, and _g_ is always hard, as in _give_. _C_ is always as _k_,never as _s_.In the following Index an accent placed after a syllable indicatesthat the stress is to be laid on that syllable. Only those words aregiven, the pronunciation of which is not easily ascertainable byattention to the foregoing rules.INDEXAEda is to be pronounced  Ee'-da.Ailill          "        Al'-yill.Anluan          "        An'-looan.Aoife           "        Ee'-fa.Bacarach        "        Bac'-ara_h_.Belachgowran    "        Bel'-a_h_-gow'-ran.Cearnach        "        Kar'-na_h_.Cuchulain       "        Coo-_h_oo'-lin.Cumhal          "        Coo'wal, Cool.Dacar           "        Dak'-ker.Derryvaragh     "        Derry-var'-a.Eisirt          "        Eye'sert.Eochy           "        Yeo'_h_ee.Fiachra         "        Fee'-a_k_ra.Fianna          "        Fee'-anna.Finegas         "        Fin'-egas.Fionnuala       "        Fee-on-oo'-ala, shortened in modern Irish                          into Fino'-la.Flahari         "        Fla'-haree.Iorroway        "        Yor'-oway.Iubdan          "        Youb'-dan.Iuchar          "        You'-_h_ar.Iucharba        "        You-_h_ar'-ba.Liagan          "        Lee'-agan.Lir             "        Leer.Logary          "        Lo'-garee.Maev            "        rhyming to _wave_.Mananan         "        Man'-anan.Mesgedra        "        Mes-ged'-ra.Midir           "        Mid'-eer.Mochaen         "        Mo-_hain'.Mochaovog       "        Mo-_h_wee'-vogue.Moonremur       "        Moon'-ray-mur.Oisin           "        Ush'-een (Ossian).Peisear         "        Pye'-sar.Sceolaun        "        Ske-o'-lawn (the _e_ very short).Slievenamuck    "        Sleeve-na-muck'.Slievenamon     "        Sleeve-na-mon'.Tuish           "        Too'-ish.***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HIGH DEEDS OF FINN AND OTHERBARDIC ROMANCES OF ANCIENT IRELAND********** This file should be named 14749.txt or 14749.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/4/7/4/14749Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

INTRODUCTORYThe subject of Religious Origins is a fascinating one, as the greatmultitude of books upon it, published in late years, tends to show.Indeed the great difficulty to-day in dealing with the subject, lies inthe very mass of the material to hand--and that not only on account ofthe labor involved in sorting the material, but because the abundanceitself of facts opens up temptation to a student in this department ofAnthropology (as happens also in other branches of general Science) torush in too hastily with what seems a plausible theory. The more facts,statistics, and so forth, there are available in any investigation, theeasier it is to pick out a considerable number which will fit a giventheory. The other facts being neglected or ignored, the views putforward enjoy for a time a great vogue. Then inevitably, and at a latertime, new or neglected facts alter the outlook, and a new perspective isestablished.There is also in these matters of Science (though many scientific menwould doubtless deny this) a great deal of "Fashion". Such has beennotoriously the case in Political Economy, Medicine, Geology, and evenin such definite studies as Physics and Chemistry. In a comparativelyrecent science, like that with which we are now concerned, one wouldnaturally expect variations. A hundred and fifty years ago, and sincethe time of Rousseau, the "Noble Savage" was extremely popular; and helingers still in the story books of our children. Then the reaction fromthis extreme view set in, and of late years it has been the popular cue(largely, it must be said, among "armchair" travelers and explorers)to represent the religious rites and customs of primitive folk as asenseless mass of superstitions, and the early man as quite devoid ofdecent feeling and intelligence. Again, when the study of religiousorigins first began in modern times to be seriously taken up--say in theearlier part of last century--there was a great boom in Sungods. Everydivinity in the Pantheon was an impersonation of the Sun--unless indeed(if feminine) of the Moon. Apollo was a sungod, of course; Hercules wasa sungod; Samson was a sungod; Indra and Krishna, and even Christ, thesame. C. F. Dupuis in France (Origine de tous les Cultes, 1795), F. Norkin Germany (Biblische Mythologie, 1842), Richard Taylor in England (TheDevil's Pulpit, (1) 1830), were among the first in modern times to putforward this view. A little later the PHALLIC explanation of everythingcame into fashion. The deities were all polite names for the organs andpowers of procreation. R. P. Knight (Ancient Art and Mythology,1818) and Dr. Thomas Inman (Ancient Faiths and Ancient Names, 1868)popularized this idea in England; so did Nork in Germany. Then againthere was a period of what is sometimes called Euhemerism--the theorythat the gods and goddesses had actually once been men and women,historical characters round whom a halo of romance and remotenesshad gathered. Later still, a school has arisen which thinks little ofsungods, and pays more attention to Earth and Nature spirits, to gnomesand demons and vegetation-sprites, and to the processes of Magic bywhich these (so it was supposed) could be enlisted in man's service iffriendly, or exorcised if hostile. (1) This extraordinary book, though carelessly composed andcontaining many unproven statements, was on the whole on the rightlines. But it raised a storm of opposition--the more so because itsauthor was a clergyman! He was ejected from the ministry, of course, andwas sent to prison twice.It is easy to see of course that there is some truth in ALL theseexplanations; but naturally each school for the time being makes themost of its own contention. Mr. J. M. Robertson (Pagan Christs andChristianity and Mythology), who has done such fine work in this field,(1) relies chiefly on the solar and astronomical origins, though he doesnot altogether deny the others; Dr. Frazer, on the other hand--whosegreat work, The Golden Bough, is a monumental collection of primitivecustoms, and will be an inexhaustible quarry for all future students--isapparently very little concerned with theories about the Sun and thestars, but concentrates his attention on the collection of innumerabledetails (2) of rites, chiefly magical, connected with food andvegetation. Still later writers, like S. Reinach, Jane Harrison andE. A. Crowley, being mainly occupied with customs of very primitivepeoples, like the Pelasgian Greeks or the Australian aborigines, haveconfined themselves (necessarily) even more to Magic and Witchcraft. (1) If only he did not waste so much time, and so needlessly, inslaughtering opponents! (2) To such a degree, indeed, that sometimes the connecting clueof the argument seems to be lost.Meanwhile the Christian Church from these speculations has kept itselfseverely apart--as of course representing a unique and divine revelationlittle concerned or interested in such heathenisms; and moreover (inthis country at any rate) has managed to persuade the general publicof its own divine uniqueness to such a degree that few people, evennowadays, realize that it has sprung from just the same root asPaganism, and that it shares by far the most part of its doctrines andrites with the latter. Till quite lately it was thought (in Britain)that only secularists and unfashionable people took any interest insungods; and while it was true that learned professors might point to abelief in Magic as one of the first sources of Religion, it was easy inreply to say that this obviously had nothing to do with Christianity!The Secularists, too, rather spoilt their case by assuming, in theirwrath against the Church, that all priests since the beginning ofthe world have been frauds and charlatans, and that all the rites ofreligion were merely devil's devices invented by them for the purpose ofpreying upon the superstitions of the ignorant, to their own enrichment.They (the Secularists) overleaped themselves by grossly exaggerating athing that no doubt is partially true.Thus the subject of religious origins is somewhat complex, and yieldsmany aspects for consideration. It is only, I think, by keeping a broadcourse and admitting contributions to the truth from various sides, thatvaluable results can be obtained. It is absurd to suppose that in thisor any other science neat systems can be found which will cover all thefacts. Nature and History do not deal in such things, or supply them fora sop to Man's vanity.It is clear that there have been three main lines, so far, along whichhuman speculation and study have run. One connecting religious rites andobservations with the movements of the Sun and the planets in the sky,and leading to the invention of and belief in Olympian and remote godsdwelling in heaven and ruling the Earth from a distance; the secondconnecting religion with the changes of the season, on the Earth andwith such practical things as the growth of vegetation and food, andleading to or mingled with a vague belief in earth-spirits and magicalmethods of influencing such spirits; and the third connecting religionwith man's own body and the tremendous force of sex residing init--emblem of undying life and all fertility and power. It is clearalso--and all investigation confirms it--that the second-mentioned phaseof religion arose on the whole BEFORE the first-mentioned--that is, thatmen naturally thought about the very practical questions of food andvegetation, and the magical or other methods of encouraging the same,before they worried themselves about the heavenly bodies and the laws ofTHEIR movements, or about the sinister or favorable influences the starsmight exert. And again it is extremely probable that the third-mentionedaspect--that which connected religion with the procreative desires andphenomena of human physiology--really came FIRST. These desires andphysiological phenomena must have loomed large on the primitive mindlong before the changes of the seasons or of the sky had been at alldefinitely observed or considered. Thus we find it probable that, inorder to understand the sequence of the actual and historical phases ofreligious worship, we must approximately reverse the order above-givenin which they have been STUDIED, and conclude that in general thePhallic cults came first, the cult of Magic and the propitiation ofearth-divinities and spirits came second, and only last came the beliefin definite God-figures residing in heaven.At the base of the whole process by which divinities and demons werecreated, and rites for their propitiation and placation established, layFear--fear stimulating the imagination to fantastic activity. Primus inorbe deos fecit Timor. And fear, as we shall see, only became a mentalstimulus at the time of, or after, the evolution of self-consciousness.Before that time, in the period of SIMPLE consciousness, when the humanmind resembled that of the animals, fear indeed existed, but its naturewas more that of a mechanical protective instinct. There being no figureor image of SELF in the animal mind, there were correspondingly nofigures or images of beings who might threaten or destroy that self. Soit was that the imaginative power of fear began with Self-consciousness,and from that imaginative power was unrolled the whole panorama of thegods and rites and creeds of Religion down the centuries.The immense force and domination of Fear in the first self-consciousstages of the human mind is a thing which can hardly be exaggerated, andwhich is even difficult for some of us moderns to realize. But naturallyas soon as Man began to think about himself--a frail phantom and waif inthe midst of tremendous forces of whose nature and mode of operation hewas entirely ignorant--he was BESET with terrors; dangers loomed uponhim on all sides. Even to-day it is noticed by doctors that one of thechief obstacles to the cure of illness among some black or native racesis sheer superstitious terror; and Thanatomania is the recognized wordfor a state of mind ("obsession of death") which will often cause asavage to perish from a mere scratch hardly to be called a wound.The natural defence against this state of mind was the creation of anenormous number of taboos--such as we find among all races and on everyconceivable subject--and these taboos constituted practically agreat body of warnings which regulated the lives and thoughts of thecommunity, and ultimately, after they had been weeded out and to somedegree simplified, hardened down into very stringent Customs and Laws.Such taboos naturally in the beginning tended to include the avoidancenot only of acts which might reasonably be considered dangerous, liketouching a corpse, but also things much more remote and fanciful intheir relation to danger, like merely looking at a mother-in-law, orpassing a lightning-struck tree; and (what is especially to be noticed)they tended to include acts which offered any special PLEASURE ortemptation--like sex or marriage or the enjoyment of a meal. Taboossurrounded these things too, and the psychological connection is easy todivine: but I shall deal with this general subject later.It may be guessed that so complex a system of regulations made lifeanything but easy to early peoples; but, preposterous and unreasonableas some of the taboos were, they undoubtedly had the effect ofcompelling the growth of self-control. Fear does not seem a very worthymotive, but in the beginning it curbed the violence of the purely animalpassions, and introduced order and restraint among them. Simultaneouslyit became itself, through the gradual increase of knowledge andobservation, transmuted and etherealized into something more like wonderand awe and (when the gods rose above the horizon) into reverence.Anyhow we seem to perceive that from the early beginnings (in theStone Age) of self-consciousness in Man there has been a gradualdevelopment--from crass superstition, senseless and accidental, torudimentary observation, and so to belief in Magic; thence to Animismand personification of nature-powers in more or less human form,as earth-divinities or sky-gods or embodiments of the tribe; and toplacation of these powers by rites like Sacrifice and the Eucharist,which in their turn became the foundation of Morality. Graphicrepresentations made for the encouragement of fertility--as on thewalls of Bushmen's rock-dwellings or the ceilings of the caverns ofAltamira--became the nurse of pictorial Art; observations of plantsor of the weather or the stars, carried on by tribal medicine-men forpurposes of witchcraft or prophecy, supplied some of the material ofScience; and humanity emerged by faltering and hesitating steps on theborderland of those finer perceptions and reasonings which are supposedto be characteristic of Civilization.The process of the evolution of religious rites and ceremonies has inits main outlines been the same all over the world, as the reader willpresently see--and this whether in connection with the numerous creedsof Paganism or the supposedly unique case of Christianity; and now thecontinuity and close intermixture of these great streams can no longerbe denied--nor IS it indeed denied by those who have really studied thesubject. It is seen that religious evolution through the ages has beenpractically One thing--that there has been in fact a World-religion,though with various phases and branches.And so in the present day a new problem arises, namely how to accountfor the appearance of this great Phenomenon, with its orderly phasesof evolution, and its own spontaneous (1) growths in all corners of theglobe--this phenomenon which has had such a strange sway over the heartsof men, which has attracted them with so weird a charm, which has drawnout their devotion, love and tenderness, which has consoled them insorrow and affliction, and yet which has stained their history with suchhorrible sacrifices and persecutions and cruelties. What has been theinstigating cause of it? (1) For the question of spontaneity see chap. x and elsewhere.The answer which I propose to this question, and which is developed tosome extent in the following chapters, is a psychological one. It isthat the phenomenon proceeds from, and is a necessary accompaniment of,the growth of human Consciousness itself--its growth, namely, throughthe three great stages of its unfoldment. These stages are (1) that ofthe simple or animal consciousness, (2) that of SELF-consciousness, and(3) that of a third stage of consciousness which has not as yet beeneffectively named, but whose indications and precursive signs we hereand there perceive in the rites and prophecies and mysteries of theearly religions, and in the poetry and art and literature generally ofthe later civilizations. Though I do not expect or wish to catch Natureand History in the careful net of a phrase, yet I think that in thesequence from the above-mentioned first stage to the second, and thenagain in the sequence from the second to the third, there will be founda helpful explanation of the rites and aspirations of human religion. Itis this idea, illustrated by details of ceremonial and so forth, whichforms the main thesis of the present book. In this sequence of growth,Christianity enters as an episode, but no more than an episode. It doesnot amount to a disruption or dislocation of evolution. If it did, orif it stood as an unique or unclassifiable phenomenon (as some of itsvotaries contend), this would seem to be a misfortune--as it wouldobviously rob us of at any rate one promise of progress in the future.And the promise of something better than Paganism and better thanChristianity is very precious. It is surely time that it should befulfilled.The tracing, therefore, of the part that human self-consciousness hasplayed, psychologically, in the evolution of religion, runs like athread through the following chapters, and seeks illustration in avariety of details. The idea has been repeated under different aspects;sometimes, possibly, it has been repeated too often; but differentaspects in such a case do help, as in a stereoscope, to give solidity tothe thing seen. Though the worship of Sun-gods and divine figures inthe sky came comparatively late in religious evolution, 1 have put thissubject early in the book (chapters ii and iii), partly because (as Ihave already explained) it was the phase first studied in modern times,and therefore is the one most familiar to present-day readers, andpartly because its astronomical data give great definiteness and"proveability" to it, in rebuttal to the common accusation that thewhole study of religious origins is too vague and uncertain to have muchvalue. Going backwards in Time, the two next chapters (iv and v) dealwith Totem-sacraments and Magic, perhaps the earliest forms of religion.And these four lead on (in chapters vi to xi) to the consideration ofrites and creeds common to Paganism and Christianity. XII and xiii dealespecially with the evolution of Christianity itself; xiv and xv explainthe inner Meaning of the whole process from the beginning; and xvi andxvii look to the Future.The appendix on the doctrines of the Upanishads may, I hope, serve togive an idea, intimate even though inadequate, of the third Stage--thatwhich follows on the stage of self-consciousness; and to portray themental attitudes which are characteristic of that stage. Here in thisthird stage, it would seem, one comes upon the real FACTS of the innerlife--in contradistinction to the fancies and figments of the secondstage; and so one reaches the final point of conjunction between Scienceand Religion.II. SOLAR MYTHS AND CHRISTIAN FESTIVALSTo the ordinary public--notwithstanding the immense amount of work whichhas of late been done on this subject--the connection between Paganismand Christianity still seems rather remote. Indeed the common notionis that Christianity was really a miraculous interposition into anddislocation of the old order of the world; and that the pagan gods (asin Milton's Hymn on the Nativity) fled away in dismay before the sign ofthe Cross, and at the sound of the name of Jesus. Doubtless this was aview much encouraged by the early Church itself--if only to enhance itsown authority and importance; yet, as is well known to every student, itis quite misleading and contrary to fact. The main Christian doctrinesand festivals, besides a great mass of affiliated legend and ceremonial,are really quite directly derived from, and related to, precedingNature worships; and it has only been by a good deal of deliberatemystification and falsification that this derivation has been kept outof sight.In these Nature-worships there may be discerned three fairly independentstreams of religious or quasi-religious enthusiasm: (1) that connectedwith the phenomena of the heavens, the movements of the Sun, planets andstars, and the awe and wonderment they excited; (2) that connected withthe seasons and the very important matter of the growth of vegetationand food on the Earth; and (3) that connected with the mysteries of Sexand reproduction. It is obvious that these three streams would mingleand interfuse with each other a good deal; but as far as they wereseparable the first would tend to create Solar heroes and Sun-myths;the second Vegetation-gods and personifications of Nature and theearth-life; while the third would throw its glamour over the other twoand contribute to the projection of deities or demons worshipped withall sorts of sexual and phallic rites. All three systems of course havetheir special rites and times and ceremonies; but, as, I say, the ritesand ceremonies of one system would rarely be found pure and unmixed withthose belonging to the two others. The whole subject is a very largeone; but for reasons given in the Introduction I shall in this andthe following chapter--while not ignoring phases (2) and (3)--lay moststress on phase (1) of the question before us.At the time of the life or recorded appearance of Jesus of Nazareth, andfor some centuries before, the Mediterranean and neighboring world hadbeen the scene of a vast number of pagan creeds and rituals. There wereTemples without end dedicated to gods like Apollo or Dionysus among theGreeks, Hercules among the Romans, Mithra among the Persians, Adonis andAttis in Syria and Phrygia, Osiris and Isis and Horus in Egypt, Baaland Astarte among the Babylonians and Carthaginians, and so forth.Societies, large or small, united believers and the devout in theservice or ceremonials connected with their respective deities, andin the creeds which they confessed concerning these deities. And anextraordinarily interesting fact, for us, is that notwithstanding greatgeographical distances and racial differences between the adherentsof these various cults, as well as differences in the details of theirservices, the general outlines of their creeds and ceremonials were--ifnot identical--so markedly similar as we find them.I cannot of course go at length into these different cults, but I maysay roughly that of all or nearly all the deities above-mentioned it wassaid and believed that:(1) They were born on or very near our Christmas Day.(2) They were born of a Virgin-Mother.(3) And in a Cave or Underground Chamber.(4) They led a life of toil for Mankind.(5) And were called by the names of Light-bringer, Healer, Mediator,Savior, Deliverer.(6) They were however vanquished by the Powers of Darkness.(7) And descended into Hell or the Underworld.(8) They rose again from the dead, and became the pioneers of mankind tothe Heavenly world.(9) They founded Communions of Saints, and Churches into which discipleswere received by Baptism.(10) And they were commemorated by Eucharistic meals.Let me give a few brief examples.Mithra was born in a cave, and on the 25th December. (1) He was born ofa Virgin. (2) He traveled far and wide as a teacher and illuminatorof men. He slew the Bull (symbol of the gross Earth which the sunlightfructifies). His great festivals were the winter solstice and the Springequinox (Christmas and Easter). He had twelve companions or disciples(the twelve months). He was buried in a tomb, from which however he roseagain; and his resurrection was celebrated yearly with great rejoicings.He was called Savior and Mediator, and sometimes figured as a Lamb; andsacramental feasts in remembrance of him were held by his followers.This legend is apparently partly astronomical and partly vegetational;and the same may be said of the following about Osiris. (1) The birthfeast of Mithra was held in Rome on the 8th daybefore the Kalends of January, being also the day of the Circassiangames, which were sacred to the Sun. (See F. Nork, Der Mystagog,Leipzig.) (2) This at any rate was reported by his later disciples (seeRobertson's Pagan Christs, p. 338).Osiris was born (Plutarch tells us) on the 361st day of the year,say the 27th December. He too, like Mithra and Dionysus, was a greattraveler. As King of Egypt he taught men civil arts, and "tamed them bymusic and gentleness, not by force of arms"; (1) he was the discovererof corn and wine. But he was betrayed by Typhon, the power of darkness,and slain and dismembered. "This happened," says Plutarch, "on the 17thof the month Athyr, when the sun enters into the Scorpion" (the sign ofthe Zodiac which indicates the oncoming of Winter). His body was placedin a box, but afterwards, on the 19th, came again to life, and, as inthe cults of Mithra, Dionysus, Adonis and others, so in the cultof Osiris, an image placed in a coffin was brought out before theworshipers and saluted with glad cries of "Osiris is risen." (1) "Hissufferings, his death and his resurrection were enacted year by year ina great mystery-play at Abydos." (2) (1) See Plutarch on Isis and Osiris. (2) Ancient Art and Ritual, by Jane E. Harrison, chap. i.The two following legends have more distinctly the character ofVegetation myths.Adonis or Tammuz, the Syrian god of vegetation, was a very beautifulyouth, born of a Virgin (Nature), and so beautiful that Venus andProserpine (the goddesses of the Upper and Underworlds) both fell inlove with him. To reconcile their claims it was agreed that he shouldspend half the year (summer) in the upper world, and the winter halfwith Proserpine below. He was killed by a boar (Typhon) in the autumn.And every year the maidens "wept for Adonis" (see Ezekiel viii. 14). Inthe spring a festival of his resurrection was held--the women set outto seek him, and having found the supposed corpse placed it (a woodenimage) in a coffin or hollow tree, and performed wild rites andlamentations, followed by even wilder rejoicings over his supposedresurrection. At Aphaca in the North of Syria, and halfway betweenByblus and Baalbec, there was a famous grove and temple of Astarte,near which was a wild romantic gorge full of trees, the birthplace ofa certain river Adonis--the water rushing from a Cavern, under loftycliffs. Here (it was said) every year the youth Adonis was again woundedto death, and the river ran red with his blood, (1) while the scarletanemone bloomed among the cedars and walnuts. (1) A discoloration caused by red earth washed by rain from themountains, and which has been observed by modern travelers. For thewhole story of Adonis and of Attis see Frazer's Golden Bough, part iv.The story of Attis is very similar. He was a fair young shepherd orherdsman of Phrygia, beloved by Cybele (or Demeter), the Mother of thegods. He was born of a Virgin--Nana--who conceived by putting a ripealmond or pomegranate in her bosom. He died, either killed by a boar,the symbol of winter, like Adonis, or self-castrated (like his ownpriests); and he bled to death at the foot of a pine tree (the pineand pine-cone being symbols of fertility). The sacrifice of his bloodrenewed the fertility of the earth, and in the ritual celebration ofhis death and resurrection his image was fastened to the trunk of apine-tree (compare the Crucifixion). But I shall return to this legendpresently. The worship of Attis became very widespread and much honored,and was ultimately incorporated with the established religion at Romesomewhere about the commencement of our Era.The following two legends (dealing with Hercules and with Krishna) haverather more of the character of the solar, and less of the vegetationalmyth about them. Both heroes were regarded as great benefactors ofhumanity; but the former more on the material plane, and the latter onthe spiritual.Hercules or Heracles was, like other Sun-gods and benefactors ofmankind, a great Traveler. He was known in many lands, and everywherehe was invoked as Saviour. He was miraculously conceived from a divineFather; even in the cradle he strangled two serpents sent to destroyhim. His many labors for the good of the world were ultimatelyepitomized into twelve, symbolized by the signs of the Zodiac. He slewthe Nemxan Lion and the Hydra (offspring of Typhon) and the Boar. Heovercame the Cretan Bull, and cleaned out the Stables of Augeas; heconquered Death and, descending into Hades, brought Cerberus thence andascended into Heaven. On all sides he was followed by the gratitude andthe prayers of mortals.As to Krishna, the Indian god, the points of agreement with the generaldivine career indicated above are too salient to be overlooked, and toonumerous to be fully recorded. He also was born of a Virgin (Devaki)and in a Cave, (1) and his birth announced by a Star. It was sought todestroy him, and for that purpose a massacre of infants was ordered.Everywhere he performed miracles, raising the dead, healing lepers, andthe deaf and the blind, and championing the poor and oppressed. He hada beloved disciple, Arjuna, (cf. John) before whom he was transfigured.(2) His death is differently related--as being shot by an arrow, orcrucified on a tree. He descended into hell; and rose again from thedead, ascending into heaven in the sight of many people. He will returnat the last day to be the judge of the quick and the dead. (1) Cox's Myths of the Aryan Nations, p. 107. (2) Bhagavat Gita, ch. xi.Such are some of the legends concerning the pagan and pre-Christiandeities--only briefly sketched now, in order that we may get somethinglike a true perspective of the whole subject; but to most of them, andmore in detail, I shall return as the argument proceeds.What we chiefly notice so far are two points; on the one hand thegeneral similarity of these stories with that of Jesus Christ; on theother their analogy with the yearly phenomena of Nature as illustratedby the course of the Sun in heaven and the changes of Vegetation on theearth.(1) The similarity of these ancient pagan legends and beliefs withChristian traditions was indeed so great that it excited the attentionand the undisguised wrath of the early Christian fathers. They felt nodoubt about the similarity, but not knowing how to explain it fellback upon the innocent theory that the Devil--in order to confound theChristians--had, CENTURIES BEFORE, caused the pagans to adopt certainbeliefs and practices! (Very crafty, we may say, of the Devil, but alsovery innocent of the Fathers to believe it!) Justin Martyr for instancedescribes (1) the institution of the Lord's Supper as narrated in theGospels, and then goes on to say: "Which the wicked devils have IMITATEDin the mysteries of Mithra, commanding the same thing to be done. For,that bread and a cup of water are placed with certain incantations inthe mystic rites of one who is being initiated you either know or canlearn." Tertullian also says (2) that "the devil by the mysteries ofhis idols imitates even the main part of the divine mysteries."..."He baptizes his worshippers in water and makes them believe thatthis purifies them from their crimes."... "Mithra sets his mark on theforehead of his soldiers; he celebrates the oblation of bread; he offersan image of the resurrection, and presents at once the crown and thesword; he limits his chief priest to a single marriage; he even has hisvirgins and ascetics." (3) Cortez, too, it will be remembered complainedthat the Devil had positively taught to the Mexicans the same thingswhich God had taught to Christendom. (1) I Apol. c. 66. (2) De Praescriptione Hereticorum, c. 40; De Bapt. c. 3; DeCorona, c. 15. (3) For reference to both these examples see J. M. Robertson'sPagan Christs, pp. 321, 322.Justin Martyr again, in the Dialogue with Trypho says that the Birth inthe Stable was the prototype (!) of the birth of Mithra in the Cave ofZoroastrianism; and boasts that Christ was born when the Sun takes itsbirth in the Augean Stable, (1) coming as a second Hercules to cleansea foul world; and St. Augustine says "we hold this (Christmas) day holy,not like the pagans because of the birth of the Sun, but because of thebirth of him who made it." There are plenty of other instances in theEarly Fathers of their indignant ascription of these similarities to thework of devils; but we need not dwell over them. There is no need forUS to be indignant. On the contrary we can now see that theseanimadversions of the Christian writers are the evidence of how and towhat extent in the spread of Christianity over the world it had becomefused with the Pagan cults previously existing. (1) The Zodiacal sign of Capricornus, iii.It was not till the year A.D. 530 or so--five centuries after thesupposed birth of Christ--that a Scythian Monk, Dionysius Exiguus, anabbot and astronomer of Rome, was commissioned to fix the day and theyear of that birth. A nice problem, considering the historical scienceof the period! For year he assigned the date which we now adopt, (2) andfor day and month he adopted the 25th December--a date which had beenin popular use since about 350 B.C., and the very date, within a day ortwo, of the supposed birth of the previous Sungods. (3) From thatfact alone we may fairly conclude that by the year 530 or earlier theexisting Nature-worships had become largely fused into Christianity. Infact the dates of the main pagan religious festivals had by that timebecome so popular that Christianity was OBLIGED to accommodate itself tothem. (1) (1) As, for instance, the festival of John the Baptist in Junetook the place of the pagan midsummer festival of water and bathing;the Assumption of the Virgin in August the place of that of Diana in thesame month; and the festival of All Souls early in November, that of theworld-wide pagan feasts of the dead and their ghosts at the same season. (2) See Encycl. Brit. art. "Chronology." (3) "There is however a difficulty in accepting the 25th Decemberas the real date of the Nativity, December being the height of the rainyseason in Judaea, when neither flocks nor shepherds could have been atnight in the fields of Bethlehem" (!). Encycl. Brit. art. "ChristmasDay." According to Hastings's Encyclopaedia, art. "Christmas," "Usenersays that the Feast of the Nativity was held originally on the 6thJanuary (the Epiphany), but in 353-4 the Pope Liberius displaced it tothe 25th December... but there is no evidence of a Feast of the Nativitytaking place at all, before the fourth century A.D." It was not till 534A.D. that Christmas Day and Epiphany were reckoned by the law-courts asdies non.This brings us to the second point mentioned a few pages back--theanalogy between the Christian festivals and the yearly phenomena ofNature in the Sun and the Vegetation.Let us take Christmas Day first. Mithra, as we have seen, was reportedto have been born on the 25th December (which in the Julian Calendar wasreckoned as the day of the Winter Solstice AND of the Nativity of theSun); Plutarch says (Isis and Osiris, c. 12) that Osiris was born onthe 361st day of the year, when a Voice rang out proclaiming the Lord ofAll. Horus, he says, was born on the 362nd day. Apollo on the same.Why was all this? Why did the Druids at Yule Tide light roaring fires?Why was the cock supposed to crow all Christmas Eve ("The bird ofdawning singeth all night long")? Why was Apollo born with only one hair(the young Sun with only one feeble ray)? Why did Samson (name derivedfrom Shemesh, the sun) lose all his strength when he lost his hair? Whywere so many of these gods--Mithra, Apollo, Krishna, Jesus, and others,born in caves or underground chambers? (1) Why, at the Easter Evefestival of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem is a light brought from thegrave and communicated to the candles of thousands who wait outside, andwho rush forth rejoicing to carry the new glory over the world? (2) Whyindeed? except that older than all history and all written records hasbeen the fear and wonderment of the children of men over the failure ofthe Sun's strength in Autumn--the decay of their God; and the anxietylest by any means he should not revive or reappear? (1) This same legend of gods (or idols) being born in caves has,curiously enough, been reported from Mexico, Guatemala, the Antilles,and other places in Central America. See C. F. P. von Martius,Etknographie Amerika, etc. (Leipzig, 1867), vol. i, p. 758. (2) Compare the Aztec ceremonial of lighting a holy fire andcommunicating it to the multitude from the wounded breast of a humanvictim, celebrated every 52 years at the end of one cycle and thebeginning of another--the constellation of the Pleiades being in theZenith (Prescott's Conquest of Mexico, Bk. I, ch. 4).Think for a moment of a time far back when there were absolutely NOAlmanacs or Calendars, either nicely printed or otherwise, when all thattimid mortals could see was that their great source of Light and Warmthwas daily failing, daily sinking lower in the sky. As everyone now knowsthere are about three weeks at the fag end of the year when the days areat their shortest and there is very little change. What was happening?Evidently the god had fallen upon evil times. Typhon, the prince ofdarkness, had betrayed him; Delilah, the queen of Night, had shorn hishair; the dreadful Boar had wounded him; Hercules was strugglingwith Death itself; he had fallen under the influence of those malignconstellations--the Serpent and the Scorpion. Would the god grow weakerand weaker, and finally succumb, or would he conquer after all? We canimagine the anxiety with which those early men and women watched for thefirst indication of a lengthening day; and the universal joy when thePriest (the representative of primitive science) having made somesimple observations, announced from the Temple steps that the day WASlengthening--that the Sun was really born again to a new and gloriouscareer. (1) (1) It was such things as these which doubtless gave thePriesthood its power.Let us look at the elementary science of those days a little closer.How without Almanacs or Calendars could the day, or probable day, of theSun's rebirth be fixed? Go out next Christmas Evening, and at midnightyou will see the brightest of the fixed stars, Sirius, blazing in thesouthern sky--not however due south from you, but somewhat to theleft of the Meridian line. Some three thousand years ago (owing to thePrecession of the Equinoxes) that star at the winter solstice didnot stand at midnight where you now see it, but almost exactly ONthe meridian line. The coming of Sirius therefore to the meridian atmidnight became the sign and assurance of the Sun having reached thevery lowest point of his course, and therefore of having arrived at themoment of his re-birth. Where then was the Sun at that moment? Obviouslyin the underworld beneath our feet. Whatever views the ancients may havehad about the shape of the earth, it was evident to the mass of peoplethat the Sungod, after illuminating the world during the day, plungeddown in the West, and remained there during the hours of darkness insome cavern under the earth. Here he rested and after bathing in thegreat ocean renewed his garments before reappearing in the East nextmorning.But in this long night of his greatest winter weakness, when all theworld was hoping and praying for the renewal of his strength, it isevident that the new birth would come--if it came at all--at midnight.This then was the sacred hour when in the underworld (the Stable or theCave or whatever it might be called) the child was born who was destinedto be the Savior of men. At that moment Sirius stood on the southernmeridian (and in more southern lands than ours this would be more nearlyoverhead); and that star--there is little doubt--is the Star in the Eastmentioned in the Gospels.To the right, as the supposed observer looks at Sirius on the midnightof Christmas Eve, stands the magnificent Orion, the mighty hunter. Thereare three stars in his belt which, as is well known, lie in a straightline pointing to Sirius. They are not so bright as Sirius, but they aresufficiently bright to attract attention. A long tradition gives themthe name of the Three Kings. Dupuis (1) says: "Orion a trois bellesetoiles vers le milieu, qui sont de seconde grandeur et posees en lignedroite, l'une pres de l'autre, le peuple les appelle les trois rois.On donne aux trois rois Magis les noms de Magalat, Galgalat, Saraim;et Athos, Satos, Paratoras. Les Catholiques les appellent Gaspard,Melchior, et Balthasar." The last-mentioned group of names comes inthe Catholic Calendar in connection with the feast of the Epiphany (6thJanuary); and the name "Trois Rois" is commonly to-day given to thesestars by the French and Swiss peasants. (1) Charles F. Dupuis (Origine de Tous les Cultes, Paris, 1822)was one of the earliest modern writers on these subjects.Immediately after Midnight then, on the 25th December, the Beloved Son(or Sun-god) is born. If we go back in thought to the period, some threethousand years ago, when at that moment of the heavenly birth Sirius,coming from the East, did actually stand on the Meridian, we shall comeinto touch with another curious astronomical coincidence. For at thesame moment we shall see the Zodiacal constellation of the Virgin inthe act of rising, and becoming visible in the East divided through themiddle by the line of the horizon.The constellation Virgo is a Y-shaped group, of which [gr a], the starat the foot, is the well-known Spica, a star of the first magnitude. Theother principal stars, [gr g] at the centre, and [gr b] and [gr e] atthe extremities, are of the second magnitude. The whole resembles more acup than the human figure; but when we remember the symbolic meaningof the cup, that seems to be an obvious explanation of the name Virgo,which the constellation has borne since the earliest times. (The threestars [gr b], [gr g] and [gr a], lie very nearly on the Ecliptic, thatis, the Sun's path--a fact to which we shall return presently.)At the moment then when Sirius, the star from the East, by coming to theMeridian at midnight signalled the Sun's new birth, the Virgin was seenjust rising on the Eastern sky--the horizon line passing throughher centre. And many people think that this astronomical fact is theexplanation of the very widespread legend of the Virgin-birth. I do notthink that it is the sole explanation--for indeed in all or nearly allthese cases the acceptance of a myth seems to depend not upon a singleargument but upon the convergence of a number of meanings and reasons inthe same symbol. But certainly the fact mentioned above is curious, andits importance is accentuated by the following considerations.In the Temple of Denderah in Egypt, and on the inside of the dome,there is or WAS an elaborate circular representation of the Northernhemisphere of the sky and the Zodiac. (1) Here Virgo the constellationis represented, as in our star-maps, by a woman with a spike of corn inher hand (Spica). But on the margin close by there is an annotating andexplicatory figure--a figure of Isis with the infant Horus in her arms,and quite resembling in style the Christian Madonna and Child, exceptthat she is sitting and the child is on her knee. This seems to showthat--whatever other nations may have done in associating Virgo withDemeter, Ceres, Diana (2) etc.--the Egyptians made no doubt of theconstellation's connection with Isis and Horus. But it is well known asa matter of history that the worship of Isis and Horus descended in theearly Christian centuries to Alexandria, where it took the form of theworship of the Virgin Mary and the infant Savior, and so passed intothe European ceremonial. We have therefore the Virgin Mary connected bylinear succession and descent with that remote Zodiacal cluster in thesky! Also it may be mentioned that on the Arabian and Persian globes ofAbenezra and Abuazar a Virgin and Child are figured in connection withthe same constellation. (3) (1) Carefully described and mapped by Dupuis, see op. cit. (2) For the harvest-festival of Diana, the Virgin, and herparallelism with the Virgin Mary, see The Golden Bough, vol. i, 14 andii, 121. (3) See F. Nork, Der Mystagog (Leipzig, 1838).A curious confirmation of the same astronomical connection is affordedby the Roman Catholic Calendar. For if this be consulted it will befound that the festival of the Assumption of the Virgin is placed on the15th August, while the festival of the Birth of the Virgin is dated the8th September. I have already pointed out that the stars, [gr a], [grb] and [gr g] of Virgo are almost exactly on the Ecliptic, or Sun's paththrough the sky; and a brief reference to the Zodiacal signs and thestar-maps will show that the Sun each year enters the sign of Virgoabout the first-mentioned date, and leaves it about the second date. Atthe present day the Zodiacal signs (owing to precession) have shiftedsome distance from the constellations of the same name. But at the timewhen the Zodiac was constituted and these names were given, the firstdate obviously would signalize the actual disappearance of the clusterVirgo in the Sun's rays--i. e. the Assumption of the Virgin into theglory of the God--while the second date would signalize the reappearanceof the constellation or the Birth of the Virgin. The Church of NotreDame at Paris is supposed to be on the original site of a Temple ofIsis; and it is said (but I have not been able to verify this myself)that one of the side entrances--that, namely, on the left in enteringfrom the North (cloister) side--is figured with the signs of the ZodiacEXCEPT that the sign Virgo is replaced by the figure of the Madonna andChild.So strange is the scripture of the sky! Innumerable legends and customsconnect the rebirth of the Sun with a Virgin parturition. Dr. J. G.Frazer in his Part IV of The Golden Bough (1) says: "If we may trust theevidence of an obscure scholiast the Greeks (in the worship of Mithrasat Rome) used to celebrate the birth of the luminary by a midnightservice, coming out of the inner shrines and crying, 'The Virgin hasbrought forth! The light is waxing!' ([gr 'H parhenos tetoken, auzeipws].)" In Elie Reclus' little book Primitive Folk (2) it is said of theEsquimaux that "On the longest night of the year two angakout (priests),of whom one is disguised as a WOMAN, go from hut to hut extinguishingall the lights, rekindling them from a vestal flame, and crying out,'From the new sun cometh a new light!'" (1) Book II, ch. vi. (2) In the Contemporary Science Series, I. 92.All this above-written on the Solar or Astronomical origins of the mythsdoes not of course imply that the Vegetational origins must be deniedor ignored. These latter were doubtless the earliest, but there is noreason--as said in the Introduction (ch. i)--why the two elements shouldnot to some extent have run side by side, or been fused with each other.In fact it is quite clear that they must have done so; and to separatethem out too rigidly, or treat them as antagonistic, is a mistake. TheCave or Underworld in which the New Year is born is not only the placeof the Sun's winter retirement, but also the hidden chamber beneath theEarth to which the dying Vegetation goes, and from which it re-arisesin Spring. The amours of Adonis with Venus and Proserpine, the lovelygoddesses of the upper and under worlds, or of Attis with Cybele, theblooming Earth-mother, are obvious vegetation-symbols; but they do notexclude the interpretation that Adonis (Adonai) may also figure as aSun-god. The Zodiacal constellations of Aries and Taurus (to which Ishall return presently) rule in heaven just when the Lamb and the Bullare in evidence on the earth; and the yearly sacrifice of those twoanimals and of the growing Corn for the good of mankind runsparallel with the drama of the sky, as it affects not only the saidconstellations but also Virgo (the Earth-mother who bears the sheaf ofcorn in her hand).I shall therefore continue (in the next chapter) to point out theseastronomical references--which are full of significance and poetry; butwith a recommendation at the same time to the reader not to forget thepoetry and significance of the terrestrial interpretations.Between Christmas Day and Easter there are several minor festivals orholy days--such as the 28th December (the Massacre of the Innocents),the 6th January (the Epiphany), the 2nd February (Candlemas (1) Day),the period of Lent (German Lenz, the Spring), the Annunciation of theBlessed Virgin, and so forth--which have been commonly celebrated inthe pagan cults before Christianity, and in which elements of Star andNature worship can be traced; but to dwell on all these would take toolong; so let us pass at once to the period of Easter itself. (1) This festival of the Purification of the Virgin correspondswith the old Roman festival of Juno Februata (i. e. purified) which washeld in the last month (February) of the Roman year, and which includeda candle procession of Ceres, searching for Proserpine. (F. Nork, DerMystagog.)III. THE SYMBOLISM OF THE ZODIACThe Vernal Equinox has all over the ancient world, and from the earliesttimes, been a period of rejoicing and of festivals in honor of theSungod. It is needless to labor a point which is so well known. Everyoneunderstands and appreciates the joy of finding that the long darkness isgiving way, that the Sun is growing in strength, and that the days arewinning a victory over the nights. The birds and flowers reappear, andthe promise of Spring is in the air. But it may be worth while to givean elementary explanation of the ASTRONOMICAL meaning of this period,because this is not always understood, and yet it is very important inits bearing on the rites and creeds of the early religions. The priestswho were, as I have said, the early students and inquirers, had workedout this astronomical side, and in that way were able to fix dates andto frame for the benefit of the populace myths and legends, which werein a certain sense explanations of the order of Nature, and a kind of"popular science."The Equator, as everyone knows, is an imaginary line or circle girdlingthe Earth half-way between the North and South poles. If you imagine atransparent Earth with a light at its very centre, and also imagine theSHADOW of this equatorial line to be thrown on the vast concave ofthe Sky, this shadow would in astronomical parlance coincide with theEquator of the Sky--forming an imaginary circle half-way between theNorth and South celestial poles.The Equator, then, may be pictured as cutting across the sky either byday or by night, and always at the same elevation--that is, as seen fromany one place. But the Ecliptic (the other important great circle of theheavens) can only be thought of as a line traversing the constellationsas they are seen at NIGHT. It is in fact the Sun's path among the fixedstars. For (really owing to the Earth's motion in its orbit) the Sunappears to move round the heavens once a year--travelling, always to theleft, from constellation to constellation. The exact path of the sun iscalled the Ecliptic; and the band of sky on either side of the Eclipticwhich may be supposed to include the said constellations is called theZodiac. How then--it will of course be asked--seeing that the Sun andthe Stars can never be seen together--were the Priests ABLE to map outthe path of the former among the latter? Into that question we need notgo. Sufficient to say that they succeeded; and their success--even withthe very primitive instruments they had--shows that their astronomicalknowledge and acuteness of reasoning were of no mean order.To return to our Vernal Equinox. Let us suppose that the Equator andEcliptic of the sky, at the Spring season, are represented by two linesEq. and Ecl. crossing each other at the point P. The Sun, representedby the small circle, is moving slowly and in its annual course along theEcliptic to the left. When it reaches the point P (the dotted circle)it stands on the Equator of the sky, and then for a day or two, beingneither North nor South, it shines on the two terrestrial hemispheresalike, and day and night are equal. BEFORE that time, when the sunis low down in the heavens, night has the advantage, and the days areshort; AFTERWARDS, when the Sun has travelled more to the left, the daystriumph over the nights. It will be seen then that this point P wherethe Sun's path crosses the Equator is a very critical point. It is theastronomical location of the triumph of the Sungod and of the arrival ofSpring.How was this location defined? Among what stars was the Sun moving atthat critical moment? (For of course it was understood, or supposed,that the Sun was deeply influenced by the constellation through which itwas, or appeared to be, moving.) It seems then that at the period whenthese questions were occupying men's minds--say about three thousandyears ago--the point where the Ecliptic crossed the Equator was, as amatter of fact, in the region of the constellation Aries or the he-Lamb.The triumph of the Sungod was therefore, and quite naturally, ascribedto the influence of Aries. THE LAMB BECAME THE SYMBOL OF THE RISENSAVIOR, AND OF HIS PASSAGE FROM THE UNDERWORLD INTO THE HEIGHT OFHEAVEN. At first such an explanation sounds hazardous; but a thousandtexts and references confirm it; and it is only by the accumulation ofevidence in these cases that the student becomes convinced of a theory'scorrectness. It must also be remembered (what I have mentioned before)that these myths and legends were commonly adopted not only forone strict reason but because they represented in a general way theconvergence of various symbols and inferences.Let me enumerate a few points with regard to the Vernal Equinox. In theBible the festival is called the Passover, and its supposed institutionby Moses is related in Exodus, ch. xii. In every house a he-lamb was tobe slain, and its blood to be sprinkled on the doorposts of the house.Then the Lord would pass over and not smite that house. The Hebrew wordis pasach, to pass. (1) The lamb slain was called the Paschal Lamb. Butwhat was that lamb? Evidently not an earthly lamb--(though certainlythe earthly lambs on the hillsides WERE just then ready to be killed andeaten)--but the heavenly Lamb, which was slain or sacrificed when theLord "passed over" the equator and obliterated the constellation Aries.This was the Lamb of God which was slain each year, and "Slain since thefoundation of the world." This period of the Passover (about the 25thMarch) was to be (2) the beginning of a new year. The sacrifice ofthe Lamb, and its blood, were to be the promise of redemption. Thedoor-frames of the houses--symbols of the entrance into a new life--wereto be sprinkled with blood. (3) Later, the imagery of the saving powerof the blood of the Lamb became more popular, more highly colored. (SeeSt. Paul's epistles, and the early Fathers.) And we have the expression"washed in the blood of the Lamb" adopted into the Christian Church. (1) It is said that pasach sometimes means not so much to passover, as to hover over and so protect. Possibly both meanings enter inhere. See Isaiah xxxi. 5. (2) See Exodus xii. i. (3) It is even said (see The Golden Bough, vol. iii, 185) thatthe doorways of houses and temples in Peru were at the Spring festivaldaubed with blood of the first-born children--commuted afterwards to theblood of the sacred animal, the Llama. And as to Mexico, Sahagun, thegreat Spanish missionary, tells us that it was a custom of the peoplethere to "smear the outside of their houses and doors with blood drawnfrom their own ears and ankles, in order to propitiate the god ofHarvest" (Kingsborough's Mexican Antiquities, vol. vi, p. 235).In order fully to understand this extraordinary expression and itsorigin we must turn for a moment to the worship both of Mithra, thePersian Sungod, and of Attis the Syrian god, as throwing great lighton the Christian cult and ceremonies. It must be remembered that in theearly centuries of our era the Mithra-cult was spread over the wholeWestern world. It has left many monuments of itself here in Britain.At Rome the worship was extremely popular, and it may almost be saidto have been a matter of chance whether Mithraism should overwhelmChristianity, or whether the younger religion by adopting many of therites of the older one should establish itself (as it did) in the faceof the latter.Now we have already mentioned that in the Mithra cult the slaying of aBull by the Sungod occupies the same sort of place as the slaving of theLamb in the Christian cult. It took place at the Vernal Equinox and theblood of the Bull acquired in men's minds a magic virtue. Mithraism wasa greatly older religion than Christianity; but its genesis was similar.In fact, owing to the Precession of the Equinoxes, the crossing-place ofthe Ecliptic and Equator was different at the time of the establishmentof Mithra-worship from what it was in the Christian period; and theSun instead of standing in the He-lamb, or Aries, at the Vernal Equinoxstood, about two thousand years earlier (as indicated by the dotted linein the diagram), in this very constellation of the Bull. (1) The bulltherefore became the symbol of the triumphant God, and the sacrificeof the bull a holy mystery. (Nor must we overlook here the agriculturalappropriateness of the bull as the emblem of Spring-plowings and ofservice to man.) (1) With regard to this point, see an article in the NineteenthCentury for September 1900, by E. W. Maunder of the GreenwichObservatory on "The Oldest Picture Book" (the Zodiac). Mr. Maundercalculates that the Vernal Equinox was in the centre of the Sign ofthe Bull 5,000 years ago. (It would therefore be in the centre of Aries2,845 years ago--allowing 2,155 years for the time occupied in passingfrom one Sign to another.) At the earlier period the Summer solstice wasin the centre of Leo, the Autumnal equinox in the centre of Scorpio, andthe Winter solstice in the centre of Aquarius--corresponding roughly,Mr. Maunder points out, to the positions of the four "Royal Stars,"Aldebaran, Regulus, Antares and Fomalhaut.The sacrifice of the Bull became the image of redemption. In a certainwell-known Mithra-sculpture or group, the Sungod is represented asplunging his dagger into a bull, while a scorpion, a serpent, and otheranimals are sucking the latter's blood. From one point of view this maybe taken as symbolic of the Sun fertilizing the gross Earth by plunginghis rays into it and so drawing forth its blood for the sustenance ofall creatures; while from another more astronomical aspect it symbolizesthe conquest of the Sun over winter in the moment of "passing over" thesign of the Bull, and the depletion of the generative power of the Bullby the Scorpion--which of course is the autumnal sign of the Zodiacand herald of winter. One such Mithraic group was found at Ostia, wherethere was a large subterranean Temple "to the invincible god Mithras."In the worship of Attis there were (as I have already indicated) manypoints of resemblance to the Christian cult. On the 22nd March (theVernal Equinox) a pinetree was cut in the woods and brought into theTemple of Cybele. It was treated almost as a divinity, was deckedwith violets, and the effigy of a young man tied to the stem (cf. theCrucifixion). The 24th was called the "Day of Blood"; the High Priestfirst drew blood from his own arms; and then the others gashed andslashed themselves, and spattered the altar and the sacred tree withblood; while novices made themselves eunuchs "for the kingdom ofheaven's sake." The effigy was afterwards laid in a tomb. But whennight fell, says Dr. Frazer, (1) sorrow was turned to joy. A light wasbrought, and the tomb was found to be empty. The next day, the 25th, wasthe festival of the Resurrection; and ended in carnival and license(the Hilaria). Further, says Dr. Frazer, these mysteries "seem to haveincluded a sacramental meal and a baptism of blood." (1) See Adonis, Attis and Osiris, Part IV of The Golden Bough, byJ. G. Frazer, p. 229."In the baptism the devotee, crowned with gold and wreathed withfillets, descended into a pit, the mouth of which was covered with awooden grating. A bull, adorned with garlands of flowers, its foreheadglittering with gold leaf, was then driven on to the grating and therestabbed to death with a consecrated spear. Its hot reeking bloodpoured in torrents through the apertures, and was received with devouteagerness by the worshiper on every part of his person and garments,till he emerged from the pit, drenched, dripping, and scarlet from headto foot, to receive the homage, nay the adoration, of his fellows--asone who had been born again to eternal life and had washed away his sinsin the blood of the bull." (1) And Frazer continuing says: "That thebath of blood derived from slaughter of the bull (tauro-bolium)was believed to regenerate the devotee for eternity is proved by aninscription found at Rome, which records that a certain SextiliusAgesilaus Aedesius, who dedicated an altar to Attis and the mother ofthe gods (Cybele) was taurobolio criobolio que in aeternum renatus."(2) "In the procedure of the Taurobolia and Criobolia," says Mr. J. M.Robertson, (3) "which grew very popular in the Roman world, we have theliteral and original meaning of the phrase 'washed in the blood of thelamb' (4); the doctrine being that resurrection and eternal lifewere secured by drenching or sprinkling with the actual blood of asacrificial bull or ram." (5) For the POPULARITY of the rite we mayquote Franz Cumont, who says:--"Cette douche sacree (taurobolium) pareitavoir ete administree en Cappadoce dans un grand nombre de sanctuaires,et en particulier dans ceux de Ma la grande divinite indigene, et dansceux: de Anahita." (1) See vol. i, pp. 334 ff. (2) Adonis, Attis and Osiris, p. 229. References to Prudentius,and to Firmicus Maternus, De errore 28. 8. (3) That is, "By the slaughter of the bull and the slaughter ofthe ram born again into eternity." (4) Pagan Christs, p. 315. (5) Mysteres de Mithra, Bruxelles, 1902, p. 153.Whether Mr. Robertson is right in ascribing to the priests (as heappears to do) so materialistic a view of the potency of the actualblood is, I should say, doubtful. I do not myself see that there isany reason for supposing that the priests of Mithra or Attis regardedbaptism by blood very differently from the way in which the ChristianChurch has generally regarded baptism by water--namely, as a SYMBOL ofsome inner regeneration. There may certainly have been a little moreof the MAGICAL view and a little less of the symbolic, in the olderreligions; but the difference was probably on the whole more one ofdegree than of essential disparity. But however that may be, we cannotbut be struck by the extraordinary analogy between the tombstoneinscriptions of that period "born again into eternity by the blood ofthe Bull or the Ram," and the corresponding texts in our graveyardsto-day. F. Cumont in his elaborate work, Textes et Monuments relatifsaux Mysteres de Mithra (2 vols., Brussels, 1899) gives a great number oftexts and epitaphs of the same character as that above-quoted, and theyare well worth studying by those interested in the subject. Cumont, itmay be noted (vol. i, p. 305), thinks that the story of Mithra and theslaying of the Bull must have originated among some pastoral people towhom the bull was the source of all life. The Bull in heaven--the symbolof the triumphant Sungod--and the earthly bull, sacrificed for the goodof humanity were one and the same; the god, in fact, SACRIFICED HIMSELFOR HIS REPRESENTATIVE. And Mithra was the hero who first won thisconception of divinity for mankind--though of course it is in essencequite similar to the conception put forward by the Christian Church.As illustrating the belief that the Baptism by Blood was accompanied bya real regeneration of the devotee, Frazer quotes an ancient writer(1) who says that for some time after the ceremony the fiction of a newbirth was kept up by dieting the devotee on MILK, like a new-bornbabe. And it is interesting in that connection to find that even in thepresent day a diet of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BUT MILK for six or eightweeks is by many doctors recommended as the only means of getting ridof deep-seated illnesses and enabling a patient's organism to make acompletely new start in life. (1) Sallustius philosophus. See Adonis, Attis and Osiris, note,p. 229."At Rome," he further says (p. 230), "the new birth and the remissionof sins by the shedding of bull's blood appear to have been carriedout above all at the sanctuary of the Phrygian Goddess (Cybele) onthe Vatican Hill, at or near the spot where the great basilica of St.Peter's now stands; for many inscriptions relating to the rites werefound when the church was being enlarged in 1608 or 1609. Fromthe Vatican as a centre," he continues, "this barbarous system ofsuperstition seems to have spread to other parts of the Roman empire.Inscriptions found in Gaul and Germany prove that provincial sanctuariesmodelled their ritual on that of the Vatican."It would appear then that at Rome in the quiet early days of theChristian Church, the rites and ceremonials of Mithra and Cybele,probably much intermingled and blended, were exceedingly popular. Bothreligions had been recognized by the Roman State, and the Christians,persecuted and despised as they were, found it hard to make any headwayagainst them--the more so perhaps because the Christian doctrinesappeared in many respects to be merely faint replicas and copies of theolder creeds. Robertson maintains (1) that a he-lamb was sacrificed inthe Mithraic mysteries, and he quotes Porphyry as saying (2) that"a place near the equinoctial circle was assigned to Mithra as anappropriate seat; and on this account he bears the sword of the Ram(Aries) which is a sign of Mars (Ares)." Similarly among the earlyChristians, it is said, a ram or lamb was sacrificed in the Paschalmystery. (1) Pagan Christs, p. 336. (2) De Antro, xxiv.Many people think that the association of the Lamb-god with the Crossarose from the fact that the constellation Aries at that time WAS on theheavenly cross (the crossways of the Ecliptic and Equator-see diagram,ch. iii), and in the very place through which the Sungod had to passjust before his final triumph. And it is curious to find that JustinMartyr in his Dialogue with Trypho (1) (a Jew) alludes to an old Jewishpractice of roasting a Lamb on spits arranged in the form of a Cross."The lamb," he says, meaning apparently the Paschal lamb, "is roastedand dressed up in the form of a cross. For one spit is transfixed rightthrough the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, towhich are attached the legs (forelegs) of the lamb." (1) Ch. xl.To-day in Morocco at the festival of Eid-el-Kebir, corresponding to theChristian Easter, the Mohammedans sacrifice a young ram and hurry itstill bleeding to the precincts of the Mosque, while at the same timeevery household slays a lamb, as in the Biblical institution, for itsfamily feast.But it will perhaps be said, "You are going too fast and proving toomuch. In the anxiety to show that the Lamb-god and the sacrifice of theLamb were honored by the devotees of Mithra and Cybele in the Rome ofthe Christian era, you are forgetting that the sacrifice of the Bull andthe baptism in bull's blood were the salient features of the Persian andPhrygian ceremonials, some centuries earlier. How can you reconcilethe existence side by side of divinities belonging to such differentperiods, or ascribe them both to an astronomical origin?" The answeris simple enough. As I have explained before, the Precession of theEquinoxes caused the Sun, at its moment of triumph over the powers ofdarkness, to stand at one period in the constellation of the Bull, andat a period some two thousand years later in the constellation of theRam. It was perfectly natural therefore that a change in the sacredsymbols should, in the course of time, take place; yet perfectly naturalalso that these symbols, having once been consecrated and adopted,should continue to be honored and clung to long after the time of theirastronomical appropriateness had passed, and so to be found side by sidein later centuries. The devotee of Mithra or Attis on the VaticanHill at Rome in the year 200 A.D. probably had as little notion orcomprehension of the real origin of the sacred Bull or Ram which headored, as the Christian in St. Peter's to-day has of the origin of theLamb-god whose vicegerent on earth is the Pope.It is indeed easy to imagine that the change from the worship of theBull to the worship of the Lamb which undoubtedly took place amongvarious peoples as time went on, was only a ritual change initiatedby the priests in order to put on record and harmonize with theastronomical alteration. Anyhow it is curious that while Mithra in theearly times was specially associated with the bull, his association withthe lamb belonged more to the Roman period. Somewhat the same happenedin the case of Attis. In the Bible we read of the indignation ofMoses at the setting up by the Israelites of a Golden Calf, AFTERthe sacrifice of the ram-lamb had been instituted--as if indeed therebellious people were returning to the earlier cult of Apis which theyought to have left behind them in Egypt. In Egypt itself, too, we findthe worship of Apis, as time went on, yielding place to that of theRam-headed god Amun, or Jupiter Ammon. (1) So that both from the Bibleand from Egyptian history we may conclude that the worship of the Lambor Ram succeeded to the worship of the Bull. (1) Tacitus (Hist. v. 4) speaks of ram-sacrifice by the Jews inhonor of Jupiter Ammon. See also Herodotus (ii. 42) on the same inEgypt.Finally it has been pointed out, and there may be some real connectionin the coincidence, that in the quite early years of Christianity theFISH came in as an accepted symbol of Jesus Christ. Considering thatafter the domination of Taurus and Aries, the Fish (Pisces) comes nextin succession as the Zodiacal sign for the Vernal Equinox, and is nowthe constellation in which the Sun stands at that period, it seemsnot impossible that the astronomical change has been the cause of theadoption of this new symbol.Anyhow, and allowing for possible errors or exaggerations, it becomesclear that the travels of the Sun through the belt of constellationswhich forms the Zodiac must have had, from earliest times, a profoundinfluence on the generation of religious myths and legends. To say thatit was the only influence would certainly be a mistake. Other causesundoubtedly contributed. But it was a main and important influence. Theorigins of the Zodiac are obscure; we do not know with any certainty thereasons why the various names were given to its component sections, norcan we measure the exact antiquity of these names; but--pre-supposingthe names of the signs as once given--it is not difficult to imagine thegrowth of legends connected with the Sun's course among them.Of all the ancient divinities perhaps Hercules is the one whose roleas a Sungod is most generally admitted. The helper of gods and men, amighty Traveller, and invoked everywhere as the Saviour, his laborsfor the good of the world became ultimately defined and systematizedas twelve and corresponding in number to the signs of the Zodiac. Itis true that this systematization only took place at a late period,probably in Alexandria; also that the identification of some of theLabors with the actual signs as we have them at present is not alwaysclear. But considering the wide prevalence of the Hercules myth overthe ancient world and the very various astronomical systems it must havebeen connected with in its origin, this lack of exact correspondence ishardly to be wondered at.The Labors of Hercules which chiefly interest us are: (1) The captureof the Bull, (2) the slaughter of the Lion, (3) the destruction of theHydra, (4) of the Boar, (5) the cleansing of the stables of Augeas, (6)the descent into Hades and the taming of Cerberus. The first of theseis in line with the Mithraic conquest of the Bull; the Lion is of courseone of the most prominent constellations of the Zodiac, and its conquestis obviously the work of a Saviour of mankind; while the last fourlabors connect themselves very naturally with the Solar conflict inwinter against the powers of darkness. The Boar (4) we have seen alreadyas the image of Typhon, the prince of darkness; the Hydra (3) was saidto be the offspring of Typhon; the descent into Hades (6)--generallyassociated with Hercules' struggle with and victory over Death--links onto the descent of the Sun into the underworld, and its long and doubtfulstrife with the forces of winter; and the cleansing of the stablesof Augeas (5) has the same signification. It appears in fact that thestables of Augeas was another name for the sign of Capricorn throughwhich the Sun passes at the Winter solstice (1)--the stable of coursebeing an underground chamber--and the myth was that there, in thislowest tract and backwater of the Ecliptic all the malarious and evilinfluences of the sky were collected, and the Sungod came to wash themaway (December was the height of the rainy season in Judaea) and cleansethe year towards its rebirth. (1) See diagram of Zodiac.It should not be forgotten too that even as a child in the cradleHercules slew two serpents sent for his destruction--the serpent and thescorpion as autumnal constellations figuring always as enemies of theSungod--to which may be compared the power given to his disciples byJesus (1) "to tread on serpents and scorpions." Hercules also as aSungod compares curiously with Samson (mentioned above, ii), but weneed not dwell on all the elaborate analogies that have been traced (2)between these two heroes. (1) Luke x. 19. (2) See Doane's Bible Myths, ch. viii, (New York, 1882.)The Jesus-story, it will now be seen, has a great number ofcorrespondences with the stories of former Sungods and with the actualcareer of the Sun through the heavens--so many indeed that they cannotwell be attributed to mere coincidence or even to the blasphemous wilesof the Devil! Let us enumerate some of these. There are (1) the birthfrom a Virgin mother; (2) the birth in a stable (cave or undergroundchamber); and (3) on the 25th December (just after the winter solstice).There is (4) the Star in the East (Sirius) and (5) the arrival of theMagi (the "Three Kings"); there is (6) the threatened Massacre of theInnocents, and the consequent flight into a distant country (told alsoof Krishna and other Sungods). There are the Church festivals of (7)Candlemas (2nd February), with processions of candles to symbolize thegrowing light; of (8) Lent, or the arrival of Spring; of (9) Easter Day(normally on the 25th March) to celebrate the crossing of the Equatorby the Sun; and (10) simultaneously the outburst of lights at the HolySepulchre at Jerusalem. There is (11) the Crucifixion and death of theLamb-God, on Good Friday, three days before Easter; there are (12) thenailing to a tree, (13) the empty grave, (14) the glad Resurrection (asin the cases of Osiris, Attis and others); there are (15) the twelvedisciples (the Zodiacal signs); and (16) the betrayal by one of thetwelve. Then later there is (17) Midsummer Day, the 24th June, dedicatedto the Nativity of John the Baptist, and corresponding to ChristmasDay; there are the festivals of (18) the Assumption of the Virgin(15th August) and of (19) the Nativity of the Virgin (8th September),corresponding to the movement of the god through Virgo; there is theconflict of Christ and his disciples with the autumnal asterisms, (20)the Serpent and the Scorpion; and finally there is the curious fact thatthe Church (21) dedicates the very day of the winter solstice (when anyone may very naturally doubt the rebirth of the Sun) to St. Thomas, whodoubted the truth of the Resurrection!These are some of, and by no means all, the coincidences in question.But they are sufficient, I think, to prove--even allowing for possiblemargins of error--the truth of our general contention. To go into theparallelism of the careers of Krishna, the Indian Sungod, andJesus would take too long; because indeed the correspondence is soextraordinarily close and elaborate. (1) I propose, however, at theclose of this chapter, to dwell now for a moment on the Christianfestival of the Eucharist, partly on account of its connection with thederivation from the astronomical rites and Nature-celebrations alreadyalluded to, and partly on account of the light which the festivalgenerally, whether Christian or Pagan, throws on the origins ofReligious Magic--a subject I shall have to deal with in the nextchapter. (1) See Robertson's Christianity and Mythology, Part II, pp.129-302; also Doane's Bible Myths, ch. xxviii, p. 278.I have already (Ch. II) mentioned the Eucharistic rite held incommemoration of Mithra, and the indignant ascription of this by JustinMartyr to the wiles of the Devil. Justin Martyr clearly had no doubtabout the resemblance of the Mithraic to the Christian ceremony. ASacramental meal, as mentioned a few pages back, seems to have been heldby the worshipers of Attis (1) in commemoration of their god; andthe 'mysteries' of the Pagan cults generally appear to have includedrites--sometimes half-savage, sometimes more aesthetic--in which adismembered animal was eaten, or bread and wine (the spirits of the Cornand the Vine) were consumed, as representing the body of the god whomhis devotees desired to honor. But the best example of this practice isafforded by the rites of Dionysus, to which I will devote a few lines.Dionysus, like other Sun or Nature deities, was born of a Virgin (Semeleor Demeter) untainted by any earthly husband; and born on the 25th.December. He was nurtured in a Cave, and even at that early age wasidentified with the Ram or Lamb, into whose form he was for the timebeing changed. At times also he was worshiped in the form of a Bull.(2) He travelled far and wide; and brought the great gift of wine tomankind. (3) He was called Liberator, and Saviour. His grave "was shownat Delphi in the inmost shrine of the temple of Apollo. Secret offeringswere brought thither, while the women who were celebrating the feastwoke up the new-born god.... Festivals of this kind in celebration ofthe extinction and resurrection of the deity were held (by women andgirls only) amid the mountains at night, every third year, about thetime of the shortest day. The rites, intended to express the excess ofgrief and joy at the death and reappearance of the god, were wild evento savagery, and the women who performed them were hence known bythe expressive names of Bacchae, Maenads, and Thyiades. They wanderedthrough woods and mountains, their flying locks crowned with ivy orsnakes, brandishing wands and torches, to the hollow sounds of the drum,or the shrill notes of the flute, with wild dances and insane cries andjubilation." (1) See Frazer's Golden Bough, Part IV, p. 229. (2) The Golden Bough, Part II, Book II, p. 164. (3) "I am the TRUE Vine," says the Jesus of the fourth gospel,perhaps with an implicit and hostile reference to the cult ofDionysus--in which Robertson suggests (Christianity and Mythology, p.357) there was a ritual miracle of turning water into wine.Oxen, goats, even fawns and roes from the forest were killed, torn topieces, and eaten raw. This in imitation of the treatment of Dionysus bythe Titans, (1)--who it was supposed had torn the god in pieces when achild. (1) See art. Dionysus. Dictionary of Classical Antiquities,Nettleship and Sandys 3rd edn., London, 1898).Dupuis, one of the earliest writers (at the beginning of last century)on this subject, says, describing the mystic rites of Dionysus (1):"The sacred doors of the Temple in which the initiation took place wereopened only once a year, and no stranger might ever enter. Night lent tothese august mysteries a veil which was forbidden to be drawn aside--forwhoever it might be. (2) It was the sole occasion for the representationof the passion of Bacchus (Dionysus) dead, descended into hell, andrearisen--in imitation of the representation of the sufferings of Osiriswhich, according to Herodotus, were commemorated at Sais in Egypt. Itwas in that place that the partition took place of the body of the god,(3) which was then eaten--the ceremony, in fact, of which our Eucharistis only a reflection; whereas in the mysteries of Bacchus actual rawflesh was distributed, which each of those present had to consume incommemoration of the death of Bacchus dismembered by the Titans, andwhose passion, in Chios and Tenedos, was renewed each year by thesacrifice of a man who represented the god. (4) Possibly it is this lastfact which made people believe that the Christians (whose hoc est corpusmeum and sharing of an Eucharistic meal were no more than a shadow of amore ancient rite) did really sacrifice a child and devour its limbs." (1) See Charles F. Dupuis, "Traite des Mysteres," ch. i. (2) Pausan, Corinth, ch. 37. (3) Clem, Prot. Eur. Bacch. (4) See Porphyry, De Abstinentia, lii, Section 56.That Eucharistic rites were very very ancient is plain from theTotem-sacraments of savages; and to this subject we shall now turn.IV. TOTEM-SACRAMENTS AND EUCHARISTSMuch has been written on the origin of the Totem-system--the system,that is, of naming a tribe or a portion of a tribe (say a CLAN)after some ANIMAL--or sometimes--also after some plant or tree orNature-element, like fire or rain or thunder; but at best the subject isa difficult one for us moderns to understand. A careful study has beenmade of it by Salamon Reinach in his Cultes, Mythes et Religions, (1)where he formulates his conclusions in twelve statements or definitions;but even so--though his suggestions are helpful--he throws very littlelight on the real origin of the system. (2) (1) See English translation of certain chapters (published byDavid Nutt in 1912) entitled Cults, Myths and Religions, pp. 1-25. TheFrench original is in three large volumes. (2) The same may be said of the formulated statement of thesubject in Morris Jastrow's Handbooks of the History of Religion, vol.iv.There are three main difficulties. The first is to understand whyprimitive Man should name his Tribe after an animal or object of natureat all; the second, to understand on what principle he selected theparticular name (a lion, a crocodile, a lady bird, a certain tree); thethird, why he should make of the said totem a divinity, and pay honorand worship to it. It may be worth while to pause for a moment overthese.(1) The fact that the Tribe was one of the early things for which Manfound it necessary to have a name is interesting, because it showshow early the solidarity and psychological actuality of the tribewas recognized; and as to the selection of a name from some animal orconcrete object of Nature, that was inevitable, for the simple reasonthat there was nothing else for the savage to choose from. Plainly tocall his tribe "The Wayfarers" or "The Pioneers" or the "Pacifists" orthe "Invincibles," or by any of the thousand and one names which modernassociations adopt, would have been impossible, since such abstractterms had little or no existence in his mind. And again to name it afteran animal was the most obvious thing to do, simply because the animalswere by far the most important features or accompaniments of his ownlife. As I am dealing in this book largely with certain psychologicalconditions of human evolution, it has to be pointed out that toprimitive man the animal was the nearest and most closely related of allobjects. Being of the same order of consciousness as himself, the animalappealed to him very closely as his mate and equal. He made with regardto it little or no distinction from himself. We see this very clearly inthe case of children, who of course represent the savage mind, and whoregard animals simply as their mates and equals, and come quickly intorapport with them, not differentiating themselves from them.(2) As to the particular animal or other object selected in order togive a name to the Tribe, this would no doubt be largely accidental. Anyunusual incident might superstitiously precipitate a name. We can hardlyimagine the Tribe scratching its congregated head in the deliberateeffort to think out a suitable emblem for itself. That is not the way inwhich nicknames are invented in a school or anywhere else to-day. At thesame time the heraldic appeal of a certain object of nature, animate orinanimate, would be deeply and widely felt. The strength of the lion,the fleetness of the deer, the food-value of a bear, the flight of abird, the awful jaws of a crocodile, might easily mesmerize a wholetribe. Reinach points out, with great justice, that many tribes placedthemselves under the protection of animals which were supposed (rightlyor wrongly) to act as guides and augurs, foretelling the future."Diodorus," he says, "distinctly states that the hawk, in Egypt, wasvenerated because it foretold the future." (Birds generally act as and Samoa the kangaroo, the crow and the owl premonish their fellowclansmen of events to come. At one time the Samoan warriors went so faras to rear owls for their prophetic qualities in war. (The jackal,or 'pathfinder'--whose tracks sometimes lead to the remains of afood-animal slain by a lion, and many birds and insects, have a value ofthis kind.) "The use of animal totems for purposes of augury is, in alllikelihood, of great antiquity. Men must soon have realized that thesenses of animals were acuter than their own; nor is it surprising thatthey should have expected their totems--that is to say, their naturalallies--to forewarn them both of unsuspected dangers and of thoseprovisions of nature, WELLS especially, which animals seem to scentby instinct." (1) And again, beyond all this, I have little doubt thatthere are subconscious affinities which unite certain tribes to certainanimals or plants, affinities whose origin we cannot now trace, thoughthey are very real--the same affinities that we recognize as existingbetween individual PERSONS and certain objects of nature. W. H.Hudson--himself in many respects having this deep and primitive relationto nature--speaks in a very interesting and autobiographical volume (2)of the extraordinary fascination exercised upon him as a boy, notonly by a snake, but by certain trees, and especially by a particularflowering-plant "not more than a foot in height, with downy softpale green leaves, and clusters of reddish blossoms, something likevalerian." ... "One of my sacred flowers," he calls it, and insists onthe "inexplicable attraction" which it had for him. In various ways ofthis kind one can perceive how particular totems came to be selected byparticular peoples. (1) See Reinach, Eng. trans., op. cit., pp. 20, 21. (2) Far away and Long ago (1918) chs. xvi and xvii.(3) As to the tendency to divinize these totems, this arises no doubtpartly out of question (2). The animal or other object admired onaccount of its strength or swiftness, or adopted as guardian of thetribe because of its keen sight or prophetic quality, or infinitelyprized on account of its food-value, or felt for any other reason tohave a peculiar relation and affinity to the tribe, is by that fact SETAPART. It becomes taboo. It must not be killed--except under necessityand by sanction of the whole tribe--nor injured; and all dealings withit must be fenced round with regulations. It is out of this taboo orsystem of taboos that, according to Reinach, religion arose. "I propose(he says) to define religion as: A SUM OF SCRUPLES (TABOOS) WHICH IMPEDETHE FREE EXERCISE OF OUR FACULTIES." (1) Obviously this definition isgravely deficient, simply because it is purely negative, and leavesout of account the positive aspect of the subject. In Man, the positivecontent of religion is the instinctive sense--whether conscious orsubconscious--of an inner unity and continuity with the world around.This is the stuff out of which religion is made. The scruples or tabooswhich "impede the freedom" of this relation are the negative forceswhich give outline and form to the relation. These are the things whichgenerate the RITES AND CEREMONIALS of religion; and as far as Reinachmeans by religion MERELY rites and ceremonies he is correct; but clearlyhe only covers half the subject. The tendency to divinize the totem isat least as much dependent on the positive sense of unity with it, as onthe negative scruples which limit the relation in each particular case.But I shall return to this subject presently, and more than once, withthe view of clarifying it. Just now it will be best to illustrate thenature of Totems generally, and in some detail. (1) See Orpheus by S. Reinach, p. 3.As would be gathered from what I have just said, there is found amongall the more primitive peoples, and in all parts of the world, animmense variety of totem-names. The Dinkas, for instance, are a ratherintelligent well-grown people inhabiting the upper reaches of the Nilein the vicinity of the great swamps. According to Dr. Seligman theirclans have for totems the lion, the elephant, the crocodile, thehippopotamus, the fox, and the hyena, as well as certain birds whichinfest and damage the corn, some plants and trees, and such things asrain, fire, etc. "Each clan speaks of its totem as its ancestor, andrefrains (as a rule) from injuring or eating it." (1) The members of theCrocodile clan call themselves "brothers of the crocodile." The tribesof Bechuana-land have a very similar list of totem-names--the buffalo,the fish, the porcupine, the wild vine, etc. They too have a Crocodileclan, but they call the crocodile their FATHER! The tribes of Australiamuch the same again, with the differences suitable to their country; andthe Red Indians of North America the same. Garcilasso, della Vega,the Spanish historian, son of an Inca princess by one of the Spanishconquerors of Peru and author of the well-known book CommentariasReales, says in that book (i, 57), speaking of the pre-Inca period, "AnIndian (of Peru) was not considered honorable unless he was descendedfrom a fountain, river or lake, or even from the sea, or from a wildanimal, as a bear, lion, tiger, eagle, or the bird they call cuntur(condor), or some other bird of prey." (2) According to Lewis Morgan,the North American Indians of various tribes had for totems the wolf,bear, beaver, turtle, deer, snipe, heron, hawk, crane, loon, turkey,muskrat; pike, catfish, carp; buffalo, elk, reindeer, eagle, hare,rabbit, snake; reed-grass, sand, rock, and tobacco-plant. (1) See The Golden Bough, vol. iv, p. 31. (2) See Andrew Lang, Custom and Myth, p. 104, also Myth, Ritualand Religion, vol. i, pp. 71, 76, etc.So we might go on rather indefinitely. I need hardly say that in moremodern and civilized life, relics of the totem system are still to befound in the forms of the heraldic creatures adopted for their crests bydifferent families, and in the bears, lions, eagles, the sun, moon andstars and so forth, which still adorn the flags and are flaunted as theinsignia of the various nations. The names may not have been ORIGINALLYadopted from any definite belief in blood-relationship with the animalor other object in question; but when, as Robertson says (Pagan Christs,p. 104), a "savage learned that he was 'a Bear' and that his fatherand grandfather and forefathers were so before him, it was reallyimpossible, after ages in which totem-names thus passed current, that heshould fail to assume that his folk were DESCENDED from a bear."As a rule, as may be imagined, the savage tribesman will on no accountEAT his tribal totem-animal. Such would naturally be deemed a kind ofsacrilege. Also it must be remarked that some totems are hardly suitablefor eating. Yet it is important to observe that occasionally, andguarding the ceremony with great precautions, it has been an almostuniversal custom for the tribal elders to call a feast at whichan animal (either the totem or some other) IS killed and commonlyeaten--and this in order that the tribesmen may absorb some virtuebelonging to it, and may confirm their identity with the tribe and witheach other. The eating of the bear or other animal, the sprinkling withits blood, and the general ritual in which the participants shared itsflesh, or dressed and disguised themselves in its skin, or otherwiseidentified themselves with it, was to them a symbol of their communityof life with each other, and a means of their renewal and salvation inthe holy emblem. And this custom, as the reader will perceive, becamethe origin of the Eucharists and Holy Communions of the later religions.Professor Robertson-Smith's celebrated Camel affords an instance ofthis. (1) It appears that St. Nilus (fifth century) has left a detailedaccount of the occasional sacrifice in his time of a spotless whitecamel among the Arabs of the Sinai region, which closely resembles atotemic communion-feast. The uncooked blood and flesh of the animal hadto be entirely consumed by the faithful before daybreak. "The slaughterof the victim, the sacramental drinking of the blood, and devouring inwild haste of the pieces of still quivering flesh, recall the detailsof the Dionysiac and other festivals." (2) Robertson-Smith himselfsays:--"The plain meaning is that the victim was devoured before itslife had left the still warm blood and flesh... and that thus in themost literal way, all those who shared in the ceremony absorbed part ofthe victim's life into themselves. One sees how much more forciblythan any ordinary meal such a rite expresses the establishment orconfirmation of a bond of common life between the worshipers, and also,since the blood is shed upon the altar itself, between the worshipersand their god. In this sacrifice, then, the significant factors are two:the conveyance of the living blood to the godhead, and the absorption ofthe living flesh and blood into the flesh and blood of the worshippers.Each of these is effected in the simplest and most direct manner, sothat the meaning of the ritual is perfectly transparent." (1) See his Religion of the Semites, p. 320. (2) They also recall the rites of the Passover--though in thislatter the blood was no longer drunk, nor the flesh eaten raw.It seems strange, of course, that men should eat their totems; andit must not by any means be supposed that this practice is (or was)universal; but it undoubtedly obtains in some cases. As Miss Harrisonsays (Themis, p. 123); "you do not as a rule eat your relations," and asa rule the eating of a totem is tabu and forbidden, but (Miss Harrisoncontinues) "at certain times and under certain restrictions a man notonly may, but MUST, eat of his totem, though only sparingly, as of athing sacrosanct." The ceremonial carried out in a communal way by thetribe not only identifies the tribe with the totem (animal), but isheld, according to early magical ideas, and when the animal is desiredfor food, to favor its manipulation. The human tribe partakes of themana or life-force of the animal, and is strengthened; the animal tribeis sympathetically renewed by the ceremonial and multiplies exceedingly.The slaughter of the sacred animal and (often) the simultaneousoutpouring of human blood seals the compact and confirms the magic. Thisis well illustrated by a ceremony of the 'Emu' tribe referred to by Dr.Frazer:--"In order to multiply Emus which are an important article of food, themen of the Emu totem in the Arunta tribe proceed as follows: They cleara small spot of level ground, and opening veins in their arms they letthe blood stream out until the surface of the ground for a space ofabout three square yards is soaked with it. When the blood has driedand caked, it forms a hard and fairly impermeable surface, on which theypaint the sacred design of the emu totem, especially the parts of thebird which they like best to eat, namely, the fat and the eggs. Roundthis painting the men sit and sing. Afterwards performers wearing longhead-dresses to represent the long neck and small head of the emu, mimicthe appearance of the bird as it stands aimlessly peering about in alldirections." (1) (1) The Golden Bough i, 85--with reference to Spencer andGillen's Native Tribes of Central Australia, pp. 179, 189.Thus blood sacrifice comes in; and--(whether this has ever actuallyhappened in the case of the Central Australians I know not)--we caneasily imagine a member of the Emu tribe, and disguised as an actualemu, having been ceremonially slaughtered as a firstfruits and promiseof the expected and prayed-for emu-crop; just as the same certainlyHAS happened in the case of men wearing beast-masks of Bulls or Ramsor Bears being sacrificed in propitiation of Bull-gods, Ram-gods orBear-gods or simply in pursuance of some kind of magic to favor themultiplication of these food-animals."In the light of totemistic ways of thinking we see plainly enough therelation of man to food-animals. You need or at least desire flesh food,yet you shrink from slaughtering 'your brother the ox'; you desire hismana, yet you respect his tabu, for in you and him alike runs the commonlife-blood. On your own individual responsibility you would never killhim; but for the common weal, on great occasions, and in a fashionconducted with scrupulous care, it is expedient that he die for hispeople, and that they feast upon his flesh." (1) (1) Themis, p. 140.In her little book Ancient Art and Ritual (1) Jane Harrison describesthe dedication of a holy Bull, as conducted in Greece at Elis, and atMagnesia and other cities. "There at the annual fair year by year thestewards of the city bought a Bull 'the finest that could be got,' andat the new moon of the month at the beginning of seed-time (? April) Bull was led in procession at the head of which went the chief priestand priestess of the city. With them went a herald and sacrificer,and two bands of youths and maidens. So holy was the Bull that nothingunlucky might come near him. The herald pronounced aloud a prayer for'the safety of the city and the land, and the citizens, and the womenand children, for peace and wealth, and for the bringing forth of grainand all other fruits, and of cattle.' All this longing for fertility,for food and children, focuses round the holy Bull, whose holiness ishis strength and fruitfulness." The Bull is sacrificed. The flesh isdivided in solemn feast among those who take part in the procession."The holy flesh is not offered to a god, it is eaten--to every man hisportion--by each and every citizen, that he may get his share of thestrength of the Bull, of the luck of the State." But at Athens theBouphonia, as it was called, was followed by a curious ceremony. "Thehide was stuffed with straw and sewed up, and next the stuffed animalwas set on its feet and yoked to a plough as though it were ploughing.The Death is followed by a Resurrection. Now this is all important. Weare accustomed to think of sacrifice as the death, the giving up, therenouncing of something. But SACRIFICE does not mean 'death' at all. Itmeans MAKING HOLY, sanctifying; and holiness was to primitive man justspecial strength and life. What they wanted from the Bull was just thatspecial life and strength which all the year long they had put into him,and nourished and fostered. That life was in his blood. They could noteat that flesh nor drink that blood unless they killed him. So he mustdie. But it was not to give him up to the gods that they killed him,not to 'sacrifice' him in our sense, but to have him, keep him, eat him,live BY him and through him, by his grace." (1) Home University Library, p. 87.We have already had to deal with instances of the ceremonial eating ofthe sacred he-Lamb or Ram, immolated in the Spring season of the year,and partaken of in a kind of communal feast--not without reference (atany rate in later times) to a supposed Lamb-god. Among the Ainos in theNorth of Japan, as also among the Gilyaks in Eastern Siberia, the Bearis the great food-animal, and is worshipped as the supreme giver ofhealth and strength. There also a similar ritual of sacrifice occurs. Aperfect Bear is caught and caged. He is fed up and even pampered to theday of his death. "Fish, brandy and other delicacies are offered to him.Some of the people prostrate themselves before him; his coming intoa house brings a blessing, and if he sniffs at the food that brings ablessing too." Then he is led out and slain. A great feast takes place,the flesh is divided, cupfuls of the blood are drunk by the men;the tribe is united and strengthened, and the Bear-god blesses theceremony--the ideal Bear that has given its life for the people. (1) (1) See Art and Ritual, pp. 92-98; The Golden Bough, ii, 375seq.; Themis, pp. 140, 141; etc.That the eating of the flesh of an animal or a man conveys to you someof the qualities, the life-force, the mana, of that animal or man, is anidea which one often meets with among primitive folk. Hence the commontendency to eat enemy warriors slain in battle against your tribe. Bydoing so you absorb some of their valor and strength. Even the enemyscalps which an Apache Indian might hang from his belt were somethingmagical to add to the Apache's power. As Gilbert Murray says, (1) "youdevoured the holy animal to get its mana, its swiftness, its strength,its great endurance, just as the savage now will eat his enemy's brainor heart or hands to get some particular quality residing there."Even--as he explains on the earlier page--mere CONTACT was oftenconsidered sufficient--"we have holy pillars whose holiness consistsin the fact that they have been touched by the blood of a bull." And inthis connection we may note that nearly all the Christian Churches havea great belief in the virtue imparted by the mere 'laying on of hands.' (1) Four Stages of Greek Religion, p. 36.In quite a different connection--we read (1) that among the Spartans awarrior-boy would often beg for the love of the elder warrior whom headmired (i. e. the contact with his body) in order to obtain in thatway a portion of the latter's courage and prowess. That through themediation of the lips one's spirit may be united to the spirit ofanother person is an idea not unfamiliar to the modern mind; while theexchange of blood, clothes, locks of hair, etc., by lovers is a customknown all over the world. (2) (1) Aelian VII, iii, 12: [gr autoi goun (oi paides) deontai twnerastwn] [gr eispnein autois]. See also E. Bethe on "Die DorischeKnabenliebe" in the Rheinisches Museum, vol. 26, iii, 461. (2) See Crawley's Mystic Rose, pp. 238, 242.To suppose that by eating another you absorb his or her soul is somewhatnaive certainly. Perhaps it IS more native, more primitive. Yet theremay be SOME truth even in that idea. Certainly the food that one eatshas a psychological effect, and the flesh-eaters among the human racehave a different temperament as a rule from the fruit and vegetableeaters, while among the animals (though other causes may come inhere) the Carnivora are decidedly more cruel and less gentle than theHerbivora.To return to the rites of Dionysus, Gilbert Murray, speaking ofOrphism--a great wave of religious reform which swept over Greece andSouth Italy in the sixth century B.C.--says: (1) "A curious relic ofprimitive superstition and cruelty remained firmly imbedded in Orphism,a doctrine irrational and unintelligible, and for that very reasonwrapped in the deepest and most sacred mystery: a belief in theSACRIFICE OF DIONYSUS HIMSELF, AND THE PURIFICATION OF MAN BY HISBLOOD. It seems possible that the savage Thracians, in the fury of theirworship on the mountains, when they were possessed by the god and became'wild beasts,' actually tore with their teeth and hands any hares,goats, fawns or the like that they came across.... The Orphiccongregations of later times, in their most holy gatherings, solemnlypartook of the blood of a bull, which was by a mystery the blood ofDionysus-Zagreus himself, the Bull of God, slain in sacrifice for thepurification of man." (2) (1) See Notes to his translation of the Bacch[ae] of Euripides. (2) For a description of this orgy see Theocritus, Idyll xxvi;also for explanations of it, Lang's Myth, Ritual and Religion, vol. ii,pp, 241-260, on Dionysus. The Encyclop[ae]dia Brit., article "Orpheus,"says:--"Orpheus, in the manner of his death, was considered to personatethe god Dionysus, and was thus representative of the god torn to piecesevery year--a ceremony enacted by the Bacchae in the earliest times witha human victim, and afterwards with a bull, to represent the bull-formedgod. A distinct feature of this ritual was [gr wmofagia] (eating theflesh of the victim raw), whereby the communicants imagined that theyconsumed and assimilated the god represented by the victim, and thusbecame filled with the divine ecstasy." Compare also the Hindu doctrineof Praj[pati, the dismembered Lord of Creation.Such instances of early communal feasts, which fulfilled the double partof confirming on the one hand the solidarity of the tribe, and on theother of bringing the tribe, by the shedding of the blood of a divineVictim into close relationship with the very source of its life,are plentiful to find. "The sacramental rite," says ProfessorRobertson-Smith, (1) "is also an atoning rite, which brings thecommunity again into harmony with its alienated god--atonement beingsimply an act of communion designed to wipe out all memory of previousestrangement." With this subject I shall deal more specially in chaptervii below. Meanwhile as instances of early Eucharists we may mention thefollowing cases, remembering always that as the blood is regarded as theLife, the drinking or partaking of, or sprinkling with, blood is alwaysan acknowledgment of the common life; and that the juice of the grapebeing regarded as the blood of the Vine, wine in the later ceremonialsquite easily and naturally takes the place of the blood in the earlysacrifices. (1) Religion of the Semites, p. 302.Thus P. Andrada La Crozius, a French missionary, and one of the firstChristians who went to Nepaul and Thibet, says in his History of India:"Their Grand Lama celebrates a species of sacrifice with BREAD and WINE,in which, after taking a small quantity himself, he distributes therest among the Lamas present at this ceremony." (1) "The old Egyptianscelebrated the resurrection of Osiris by a sacrament, eating the sacredcake or wafer after it had been consecrated by the priest, and therebybecoming veritable flesh of his flesh." (2) As is well known, the eatingof bread or dough sacramentally (sometimes mixed with blood or seed)as an emblem of community of life with the divinity, is an extremelyancient practice or ritual. Dr. Frazer (3) says of the Aztecs,that "twice a year, in May and December, an image of the great godHuitzilopochtli was made of dough, then broken in pieces and solemnlyeaten by his worshipers." And Lord Kingsborough in his MexicanAntiquities (vol. vi, p. 220) gives a record of a "most Holy Supper"in which these people ate the flesh of their god. It was a cake made ofcertain seeds, "and having made it, they blessed it in their manner, andbroke it into pieces, which the high priest put into certain very cleanvessels, and took a thorn of maguey which resembles a very thick needle,with which he took up with the utmost reverence single morsels, whichhe put into the mouth of each individual in the manner of a communion."Acostas (4) confirms this and similar accounts. The Peruvians partook ofa sacrament consisting of a pudding of coarsely ground maize, of whicha portion had been smeared on the idol. The priest sprinkled it with theblood of the victim before distributing it to the people. Priest andpeople then all took their shares in turn, "with great care that noparticle should be allowed to fall to the ground--this being looked uponas a great sin." (5) (1) See Doane's Bible Myths, p. 306. (2) From The Great Law, of religious origins: by W. Williamson(1899), p. 177. (3) The Golden Bough, vol. ii, p. 79. (4) Natural and Moral History of the Indies. London (1604). (5) See Markham's Rites and laws of the Incas, p. 27.Moving from Peru to China (instead of 'from China to Peru') we find that"the Chinese pour wine (a very general substitute for blood) on a strawimage of Confucius, and then all present drink of it, and taste thesacrificial victim, in order to participate in the grace of Confucius."(Here again the Corn and Wine are blended in one rite.) And of TartaryFather Grueber thus testifies: "This only I do affirm, that the devil somimics the Catholic Church there, that although no European or Christianhas ever been there, still in all essential things they agree socompletely with the Roman Church, as even to celebrate the Host withbread and wine: with my own eyes I have seen it." (1) These fewinstances are sufficient to show the extraordinarily wide diffusion ofTotem-sacraments and Eucharistic rites all over the world. (1) For these two quotations see Jevons' Introduction to theHistory of Religion, pp. 148 and 219.V. FOOD AND VEGETATION MAGICI have wandered, in pursuit of Totems and the Eucharist, some way fromthe astronomical thread of Chapters II and III, and now it would appearthat in order to understand religious origins we must wander stillfarther. The chapters mentioned were largely occupied with Sungods andastronomical phenomena, but now we have to consider an earlier periodwhen there were no definite forms of gods, and when none but the vaguestastronomical knowledge existed. Sometimes in historical matters it isbest and safest to move thus backwards in Time, from the things recentand fairly well known to things more ancient and less known. In this waywe approach more securely to some understanding of the dim and remotepast.It is clear that before any definite speculations on heaven-dwellinggods or divine beings had arisen in the human mind--or any cleartheories of how the sun and moon and stars might be connected with thechanges of the seasons on the earth--there were still certain obviousthings which appealed to everybody, learned or unlearned alike. One ofthese was the return of Vegetation, bringing with it the fruits or thepromise of the fruits of the earth, for human food, and also bringingwith it increase of animal life, for food in another form; and the otherwas the return of Light and Warmth, making life easier in all ways. Fooddelivering from the fear of starvation; Light and Warmth delivering fromthe fear of danger and of cold. These were three glorious things whichreturned together and brought salvation and renewed life to man. Theperiod of their return was 'Spring,' and though Spring and its benefitsmight fade away in time, still there was always the HOPE of itsreturn--though even so it may have been a long time in human evolutionbefore man discovered that it really did always return, and (withcertain allowances) at equal intervals of time.Long then before any Sun or Star gods could be called in, the return ofthe Vegetation must have enthralled man's attention, and filled him withhope and joy. Yet since its return was somewhat variable and uncertainthe question, What could man do to assist that return? naturallybecame a pressing one. It is now generally held that the use ofMagic--sympathetic magic--arose in this way. Sympathetic magic seems tohave been generated by a belief that your own actions cause a similarresponse in things and persons around you. Yet this belief did not reston any philosophy or argument, but was purely instinctive and sometimesof the nature of a mere corporeal reaction. Every schoolboy knows howin watching a comrade's high jump at the Sports he often finds himselflifting a knee at the moment 'to help him over'; at football matchesquarrels sometimes arise among the spectators by reason of anill-placed kick coming from a too enthusiastic on-looker, behind one;undergraduates running on the tow-path beside their College boat inthe races will hurry even faster than the boat in order to increase itsspeed; there is in each case an automatic bodily response increasedby one's own desire. A person ACTS the part which he desires to besuccessful. He thinks to transfer his energy in that way. Again, if bychance one witnesses a painful accident, a crushed foot or what-not,it commonly happens that one feels a pain in the same part oneself--asympathetic pain. What more natural than to suppose that the painreally is transferred from the one person to the other? and how easy theinference that by tormenting a wretched scape-goat or crucifying a humanvictim in some cases the sufferings of people may be relieved or theirsins atoned for?Simaetha, it will be remembered, in the second Idyll of Theocritus,curses her faithless lover Delphis, and as she melts his waxen image sheprays that HE TOO MAY MELT. All this is of the nature of Magic, and isindependent of and generally more primitive than Theology or Philosophy.Yet it interests us because it points to a firm instinct in earlyman--to which I have already alluded--the instinct of his unity andcontinuity with the rest of creation, and of a common life so closethat his lightest actions may cause a far-reaching reaction in the worldoutside.Man, then, independently of any belief in gods, may assist the arrivalof Spring by magic ceremonies. If you want the Vegetation to appear youmust have rain; and the rain-maker in almost all primitive tribes hasbeen a MOST important personage. Generally he based his rites on quitefanciful associations, as when the rain-maker among the Mandans wore araven's skin on his head (bird of the storm) or painted his shield withred zigzags of lightning (1); but partly, no doubt, he had observedactual facts, or had had the knowledge of them transmitted to him--as,for instance that when rain is impending loud noises will bring aboutits speedy downfall, a fact we moderns have had occasion to notice onbattlefields. He had observed perhaps that in a storm a specially loudclap of thunder is generally followed by a greatly increased downpourof rain. He had even noticed (a thing which I have often verified inthe vicinity of Sheffield) that the copious smoke of fires will generaterain-clouds--and so quite naturally he concluded that it was his smokingSACRIFICES which had that desirable effect. So far he was on the trackof elementary Science. And so he made "bull-roarers" to imitate thesound of wind and the blessed rain-bringing thunder, or clashedgreat bronze cymbals together with the same object. Bull-voices andthunder-drums and the clashing of cymbals were used in this connectionby the Greeks, and are mentioned by Aeschylus (2); but the bull-roarer,in the form of a rhombus of wood whirled at the end of a string, seemsto be known, or to have been known, all over the world. It is describedwith some care by Mr. Andrew Lang in his Custom and Myth (pp. 29-44),where he says "it is found always as a sacred instrument employed inreligious mysteries, in New Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, ancientGreece, and Africa." (1) See Catlin's North American Indians, Letter 19. (2) Themis, p. 61.Sometimes, of course, the rain-maker was successful; but of the innercauses of rain he knew next to nothing; he was more ignorant even thanwe are! His main idea was a more specially 'magical' one--namely, thatthe sound itself would appeal to the SPIRITS of rain and thunder andcause them to give a response. For of course the thunder (in HebrewBath-Kol, "the daughter of the Voice") was everywhere regarded asthe manifestation of a spirit. (1) To make sounds like thunder wouldtherefore naturally call the attention of such a spirit; or he, therain-maker, might make sounds like rain. He made gourd-rattles (knownin ever so many parts of the world) in which he rattled dried seedsor small pebbles with a most beguiling and rain-like insistence; orsometimes, like the priests of Baal in the Bible, (2) he would cuthimself with knives till the blood fell upon the ground in great dropssuggestive of an oncoming thunder-shower. "In Mexico the rain god waspropitiated with sacrifices of children. If the children wept and shedabundant tears, they who carried them rejoiced, being convinced thatrain would also be abundant." (3) Sometimes he, the rain-maker, wouldWHISTLE for the wind, or, like the Omaha Indians, flap his blankets forthe same purpose. (1) See A. Lang, op. cit.: "The muttering of the thunder is saidto be his voice calling to the rain to fall and make the grass grow upgreen." Such are the very words of Umbara, the minstrel of the Tribe(Australian). (2) I Kings xviii. (3) Quoted from Sahagun II, 2, 3 by A. Lang in Myth, Ritual andReligion, vol. ii, p. 102.In the ancient myth of Demeter and Persephone--which has been adopted byso many peoples under so many forms--Demeter the Earth-mother loses herdaughter Persephone (who represents of course the Vegetation), carrieddown into the underworld by the evil powers of Darkness and Winter.And in Greece there was a yearly ceremonial and ritual of magic for thepurpose of restoring the lost one and bringing her back to the worldagain. Women carried certain charms, "fir-cones and snakes and unnamableobjects made of paste, to ensure fertility; there was a sacrifice ofpigs, who were thrown into a deep cleft of the earth, and their remainsafterwards collected and scattered as a charm over the fields."(1) Fir-cones and snakes from their very forms were emblems of malefertility; snakes, too, from their habit of gliding out of their ownskins with renewed brightness and color were suggestive of resurrectionand re-vivification; pigs and sows by their exceeding fruitfulness wouldin their hour of sacrifice remind old mother Earth of what was expectedfrom her! Moreover, no doubt it had been observed that the scattering ofdead flesh over the ground or mixed with the seed, did bless theground to a greater fertility; and so by a strange mixture of primitiveobservation with a certain child-like belief that by means of symbolsand suggestions Nature could be appealed to and induced to answer to thedesires and needs for her children this sort of ceremonial Magic arose.It was not exactly Science, and it was not exactly Religion; but it wasa naive, and perhaps not altogether mistaken, sense of the bond betweenNature and Man. (1) See Gilbert Murray's Four Stages of Greek Religion, p. 29.For we can perceive that earliest man was not yet consciouslydifferentiated from Nature. Not only do we see that the tribal life wasso strong that the individual seldom regarded himself as different orseparate or opposed to the rest of the tribe; but that something of thesame kind was true with regard to his relation to the Animals and toNature at large. This outer world was part of himself, was also himself.His sub-conscious sense of unity was so great that it largely dominatedhis life. That brain-cleverness and brain-activity which causes modernman to perceive such a gulf between him and the animals, or betweenhimself and Nature, did not exist in the early man. Hence it wasno difficulty to him to believe that he was a Bear or an Emu.Sub-consciously he was wiser than we are. He knew that he was a bear oran emu, or any other such animal as his totem-creed led him to fix hismind upon. Hence we find that a familiarity and common consent existedbetween primitive man and many of his companion animals such as hasbeen lost or much attenuated in modern times. Elisee Reclus in his veryinteresting paper La Grande Famille (1) gives support to the idea thatthe so-called domestication of animals did not originally arise from anyforcible subjugation of them by man, but from a natural amity withthem which grew up in the beginning from common interests, pursuits andaffections. Thus the chetah of India (and probably the puma of Brazil)from far-back times took to hunting in the company of his two-legged andbow-and-arrow-armed friend, with whom he divided the spoil. W. H. Hudson(2) declares that the Puma, wild and fierce though it is, and capableof killing the largest game, will never even to-day attack man, butwhen maltreated by the latter submits to the outrage, unresisting, withmournful cries and every sign of grief. The Llama, though domesticatedin a sense, has never allowed the domination of the whip or the bit,but may still be seen walking by the side of the Brazilian peasantand carrying his burdens in a kind of proud companionship. The mutualrelations of Women and the Cow, or of Man and the Horse (3) (also theElephant) reach so far into the past that their origin cannot be traced.The Swallow still loves to make its home under the cottage eaves andstill is welcomed by the inmates as the bringer of good fortune. EliseeReclus assures us that the Dinka man on the Nile calls to certain snakesby name and shares with them the milk of his cows. (1) Published originally in Le Magazine International, January1896. (2) See The Naturalist in La Plata, ch. ii. (3) "It is certain that the primitive Indo-European reared drovesof tame or half-tame horses for generations, if not centuries, beforeit ever occurred to him to ride or drive them" (F. B. Jevons, Introd. toHist. Religion, p. 119).And so with Nature. The communal sense, or subconscious perception,which made primitive men feel their unity with other members of theirtribe, and their obvious kinship with the animals around them, broughtthem also so close to general Nature that they looked upon the trees,the vegetation, the rain, the warmth of the sun, as part of theirbodies, part of themselves. Conscious differentiation had not yet setin. To cause rain or thunder you had to make rain- or thunder-likenoises; to encourage Vegetation and the crops to leap out of the ground,you had to leap and dance. "In Swabia and among the Transylvanian Saxonsit is a common custom (says Dr. Frazer) for a man who has some hemp toleap high in the field in the belief that this will make the hemp growtall." (1) Native May-pole dances and Jacks in the Green have hardlyyet died out--even in this most civilized England. The bower of greenboughs, the music of pipes, the leaping and the twirling, were all anencouragement to the arrival of Spring, and an expression of SympatheticMagic. When you felt full of life and energy and virility in yourselfyou naturally leapt and danced, so why should you not sympathetically dothis for the energizing of the crops? In every country of the worldthe vernal season and the resurrection of the Sun has been greeted withdances and the sound of music. But if you wanted success in huntingor in warfare then you danced before-hand mimic dances suggesting thesuccessful hunt or battle. It was no more than our children do to-day,and it all was, and is, part of a natural-magic tendency in humanthought. (1) See The Golden Bough, i, 139 seq. Also Art and Ritual, p. 31.Let me pause here for a moment. It is difficult for us with ouracademical and somewhat school-boardy minds to enter into all this, andto understand the sense of (unconscious or sub-conscious) identificationwith the world around which characterized the primitive man--or to lookupon Nature with his eyes. A Tree, a Snake, a Bull, an Ear of Corn. WEknow so well from our botany and natural history books what these thingsare. Why should our minds dwell on them any longer or harbor a doubt asto our perfect comprehension of them?And yet (one cannot help asking the question): Has any one of us reallyever SEEN a Tree? I certainly do not think that I have--except mostsuperficially. That very penetrating observer and naturalist, Henry D.Thoreau, tells us that he would often make an appointment to visit acertain tree, miles away--but what or whom he saw when he got there, hedoes not say. Walt Whitman, also a keen observer, speaks of a tulip-treenear which he sometimes sat--"the Apollo of the woods--tall andgraceful, yet robust and sinewy, inimitable in hang of foliage andthrowing-out of limb; as if the beauteous, vital, leafy creature couldwalk, if it only would"; and mentions that in a dream-trance he actuallyonce saw his "favorite trees step out and promenade up, down and aroundVERY CURIOUSLY." (1) Once the present writer seemed to have a partialvision of a tree. It was a beech, standing somewhat isolated, andstill leafless in quite early Spring. Suddenly I was aware of itsskyward-reaching arms and up-turned finger-tips, as if some vivid life(or electricity) was streaming through them far into the spaces ofheaven, and of its roots plunged in the earth and drawing the sameenergies from below. The day was quite still and there was no movementin the branches, but in that moment the tree was no longer a separate orseparable organism, but a vast being ramifying far into space, sharingand uniting the life of Earth and Sky, and full of a most amazingactivity. (1) Specimen Days, 1882-3 Edition, p. iii.The reader of this will probably have had some similar experiences.Perhaps he will have seen a full-foliaged Lombardy poplar swaying inhalf a gale in June--the wind and the sun streaming over every littletwig and leaf, the tree throwing out its branches in a kind of ecstasyand bathing them in the passionately boisterous caresses of its twovisitants; or he will have heard the deep glad murmur of some hugesycamore with ripening seed clusters when after weeks of drought thesteady warm rain brings relief to its thirst; and he will have knownthat these creatures are but likenesses of himself, intimately anddeeply-related to him in their love and hunger longing, and, likehimself too, unfathomed and unfathomable.It would be absurd to credit early man with conscious speculationslike these, belonging more properly to the twentieth century; yet it isincontrovertible, I think, that in SOME ways the primitive peoples, withtheir swift subconscious intuitions and their minds unclouded by merebook knowledge, perceived truths to which we moderns are blind. Likethe animals they arrived at their perceptions without (individual) braineffort; they knew things without thinking. When they did THINK of coursethey went wrong. Their budding science easily went astray. Religionwith them had as yet taken no definite shape; science was equallyprotoplasmic; and all they had was a queer jumble of the two in the formof Magic. When at a later time Science gradually defined its outlook andits observations, and Religion, from being a vague subconscious feeling,took clear shape in the form of gods and creeds, then mankind graduallyemerged into the stage of evolution IN WHICH WE NOW ARE. OUR scientificlaws and doctrines are of course only temporary formulae, and so alsoare the gods and the creeds of our own and other religions; but thesethings, with their set and angular outlines, have served in the pastand will serve in the future as stepping-stones towards another kind ofknowledge of which at present we only dream, and will lead us on toa renewed power of perception which again will not be the laboriousproduct of thought but a direct and instantaneous intuition like that ofthe animals--and the angels.To return to our Tree. Though primitive man did not speculate in modernstyle on these things, I yet have no reasonable doubt that he felt (andFEELS, in those cases where we can still trace the workings of hismind) his essential relationship to the creatures of the forest moreintimately, if less analytically, than we do to-day. If the animals withall their wonderful gifts are (as we readily admit) a veritable partof Nature--so that they live and move and have their being more or lesssubmerged in the spirit of the great world around them--then Man, whenhe first began to differentiate himself from them, must for a longtime have remained in this SUBconscious unity, becoming only distinctlyCONSCIOUS of it when he was already beginning to lose it. That earlydawn of distinct consciousness corresponded to the period of beliefin Magic. In that first mystic illumination almost every object wasinvested with a halo of mystery or terror or adoration. Things wereeither tabu, in which case they were dangerous, and often not to betouched or even looked upon--or they were overflowing with magic graceand influence, in which case they were holy, and any rite which releasedtheir influence was also holy. William Blake, that modern propheticchild, beheld a Tree full of angels; the Central Australian nativebelieves bushes to be the abode of spirits which leap into the bodies ofpassing women and are the cause of the conception of children; Mosessaw in the desert a bush (perhaps the mimosa) like a flame of fire, withJehovah dwelling in the midst of it, and he put off his shoes forhe felt that the place was holy; Osiris was at times regarded as aTree-spirit (1); and in inscriptions is referred to as "the solitary onein the acacia"--which reminds us curiously of the "burning bush." Thesame is true of others of the gods; in the old Norse mythology Ygdrasilwas the great branching World-Ash, abode of the soul of the universe;the Peepul or Bo-tree in India is very sacred and must on no account becut down, seeing that gods and spirits dwell among its branches. It isof the nature of an Aspen, and of little or no practical use, (2) but soholy that the poorest peasant will not disturb it. The Burmese believethe things of nature, but especially the trees, to be the abode ofspirits. "To the Burman of to-day, not less than to the Greek of longago, all nature is alive. The forest and the river and the mountainsare full of spirits, whom the Burmans call Nats. There are all kinds ofNats, good and bad, great and little, male and female, now living roundabout us. Some of them live in the trees, especially in the huge figtreethat shades half-an-acre without the village; or among the fern-likefronds of the tamarind." (3) (1) The Golden Bough, iv, 339. (2) Though the sap is said to contain caoutchouc. (3) The Soul of a People, by H. Fielding (1902), p. 250.There are also in India and elsewhere popular rites of MARRIAGE of women(and men) to Trees; which suggest that trees were regarded as verynear akin to human beings! The Golden Bough (1) mentions many of these,including the idea that some trees are male and others female. Thewell-known Assyrian emblem of a Pine cone being presented by a priest toa Palm-tree is supposed by E. B. Tylor to symbolize fertilization--thePine cone being masculine and the Palm feminine. The ceremony of the godKrishna's marriage to a Basil plant is still celebrated in India downto the present day; and certain trees are clasped and hugged by pregnantwomen--the idea no doubt being that they bestow fertility on thosewho embrace them. In other cases apparently it is the trees which arebenefited, since it is said that men sometimes go naked into theClove plantations at night in order by a sort of sexual intercourse tofertilize them. (2) (1) Vol. i, p. 40, Vol. iii, pp. 24 sq. (2) Ibid., vol. ii, p. 98.One might go on multiplying examples in this direction quiteindefinitely. There is no end to them. They all indicate--what wasinstinctively felt by early man, and is perfectly obvious to all to-daywho are not blinded by "civilization" (and Herbert Spencer!) that theworld outside us is really most deeply akin to ourselves, that it isnot dead and senseless but intensely alive and instinct with feeling andintelligence resembling our own. It is this perception, this convictionof our essential unity with the whole of creation, which lay from thefirst at the base of all Religion; yet at first, as I have said, washardly a conscious perception. Only later, when it gradually became moreconscious, did it evolve itself into the definite forms of the gods andthe creeds--but of that process I will speak more in detail presently.The Tree therefore was a most intimate presence to the Man. It grew inthe very midst of his Garden of Eden. It had a magical virtue, whichhis tentative science could only explain by chance analogies andassimilations. Attractive and beloved and worshipped by reason of itsmany gifts to mankind--its grateful shelter, its abounding fruits, itstimber, and other invaluable products--why should it not become thenatural emblem of the female, to whom through sex man's worship is everdrawn? If the Snake has an unmistakable resemblance to the male organ inits active state, the foliage of the tree or bush is equally remindfulof the female. What more clear than that the conjunction of Tree andSerpent is the fulfilment in nature of that sex-mystery which is sopotent in the life of man and the animals? and that the magic ritualmost obviously fitted to induce fertility in the tribe or the herds(or even the crops) is to set up an image of the Tree and the Serpentcombined, and for all the tribe-folk in common to worship and pay itreverence. In the Bible with more or less veiled sexual significancewe have this combination in the Eden-garden, and again in the brazenSerpent and Pole which Moses set up in the wilderness (as a cure for thefiery serpents of lust); illustrations of the same are said to be foundin the temples of Egypt and of South India, and even in the ancienttemples of Central America. (1) In the myth of Hercules the goldenapples of the Hesperides garden are guarded by a dragon. The Etruscans,the Persians and the Babylonians had also legends of the Fall of manthrough a serpent tempting him to taste of the fruit of a holy Tree. AndDe Gubernatis, (2) pointing out the phallic meaning of these stories,says "the legends concerning the tree of golden apples or figs whichyields honey or ambrosia, guarded by dragons, in which the life, thefortune, the glory, the strength and the riches of the hero have theirbeginning, are numerous among every people of Aryan origin: in India,Persia, Russia, Poland, Sweden, Germany, Greece and Italy." (1) See Ancient Pagan and Modern Christian Symbolism, by ThomasInman (Trubner, 1874), p. 55. (2) Zoological Mythology, vol. ii, pp. 410 sq.Thus we see the natural-magic tendency of the human mind assertingitself. To some of us indeed this tendency is even greater in the caseof the Snake than in that of the Tree. W. H. Hudson, in Far Awayand Long Ago, speaks of "that sense of something supernatural inthe serpent, which appears to have been universal among peoples in aprimitive state of culture, and still survives in some barbarous orsemi-barbarous countries." The fascination of the Snake--the fascinationof its mysteriously gliding movement, of its vivid energy, itsglittering eye, its intensity of life, combined with its fatal dart ofDeath--is a thing felt even more by women than by men--and for a reason(from what we have already said) not far to seek. It was the Woman whoin the story of the Fall was the first to listen to its suggestions.No wonder that, as Professor Murray says, (1) the Greeks worshiped agigantic snake (Meilichios) the lord of Death and Life, with ceremoniesof appeasement, and sacrifices, long before they arrived at the worshipof Zeus and the Olympian gods. (1) Four Stages of Greek Religion, p. 29.Or let us take the example of an Ear of Corn. Some peoplewonder--hearing nowadays that the folk of old used to worship aCorn-spirit or Corn-god--wonder that any human beings could have been sofoolish. But probably the good people who wonder thus have never REALLYLOOKED (with their town-dazed eyes) at a growing spike of wheat. (1) Ofall the wonderful things in Nature I hardly know any that thrills onemore with a sense of wizardry than just this very thing--to observe,each year, this disclosure of the Ear within the Blade--first a swellingof the sheath, then a transparency and a whitey-green face within ahooded shroud, and then the perfect spike of grain disengaging itselfand spiring upward towards the sky--"the resurrection of the wheat withpale visage appearing out of the ground." (1) Even the thrice-learned Dr. Famell quotes apparently withapproval the scornful words of Hippolytus, who (he says) "speaks of theAthenians imitating people at the Eleusinian mysteries and showing tothe epoptae (initiates) that great and marvelous mystery of perfectrevelation--in solemn silence--a CUT CORNSTALK ([gr teqerismenon] [grstacon])."--Cults of the Greek States, vol. iii, p. 182.If this spectacle amazes one to-day, what emotions must it not havearoused in the breasts of the earlier folk, whose outlook on the worldwas so much more direct than ours--more 'animistic' if you like! Whatwonderment, what gratitude, what deliverance from fear (of starvation),what certainty that this being who had been ruthlessly cut down andsacrificed last year for human food had indeed arisen again as a saviorof men, what readiness to make some human sacrifice in return, both asan acknowledgment of the debt, and as a gift of something which wouldno doubt be graciously accepted!--(for was it not well known that whereblood had been spilt on the ground the future crop was so much moregenerous?)--what readiness to adopt some magic ritual likely topropitiate the unseen power--even though the outline and form of thelatter were vague and uncertain in the extreme! Dr. Frazer, speaking ofthe Egyptian Osiris as one out of many corn-gods of the above character,says (1): "The primitive conception of him as the corn-god comes clearlyout in the festival of his death and resurrection, which was celebratedthe month of Athyr. That festival appears to have been essentially afestival of sowing, which properly fell at the time when the husbandmanactually committed the seed to the earth. On that occasion an effigy ofthe corn-god, moulded of earth and corn, was buried with funeral ritesin the ground in order that, dying there, he might come to life againwith the new crops. The ceremony was in fact a charm to ensure thegrowth of the corn by sympathetic magic, and we may conjecture that assuch it was practised in a simple form by every Egyptian farmer on hisfields long before it was adopted and transfigured by the priests in thestately ritual of the temple." (2) (1) The Golden Bough, iv, p. 330. (2) See ch. xv.The magic in this case was of a gentle description; the clay image ofOsiris sprouting all over with the young green blade was patheticallypoetic; but, as has been suggested, bloodthirsty ceremonies were alsocommon enough. Human sacrifices, it is said, had at one time beenoffered at the grave of Osiris. We bear that the Indians in Ecuador usedto sacrifice men's hearts and pour out human blood on their fieldswhen they sowed them; the Pawnee Indians used a human victim the same,allowing his blood to drop on the seed-corn. It is said that in Mexicogirls were sacrificed, and that the Mexicans would sometimes GRIND their(male) victim, like corn, between two stones. ("I'll grind his bones tomake me bread.") Among the Khonds of East India--who were particularlygiven to this kind of ritual--the very TEARS of the sufferer were anincitement to more cruelties, for tears of course were magic for Rain.(1) (1) The Golden Bough, vol. vii, "The Corn-Spirit," pp. 236 sq.And so on. We have referred to the Bull many times, both in hisastronomical aspect as pioneer of the Spring-Sun, and in his more directrole as plougher of the fields, and provider of food from his own body."The tremendous mana of the wild bull," says Gilbert Murray, "occupiesalmost half the stage of pre-Olympic ritual." (1) Even to us there issomething mesmeric and overwhelming in the sense of this animal'sglory of strength and fury and sexual power. No wonder the primitivesworshiped him, or that they devised rituals which should convey hispower and vitality by mere contact, or that in sacramental feaststhey ate his flesh and drank his blood as a magic symbol and means ofsalvation. (1) Four Stages, p. 34.VI. MAGICIANS, KINGS AND GODSIt is perhaps necessary, at the commencement of this chapter, to say afew more words about the nature and origin of the belief in Magic.Magic represented on one side, and clearly enough, the beginnings ofReligion--i.e. the instinctive sense of Man's inner continuity with theworld around him, TAKING SHAPE: a fanciful shape it is true, but withvery real reaction on his practical life and feelings. (1) On the otherside it represented the beginnings of Science. It was his first attemptnot merely to FEEL but to UNDERSTAND the mystery of things. (1) For an excellent account of the relation of Magic to Religionsee W. McDougall, Social Psychology (1908), pp. 317-320.Inevitably these first efforts to understand were very puerile, verysuperficial. As E. B. Tylor says (1) of primitive folk in general, "theymistook an imaginary for a real connection." And he instances the caseof the inhabitants of the City of Ephesus, who laid down a rope, sevenfurlongs in length, from the City to the temple of Artemis, in order toplace the former under the protection of the latter! WE should lay downa telephone wire, and consider that we established a much more efficientconnection; but in the beginning, and quite naturally, men, likechildren, rely on surface associations. Among the Dyaks of Borneo (2)when the men are away fighting, the WOMEN must use a sort of telepathicmagic in order to safeguard them--that is, they must themselves riseearly and keep awake all day (lest darkness and sleep should giveadvantage to the enemy); they must not OIL their hair (lest theirhusbands should make any SLIPS); they must eat sparingly and put asiderice at every meal (so that the men may not want for food). And so on.Similar superstitions are common. But they gradually lead to a littlethought, and then to a little more, and so to the discovery of actualand provable influences. Perhaps one day the cord connecting the templewith Ephesus was drawn TIGHT and it was found that messages could be, bytapping, transmitted along it. That way lay the discovery of a fact. Inan age which worshiped fertility, whether in mankind or animals, TWINSwere ever counted especially blest, and were credited with a magicpower. (The Constellation of the Twins was thought peculiarly lucky.)Perhaps after a time it was discovered that twins sometimes run infamilies, and in such cases really do bring fertility with them. Incattle it is known nowadays that there are more twins of the female sexthan of the male sex. (3) (1) Primitive Culture, vol. i, p. 106. (2) See The Golden Bough, i, 127. (3) See Evolution of Sex, by Geddes and Thomson (1901), p. 41,note.Observations of this kind were naturally made by the ablest members ofthe tribe--who were in all probability the medicine-men and wizards--andbrought in consequence power into their hands. The road to power infact--and especially was this the case in societies which had notyet developed wealth and property--lay through Magic. As far as magicrepresented early superstition land religion it laid hold of the HEARTSof men--their hopes and fears; as far as it represented science and thebeginnings of actual knowledge, it inspired their minds with a sense ofpower, and gave form to their lives and customs. We have no reason tosuppose that the early magicians and medicine-men were peculiarly wickedor bent on mere self-aggrandizement--any more than we have to think thesame of the average country vicar or country doctor of to-day. Theywere merely men a trifle wiser or more instructed than their flocks.But though probably in most cases their original intentions were decentenough, they were not proof against the temptations which the possessionof power always brings, and as time went on they became liable to trademore and more upon this power for their own advancement. In thematter of Religion the history of the Christian priesthood through thecenturies shows sufficiently to what misuse such power can be put; andin the matter of Science it is a warning to us of the dangers attendingthe formation of a scientific priesthood, such as we see growing uparound us to-day. In both cases--whether Science or Religion--vanity,personal ambition, lust of domination and a hundred other vices, unlesscorrected by a real devotion to the public good, may easily bring asmany evils in their train as those they profess to cure.The Medicine-man, or Wizard, or Magician, or Priest, slowly butnecessarily gathered power into his hands, and there is much evidence toshow that in the case of many tribes at any rate, it was HE who becameultimate chief and leader and laid the foundations of Kingship. TheBasileus was always a sacred personality, and often united in himself ashead of the clan the offices of chief in warfare and leader in priestlyrites--like Agamemnon in Homer, or Saul or David in the Bible. As amagician he had influence over the fertility of the earth and, like theblameless king in the Odyssey, under his sway                         "the dark earth beareth in season     Barley and wheat, and the trees are laden with fruitage, and     alway      Yean unfailing the flocks, and the sea gives fish in     abundance." (1) (1) Odyssey xix, 109 sq. Translation by H. B. Cotterill.As a magician too he was trusted for success in warfare; andSchoolcraft, in a passage quoted by Andrew Lang, (1) says of the DacotahIndians "the war-chief who leads the party to war is always one ofthese medicine-men." This connection, however, by which the magician istransformed into the king has been abundantly studied, and need not befurther dwelt upon here.And what of the transformation of the king into a god--or of theMagician or Priest directly into the same? Perhaps in order toappreciate this, one must make a further digression.For the early peoples there were, as it would appear, two main objectsin life: (1) to promote fertility in cattle and crops, for food; and (2)to placate or ward off Death; and it seemed very obvious--even beforeany distinct figures of gods, or any idea of prayer, had arisen--toattain these objects by magic ritual. The rites of Baptism, ofInitiation (or Confirmation) and the many ceremonies of a Second Birth,which we associate with fully-formed religions, did belong also tothe age of Magic; and they all implied a belief in some kind ofre-incarnation--in a life going forward continually and being renewedin birth again and again. It is curious that we find such a belief amongthe lowest savages even to-day. Dr. Frazer, speaking of the CentralAustralian tribes, says the belief is firmly rooted among them "that thehuman soul undergoes an endless series of re-incarnations--the livingmen and women of one generation being nothing but the spirits of theirancestors come to life again, and destined themselves to be rebornin the persons of their descendants. During the interval betweentwo re-incarnations the souls live in their nanja spots, or localtotem-centres, which are always natural objects such as trees or rocks.Each totem-clan has a number of such totem-centres scattered over thecountry. There the souls of the dead men and women of the totem, but noothers, congregate, and are born again in human form when a favorableopportunity presents itself." (2) (1) Myth, Ritual and Religion, vol. i, p. 113. (2) The Golden Bough, vol. i, p. 96.And what the early people believed of the human spirit, they believed ofthe corn-spirits and the tree and vegetation spirits also. At the greatSpring-ritual among the primitive Greeks "the tribe and the growingearth were renovated together: the earth arises afresh from her deadseeds, the tribe from its dead ancestors." And the whole processprojects itself in the idea of a spirit of the year, who "in the firststage is living, then dies with each year, and thirdly rises again fromthe dead, raising the whole dead world with him. The Greeks called himin this stage 'The Third One' (Tritos Soter) or 'the Saviour'; and therenovation ceremonies were accompanied by a casting-off of the old year,the old garments, and everything that is polluted by the infection ofdeath." (1) Thus the multiplication of the crops and the renovation ofthe tribe, and at the same time the evasion and placation of death, wereall assured by similar rites and befitting ceremonial magic. (2) (1) Gilbert Murray, Four Stages, p. 46. (2) It is interesting to find, with regard to the renovation ofthe tribe, that among the Central Australians the foreskins or malemembers of those who died were deposited in the above-mentioned nanjaspots--the idea evidently being that like the seeds of the corn theseeds of the human crop must be carefully and ceremonially preserved fortheir re-incarnation.In all these cases, and many others that I have not mentioned--ofthe magical worship of Bulls and Bears and Rams and Cats and Emus andKangaroos, of Trees and Snakes, of Sun and Moon and Stars, and thespirit of the Corn in its yearly and miraculous resurrection out of theground--there is still the same idea or moving inspiration, the sensementioned in the foregoing chapter, the feeling (hardly yet conscious ofits own meaning) of intimate relationship and unity with all this outerworld, the instinctive conviction that the world can be swayed by thespirit of Man, if the man can only find the right ritual, the rightword, the right spell, wherewith to move it. An aura of emotionsurrounded everything--of terror, of tabu, of fascination, of desire.The world, to these people, was transparent with presences related tothemselves; and though hunger and sex may have been the dominant andoverwhelmingly practical needs of their life, yet their outlook on theworld was essentially poetic and imaginative.Moreover it will be seen that in this age of magic and the belief inspirits, though there was an intense sense of every thing beingalive, the gods, in the more modern sense of the world, hardly existed(1)--that is, there was no very clear vision, to these people, ofsupra-mundane beings, sitting apart and ordaining the affairs ofearth, as it were from a distance. Doubtless this conception was slowlyevolving, but it was only incipient. For the time being--though theremight be orders and degrees of spirits (and of gods)--every such beingwas only conceived of, and could only be conceived of, as actually apart of Nature, dwelling in and interlaced with some phenomenon of Earthand Sky, and having no separate existence. (1) For a discussion of the evolution of RELIGION out of MAGIC,see Westermarck's Origin of Moral Ideas, ch. 47.How was it then, it will be asked, that the belief in separate andseparable gods and goddesses--each with his or her well-marked outlineand character and function, like the divinities of Greece, or of India,or of the Egyptian or Christian religions, ultimately arose? Tothis question Jane Harrison (in her Themis and other books) gives aningenious answer, which as it chimes in with my own speculations (in theArt of Creation and elsewhere) I am inclined to adopt. It is that thefigures of the supranatural gods arose from a process in the human mindsimilar to that which the photographer adopts when by photographing anumber of faces on the same plate, and so superposing their images onone another, he produces a so-called "composite" photograph or image.Thus, in the photographic sphere, the portraits of a lot of membersof the same family superposed upon one another may produce a compositeimage or ideal of that family type, or the portraits of a number ofAztecs or of a number of Apache Indians the ideals respectively of theAztec or of the Apache types. And so in the mental sphere of each memberof a tribe the many images of the well-known Warriors or Priests orwise and gracious Women of that tribe did inevitably combine at lastto composite figures of gods and goddesses--on whom the enthusiasmand adoration of the tribe was concentrated. (1) Miss Harrison hasingeniously suggested how the leading figures in the magic rituals ofthe past--being the figures on which all eyes would be concentrated; andwhose importance would be imprinted on every mind--lent themselves tothis process. The suffering Victim, bound and scourged and crucified,recurring year after year as the centre-figure of a thousand ritualprocessions, would at last be dramatized and idealized in the greatrace-consciousness into the form of a Suffering God--a Jesus Christ ora Dionysus or Osiris--dismembered or crucified for the salvation ofmankind. The Priest or Medicine-Man--or rather the succession of Priestsor Medicine-Men--whose figures would recur again and again as leadersand ordainers of the ceremonies, would be glorified at last into thecomposite-image of a God in whom were concentrated all magic powers."Recent researches," says Gilbert Murray, "have shown us in abundancethe early Greek medicine-chiefs making thunder and lightning and rain."Here is the germ of a Zeus or a Jupiter. The particular medicine-manmay fail; that does not so much matter; he is only the individualrepresentative of the glorified and composite being who exists in themind of the tribe (just as a present-day King may be unworthy, but issurrounded all the same by the agelong glamour of Royalty). "The real[gr qeos], tremendous, infallible, is somewhere far away, hidden inclouds perhaps, on the summit of some inaccessible mountain. If themountain is once climbed the god will move to the upper sky. Themedicine-chief meanwhile stays on earth, still influential. He has someconnection with the great god more intimate than that of other men... heknows the rules for approaching him and making prayers to him." (2) Thusdid the Medicine-man, or Priest, or Magician (for these are but threenames for one figure) represent one step in the evolution of the god. (1) See The Art of Creation, ch. viii, "The Gods as Apparitionsof the Race-Life." (2) The Four Stages, p. 140.And farther back still in the evolutionary process we may trace (as inchapter iv above) the divinization or deification of four-footed animalsand birds and snakes and trees and the like, from the personification ofthe collective emotion of the tribe towards these creatures. For peoplewhose chief food was bear-meat, for instance, whose totem was a bear,and who believed themselves descended from an ursine ancestor, therewould grow up in the tribal mind an image surrounded by a halo ofemotions--emotions of hungry desire, of reverence, fear, gratitude andso forth--an image of a divine Bear in whom they lived and moved and hadtheir being. For another tribe or group in whose yearly ritual a Bull ora Lamb or a Kangaroo played a leading part there would in the sameway spring tip the image of a holy bull, a divine lamb, or a sacredkangaroo. Another group again might come to worship a Serpent as itspresiding genius, or a particular kind of Tree, simply because theseobjects were and had been for centuries prominent factors in its yearlyand seasonal Magic. As Reinach and others suggest, it was the Taboo(bred by Fear) which by first forbidding contact with the totem-animalor priest or magician-chief gradually invested him with Awe andDivinity.According to this theory the god--the full-grown god in human shape,dwelling apart and beyond the earth--did not come first, but was a lateand more finished product of evolution. He grew up by degrees and out ofthe preceding animal-worships and totem-systems. And this theory is muchsupported and corroborated by the fact that in a vast number of earlycults the gods are represented by human figures with animal heads. TheEgyptian religion was full of such divinities--the jackal-headedAnubis, the ram-headed Ammon, the bull-fronted Osiris, or Muth, queen ofdarkness, clad in a vulture's skin; Minos and the Minotaur in Crete; inGreece, Athena with an owl's head, or Herakles masked in the hideand jaws of a monstrous lion. What could be more obvious than that,following on the tribal worship of any totem-animal, the priest ormedicine-man or actual king in leading the magic ritual should don theskin and head of that animal, and wear the same as a kind of mask--thispartly in order to appear to the people as the true representative ofthe totem, and partly also in order to obtain from the skin the magicvirtues and mana of the beast, which he could then duly impart to thecrowd? Zeus, it must be remembered, wears the aegis, or goat-skin--saidto be the hide of the goat Amaltheia who suckled him in his infancy;there are a number of legends which connected the Arcadian Artemis withthe worship of the bear, Apollo with the wolf, and so forth. And, mostcurious as showing similarity of rites between the Old and New Worlds,there are found plenty of examples of the wearing of beast-masks inreligious processions among the native tribes of both North and SouthAmerica. In the Atlas of Spix and Martius (who travelled together inthe Amazonian forests about 1820) there is an understanding andcharacteristic picture of the men (and some women) of the tribe of theTecunas moving in procession through the woods mostly naked, except forwearing animal heads and masks--the masks representing Cranes of variouskinds, Ducks, the Opossum, the Jaguar, the Parrot, etc., probablysymbolic of their respective clans.By some such process as this, it may fairly be supposed, the forms ofthe Gods were slowly exhaled from the actual figures of men and women,of youths and girls, who year after year took part in the ancientrituals. Just as the Queen of the May or Father Christmas with us areidealized forms derived from the many happy maidens or white-beardedold men who took leading parts in the May or December mummings and thusgained their apotheosis in our literature and tradition--so doubtlessZeus with his thunderbolts and arrows of lightning is the idealizationinto Heaven of the Priestly rain-maker and storm-controller; Ares thegod of War, the similar idealization of the leading warrior in theritual war-dance preceding an attack on a neighboring tribe; and Mercuryof the foot-running Messenger whose swiftness in those days (devoid ofsteam or electricity) was so precious a tribal possession.And here it must be remembered that this explanation of the genesis ofthe gods only applies to the SHAPES and FIGURES of the various deities.It does not apply to the genesis of the widespread belief in spirits ora Great Spirit generally; that, as I think will become clear, hasquite another source. Some people have jeered at the 'animistic' or'anthropomorphic' tendency of primitive man in his contemplation of theforces of Nature or his imaginations of religion and the gods. With akind of superior pity they speak of "the poor Indian whose untutoredmind sees God in clouds and hears him in the wind." But I must confessthat to me the "poor Indian" seems on the whole to show more good sensethan his critics, and to have aimed his rude arrows at the philosophicmark more successfully than a vast number of his learned and scientificsuccessors. A consideration of what we have said above would show thatearly people felt their unity with Nature so deeply and intimatelythat--like the animals themselves--they did not think consciously ortheorize about it. It was just their life to be--like the beasts of thefield and the trees of the forest--a part of the whole flux of things,non-differentiated so to speak. What more natural or indeed morelogically correct than for them to assume (when they first began tothink or differentiate themselves) that these other creatures, thesebirds, beasts and plants, and even the sun and moon, were of the sameblood as themselves, their first cousins, so to speak, and having thesame interior nature? What more reasonable (if indeed they creditedTHEMSELVES with having some kind of soul or spirit) than to credit theseother creatures with a similar soul or spirit? Im Thurn, speaking of theGuiana Indians, says that for them "the whole world swarms with beings."Surely this could not be taken to indicate an untutored mind--unlessindeed a mind untutored in the nonsense of the Schools--but rather avery directly perceptive mind. And again what more reasonable (seeingthat these people themselves were in the animal stage of evolution) thanthat they should pay great reverence to some ideal animal--first cousinor ancestor--who played an important part in their tribal existence, andmake of this animal a totem emblem and a symbol of their common life?And, further still, what more natural than that when the tribe passedto some degree beyond the animal stage and began to realize a life moreintelligent and emotional--more specially human in fact--than thatof the beasts of the field, that it should then in its rituals andceremonies throw off the beast-mask and pay reverence to the interiorand more human spirit. Rising to a more enlightened consciousness of itsown intimate quality, and still deeply penetrated with the sense of itskinship to external nature, it would inevitably and perfectly logicallycredit the latter with an inner life and intelligence, moredistinctly human than before. Its religion in fact would become MORE'anthropomorphic' instead of less so; and one sees that this is aprocess that is inevitable; and inevitable notwithstanding acertain parenthesis in the process, due to obvious elements in our'Civilization' and to the temporary and fallacious domination ofa leaden-eyed so-called 'Science.' According to this view the trueevolution of Religion and Man's outlook on the world has proceeded notby the denial by man of his unity with the world, but by his seeing andunderstanding that unity more deeply. And the more deeply he understandshimself the more certainly he will recognize in the external world aBeing or beings resembling himself.W. H. Hudson--whose mind is certainly not of a quality to be jeeredat--speaks of Animism as "the projection of ourselves into nature:the sense and apprehension of an intelligence like our own, but morepowerful, in all visible things"; and continues, "old as I am this sameprimitive faculty which manifested itself in my early boyhood, stillpersists, and in those early years was so powerful that I am almostafraid to say how deeply I was moved by it." (1) Nor will it be quiteforgotten that Shelley once said:--     The moveless pillar of a mountain's weight     Is active living spirit. Every grain     Is sentient both in unity and part,     And the minutest atom comprehends     A world of loves and hatreds. (1) Far Away and Long Ago, ch. xiii, p. 225.The tendency to animism and later to anthropomorphism is I sayinevitable, and perfectly logical. But the great value of the work doneby some of those investigators whom I have quoted has been to show thatamong quite primitive people (whose interior life and 'soul-sense' wasonly very feeble) their projections of intelligence into Nature werecorrespondingly feeble. The reflections of themselves projected intothe world beyond could not reach the stature of eternal 'gods,' butwere rather of the quality of ephemeral phantoms and ghosts; and theceremonials and creeds of that period are consequently more properlydescribed as, Magic than as Religion. There have indeed been greatcontroversies as to whether there has or has not been, in the courseof religious evolution, a PRE-animistic stage. Probably of course humanevolution in this matter must have been perfectly continuous from stagespresenting the very feeblest or an absolutely deficient animistic senseto the very highest manifestations of anthropomorphism; but as there isa good deal of evidence to show that ANIMALS (notably dogs and horses)see ghosts, the inquiry ought certainly to be enlarged so far as toinclude the pre-human species. Anyhow it must be remembered that thequestion is one of CONSCIOUSNESS--that is, of how far and to what degreeconsciousness of self has been developed in the animal or the primitiveman or the civilized man, and therefore how far and to what degree theanimal or human creature has credited the outside world with a similarconsciousness. It is not a question of whether there IS an inner lifeand SUB-consciousness common to all these creatures of the earth andsky, because that, I take it, is a fact beyond question; they all emergeor have emerged from the same matrix, and are rooted in identity; butit is a question of how far they are AWARE of this, and how far byseparation (which is the genius of evolution) each individual creaturehas become conscious of the interior nature both of itself and of theother creatures AND of the great whole which includes them all.Finally, and to avoid misunderstanding, let me say thatAnthropomorphism, in man's conception of the gods, is itself of courseonly a stage and destined to pass away. In so far, that is, as theterm indicates a belief in divine beings corresponding to our PRESENTconception of ourselves--that is as separate personalities having eacha separate and limited character and function, and animated bythe separatist motives of ambition, possession, power, vainglory,superiority, patronage, self-greed, self-satisfaction, etc.--in so faras anthropomorphism is the expression of that kind of belief it is ofcourse destined, with the illusion from which it springs, to pass away.When man arrives at the final consciousness in which the idea of such aself, superior or inferior or in any way antagonistic to others, ceasesto operate, then he will return to his first and primal condition, andwill cease to need ANY special religion or gods, knowing himself and allhis fellows to be divine and the origin and perfect fruition of all.VII. RITES OF EXPIATION AND REDEMPTIONThere is a passage in Richard Jefferies' imperishably beautiful bookThe Story of my Heart--a passage well known to all lovers of thatprose-poet--in which he figures himself standing "in front of the RoyalExchange where the wide pavement reaches out like a promontory," andpondering on the vast crowd and the mystery of life. "Is there anytheory, philosophy, or creed," he says, "is there any system of culture,any formulated method, able to meet and satisfy each separate item ofthis agitated pool of human life? By which they may be guided, by whichthey may hope, by which look forward? Not a mere illusion of the cravingheart--something real, as real as the solid walls of fact againstwhich, like seaweed, they are dashed; something to give each separatepersonality sunshine and a flower in its own existence now; somethingto shape this million-handed labor to an end and outcome that will leavemore sunshine and more flowers to those who must succeed? Something realnow, and not in the spirit-land; in this hour now, as I stand and thesun burns.... Full well aware that all has failed, yet, side by sidewith the sadness of that knowledge, there lives on in me an unquenchablebelief, thought burning like the sun, that there is yet something tobe found.... It must be dragged forth by the might of thought from theimmense forces of the universe."In answer to this passage we may say "No,--a thousand times No! thereis no theory, philosophy, creed, system or formulated method whichwill meet or ever satisfy the demand of each separate item of thehuman whirlpool." And happy are we to know there is no such thing! Howterrible if one of these bloodless 'systems' which strew the historyof religion and philosophy and the political and social paths ofhuman endeavor HAD been found absolutely correct and universallyapplicable--so that every human being would be compelled to passthrough its machine-like maw, every personality to be crushed underits Juggernath wheels! No, thank Heaven! there is no theory or creed orsystem; and yet there is something--as Jefferies prophetically felt andwith a great longing desired--that CAN satisfy; and that, the rootof all religion, has been hinted at in the last chapter. It is theCONSCIOUSNESS of the world-life burning, blazing, deep down within us:it is the Soul's intuition of its roots in Omnipresence and Eternity.The gods and the creeds of the past, as shown in the lastchapter--whatever they may have been, animistic or anthropomorphicor transcendental, whether grossly brutish or serenely ideal andabstract--are essentially projections of the human mind; and no doubtthose who are anxious to discredit the religious impulse generally willcatch at this, saying "Yes, they are mere forms and phantoms of themind, ephemeral dreams, projected on the background of Nature, andhaving no real substance or solid value. The history of Religion (theywill say) is a history of delusion and illusion; why waste time overit? These divine grizzly Bears or Aesculapian Snakes, these cat-facedPashts, this Isis, queen of heaven, and Astarte and Baal and Indraand Agni and Kali and Demeter and the Virgin Mary and Apollo and JesusChrist and Satan and the Holy Ghost, are only shadows cast outwards ontoa screen; the constitution of the human mind makes them all tend tobe anthropomorphic; but that is all; they each and all inevitably passaway. Why waste time over them?"And this is in a sense a perfectly fair way of looking at the matter.These gods and creeds ARE only projections of the human mind. But allthe same it misses, does this view, the essential fact. It misses thefact that there is no shadow without a fire, that the very existence ofa shadow argues a light somewhere (though we may not directly see it) aswell as the existence of a solid form which intercepts that light.Deep, deep in the human mind there is that burning blazing light ofthe world-consciousness--so deep indeed that the vast majority ofindividuals are hardly aware of its existence. Their gaze turnedoutwards is held and riveted by the gigantic figures and processionspassing across their sky; they are unaware that the latter are onlyshadows--silhouettes of the forms inhabiting their own minds. (1) Thevast majority of people have never observed their own minds; their ownmental forms. They have only observed the reflections cast by these.Thus it may be said, in this matter, that there are three degrees ofreality. There are the mere shadows--the least real and mostevanescent; there are the actual mental outlines of humanity (and ofthe individual), much more real, but themselves also of course slowlychanging; and most real of all, and permanent, there is the light "whichlighteth every man that cometh into the world"--the glorious lightof the world-consciousness. Of this last it may be said that it neverchanges. Every thing is known to it--even the very IMPEDIMENTS to itsshining. But as it is from the impediments to the shining of a lightthat shadows are cast, so we now may understand that the things of thisworld and of humanity, though real in their degree, have chiefly akind of negative value; they are opaquenesses, clouds, materialisms,ignorances, and the inner light falling upon them gradually revealstheir negative character and gradually dissolves them away till theyare lost in the extreme and eternal Splendor. I think Jefferies, whenhe asked that question with which I have begun this chapter, was in somesense subconsciously, if not quite consciously, aware of the answer. Hisfrequent references to the burning blazing sun throughout The Story ofthe Heart seem to be an indication of his real deep-down attitude ofmind. (1) See, in the same connection, Plato's allegory of the Cave,Republic, Book vii.The shadow-figures of the creeds and theogonies pass away truly likeephemeral dreams; but to say that time spent in their study is wasted,is a mistake, for they have value as being indications of things muchmore real than themselves, namely, of the stages of evolution of thehuman mind. The fact that a certain god-figure, however grotesque andqueer, or a certain creed, however childish, cruel, and illogical, heldsway for a considerable time over the hearts of men in any corner orcontinent of the world is good evidence that it represented a realformative urge at the time in the hearts of those good people, anda definite stage in their evolution and the evolution of humanity.Certainly it was destined to pass away, but it was a step, and anecessary step in the great process; and certainly it was opaque andbrutish, but it is through the opaque things of the world, and notthrough the transparent, that we become aware of the light.It may be worth while to give instances of how some early rituals andcreeds, in themselves apparently barbarous or preposterous, were reallythe indications of important moral and social conceptions evolving inthe heart of man. Let us take, first, the religious customs connectedwith the ideas of Sacrifice and of Sin, of which such innumerableexamples are now to be found in the modern books on Anthropology. If weassume, as I have done more than once, that the earliest state of Manwas one in which he did not consciously separate himself from the world,animate and inanimate, which surrounded him, then (as I have also said)it was perfectly natural for him to take some animal which bulked largeon his horizon--some food-animal for instance--and to pay respect to itas the benefactor of his tribe, its far-back ancestor and totem-symbol;or, seeing the boundless blessing of the cornfields, to believe insome kind of spirit of the corn (not exactly a god but rather a magicalghost) which, reincarnated every year, sprang up to save mankindfrom famine. But then no sooner had he done this than he was bound toperceive that in cutting down the corn or in eating his totem-bearor kangaroo he was slaying his own best self and benefactor. Inthat instant the consciousness of DISUNITY, the sense of sin in someundefined yet no less disturbing and alarming form would come in. If,before, his ritual magic had been concentrated on the simple purpose ofmultiplying the animal or, vegetable forms of his food, now in additionhis magical endeavor would be turned to averting the just wrath of thespirits who animated these forms--just indeed, for the rudest savagewould perceive the wrong done and the probability of its retribution.Clearly the wrong done could only be expiated by an equivalent sacrificeof some kind on the part of the man, or the tribe--that is by theoffering to the totem-animal or to the corn-spirit of some victim whomthese nature powers in their turn could feed upon and assimilate. Inthis way the nature-powers would be appeased, the sense of unity wouldbe restored, and the first At-one-ment effected.It is hardly necessary to recite in any detail the cruel and hideoussacrifices which have been perpetrated in this sense all over the world,sometimes in appeasement of a wrong committed or supposed to have beencommitted by the tribe or some member of it, sometimes in placation orfor the averting of death, or defeat, or plague, sometimes merelyin fulfilment of some long-standing custom of forgotten origin--theflayings and floggings and burnings and crucifixions of victims withoutend, carried out in all deliberation and solemnity of establishedritual. I have mentioned some cases connected with the sowing of thecorn. The Bible is full of such things, from the intended sacrifice ofIsaac by his father Abraham, to the actual crucifixion of Jesus bythe Jews. The first-born sons were claimed by a god who called himself"jealous" and were only to be redeemed by a substitute. (1) Of theCanaanites it was said that "even their daughters they have BURNT in thefire to their gods"; (2) and of the King of Moab, that when he sawhis army in danger of defeat, "he took his eldest son that should havereigned in his stead and offered him for a burnt-offering on the wall!"(3) Dr. Frazer (4) mentions the similar case of the Carthaginians(about B.C. 300) sacrificing two hundred children of good family as apropitiation to Baal and to save their beloved city from the assaultsof the Sicilian tyrant Agathocles. And even so we hear that on thatoccasion three hundred more young folk VOLUNTEERED to die for thefatherland. (1) Exodus xxxiv. 20. (2) Deut. xii. 31. (3) 2 Kings iii. 27. (4) The Golden Bough, vol. "The Dying God," p. 167.The awful sacrifices made by the Aztecs in Mexico to their godsHuitzilopochtli, Texcatlipoca, and others are described in much detailby Sahagun, the Spanish missionary of the sixteenth century. The victimswere mostly prisoners of war or young children; they were numbered bythousands. In one case Sahagun describes the huge Idol or figure of thegod as largely plated with gold and holding his hands palm upward and ina downward sloping position over a cauldron or furnace placed below. Thechildren, who had previously been borne in triumphal state on littersover the crowd and decorated with every ornamental device of feathersand flowers and wings, were placed one by one on the vast hands andROLLED DOWN into the flames--as if the god were himself offering them.(1) As the procession approached the temple, the members of it wept anddanced and sang, and here again the abundance of tears was taken for agood augury of rain. (2) (1) It is curious to find that exactly the same story (of thesloping hands and the children rolled down into the flames) is relatedconcerning the above-mentioned Baal image at Carthage (see DiodorusSiculus, xx. 14; also Baring Gould's Religious Belief, vol. i, p. 375). (2) "A los ninos que mataban, componianlos en muchos atavios parallevarlos al sacrificio, y llevabos en unas literas sobre los hombros,estas literas iban adornadas con plumages y con flores: iban tanendo,cantando y bailando delante de ellos... Cuando Ileviban los ninos amatar, si llevaban y echaban muchos lagrimas, alegrabansi los que losllevaban porque tomaban pronostico de que habian de tener muchas aguasen aquel ano." Sahagun, Historia Nueva Espana, Bk. II, ch. i.Bernal Diaz describes how he saw one of these monstrous figures--thatof Huitzilopochtli, the god of war, all inlaid with gold and preciousstones; and beside it were "braziers, wherein burned the hearts of threeIndians, torn from their bodies that very day, and the smoke of them andthe savor of incense were the sacrifice."Sahagun again (in Book II, ch. 5) gives a long account of the sacrificeof a perfect youth at Easter-time--which date Sabagun connects with theChristian festival of the Resurrection. For a whole year the youth hadbeen held in honor and adored by the people as the very image of thegod (Tetzcatlipoca) to whom he was to be sacrificed. Every luxuryand fulfilment of his last wish (including such four courtesans as hedesired) had been granted him. At the last and on the fatal day, leavinghis companions and his worshipers behind, be slowly ascended the Templestaircase; stripping on each step the ornaments from his body; andbreaking and casting away his flutes and other musical instruments;till, reaching the summit, he was stretched, curved on his back, andbelly upwards, over the altar stone, while the priest with obsidianknife cut his breast open and, snatching the heart out, held it up, yetbeating, as an offering to the Sun. In the meantime, and while the heartstill lived, his successor for the next year was chosen.In Book II, ch. 7 of the same work Sahagun describes the similaroffering of a woman to a goddess. In both cases (he explains) of youngman or young woman, the victims were richly adorned in the guise of thegod or goddess to whom they were offered, and at the same time greatlargesse of food was distributed to all who needed. (Here we see theconnection in the general mind between the gift of food (by the gods)and the sacrifice of precious blood (by the people).) More than onceSahagun mentions that the victims in these Mexican ceremonials notinfrequently offered THEMSELVES as a voluntary sacrifice; and Prescottsays (1) that the offering of one's life to the gods was "sometimesvoluntarily embraced, as a most glorious death opening a sure passageinto Paradise." (1) Conquest of Mexico, Bk. I, ch. 3.Dr. Frazer describes (1) the far-back Babylonian festival of the Sacaeain which "a prisoner, condemned to death, was dressed in the king'srobes, seated on the king's throne, allowed to issue whatever commandshe pleased, to eat, drink and enjoy himself, and even to lie with theking's concubines." But at the end of the five days he was strippedof his royal robes, scourged, and hanged or impaled. It is certainlyastonishing to find customs so similar prevailing among peoples so farremoved in space and time as the Aztecs of the sixteenth century A.D.and the Babylonians perhaps of the sixteenth century B.C. But we knowthat this subject of the yearly sacrifice of a victim attired as aking or god is one that Dr. Frazer has especially made his own, and forfurther information on it his classic work should be consulted. (1) Golden Bough, "The Dying God," p. 114. (See also S. Reinach,Cults, Myths and Religion, p. 94) on the martyrdom of St. Dasius.Andrew Lang also, with regard to the Aztecs, quotes largely fromSahagun, and summarizes his conclusions in the following passage:"The general theory of worship was the adoration of a deity, first byinnumerable human sacrifices, next by the special sacrifice of a MAN forthe male gods, of a WOMAN for each goddess. (1) The latter victims wereregarded as the living images or incarnations of the divinities in, eachcase; for no system of worship carried farther the identification of thegod with the sacrifice (? victim), and of both with the officiating pri connection was emphasized by the priests wearing the newly-flayed skinsof the victims--just as in Greece, Egypt and Assyria, the fawn-skinor bull-hide or goat-skin or fish-skin of the victims is worn by thecelebrants. Finally, an image of the god was made out of paste, and thiswas divided into morsels and eaten in a hideous sacrament by those whocommunicated." (2) (1) Compare the festival of Thargelia at Athens, originallyconnected with the ripening of the crops. A procession was formed andthe first fruits of the year offered to Apollo, Artemis and the Horae.It was an expiatory feast, to purify the State from all guilt and avertthe wrath of the god (the Sun). A man and a woman, as representingthe male and female population, were led about with a garland of figs(fertility) round their necks, to the sound of flutes and singing. Theywere then scourged, sacrificed, and their bodies burned by the seashore.(Nettleship and Sandys.) (2) A Lang, Myth, Ritual and Religion, vol. ii, p. 97.Revolting as this whole picture is, it represents as we know a merethumbnail sketch of the awful practices of human sacrifice all over theworld. We hold up our hands in horror at the thought of Huitzilopochtlidropping children from his fingers into the flames, but we have toremember that our own most Christian Saint Augustine was content todescribe unbaptized infants as crawling for ever about the floor ofHell! What sort of god, we may ask, did Augustine worship? The Being whocould condemn children to such a fate was certainly no better than theMexican Idol.And yet Augustine was a great and noble man, with some by no meansunworthy conceptions of the greatness of his God. In the same way theAztecs were in many respects a refined and artistic people, and theirreligion was not all superstition and bloodshed. Prescott says of them(1) that they believed in a supreme Creator and Lord "omnipresent,knowing all thoughts, giving all gifts, without whom Man is asnothing--invisible, incorporeal, one God, of perfect perfection andpurity, under whose wings we find repose and a sure defence." How canwe reconcile St. Augustine with his own devilish creed, or the religiousbelief of the Aztecs with their unspeakable cruelties? Perhaps we canonly reconcile them by remembering out of what deeps of barbarism andwhat nightmares of haunting Fear, man has slowly emerged--and iseven now only slowly emerging; by remembering also that the ancientceremonies and rituals of Magic and Fear remained on and were cultivatedby the multitude in each nation long after the bolder and nobler spiritshad attained to breathe a purer air; by remembering that even to thepresent day in each individual the Old and the New are for a long periodthus intricately intertangled. It is hard to believe that the practiceof human and animal sacrifice (with whatever revolting details) shouldhave been cultivated by nine-tenths of the human race over the globeout of sheer perversity and without some reason which at any rate tothe perpetrators themselves appeared commanding and convincing. To-day(1918) we are witnessing in the Great European War a carnival of humanslaughter which in magnitude and barbarity eclipses in one stroke allthe accumulated ceremonial sacrifices of historical ages; and whenwe ask the why and wherefore of this horrid spectacle we are told,apparently in all sincerity, and by both the parties engaged, of thenoble objects and commanding moralities which inspire and compel it. Wecan hardly, in this last case, disbelieve altogether in the genuinenessof the plea, so why should we do so in the former case? In both cases weperceive that underneath the surface pretexts and moralities Fear is andwas the great urging and commanding force. (1) Conquest of Mexico, Bk. I, ch. 3.The truth is that Sin and Sacrifice represent--if you once allow for theoverwhelming sway of fear--perfectly reasonable views of human conduct,adopted instinctively by mankind since the earliest times. If in amoment of danger or an access of selfish greed you deserted your brothertribesman or took a mean advantage of him, you 'sinned' against him; andnaturally you expiated the sin by an equivalent sacrifice of some kindmade to the one you had wronged. Such an idea and such a practice werethe very foundation of social life and human morality, and must havesprung up as soon as ever, in the course of evolution, man becameCAPABLE of differentiating himself from his fellows and regarding hisown conduct as that of a 'separate self.' It was in the very conceptionof a separate self that 'sin' and disunity first began; and it wasby 'sacrifice' that unity and harmony were restored, appeasement andatonement effected.But in those earliest times, as I have already indicated more than once,man felt himself intimately related not only to his brother tribesman,but to the animals and to general Nature. It was not so much that heTHOUGHT thus as that he never thought OTHERWISE! He FELT subconsciouslythat he was a part of all this outer world. And so he adopted for histotems or presiding spirits every possible animal, as we have seen,and all sorts of nature-phenomena, such as rain and fire and water andclouds, and sun, moon and stars--which WE consider quite senseless andinanimate. Towards these apparently senseless things therefore he feltthe same compunction as I have described him feeling towards his brothertribesmen. He could sin against them too. He could sin against histotem-animal by eating it; he could sin against his 'brother the ox' byconsuming its strength in the labor of the plough; he could sin againstthe corn by cutting it down and grinding it into flour, or against theprecious and beautiful pine-tree by laying his axe to its roots andconverting it into mere timber for his house. Further still, no doubt hecould sin against elemental nature. This might be more difficult to becertain of, but when the signs of elemental displeasure were not to bemistaken--when the rain withheld itself for months, or the storms andlightning dealt death and destruction, when the crops failed or evilplagues afflicted mankind--then there could be little uncertainty thathe had sinned; and Fear, which had haunted him like a demon from thefirst day when he became conscious of his separation from his fellowsand from Nature, stood over him and urged to dreadful propitiations.In all these cases some sacrifice in reparation was the obvious thing.We have seen that to atone for the cutting-down of the corn a humanvictim would often be slaughtered. The corn-spirit clearly approved ofthis, for wherever the blood and remains of the victim were strewn thecorn always sprang up more plentifully. The tribe or human group madereparation thus to the corn; the corn-spirit signified approval. The'sin' was expiated and harmony restored. Sometimes the sacrifice wasvoluntarily offered by a tribesman; sometimes it was enforced, by lotor otherwise; sometimes the victim was a slave, or a captive enemy;sometimes even an animal. All that did not so much matter. The mainthing was that the formal expiation had been carried out, and the wrathof the spirits averted.It is known that tribes whose chief food-animal was the bear felt itnecessary to kill and cat a bear occasionally; but they could not dothis without a sense of guilt, and some fear of vengeance from the greatBear-spirit. So they ate the slain bear at a communal feast in whichthe tribesmen shared the guilt and celebrated their community with theirtotem and with each other. And since they could not make any reparationdirectly to the slain animal itself AFTER its death, they made theirreparation BEFORE, bringing all sorts of presents and food to it for along anterior period, and paying every kind of worship and respect toit. The same with the bull and the ox. At the festival of the Bouphonia,in some of the cities of Greece as I have already mentioned, the actualbull sacrificed was the handsomest and most carefully nurtured thatcould be obtained; it was crowned with flowers and led in processionwith every mark of reverence and worship. And when--as I have alreadypointed out--at the great Spring festival, instead of a bull or a goator a ram, a HUMAN victim was immolated, it was a custom (which can betraced very widely over the world) to feed and indulge and honor thevictim to the last degree for a WHOLE YEAR before the final ceremony,arraying him often as a king and placing a crown upon his head, by wayof acknowledgment of the noble and necessary work he was doing for thegeneral good.What a touching and beautiful ceremony was that--belonging especiallyto the North of Syria, and lands where the pine is so beneficent andbeloved a tree--the mourning ceremony of the death and burial of Attis!when a pine-tree, felled by the axe, was hollowed out, and in the hollowan image (often itself carved out of pinewood) of the young Attis wasplaced. Could any symbolism express more tenderly the idea that theglorious youth--who represented Spring, too soon slain by the rude tuskof Winter--was himself the very human soul of the pine-tree? (1) At someearlier period, no doubt, a real youth had been sacrificed and his bodybound within the pine; but now it was deemed sufficient for the maidensto sing their wild songs of lamentation; and for the priests and maleenthusiasts to cut and gash themselves with knives, or to sacrifice(as they did) to the Earth-mother the precious blood offering of theirvirile organs--symbols of fertility in return for the promised andexpected renewal of Nature and the crops in the coming Spring. Forthe ceremony, as we have already seen, did not end with death andlamentation, but led on, perfectly naturally, after a day or two to afestival of resurrection, when it was discovered--just as in the case ofOsiris--that the pine-tree coffin was empty, and the immortal life hadflown. How strange the similarity and parallelism of all these things tothe story of Jesus in the Gospels--the sacrifice of a life made in orderto bring salvation to men and expiation of sins, the crowning of thevictim, and arraying in royal attire, the scourging and the mockery, thebinding or nailing to a tree, the tears of Mary, and the resurrectionand the empty coffin!--or how not at all strange when we consider inwhat numerous forms and among how many peoples, this same parableand ritual had as a matter of fact been celebrated, and how it hadultimately come down to bring its message of redemption into a somewhatobscure Syrian city, in the special shape with which we are familiar. (1) See Julius Firmicus, who says (De Errore, c. 28): "in sacrisPhrygiis, quae Matris deum dicunt, per annos singulos arbor pineacaeditur, et in media arbore simulacrum uvenis subligatur. In Isiacissacris de pinea arbore caeditur truncus; hujus trunci media parssubtiliter excavatur, illis de segminibus factum idolum Osiridissepelitur. In Prosperpinae sacris caesa arbor in effigiem virginisformaraque componitur, et cum intra civitatem fuerit illata, quadragintanoctibus piangitur, quadragesima vero nocte comburitur."Though the parable or legend in its special Christian form bears with itthe consciousness of the presence of beings whom we may call gods, it isimportant to remember that in many or most of its earlier forms, thoughit dealt in 'spirits'--the spirit of the corn, or the spirit of theSpring, or the spirits of the rain and the thunder, or the spirits oftotem-animals--it had not yet quite risen to the idea of gods. Ithad not risen to the conception of eternal deities sitting apart andgoverning the world in solemn conclave--as from the slopes of Olympusor the recesses of the Christian Heaven. It belonged, in fact, in itsinception, to the age of Magic. The creed of Sin and Sacrifice, or ofGuilt and Expiation--whatever we like to call it--was evolved perfectlynaturally out of the human mind when brought face to face with Lifeand Nature) at some early stage of its self-consciousness. It wasessentially the result of man's deep, original and instinctive sense ofsolidarity with Nature, now denied and belied and to some degreebroken up by the growth and conscious insistence of the self-regardingimpulses. It was the consciousness of disharmony and disunity,causing men to feel all the more poignantly the desire and the need ofreconciliation. It was a realization of union made clear by its veryloss. It assumed of course, in a subconscious way as I have alreadyindicated, that the external world was the HABITAT of a mind or mindssimilar to man's own; but THAT being granted, it is evident that theparticular theories current in this or that place about the nature ofthe world--the theories, as we should say, of science or theology--didnot alter the general outlines of the creed; they only colored itsdetails and gave its ritual different dramatic settings. The mentalattitudes, for instance, of Abraham sacrificing the ram, or of theSiberian angakout slaughtering a totem-bear, or of a modern and piousChristian contemplating the Saviour on the Cross are really almostexactly the same. I mention this because in tracing the origins or theevolution of religions it is important to distinguish clearly what isessential and universal from that which is merely local and temporary.Some people, no doubt, would be shocked at the comparisons just made;but surely it is much more inspiriting and encouraging to think thatwhatever progress HAS been made in the religious outlook of the worldhas come about through the gradual mental growth and consent of thepeoples, rather than through some unique and miraculous event of arather arbitrary and unexplained character--which indeed might never berepeated, and concerning which it would perhaps be impious to suggestthat it SHOULD be repeated.The consciousness then of Sin (or of alienation from the life of thewhole), and of restoration or redemption through Sacrifice, seems tohave disclosed itself in the human race in very far-back times, andto have symbolized itself in some most ancient rituals; and if we areshocked sometimes at the barbarities which accompanied those rituals,yet we must allow that these barbarities show how intensely the earlypeople felt the solemnity and importance of the whole matter; and wemust allow too that the barbarities did sear and burn themselves intorude and ignorant minds with the sense of the NEED of Sacrifice, andwith a result perhaps which could not have been compassed in any otherway.For after all we see now that sacrifice is of the very essence of sociallife. "It is expedient that ONE man should die for the people"; and notonly that one man should actually die, but (what is far more important)that each man should be ready and WILLING to die in that cause, whenthe occasion and the need arises. Taken in its larger meanings andimplications Sacrifice, as conceived in the ancient world, was aperfectly reasonable thing. It SHOULD pervade modern life more than itdoes. All we have or enjoy flows from, or is implicated with, painand suffering in others, and--if there is any justice in Nature orHumanity--it demands an equivalent readiness to suffer on our part. IfChristianity has any real essence, that essence is perhaps expressedin some such ritual or practice of Sacrifice, and we see that the dimbeginnings of this idea date from the far-back customs of savages comingdown from a time anterior to all recorded history.VIII. PAGAN INITIATIONS AND THE SECOND BIRTHWe have suggested in the last chapter how the conceptions of Sin andSacrifice coming down to us from an extremely remote past, andembodied among the various peoples of the world sometimes in crude andbloodthirsty rites, sometimes in symbols and rituals of a gentler andmore gracious character, descended at last into Christianity and becamea part of its creed and of the creed of the modern world. On the wholeperhaps we may trace a slow amelioration in this process and may flatterourselves that the Christian centuries exhibit a more philosophicalunderstanding of what Sin is, and a more humane conception of whatSacrifice SHOULD be, than the centuries preceding. But I fear that anyvery decided statement or sweeping generalization to that effect wouldbe--to say the least--rash. Perhaps there IS a very slow amelioration;but the briefest glance at the history of the Christian churches--thehorrible rancours and revenges of the clergy and the sects againsteach other in the fourth and fifth centuries A.D., the heresy-huntingcrusades at Beziers and other places and the massacres of the Albigensesin the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the witch-findings andburnings of the sixteenth and seventeenth, the hideous science-urged andbishop-blessed warfare of the twentieth--horrors fully as great as anywe can charge to the account of the Aztecs or the Babylonians--must giveus pause. Nor must we forget that if there is by chance a substantialamelioration in our modern outlook with regard to these matters the samehad begun already before the advent of Christianity and can by no meansbe ascribed to any miraculous influence of that religion. Abraham wasprompted to slay a ram as a substitute for his son, long before theChristians were thought of; the rather savage Artemis of the old Greekrites was (according to Pausanias) (1) honored by the yearly sacrificeof a perfect boy and girl, but later it was deemed sufficient to draw aknife across their throats as a symbol, with the result of spilling onlya few drops of their blood, or to flog the boys (with the same result)upon her altar. Among the Khonds in old days many victims (meriahs) weresacrificed to the gods, "but in time the man was replaced by a horse,the horse by a bull, the bull by a ram, the ram by a kid, the kid byfowls, and the fowls by many flowers." (2) At one time, according to theYajur-Veda, there was a festival at which one hundred and twenty-fivevictims, men and women, boys and girls, were sacrificed; "but reformsupervened, and now the victims were bound as before to the stake,but afterwards amid litanies to the immolated (god) Narayana, thesacrificing priest brandished a knife and--severed the bonds of thecaptives." (3) At the Athenian festival of the Thargelia, to which Ireferred in the last chapter, it appears that the victims, in latertimes, instead of being slain, were tossed from a height into the sea,and after being rescued were then simply banished; while at Leucatas asimilar festival the fall of the victim was graciously broken by tyingfeathers and even living birds to his body. (4) (1) vii. 19, and iii. 8, 16. (2) Primitive Folk, by Elie Reclus (Contemp. Science Series), p.330. (3) Ibid. (4) Muller's Dorians Book II, ch. ii, par. 10.With the lapse of time and the general progress of mankind, we may,I think, perceive some such slow ameliorations in the matter of thebrutality and superstition of the old religions. How far any laterameliorations were due to the direct influence of Christianity mightbe a difficult question; but what I think we can clearly see--and whatespecially interests us here--is that in respect to its main religiousideas, and the matter underlying them (exclusive of the MANNER oftheir treatment, which necessarily has varied among different peoples)Christianity is of one piece with the earlier pagan creeds and isfor the most part a re-statement and renewed expression of world-widedoctrines whose first genesis is lost in the haze of the past, beyondall recorded history.I have illustrated this view with regard to the doctrine of Sin andSacrifice. Let us take two or three other illustrations. Let us take thedoctrine of Re-birth or Regeneration. The first few verses of St. John'sGospel are occupied with the subject of salvation through rebirth orregeneration. "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom ofGod."... "Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enterinto the kingdom of God." Our Baptismal Service begins by saying that"forasmuch as all men are conceived and born in sin; and that ourSaviour Christ saith, None can enter into the kingdom of God except hebe regenerate and born anew of water and the Holy Ghost"; therefore itis desirable that this child should be baptized, "received into Christ'sHoly Church, and be made a lively member of the same." That, is to say,there is one birth, after the flesh, but a second birth is necessary, abirth after the Spirit and into the Church of Christ. Our ConfirmationService is simply a service repeating and confirming these views, atan age (fourteen to sixteen or so) when the boy or girl is capable ofunderstanding what is being done.But our Baptismal and Confirmation ceremonies combined are clearlythe exact correspondence and parallel of the old pagan ceremonies ofInitiation, which are or have been observed in almost every primitivetribe over the world. "The rite of the second birth," says JaneHarrison, (1) "is widespread, universal, over half the savage world.With the savage to be twice-born is the rule. By his first birth hecomes into the world; by his second he is born into his tribe. At hisfirst birth he belongs to his mother and the women-folk; at his secondhe becomes a full-fledged man and passes into the society of thewarriors of his tribe."... "These rites are very various, but they allpoint to one moral, that the former things are passed away and thatthe new-born man has entered upon a new life. Simplest of all, and mostinstructive, is the rite practised by the Kikuyu tribe of British EastAfrica, who require that every boy, just before circumcision, must beborn again. The mother stands up with the boy crouching at her feet; shepretends to go through all the labour pains, and the boy on being reborncries like a babe and is washed." (2) (1) Ancient Art and Ritual, p. 104. (2) See also Themis, p. 21.Let us pause for a moment. An Initiate is of course one who "entersin." He enters into the Tribe; he enters into the revelation of certainMysteries; he becomes an associate of a certain Totem, a certain God; amember of a new Society, or Church--a church of Mithra, or Dionysus orChrist. To do any of these things he must be born again; he must dieto the old life; he must pass through ceremonials which symbolize thechange. One of these ceremonials is washing. As the new-born babe iswashed, so must the new-born initiate be washed; and as by primitiveman (and not without reason) BLOOD was considered the most vital andregenerative of fluids, the very elixir of life, so in earliest timesit was common to wash the initiate with blood. If the initiate had to beborn anew, it would seem reasonable to suppose that he must first die.So, not unfrequently, he was wounded, or scourged, and baptized with hisown blood, or, in cases, one of the candidates was really killed and hisblood used as a substitute for the blood of the others. No doubt HUMANsacrifice attended the earliest initiations. But later it was sufficientto be half-drowned in the blood of a Bull as in the Mithra cult, (1)or 'washed in the blood of the Lamb' as in the Christian phraseology.Finally, with a growing sense of decency and aesthetic perceptionamong the various peoples, washing with pure water came in theinitiation-ceremonies to take the place of blood; and our baptismalservice has reduced the ceremony to a mere sprinkling with water. (2) (1) See ch. iii. (2) For the virtue supposed to reside in blood see Westermarck'sMoral Ideas, Ch. 46.To continue the quotation from Miss Harrison: "More often the new birthis stimulated, or imagined, as a death and a resurrection, either ofthe boys themselves or of some one else in their presence. Thus atinitiation among some tribes of South-east Australia, when the boys areassembled an old man dressed in stringy bark-fibre lies down in agrave. He is covered up lightly with sticks and earth, and the grave issmoothed over. The buried man holds in his hand a small bush which seemsto be growing from the ground, and other bushes are stuck in the groundround about. The novices are then brought to the edge of the grave anda song is sung. Gradually, as the song goes on, the bush held by theburied man begins to quiver. It moves more and more, and bit by bit theman himself starts up from the grave."Strange in our own Baptismal Service and just before the actualchristening we read these words, "Then shall the Priest say: O mercifulGod, grant that old Adam in this child may be so BURIED that the newman may be raised up in him: grant that all carnal affections may diein him, and that all things belonging to the Spirit may live and growin him!" Can we doubt that the Australian medicine-man, standing at thegraveside of the re-arisen old black-fellow, pointed the same moral tothe young initiates as the priest does to-day to those assembled beforehim in church--for indeed we know that among savage tribes initiationshave always been before all things the occasions of moral and socialteaching? Can we doubt that he said, in substance if not in actualwords: "As this man has arisen from the grave, so you must also arisefrom your old childish life of amusement and self-gratification and,ENTER INTO the life of the tribe, the life of the Spirit of the tribe.""In totemistic societies," to quote Miss Harrison again, "and in theanimal secret societies that seem to grow out of them, the novice isborn again as THE SACRED ANIMAL. Thus among the Carrier Indians (1)when a man wants to become a Lulem or 'Bear,' however cold the seasonhe tears off his clothes, puts on a bear-skin and dashes into thewoods, where he will stay for three or four days. Every night hisfellow-villagers will go out in search parties to find him. They cry outYi! Kelulem (come on, Bear), and he answers with angry growls. Usuallythey fail to find him, but he comes back at last himself. He is met, andconducted to the ceremonial lodge, and there in company with the restof the Bears dances solemnly his first appearance. Disappearance andreappearance is as common a rite in initiation as stimulated killing andresurrection, and has the same object. Both are rites of transition,of passing from one to another." In the Christian ceremonies the boy orgirl puts away childish things and puts on the new man, but insteadof putting on a bear-skin he puts on Christ. There is not so muchdifference as may appear on the surface. To be identified with yourTotem is to be identified with the sacred being who watches over yourtribe, who has given his life for your tribe; it is to be born again,to be washed not only with water but with the Holy Spirit of all yourfellows. To be baptized into Christ ought to mean to be regeneratedin the Holy Spirit of all humanity; and no doubt in cases it does meanthis, but too often unfortunately it has only amounted to a pretence ofreligious sanction given to the meanest and bitterest quarrels of theChurches and the States. (1) Golden Bough, Section 2, III, p. 438.This idea of a New Birth at initiation explains the prevalent pagancustom of subjecting the initiates to serious ordeals, often painful andeven dangerous. If one is to be born again, obviously one must be readyto face death; the one thing cannot be without the other. One must beable to endure pain, like the Red Indian braves; to go long periodsfasting and without food or drink, like the choupan among the WesternInoits--who, wanders for whole nights over the ice-fields under themoon, scantily clothed and braving the intense cold; to overcome thevery fear of death and danger, like the Australian novices who, at firstterrified by the sound of the bull-roarer and threats of fire and theknife, learn finally to cast their fears away. (1) By so doing oneputs off the old childish things, and qualifies oneself by firmnessand courage to become a worthy member of the society into which oneis called. (2) The rules of social life are taught--the duty to one'stribe, and to oneself, truth-speaking, defence of women and children,the care of cattle, the meaning of sex and marriage, and even themysteries of such religious ideas and rudimentary science as the tribepossesses. And by so doing one really enters into a new life. Things ofthe spiritual world begin to dawn. Julius Firmicus, in describingthe mysteries of the resurrection of Osiris, (3) says that when theworshipers had satiated themselves with lamentations over the deathof the god then the priest would go round anointing them with oil andwhispering, "Be of good cheer, O Neophytes of the new-arisen God, for tous too from our pains shall come salvation." (4) (1) According to accounts of the Wiradthuri tribe of WesternAustralia, in their initiations, the lads were frightened by a largefire being lighted near them, and hearing the awful sound of thebull-roarers, while they were told that Dhuramoolan was about to burnthem; the legend being that Dhuramoolan, a powerful being, whose voicesounded like thunder, would take the boys into the bush and instructthem in all the laws, traditions and customs of the community. So hepretended that he always killed the boys, cut them up, and burnt them toashes, after which he moulded the ashes into human shape, and restoredthem to life as new beings. (See R. H. Matthews, "The Wiradthuritribes," Journal Anthrop. Inst., vol. xxv, 1896, pp. 297 sq.) (2) See Catlin's North-American Indians, vol. i, for initiationsand ordeals among the Mandans. (3) De Errore, c. 22. (4) [gr Qarreite, mustai ton qeou seswsmenou,][gr Estai gar hmin ek ponwn swthria.]It would seem that at some very early time in the history of tribal andpriestly initiations an attempt was made to impress upon the neophytesthe existence and over-shadowing presence of spiritual and ghostlybeings. Perhaps the pains endured in the various ordeals, the longfastings, the silences in the depth of the forests or on the mountainsor among the ice-floes, helped to rouse the visionary faculty.The developments of this faculty among the black and coloredpeoples--East-Indian, Burmese, African, American-Indian, etc.--are wellknown. Miss Alice Fletcher, who lived among the Omaha Indians for thirtyyears, gives a most interesting account (1) of the general philosophyof that people and their rites of initiation. "The Omahas regard allanimate and inanimate forms, all phenomena, as pervaded by a commonlife, which was continuous with and similar to the will-power they wereconscious of in themselves. This mysterious power in all things theycalled Wakonda, and through it all things were related to man andto each other. In the idea of the continuity of life a relation wasmaintained between the seen and the unseen, the dead and the living,and also between the fragment of anything and its entirety." (2) Thus anOmaha novice might at any time seek to obtain Wakonda by what was calledTHE RITE OF THE VISION. He would go out alone, fast, chant incantations,and finally fall into a trance (much resembling what in modern times hasbeen called COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS) in which he would perceive the innerrelations of all things and the solidarity of the least object with therest of the universe. (1) Summarized in Themis, pp. 68-71. (2) A. C. Fletcher, The Significance of the Scalp-lock, Journalof Anthropological Studies, xxvii (1897-8), p. 436.Another rite in connection with initiation, and common all overthe pagan world--in Greece, America, Africa, Australia, New Mexico,etc.--was the daubing of the novice all over with clay or chalk or evendung, and then after a while removing the same. (1) The novice must havelooked a sufficiently ugly and uncomfortable object in this state; butlater, when he was thoroughly WASHED, the ceremony must have afforded athrilling illustration of the idea of a new birth, and one which woulddwell in the minds of the spectators. When the daubing was done as notinfrequently happened with white clay or gypsum, and the ritual tookplace at night, it can easily be imagined that the figures of young menand boys moving about in the darkness would lend support to the ideathat they were spirits belonging to some intermediate world--who hadalready passed through death and were now waiting for their second birthon earth (or into the tribe) which would be signalized by their thoroughand ceremonial washing. It will be remembered that Herodotus (viii)gives a circumstantial account of how the Phocians in a battle with theThessalians smeared six hundred of their bravest warriors with whiteclay so that, looking like supernatural beings, and falling upon theThessalians by night, they terrified the latter and put them to instantflight. (1) See A. Lang's Myth, Ritual and Religion, i, 274 sq.Such then--though only very scantily described--were some of the ritesof Initiation and Second Birth celebrated in the old Pagan world. Thesubject is far too large for adequate treatment within the presentlimits; but even so we cannot but be struck by the appropriateness inmany cases of the teaching thus given to the young, the concreteness ofthe illustrations, the effectiveness of the symbols used, the dramaticcharacter of the rites, the strong enforcement of lessons on the natureand duties of the life into which the candidates were about to enter.Christianity followed on, and inherited these traditions, but one feelsthat in its ceremonies of Baptism and Confirmation, which of coursecorrespond to the Pagan Initiations, it falls short of the latter. Itsceremonies (certainly as we have them to-day in Protestant countries)are of a very milk-and-watery character; all allusion to and teaching onthe immensely important subject of Sex is omitted, the details of socialand industrial morality are passed by, and instruction is limited to afew rather commonplace lessons in general morality and religion.It may be appropriate here, before leaving the subject of the SecondBirth, to inquire how it has come about that this doctrine--so remoteand metaphysical as it might appear--has been taken up and embodied intheir creeds and rituals by quite PRIMITIVE people all over the world,to such a degree indeed that it has ultimately been adopted and builtinto the foundations of the latter and more intellectual religions, likeHinduism, Mithraism, and the Egyptian and Christian cults. I think theanswer to this question must be found in the now-familiar fact that theearliest peoples felt themselves so much a part of Nature and the animaland vegetable world around them that (whenever they thought about thesematters at all) they never for a moment doubted that the things whichwere happening all round them in the external world were also happeningwithin themselves. They saw the Sun, overclouded and nigh to death inwinter, come to its birth again each year; they saw the Vegetationshoot forth anew in spring--the revival of the spirit of the Earth; theendless breeding of the Animals, the strange transformations of Wormsand Insects; the obviously new life taken on by boys and girls atpuberty; the same at a later age when the novice was transformed intothe medicine-man--the choupan into the angakok among the Esquimaux, theDacotah youth into the wakan among the Red Indians; and they felt intheir sub-conscious way the same everlasting forces of rebirth andtransformation working within themselves. In some of the Greek Mysteriesthe newly admitted Initiates were fed for some time after on milk only"as though we were being born again." (See Sallustius, quoted by GilbertMurray.) When sub-conscious knowledge began to glimmer into directconsciousness one of the first aspects (and no doubt one of the truest)under which people saw life was just thus: as a series of rebirths andtransformations. (1) The most modern science, I need hardly say, inbiology as well as in chemistry and the field of inorganic Nature,supports that view. The savage in earliest times FELT the truth of somethings which we to-day are only beginning intellectually to perceive andanalyze. (1) The fervent and widespread belief in animal metamorphosesamong early peoples is well known.Christianity adopted and absorbed--as it was bound to do--thisworld-wide doctrine of the second birth. Passing over its physiologicaland biological applications, it gave to it a fine spiritualsignificance--or rather it insisted especially on its spiritualsignificance, which (as we have seen) had been widely recognized before.Only--as I suppose must happen with all local religions--it narrowed theapplication and outlook of the doctrine down to a special case--"Asin Adam all die, so in CHRIST shall all be made alive." The UniversalSpirit which can give rebirth and salvation to EVERY child of man towhom it comes, was offered only under a very special form--that of JesusChrist. (1) In this respect it was no better than the religionswhich preceded it. In some respects--that is, where it was especiallyfanatical, blinkered, and hostile to other sects--it was WORSE. Butto those who perceive that the Great Spirit may bring new birth andsalvation to some under the form of Osiris, equally well as to othersunder the form of Jesus, or again to some under the form of a Siberiantotem-Bear equally as to others under the form of Osiris, thesequestionings and narrowings fall away as of no importance. We in thislatter day can see the main thing, namely that Christianity was and isjust one phase of a world-old religion, slowly perhaps expanding itsscope, but whose chief attitudes and orientations have been the samethrough the centuries. (1) The same happened with regard to another great Pagan doctrine(to which I have just alluded), the doctrine of transformations andmetamorphoses; and whereas the pagans believed in these things, as thecommon and possible heritage of EVERY man, the Christians only allowedthemselves to entertain the idea in the special and unique instance ofthe Transfiguration of Christ.Many other illustrations might be taken of the truth of this view, butI will confine myself to two or three more. There is the instance of theEucharist and its exceedingly widespread celebration (under very variousforms) among the pagans all over the world--as well as among Christians.I have already said enough on this subject, and need not delay over it.By partaking of the sacramental meal, even in its wildest and crudestshapes, as in the mysteries of Dionysus, one was identified with andunited to the god; in its milder and more spiritual aspects as in theMithraic, Egyptian, Hindu and Christian cults, one passed behind theveil of maya and this ever-changing world, and entered into the regionof divine peace and power. (1) (1) Baring Gould in his Orig. Relig. Belief, I. 401,says:--"Among the ancient Hindus Soma was a chief deity; he is calledthe Giver of Life and Health.... He became incarnate among men, wastaken by them and slain, and brayed in a mortar (a god of corn and wineapparently). But he rose in flame to heaven to be 'the Benefactor of theWorld' and the 'Mediator between God and Man!' Through communion withhim in his sacrifice, man (who partook of this god) has an assurance ofimmortality, for by that sacrament he obtains union with his divinity."Or again the doctrine of the Saviour. That also is one on which I neednot add much to what has been said already. The number of pagan deities(mostly virgin-born and done to death in some way or other in theirefforts to save mankind) is so great (1) as to be difficult to keepaccount of. The god Krishna in India, the god Indra in Nepaul andThibet, spilt their blood for the salvation of men; Buddha said,according to Max Muller, (2) "Let all the sins that were in the worldfall on me, that the world may be delivered"; the Chinese Tien, the HolyOne--"one with God and existing with him from all eternity"--died tosave the world; the Egyptian Osiris was called Saviour, so was Horus;so was the Persian Mithras; so was the Greek Hercules who overcame Deaththough his body was consumed in the burning garment of mortality, outof which he rose into heaven. So also was the Phrygian Attis calledSaviour, and the Syrian Tammuz or Adonis likewise--both of whom, as wehave seen, were nailed or tied to a tree, and afterwards rose againfrom their biers, or coffins. Prometheus, the greatest and earliestbenefactor of the human race, was NAILED BY THE HANDS and feet, and witharms extended, to the rocks of Mount Caucasus. Bacchus or Dionysus,born of the virgin Semele to be the Liberator of mankind (DionysusEleutherios as he was called), was torn to pieces, not unlike Osiris.Even in far Mexico Quetzalcoatl, the Saviour, was born of a virgin, wastempted, and fasted forty days, was done to death, and his second cominglooked for so eagerly that (as is well known) when Cortes appeared, theMexicans, poor things, greeted HIM as the returning god! (3) In Peruand among the American Indians, North and South of the Equator, similarlegends are, or were, to be found. (1) See for a considerable list Doane's Bible Myths, ch. xx. (2) Hist. Sanskrit Literature, p. 80. (3) See Kingsborough, Mexican Antiquities, vol. vi.Briefly sketched as all this is, it is enough to prove quite abundantlythat the doctrine of the Saviour is world-wide and world-old, and thatChristianity merely appropriated the same and (as the other cults did)gave it a special color. Probably the wide range of this doctrine wouldhave been far better and more generally known, had not the ChristianChurch, all through, made the greatest of efforts and taken the greatestprecautions to extinguish and snuff out all evidence of pagan claims onthe subject. There is much to show that the early Church took this linewith regard to pre-Christian saviours; (1) and in later times the samepolicy is remarkably illustrated by the treatment in the sixteenthcentury of the writings of Sahagun the Spanish missionary--to whose workI have already referred. Sahagun was a wonderfully broad-minded and fineman who, while he did not conceal the barbarities of the Aztec religion,was truthful enough to point out redeeming traits in the manners andcustoms of the people and some resemblances to Christian doctrine andpractice. This infuriated the bigoted Catholics of the newly formedMexican Church. They purloined the manuscripts of Sahagun's Historia andscattered and hid them about the country, and it was only after infinitelabor and an appeal to the Spanish Court that he got them togetheragain. Finally, at the age of eighty, having translated them intoSpanish (from the original Mexican) he sent them in two big volumes hometo Spain for safety; but there almost immediately THEY DISAPPEARED, andcould not be found! It was only after TWO CENTURIES that they ultimatelyturned up (1790) in a Convent at Tolosa in Navarre. Lord Kingsboroughpublished them in England in 1830. (1) See Tertullian's Apologia, c. 16; Ad Nationes, c. xii.I have thus dwelt upon several of the main doctrines ofChristianity--namely, those of Sin and Sacrifice, the Eucharist, theSaviour, the Second Birth, and Transfiguration--as showing that they areby no means unique in our religion, but were common to nearly all thereligions of the ancient world. The list might be much further extended,but there is no need to delay over a subject which is now very generallyunderstood. I will, however, devote a page or two to one instance, whichI think is very remarkable, and full of deep suggestion.There is no doctrine in Christianity which is more reverenced by theadherents of that religion, or held in higher estimation, than that Godsacrificed his only Son for the salvation of the world; also that sincethe Son was not only of like nature but of the SAME nature with theFather, and equal to him as being the second Person of the DivineTrinity, the sacrifice amounted to an immolation of Himself for the goodof mankind. The doctrine is so mystical, so remote, and in a sense soabsurd and impossible, that it has been a favorite mark through thecenturies for the ridicule of the scoffers and enemies of the Church;and here, it might easily be thought, is a belief which--whether it beconsidered glorious or whether contemptible--is at any rate unique, andpeculiar to that Church.And yet the extraordinary fact is that a similar belief ranges allthrough the ancient religions, and can be traced back to the earliesttimes. The word host which is used in the Catholic Mass for the breadand wine on the Altar, supposed to be the transubstantiated bodyand blood of Christ, is from the Latin Hostia which the dictionaryinterprets as "an animal slain in sacrifice, a sin-offering." It takesus far far back to the Totem stage of folk-life, when the tribe, as Ihave already explained, crowned a victim-bull or bear or other animalwith flowers, and honoring it with every offering of food and worship,sacrificed the victim to the Totem spirit of the tribe, and consumed itin an Eucharistic feast--the medicine-man or priest who conducted theritual wearing a skin of the same beast as a sign that he representedthe Totem-divinity, taking part in the sacrifice of 'himself tohimself.' It reminds us of the Khonds of Bengal sacrificing theirmeriahs crowned and decorated as gods and goddesses; of the Aztecs doingthe same; of Quetzalcoatl pricking his elbows and fingers so as to drawblood, which he offered on his own altar; or of Odin hanging by his owndesire upon a tree. "I know I was hanged upon a tree shaken by the windsfor nine long nights. I was transfixed by a spear; I was moved to Odin,myself to myself." And so on. The instances are endless. "I am theoblation," says the Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, (1) "I am thesacrifice, I the ancestral offering." "In the truly orthodox conceptionof sacrifice," says Elie Reclus, (2) "the consecrated offering, be itman, woman or virgin, lamb or heifer, cock or dove, represents THE DEITYHIMSELF.... Brahma is the 'imperishable sacrifice'; Indra, Soma, Hariand the other gods, became incarnate in animals to the sole end thatthey might be immolated. Perusha, the Universal Being, caused himself tobe slain by the Immortals, and from his substance were born the birds ofthe air, wild and domestic animals, the offerings of butter and curds.The world, declared the Rishis, is a series of sacrifices disclosingother sacrifices. To stop them would be to suspend the life of Nature.The god Siva, to whom the Tipperahs of Bengal are supposed to havesacrificed as many as a thousand human victims a year, said to theBrahamins: 'It is I that am the actual offering; it is I that youbutcher upon my altars.'" (1) Ch. ix, v. 16. (2) Primitive Folk, ch. vi.It was in allusion to this doctrine that R. W. Emerson, paraphrasing theKatha-Upanishad, wrote that immortal verse of his:--     If the red slayer thinks he slays,          Or the slain thinks he is slain,     They know not well the subtle ways          I take, and pass, and turn again.I say it is an astonishing thing to think and realize that this profoundand mystic doctrine of the eternal sacrifice of Himself, ordained bythe Great Spirit for the creation and salvation of the world--a doctrinewhich has attracted and fascinated many of the great thinkers and noblerminds of Europe, which has also inspired the religious teachings ofthe Indian sages and to a less philosophical degree the writings of theChristian Saints--should have been seized in its general outline andessence by rude and primitive people before the dawn of history, andembodied in their rites and ceremonials. What is the explanation of thisfact?It is very puzzling. The whole subject is puzzling. The world-wideadoption of similar creeds and rituals (and, we may add, legends andfairy tales) among early peoples, and in far-sundered places and timesis so remarkable that it has given the students of these subjects'furiously to think' (1)--yet for the most part without great success inthe way of finding a solution. The supposition that (1) the creed, riteor legend in question has sprung up, so to speak, accidentally, in oneplace, and then has travelled (owing to some inherent plausibility) overthe rest of the world, is of course one that commends itself readily atfirst; but on closer examination the practical difficulties it presentsare certainly very great. These include the migrations of customs andmyths in quite early ages of the earth across trackless oceans andcontinents, and between races and peoples absolutely incapable ofunderstanding each other. And if to avoid these difficulties it isassumed that the present human race all proceeds from one originalstock which radiating from one centre--say in South-Eastern Asia(2)--overspread the world, carrying its rites and customs with it, why,then we are compelled to face the difficulty of supposing this radiationto have taken place at an enormous time ago (the continents being thenall more or less conjoined) and at a period when it is doubtful if anyreligious rites and customs at all existed; not to mention the furtherdifficulty of supposing all the four or five hundred languages nowexisting to be descended from one common source. The far tradition ofthe Island of Atlantis seems to afford a possible explanation of thecommunity of rites and customs between the Old and New World, andthis without assuming in any way that Atlantis (if it existed) was theoriginal and SOLE cradle of the human race. (3) Anyhow it is clear thatthese origins of human culture must be of extreme antiquity, and thatit would not be wise to be put off the track of the investigation of apossible common source merely by that fact of antiquity. (1) See A. Lang's Myth, Ritual and Religion, vol. ii. (2) See Hastings, Encycl. Religion and Ethics, art. "Ethnology." (3) E. J. Payne, History of the New World called America (vol. i,p. 93) says: "It is certain that Europe and America once formed a singlecontinent," but inroads of the sea "left a vast island or peninsulastretching from Iceland to the Azores--which gradually disappeared."Also he speaks (i. 93) of the "Miocene Bridge" between Siberia and theNew World.A second supposition, however, is (2) that the natural psychologicalevolution of the human mind has in the various times and climes led folkof the most diverse surroundings and heredity--and perhaps even sprungfrom separate anthropoid stocks--to develop their social and religiousideas along the same general lines--and that even to the extent ofexhibiting at times a remarkable similarity in minute details. This is atheory which commends itself greatly to a deeper and more philosophicalconsideration; but it brings us up point-blank against another mostdifficult question (which we have already raised), namely, how toaccount for extremely rude and primitive peoples in the far past, and onthe very borderland of the animal life, having been SUSCEPTIBLE to thegerms of great religious ideas (such as we have mentioned) and havingbeen instinctively--though not of course by any process of consciousreasoning--moved to express them in symbols and rites and ceremonials,and (later no doubt) in myths and legends, which satisfied theirFEELINGS and sense of fitness--though they may not have known WHY--andafterwards were capable of being taken up and embodied in the greatphilosophical religions.This difficulty almost compels us to a view of human knowledge which hasfound supporters among some able thinkers--the view, namely, that a vaststore of knowledge is already contained in the subconscious mind of man(and the animals) and only needs the provocation of outer experienceto bring it to the surface; and that in the second stage of humanpsychology this process of crude and piecemeal externalization istaking place, in preparation for the final or third stage in which theknowledge will be re-absorbed and become direct and intuitional on ahigh and harmonious plane--something like the present intuition of theanimals as we perceive it on the animal plane. However this generalsubject is one on which I shall touch again, and I do not propose todwell on it at any length now.There is a third alternative theory (3)--a combination of (1) and(2)--namely, that if one accepts (2) and the idea that at any givenstage of human development there is a PREDISPOSITION to certain symbolsand rites belonging to that stage, then it is much more easy to accepttheory (1) as an important factor in the spread of such symbols andrites; for clearly, then, the smallest germ of a custom or practice,transported from one country or people to another at the right time,would be sufficient to wake the development or growth in questionand stimulate it into activity. It will be seen, therefore, that theimportant point towards the solution of this whole puzzling question isthe discussion, of theory (2)--and to this theory, as illustrated by theworld-wide myth of the Golden Age, I will now turn.IX. MYTH OF THE GOLDEN AGEThe tradition of a "Golden Age" is widespread over the world, and it isnot necessary to go at any length into the story of the Garden of Edenand the other legends which in almost every country illustrate thistradition. Without indulging in sentiment on the subject we may hold itnot unlikely that the tradition is justified by the remembrance, amongthe people of every race, of a pre-civilization period of comparativeharmony and happiness when two things, which to-day we perceive to bethe prolific causes of discord and misery, were absent or only weaklydeveloped--namely, PROPERTY and SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS. (1) (1) For a fuller working out of this, see Civilisation: its Causeand Cure, by E. Carpenter, ch. i.During the first century B.C. there was a great spread of MessianicIdeas over the Roman world, and Virgil's 4th Eclogue, commonly calledthe Messianic Eclogue, reflects very clearly this state of the publicmind. The expected babe in the poem was to be the son of Octavian(Augustus) the first Roman emperor, and a messianic halo surrounded itin Virgil's verse. Unfortunately it turned out to be a GIRL! Howeverthere is little doubt that Virgil did--in that very sad age of theworld, an age of "misery and massacre," and in common with thousandsof others--look for the coming of a great 'redeemer.' It was only a fewyears earlier--about B.C. 70--that the great revolt of the shamefullymaltreated Roman slaves occurred, and that in revenge six thousandprisoners from Spartacus' army were nailed on crosses all the way fromRome to Capua (150 miles). But long before this Hesiod had recorded apast Golden Age when life had been gracious in communal fraternity andjoyful in peace, when human beings and animals spoke the same language,when death had followed on sleep, without old age or disease, and afterdeath men had moved as good daimones or genii over the lands. Pindar,three hundred years after Hesiod, had confirmed the existence of theIslands of the Blest, where the good led a blameless, tearless, life.Plato the same, (1) with further references to the fabled island ofAtlantis; the Egyptians believed in a former golden age under the godR[a^] to which they looked back with regret and envy; the Persians hada garden of Eden similar to that of the Hebrews; the Greeks a gardenof the Hesperides, in which dwelt the serpent whose head was ultimatelycrushed beneath the heel of Hercules; and so on. The references to asupposed far-back state of peace and happiness are indeed numerous. (1) See arts. by Margaret Scholes, Socialist Review, Nov. andDec. 1912.So much so that latterly, and partly to explain their prevalence, atheory has been advanced which may be worth while mentioning. It iscalled the "Theory of intra-uterine Blessedness," and, remote as it mayat first appear, it certainly has some claim for attention. The theoryis that in the minds of mature people there still remain certain vaguememories of their pre-natal days in the maternal womb--memories of alife which, though full of growing vigor and vitality, was yet at thattime one of absolute harmony with the surroundings, and of perfect peaceand contentment, spent within the body of the mother--the embryo indeedstanding in the same relation to the mother as St. Paul says WE stand toGod, "IN whom we live and move and have our being"; and that these vaguememories of the intra-uterine life in the individual are referred backby the mature mind to a past age in the life of the RACE. Though itwould not be easy at present to positively confirm this theory, yet onemay say that it is neither improbable nor unworthy of consideration;also that it bears a certain likeness to the former ones about theEden-gardens, etc. The well-known parallelism of the Individual historywith the Race-history, the "recapitulation" by the embryo of thedevelopment of the race, does in fact afford an additional argument forits favorable reception.These considerations, and what we have said so often in the foregoingchapters about the unity of the Animals (and Early Man) with Nature, andtheir instinctive and age-long adjustment to the conditions of theworld around them, bring us up hard and fast against the followingconclusions, which I think we shall find difficult to avoid.We all recognize the extraordinary grace and beauty, in their differentways, of the (wild) animals; and not only their beauty but the extremefitness of their actions and habits to their surroundings--their subtleand penetrating Intelligence in fact. Only we do not generally usethe word "Intelligence." We use another word (Instinct)--and rightlyperhaps, because their actions are plainly not the result of definiteself-conscious reasoning, such as we use, carried out by eachindividual; but are (as has been abundantly proved by Samuel Butler andothers) the systematic expression of experiences gathered up and sortedout and handed down from generation to generation in the bosom of therace--an Intelligence in fact, or Insight, of larger subtler scope thanthe other, and belonging to the tribal or racial Being rather than tothe isolated individual--a super-consciousness in fact, ramifying afarin space and time.But if we allow (as we must) this unity and perfection of nature, andthis somewhat cosmic character of the mind, to exist among the Animals,we can hardly refuse to believe that there must have been a period whenMan, too, hardly as yet differentiated from them, did himselfpossess these same qualities--perhaps even in greater degree than theanimals--of grace and beauty of body, perfection of movement and action,instinctive perception and knowledge (of course in limited spheres); anda period when he possessed above all a sense of unity with his fellowsand with surrounding Nature which became the ground of a commonconsciousness between himself and his tribe, similar to that whichMaeterlinck, in the case of the Bees, calls the Spirit of the Hive. (1)It would be difficult, nay impossible, to suppose that human beingson their first appearance formed an entire exception in the process ofevolution, or that they were completely lacking in the very graces andfaculties which we so admire in the animals--only of course we see that(LIKE the animals) they would not be SELF-conscious in these matters,and what perception they had of their relations to each other or tothe world around them would be largely inarticulate andSUB-conscious--though none the less real for that. (1) See The Life of the Bee by Maurice Maeterlinck; and fornumerous similar cases among other animals, P. Kropotkin's Mutual Aid: afactor in Evolution.Let us then grant this preliminary assumption--and it clearly is nota large or hazardous one--and what follows? It follows--since to-daydiscord is the rule, and Man has certainly lost the grace, both physicaland mental, of the animals--that at some period a break must haveoccurred in the evolution-process, a discontinuity--similar perhaps tothat which occurs in the life of a child at the moment when it is borninto the world. Humanity took a new departure; but a departure which forthe moment was signalized as a LOSS--the loss of its former harmony andself-adjustment. And the cause or accompaniment of this change was thegrowth of Self-consciousness. Into the general consciousness of thetribe (in relation to its environment) which in fact had constitutedthe mentality of the animals and of man up to this stage, there now wasintruded another kind of consciousness, a consciousness centering roundeach little individual self and concerned almost entirely with theinterests of the latter. Here was evidently a threat to the continuanceof the former happy conditions. It was like the appearance ofinnumerable little ulcers in a human body--a menace which if continuedwould inevitably lead to the break-up of the body. It meant loss oftribal harmony and nature-adjustment. It meant instead of unity a myriadconflicting centres; it meant alienation from the spirit of the tribe,the separation of man from man, discord, recrimination, and the fatalunfolding of the sense of sin. The process symbolized itself in thelegend of the Fall. Man ate of the Tree of the knowledge of good andevil. Sometimes people wonder why knowledge of any kind--and especiallythe knowledge of good and evil--should have brought a curse. But thereason is obvious. Into, the placid and harmonious life of the animaland human tribes fulfilling their days in obedience to the slowevolutions and age-long mandates of nature, Self-consciousness brokewith its inconvenient and impossible query: "How do these arrangementssuit ME? Are they good for me, are they evil for me? I want to know. IWILL KNOW!" Evidently knowledge (such knowledge as we understand bythe word) only began, and could only begin, by queries relating to thelittle local self. There was no other way for it to begin. Knowledge andself-consciousness were born, as twins, together. Knowledge thereforemeant Sin (1); for self-consciousness meant sin (and it means sinto-day). Sin is Separation. That is probably (though disputed) theetymology of the word--that which sunders. (2) The essence of sin isone's separation from the whole (the tribe or the god) of which one isa part. And knowledge--which separates subject from object, and in itsinception is necessarily occupied with the 'good and evil' of the littlelocal self, is the great engine of this separation. (Mark! I say nothingAGAINST this association of Self-consciousness with 'Sin' (so-called)and 'Knowledge' (so-called). The growth of all three together is anabsolutely necessary part of human evolution, and to rail against itwould be absurd. But we may as well open our eyes and see the factstraight instead of blinking it.) The culmination of the process and thefulfilment of the 'curse' we may watch to-day in the towering expansionof the self-conscious individualized Intellect--science as the handmaidof human Greed devastating the habitable world and destroying itsunworthy civilization. And the process must go on--necessarily mustgo on--until Self-consciousness, ceasing its vain quest (vain in bothsenses) for the separate domination of life, surrenders itself backagain into the arms of the Mother-consciousness from which it originallysprang--surrenders itself back, not to be merged in nonentity, but to beaffiliated in loving dependence on and harmony with the cosmic life. (1) Compare also other myths, like Cupid and Psyche, Lohengrinetc., in which a fatal curiosity leads to tragedy. (2) German Sunde, sin, and sonder, separated; Dutch zonde, sin;Latin sons, guilty. Not unlikely that the German root Suhn, expiation,is connected; Suhn-bock, a scape-goat.All this I have dealt with in far more detail in Civilization: itsCause and Cure, and in The Art of Creation; but I have only repeated theoutline of it as above, because some such outline is necessary for theproper ordering and understanding of the points which follow.We are not concerned now with the ultimate effects of the 'Fall' of Manor with the present-day fulfilment of the Eden-curse. What we want tounderstand is how the 'Fall' into self-consciousness led to that greatpanorama of Ritual and Religion which we have very briefly describedand summarized in the preceding chapters of this book. We want for thepresent to fix our attention on the COMMENCEMENT of that process bywhich man lapsed away from his living community with Nature and hisfellows into the desert of discord and toil, while the angels of theflaming sword closed the gates of Paradise behind him.It is evident I think that in that 'golden' stage when man was simplythe crown and perfection of the animals--and it is hardly possibleto refuse the belief in such a stage--he possessed in reality all theessentials of Religion. (1) It is not necessary to sentimentalize overhim; he was probably raw and crude in his lusts of hunger and of sex;he was certainly ignorant and superstitious; he loved fighting withand persecuting 'enemies' (which things of course all religionsto-day--except perhaps
