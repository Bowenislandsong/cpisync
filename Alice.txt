e by that name since he asked me to marry him--'you know,dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be nosecret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try tothink of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if itwas all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brainfever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want toknow it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.' For, mydear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities arecomplete. 'Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here isthe book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let meknow; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back tothe bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.' He fellback exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. Ihave asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be thisafternoon, and am waiting her reply....       *       *       *       *       *"She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English missionchurch has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soonafter as Jonathan awakes....       *       *       *       *       *"Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, veryhappy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and hesat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his 'I will' firmlyand strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even thosewords seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, Ishall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilitiesI have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When thechaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, itis the first time I have written the words 'my husband'--left me alonewith my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped itup in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbonwhich was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed itto my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it wouldbe an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted eachother; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sakeor for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,Lucy, it was the first time he took _his wife's_ hand, and said that itwas the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would gothrough all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant tohave said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and Ishall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but theyear."Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was thehappiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give himexcept myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my loveand duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemnpledge between us...."Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only becauseit is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear tome. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came fromthe schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so thatin your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear,please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day ofsunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I mustnot wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be_always_ as happy as I am _now_. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this atonce, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathanis waking--I must attend to my husband!"Your ever-loving"MINA HARKER."_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker._"_Whitby, 30 August._"My dearest Mina,--"Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your ownhome with your husband. I wish you could be coming home soon enough tostay with us here. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it hasquite restored me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full oflife, and sleep well. You will be glad to know that I have quite givenup walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for aweek, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I am gettingfat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We have suchwalks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishingtogether; and I love him more than ever. He _tells_ me that he loves memore, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn't love memore than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me.So no more just at present from your loving"LUCY."P. S.--Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear. "P. P.S.--We are to be married on 28 September."_Dr. Seward's Diary.__20 August._--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He hasnow so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then onenight, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring tohimself: "Now I can wait; now I can wait." The attendant came to tellme, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in thestrait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gonefrom his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I mightalmost say, "cringing"--softness. I was satisfied with his presentcondition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strangething that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while lookingfurtively at them:--"They think I could hurt you! Fancy _me_ hurting _you_! The fools!"It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociatedeven in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same Ido not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything incommon with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or hashe to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needfulto him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even theoffer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He willonly say: "I don't take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,and I can wait; I can wait."After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quietuntil just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and atlength violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhaustedhim so that he swooned into a sort of coma.       *       *       *       *       *... Three nights has the same thing happened--violent all day then quietfrom moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. Itwould almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.Happy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. Heescaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. Weshall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case theyare required....       *       *       *       *       *_23 August._--"The unexpected always happens." How well Disraeli knewlife. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all oursubtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved onething; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall infuture be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have givenorders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul'sbody will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark!The unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until theattendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past himand flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow.Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found himin the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw mehe became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, hewould have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thinghappened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grewcalm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caughtthe patient's eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it lookedinto the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent andghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this oneseemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or hadsome intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, andpresently said:--"You needn't tie me; I shall go quietly!" Without trouble we came backto the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shallnot forget this night...._Lucy Westenra's Diary__Hillingham, 24 August._--I must imitate Mina, and keep writing thingsdown. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it willbe. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night Iseemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is thechange of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me,for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel soweak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grievedwhen he saw me, and I hadn't the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonderif I could sleep in mother's room to-night. I shall make an excuse andtry.       *       *       *       *       *_25 August._--Another bad night. Mother did not seem to take to myproposal. She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears toworry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when theclock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been fallingasleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but Idid not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then havefallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. Thismorning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat painsme. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don't seem ever toget air enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else Iknow he will be miserable to see me so._Letter, Arthur Holmwood to Dr. Seward._"_Albemarle Hotel, 31 August._"My dear Jack,--"I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill; that is, she has no specialdisease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. I haveasked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for todisturb the poor lady's mind about her daughter in her present state ofhealth would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom isspoken--disease of the heart--though poor Lucy does not know it yet. Iam sure that there is something preying on my dear girl's mind. I amalmost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a pang. Itold her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred atfirst--I know why, old fellow--she finally consented. It will be apainful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for _her_ sake, andI must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch atHillingham to-morrow, two o'clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion inMrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of beingalone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; Iam filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as Ican after you have seen her. Do not fail!"ARTHUR."_Telegram, Arthur Holmwood to Seward._"_1 September._"Am summoned to see my father, who is worse. Am writing. Write me fullyby to-night's post to Ring. Wire me if necessary."_Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood._"_2 September._"My dear old fellow,--"With regard to Miss Westenra's health I hasten to let you know at oncethat in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any maladythat I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied withher appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I sawher last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have fullopportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendshipmakes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom canbridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you todraw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I havedone and propose doing."I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knewto mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have nodoubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, wegot, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulnessamongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left withme. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chairwith a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that herhigh spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction tomake a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--"'I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.' I reminded herthat a doctor's confidence was sacred, but that you were grievouslyanxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled thatmatter in a word. 'Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care formyself, but all for him!' So I am quite free."I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not seethe usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test thequality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cordgave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was aslight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secureda few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitativeanalysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, initself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quitesatisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be acause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be somethingmental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily attimes, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, butregarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child sheused to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, whereMiss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has notreturned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; Ihave written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, ofAmsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in theworld. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all thingswere to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and yourrelations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience toyour wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can forher. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personalreason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept hiswishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knowswhat he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopherand a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an ironnerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and thekindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for thenoble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory andpractice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. Itell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence inhim. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenrato-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may notalarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call."Yours always,"JOHN SEWARD."_Letter, Abraham Van Helsing, M. D., D. Ph., D. Lit., etc., etc., to Dr.Seward._"_2 September._"My good Friend,--"When I have received your letter I am already coming to you. By goodfortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who havetrusted me. Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who havetrusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holdsdear. Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound soswiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our otherfriend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants myaids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do. But itis pleasure added to do for him, your friend; it is to you that I come.Have then rooms for me at the Great Eastern Hotel, so that I may be nearto hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not toolate on to-morrow, for it is likely that I may have to return here thatnight. But if need be I shall come again in three days, and stay longerif it must. Till then good-bye, my friend John. "VAN HELSING."_Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._"_3 September._"My dear Art,--"Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, andfound that, by Lucy's discretion, her mother was lunching out, so thatwe were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination ofthe patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for ofcourse I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how youtrust to me in the matter, he said: 'You must tell him all you think.Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am notjesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.' I askedwhat he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we hadcome back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on hisreturn to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must notbe angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all hisbrains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when thetime comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account ofour visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for_The Daily Telegraph_. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that thesmuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was astudent here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly makeit. In any case I am to have a letter."Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I firstsaw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of theghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She wasvery sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make himfeel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hardstruggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quicklook under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat ofall things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinitegeniality that I could see poor Lucy's pretense of animation merge intoreality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversationgently round to his visit, and suavely said:--"'My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are somuch beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do notsee. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of aghastly pale. To them I say: "Pouf!"' And he snapped his fingers at meand went on: 'But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How canhe'--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that withwhich once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, aparticular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--'know anythingof a young ladies? He has his madams to play with, and to bring themback to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But theyoung ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tellthemselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so manysorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away tosmoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk allto ourselves.' I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently theprofessor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, butsaid: 'I have made careful examination, but there is no functionalcause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it hasbeen, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I haveasked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must goback home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and ifthere be cause I shall come again. The disease--for not to be all wellis a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest metoo. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.'"As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trustyour poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, mydear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people whoare both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, andyou are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word tocome at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear fromme."_Dr. Seward's Diary.__4 September._--Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Justbefore the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knewthe symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at arun, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became soviolent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about fiveminutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sankinto a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. Theattendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were reallyappalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of theother patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quiteunderstand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I wassome distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, andas yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to showsomething directly. I cannot quite understand it.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--Another change in my patient. At five o'clock I looked in onhim, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. Hewas catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his captureby making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges ofpadding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his badconduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back tohis own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well tohumour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has thesugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite aharvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into abox, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to finda spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for anyclue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would notrise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort offar-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--"All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I doit for myself!" Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:"Doctor, won't you be very good to me and let me have a little moresugar? I think it would be good for me.""And the flies?" I said."Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I likeit." And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen donot argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a manas, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.       *       *       *       *       *_Midnight._--Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra,whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at ourown gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. Ashis room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than inthe morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smokybeauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadowsand all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foulwater, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stonebuilding, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heartto endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and fromhis window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and lessfrenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, aninert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectualrecuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood upquite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not tohold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straightover to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took hisfly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shutthe window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprisedme, so I asked him: "Are you not going to keep flies any more?""No," said he; "I am sick of all that rubbish!" He certainly is awonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of hismind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clueafter all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noonand at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun atperiods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others?We shall see._Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._"_4 September._--Patient still better to-day."_Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._"_5 September._--Patient greatly improved.

Arthur Holmwood._"_6 September._"My dear Art,--"My news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted meprofessionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and toldher that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming tostay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly withmyself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for ashock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy's weakcondition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in withdifficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shallcome through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if youdo not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting fornews. In hasteYours ever,"JOHN SEWARD."_Dr. Seward's Diary.__7 September._--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met atLiverpool Street was:--"Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?""No," I said. "I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. Iwrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as MissWestenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.""Right, my friend," he said, "quite right! Better he not know as yet;perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then heshall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You dealwith the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuchas you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God's madmen,too--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor whyyou do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledgein its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around itand breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here." Hetouched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himselfthe same way. "I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shallunfold to you.""Why not now?" I asked. "It may do some good; we may arrive at somedecision." He stopped and looked at me, and said:--"My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it hasripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshinehas not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull theear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,and say to you: 'Look! he's good corn; he will make good crop when thetime comes.'" I did not see the application, and told him so. For replyhe reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, ashe used long ago to do at lectures, and said: "The good husbandman tellyou so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find thegood husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is forthe children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as ofthe work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,there's some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell." He brokeoff, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and verygravely:--"You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever morefull than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, andI trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, thatknowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that thiscase of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of suchinterest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick thebeam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is toosmall. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. Welearn from failure, not from success!"When I described Lucy's symptoms--the same as before, but infinitelymore marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him abag in which were many instruments and drugs, "the ghastly paraphernaliaof our beneficial trade," as he once called, in one of his lectures, theequipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as Iexpected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordainedthat even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a casewhere any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from somecause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in herdaughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It issomething like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body anenvelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil thatwhich it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an orderedselfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the viceof egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we haveknowledge of.I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid downa rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illnessmore than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily thatI saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I wereshown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, Iwas horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; thered seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones ofher face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see orhear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows convergedtill they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did notseem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. ThenVan Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. Theinstant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage tothe next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him andclosed the door. "My God!" he said; "this is dreadful. There is no timeto be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart'saction as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Isit you or me?""I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.""Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared."I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock atthe hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened thedoor, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying inan eager whisper:--"Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, andhave been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see formyself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,sir, for coming." When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him he hadbeen angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took inhis stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood whichseemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said tohim gravely as he held out his hand:--"Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She isbad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that." For hesuddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. "You are tohelp her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is yourbest help.""What can I do?" asked Arthur hoarsely. "Tell me, and I shall do it. Mylife is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body forher." The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from oldknowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--"My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!""What shall I do?" There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostrilquivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. "Come!"he said. "You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better thanme, better than my friend John." Arthur looked bewildered, and theProfessor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--"Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must haveor die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to performwhat we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one tothe empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he isthe more young and strong than me"--here Arthur took my hand and wrungit hard in silence--"but, now you are here, you are more good than us,old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are notso calm and our blood not so bright than yours!" Arthur turned to himand said:--"If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you wouldunderstand----"He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice."Good boy!" said Van Helsing. "In the not-so-far-off you will be happythat you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. Youshall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and youmust leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is withher! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!"We all went up to Lucy's room. Arthur by direction remained outside.Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was notasleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoketo us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laidthem on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, andcoming over to the bed, said cheerily:--"Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a goodchild. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes." She had madethe effort with success.It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, markedthe extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began toflicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifestits potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor wassatisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off hiscoat. Then he added: "You may take that one little kiss whiles I bringover the table. Friend John, help to me!" So neither of us looked whilsthe bent over her.Van Helsing turning to me, said:"He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need notdefibrinate it."Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed theoperation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to comeback to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joyof his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to growanxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as hewas. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy's system musthave undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand and withhis eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my ownheart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: "Do not stir an instant.It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her." When all was over Icould see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took hisarm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--theman seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--"The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall havepresently." And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted thepillow to the patient's head. As he did so the narrow black velvet bandwhich she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an olddiamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but Icould hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing'sways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned tome, saying: "Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the portwine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleepmuch and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given tohis love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all waysthe operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and youcan go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tellher all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what youhave done. Good-bye."When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as herbreast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in awhisper:--"What do you make of that mark on her throat?""What do you make of it?""I have not examined it yet," I answered, and then and there proceededto loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were twopunctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign ofdisease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by sometrituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever itwas, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandonedthe idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bedwould have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl musthave lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion."Well?" said Van Helsing."Well," said I, "I can make nothing of it." The Professor stood up. "Imust go back to Amsterdam to-night," he said. "There are books andthings there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and youmust not let your sight pass from her.""Shall I have a nurse?" I asked."We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see thatshe is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep allthe night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon aspossible. And then we may begin.""May begin?" I said. "What on earth do you mean?""We shall see!" he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a momentlater and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger heldup:--"Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, youshall not sleep easy hereafter!"_Dr. Seward's Diary--continued.__8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itselfoff towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different beingfrom what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of theabsolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenrathat Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her shealmost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewedstrength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and madepreparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for thenight I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat bythe bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at megratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemedsinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself togetherand shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effortand with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that shedid not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--"You do not want to go to sleep?""No; I am afraid.""Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.""Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!""A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?""I don't know; oh, I don't know. And that is what is so terrible. Allthis weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.""But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, andI can promise that nothing will happen.""Ah, I can trust you!" I seized the opportunity, and said: "I promiseyou that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.""You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I willsleep!" And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sankback, asleep.All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and onin a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips wereslightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of apendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no baddreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and tookmyself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a shortwire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent resultof the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me allday to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about myzoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for thepast day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilstI was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, asit might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by thenight mail and would join me early in the morning.       *       *       *       *       *_9 September_.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got toHillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and mybrain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebralexhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook handswith me she looked sharply in my face and said:--"No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite wellagain; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I whowill sit up with you." I would not argue the point, but went and had mysupper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, Imade an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more thanexcellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room nexther own, where a cozy fire was burning. "Now," she said, "you must stayhere. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on thesofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go tobed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything Ishall call out, and you can come to me at once." I could not butacquiesce, for I was "dog-tired," and could not have sat up had I tried.So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything,I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything._Lucy Westenra's Diary.__9 September._--I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak,that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine aftera long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very,very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I supposeit is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our innereyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Loverein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I knowwhere my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your earsmust tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest oflast night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand andwithin call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God!Good-night, Arthur._Dr. Seward's Diary.__10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor's hand on my head, andstarted awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learnin an asylum, at any rate."And how is our patient?""Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me," I answered."Come, let us see," he said. And together we went into the room.The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst VanHelsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, Iheard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, adeadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, andhis exclamation of horror, "Gott in Himmel!" needed no enforcement fromhis agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and hisiron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horriblywhite and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gumsseemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in acorpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stampin anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habitstood to him, and he put it down again softly. "Quick!" he said. "Bringthe brandy." I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm andwrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonisingsuspense said:--"It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work isundone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I haveto call on you yourself this time, friend John." As he spoke, he wasdipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; Ihad taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was nopossibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,without a moment's delay, we began the operation. After a time--it didnot seem a short time either, for the draining away of one's blood, nomatter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsingheld up a warning finger. "Do not stir," he said, "but I fear that withgrowing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so muchdanger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injectionof morphia." He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out hisintent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to mergesubtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pridethat I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallidcheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is tofeel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.The Professor watched me critically. "That will do," he said. "Already?"I remonstrated. "You took a great deal more from Art." To which hesmiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--"He is her lover, her _fiancé_. You have work, much work, to do for herand for others; and the present will suffice."When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applieddigital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited hisleisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-byhe bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine formyself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and halfwhispered:--"Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn upunexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him andenjealous him, too. There must be none. So!"When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--"You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, andrest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me."I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. Ihad done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. Ifelt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement atwhat had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering overand over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and howshe could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere toshow for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the littlepunctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of theiredges--tiny though they were.Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well andstrong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsinghad seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strictinjunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear hisvoice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anythinghad happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mothercame up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, butsaid to me gratefully:--"We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you reallymust now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking paleyourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that youdo!" As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonteddrain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turnedimploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on mylips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:"Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. Istay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You andI must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have gravereasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to thinkeven the most not-probable. Good-night."In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either ofthem might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; andwhen I said it was Dr. Van Helsing's wish that either he or I should situp, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the "foreigngentleman." I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is becauseI am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's account, thattheir devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seensimilar instances of woman's kindness. I got back here in time for alate dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waitingfor sleep. It is coming.       *       *       *       *       *_11 September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found VanHelsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I hadarrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened itwith much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle ofwhite flowers."These are for you, Miss Lucy," he said."For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!""Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines." HereLucy made a wry face. "Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction orin nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shallpoint out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeingso much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, butyou do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, andhang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like thelotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the watersof Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores soughtfor in the Floridas, and find him all too late."Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smellingthem. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, andhalf-disgust:--"Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,these flowers are only common garlic."To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, hisiron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--"No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake ofothers if not for your own." Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she mightwell be, he went on more gently: "Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fearme. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those socommon flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself thewreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make soinquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that waitfor you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shallhelp me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here."We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor'sactions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeiathat I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched themsecurely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all overthe sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might getin would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbedall over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and roundthe fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, andpresently I said:--"Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, butthis certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or hewould say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.""Perhaps I am!" he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath whichLucy was to wear round her neck.We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when shewas in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round herneck. The last words he said to her were:--"Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, donot to-night open the window or the door.""I promise," said Lucy, "and thank you both a thousand times for allyour kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with suchfriends?"As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--"To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel,much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning earlyyou call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so muchmore strong for my 'spell' which I have work. Ho! ho!"He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nightsbefore and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It musthave been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, butI felt it all the more, like unshed tears.CHAPTER XI_Lucy Westenra's Diary.__12 September._--How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. Hepositively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have beenright, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dreadbeing alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall notmind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that Ihave had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it hasfor me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, nodreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and bringsnothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,and lying like Ophelia in the play, with "virgin crants and maidenstrewments." I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night,everybody._Dr. Seward's Diary.__13 September._--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. TheProfessor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham ateight o'clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all thefresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature'sannual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we metMrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an earlyriser. She greeted us warmly and said:--"You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is stillasleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest Ishould disturb her." The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. Herubbed his hands together, and said:--"Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working," towhich she answered:--"You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy's state thismorning is due in part to me.""How you do mean, ma'am?" asked the Professor."Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went intoher room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming didnot wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of thosehorrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actuallya bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would betoo much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all awayand opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will bepleased with her, I am sure."She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. Asshe had spoken, I watched the Professor's face, and saw it turn ashengrey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor ladywas present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass intoher room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly andforcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. Heraised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beathis palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobsthat seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raisedhis arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. "God! God!God!" he said. "What have we done, what has this poor thing done, thatwe are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from thepagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poormother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does suchthing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, wemust not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we arebeset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!" Suddenly hejumped to his feet. "Come," he said, "come, we must see and act. Devilsor no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight himall the same." He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together wewent up to Lucy's room.Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the sameawful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness andinfinite pity."As I expected," he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his whichmeant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and thenbegan to set out on the little table the instruments for yet anotheroperation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised thenecessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with awarning hand. "No!" he said. "To-day you must operate. I shall provide.You are weakened already." As he spoke he took off his coat and rolledup his shirt-sleeve.Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour tothe ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time Iwatched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she mustnot remove anything from Lucy's room without consulting him; that theflowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odourwas a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the casehimself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and wouldsend me word when to come.After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright andseemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of lifeamongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain._Lucy Westenra's Diary.__17 September._--Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strongagain that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through somelong nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine andfeel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dimhalf-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darknessin which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distressmore poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back tolife as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seemsto have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of mywits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemedso close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where andcommanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed nowwithout any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grownquite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day fromHaarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for aday in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be leftalone. Thank God for mother's sake, and dear Arthur's, and for all ourfriends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, forlast night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I foundhim asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily againstthe window-panes._"The Pall Mall Gazette," 18 September._                           THE ESCAPED WOLF.         PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.         _Interview with the Keeper in the Zoölogical Gardens._After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually usingthe words "Pall Mall Gazette" as a sort of talisman, I managed to findthe keeper of the section of the Zoölogical Gardens in which the wolfdepartment is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages inthe enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down tohis tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of theirhospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be prettycomfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called "business"until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when thetable was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--"Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You'll excoose merefoosin' to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives thewolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea aforeI begins to arsk them questions.""How do you mean, ask them questions?" I queried, wishful to get himinto a talkative humour."'Ittin' of them over the 'ead with a pole is one way; scratchin' oftheir hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orfto their gals. I don't so much mind the fust--the 'ittin' with a poleafore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they've 'ad theirsherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with theear-scratchin'. Mind you," he added philosophically, "there's a deal ofthe same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here's you a-comin' andarskin' of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like thatonly for your bloomin' 'arf-quid I'd 'a' seen you blowed fust 'fore I'danswer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I'd like you toarsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offencedid I tell yer to go to 'ell?""You did.""An' when you said you'd report me for usin' of obscene language thatwas 'ittin' me over the 'ead; but the 'arf-quid made that all right. Iweren't a-goin' to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my 'owlas the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor' love yer 'art, nowthat the old 'ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an' rinsedme out with her bloomin' old teapot, and I've lit hup, you may scratchmy ears for all you're worth, and won't git even a growl out of me.Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin' at, that 'ereescaped wolf.""Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how ithappened; and when I know the facts I'll get you to say what youconsider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair willend.""All right, guv'nor. This 'ere is about the 'ole story. That 'ere wolfwhat we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came fromNorway to Jamrach's, which we bought off him four years ago. He was anice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I'm moresurprised at 'im for wantin' to get out nor any other animile in theplace. But, there, you can't trust wolves no more nor women.""Don't you mind him, sir!" broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. "'E'sgot mindin' the animiles so long that blest if he ain't like a old wolf'isself! But there ain't no 'arm in 'im.""Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin' yesterday when I firsthear my disturbance. I was makin' up a litter in the monkey-house for ayoung puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin' and 'owlin' I kemaway straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin' like a mad thing at thebars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn't much people about thatday, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a 'ooknose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin' through it. Hehad a 'ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,for it seemed as if it was 'im as they was hirritated at. He 'ad whitekid gloves on 'is 'ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:'Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.'"'Maybe it's you,' says I, for I did not like the airs as he give'isself. He didn't git angry, as I 'oped he would, but he smiled a kindof insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. 'Oh no, theywouldn't like me,' 'e says."'Ow yes, they would,' says I, a-imitatin' of him. 'They always likes abone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you 'as abagful.'"Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin' theylay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his earssame as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn't putin his hand and stroke the old wolf's ears too!"'Tyke care,' says I. 'Bersicker is quick.'"'Never mind,' he says. 'I'm used to 'em!'"'Are you in the business yourself?' I says, tyking off my 'at, for aman what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers."'No' says he, 'not exactly in the business, but I 'ave made pets ofseveral.' And with that he lifts his 'at as perlite as a lord, and walksaway. Old Bersicker kep' a-lookin' arter 'im till 'e was out of sight,and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn't come hout the 'olehevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolveshere all began a-'owling. There warn't nothing for them to 'owl at.There warn't no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin' adog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twiceI went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the 'owlingstopped. Just before twelve o'clock I just took a look round aforeturnin' in, an', bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker'scage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. Andthat's all I know for certing.""Did any one else see anything?""One of our gard'ners was a-comin' 'ome about that time from a 'armony,when he sees a big grey dog comin' out through the garding 'edges. Atleast, so he says, but I don't give much for it myself, for if he did 'enever said a word about it to his missis when 'e got 'ome, and it wasonly after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up allnight-a-huntin' of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein'anything. My own belief was that the 'armony 'ad got into his 'ead.""Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of thewolf?""Well, sir," he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, "I think I can;but I don't know as 'ow you'd be satisfied with the theory.""Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals fromexperience, can't hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?""Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that 'erewolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out."From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke Icould see that it had done service before, and that the wholeexplanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn't cope in badinagewith the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,so I said:--"Now, Mr. Bilder, we'll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you've told mewhat you think will happen.""Right y'are, sir," he said briskly. "Ye'll excoose me, I know, fora-chaffin' of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as muchas telling me to go on.""Well, I never!" said the old lady."My opinion is this: that 'ere wolf is a-'idin' of, somewheres. Thegard'ner wot didn't remember said he was a-gallopin' northward fasterthan a horse could go; but I don't believe him, for, yer see, sir,wolves don't gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein' built thatway. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they getsin packs and does be chivyin' somethin' that's more afeared than they isthey can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,Lor' bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half soclever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in'im. This one ain't been used to fightin' or even to providin' forhisself, and more like he's somewhere round the Park a-'idin' an'a-shiverin' of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin' where he is to gethis breakfast from; or maybe he's got down some area and is in acoal-cellar. My eye, won't some cook get a rum start when she sees hisgreen eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can't get food he'sbound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher'sshop in time. If he doesn't, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin' orf witha soldier, leavin' of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then Ishouldn't be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That'sall."I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing upagainst the window, and Mr. Bilder's face doubled its natural lengthwith surprise."God bless me!" he said. "If there ain't old Bersicker come back by'isself!"He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding itseemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks sowell as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; apersonal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder norhis wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animalitself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of allpicture-wolves--Red Riding Hood's quondam friend, whilst moving herconfidence in masquerade.The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. Thewicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all thechildren in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort ofpenitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpineprodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tendersolicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--"There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;didn't I say it all along? Here's his head all cut and full of brokenglass. 'E's been a-gettin' over some bloomin' wall or other. It's ashyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.This 'ere's what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker."He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat thatsatisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of thefatted calf, and went off to report.I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is givento-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo._Dr. Seward's Diary.__17 September._--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up mybooks, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and inrushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I wasthunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accordinto the Superintendent's study is almost unknown. Without an instant'spause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He wastoo quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get mybalance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he wassprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite alittle pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was notintent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When theattendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employmentpositively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor lickingup, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He waseasily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quiteplacidly, simply repeating over and over again: "The blood is the life!The blood is the life!"I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much oflate for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy'sillness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited andweary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summonedme, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do withoutit._Telegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax._(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late bytwenty-two hours.)"_17 September._--Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night. If notwatching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are asplaced; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon aspossible after arrival."_Dr. Seward's Diary.__18 September._--Just off for train to London. The arrival of VanHelsing's telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I knowby bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it ispossible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened? Surelythere is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accidentshould thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder withme, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy's phonograph._Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra.__17 September. Night._--I write this and leave it to be seen, so that noone may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exactrecord of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, andhave barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in thedoing.I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after thatsleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now Iknow so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was inthe next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might havecalled him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to methe old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleepwould try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to bealone, I opened my door and called out: "Is there anybody there?" Therewas no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog's, butmore fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but couldsee nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting itswings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determinednot to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. Shesaid to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--"I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were allright."I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come inand sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she didnot take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a whileand then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I inhers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She wasstartled and a little frightened, and cried out: "What is that?" I triedto pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I couldhear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there wasthe low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was acrash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in theaperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt greywolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sittingposture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongstother things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsinginsisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For asecond or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strangeand horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struckwith lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for amoment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept myeyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a wholemyriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the brokenwindow, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust thattravellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried tostir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother's poor body,which seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased tobeat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recoveredconsciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; thedogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed andstupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of thenightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfortme. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could heartheir bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and theycame in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that layover me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through thebroken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of mydear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after Ihad got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed themto go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flewopen for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then wentin a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dearmother's breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsinghad told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and, besides, I wouldhave some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised thatthe maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I wentto the dining-room to look for them.My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helplesson the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the tablehalf full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on thesideboard, I found that the bottle which mother's doctor uses forher--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am backin the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save forthe sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! Idare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through thebroken window.The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught fromthe window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? Godshield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mothergone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should notsurvive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!CHAPTER XIIDR. SEWARD'S DIARY_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gentlyand rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or hermother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursedthe laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such anhour--for it was now ten o'clock--and so rang and knocked again, butmore impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed onlythe servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was thisdesolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawingtight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, toolate? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours ofdanger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entryanywhere.I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened andlocked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard therapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet. They stopped at thegate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.When he saw me, he gasped out:--"Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did younot get my telegram?"I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got histelegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused andraised his hat as he said solemnly:--"Then I fear we are too late. God's will be done!" With his usualrecuperative energy, he went on: "Come. If there be no way open to getin, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now."We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchenwindow. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, andhanding it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. Iattacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Thenwith a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes andopened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. Therewas no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close athand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found fourservant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in theroom left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked ateach other, and as we moved away he said: "We can attend to them later."Then we ascended to Lucy's room. For an instant or two we paused at thedoor to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With whitefaces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered theroom.How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and hermother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a whitesheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through thebroken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terrorfixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still moredrawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon hermother's bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little woundswhich we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touchingpoor Lucy's breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one wholistens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--"It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!"I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and tasteit, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I foundon the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and Ifancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on anotheroccasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of herhands. He said to me:--"I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make themget heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold asthat beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anythingmore."I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of thewomen. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidentlyaffected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let hersleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back tothem they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern withthem, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one lifewas bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrificeMiss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half cladas they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen andboiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. Wegot a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilstwe were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. Oneof the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Thenshe returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had comewith a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that hemust wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadlyearnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did notunderstand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--"If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fadeaway into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon." He wenton with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning tobe of some effect. Lucy's heart beat a trifle more audibly to thestethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing'sface almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her ina hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--"The first gain is ours! Check to the King!"We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laidher in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticedthat Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She wasstill unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we hadever seen her.Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with herand not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned meout of the room."We must consult as to what is to be done," he said as we descended thestairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, heclosing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, butthe blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette ofdeath which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidlyobserves. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, lightenough for our purposes. Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relievedby a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind aboutsomething, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--"What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must haveanother transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl's lifewon't be worth an hour's purchase. You are exhausted already; I amexhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would havecourage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open hisveins for her?""What's the matter with me, anyhow?"The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones broughtrelief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. VanHelsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and aglad look came into his eyes as I cried out: "Quincey Morris!" andrushed towards him with outstretched hands."What brought you here?" I cried as our hands met."I guess Art is the cause."He handed me a telegram:--"Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.Do not delay.--HOLMWOOD.""I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tellme what to do."Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight inthe eyes as he said:--"A brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is introuble. You're a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work againstus for all he's worth, but God sends us men when we want them."Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heartto go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and ittold on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into herveins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the otheroccasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to seeand hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and VanHelsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and withgood effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watchedwhilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maidsto pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying downafter having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a goodbreakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room whereLucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet ortwo of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and wasthinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a lookof grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.He handed me the paper saying only: "It dropped from Lucy's breast whenwe carried her to the bath."When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pauseasked him: "In God's name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?" I was so bewildered that Idid not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took thepaper, saying:--"Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall knowand understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now whatis it that you came to me to say?" This brought me back to fact, and Iwas all myself again."I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not actproperly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would haveto be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if wehad it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and youknow, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenrahad disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let usfill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to theregistrar and go on to the undertaker.""Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she besad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends thatlove her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one oldman. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all themore for it! Now go."In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling himthat Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was nowgoing on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told himwhere I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--"When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all toourselves?" I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty aboutthe registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up inthe evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see himas soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was stillsleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at herside. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that heexpected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, wherethe blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, orrather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he saidto me:--"Jack Seward, I don't want to shove myself in anywhere where I've noright to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girland wanted to marry her; but, although that's all past and gone, I can'thelp feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that's wrongwith her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can seethat--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a manmust not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this isno common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not thatso?""That's so," I said, and he went on:--"I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I didto-day. Is not that so?""That's so.""And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at hisown place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quicksince I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grassall in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got ather in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, therewasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put abullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me withoutbetraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?" As he spokethe poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspenseregarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terriblemystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His veryheart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was aroyal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. I paused beforeanswering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which theProfessor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessedso much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answeredin the same phrase: "That's so.""And how long has this been going on?""About ten days.""Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creaturethat we all love has had put into her veins within that time the bloodof four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn't hold it." Then,coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: "What took itout?"I shook my head. "That," I said, "is the crux. Van Helsing is simplyfrantic about it, and I am at my wits' end. I can't even hazard a guess.There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown outall our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shallnot occur again. Here we stay until all be well--or ill." Quincey heldout his hand. "Count me in," he said. "You and the Dutchman will tell mewhat to do, and I'll do it."When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy's first movement was to feelin her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsinghad given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it hadcome from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on VanHelsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put herpoor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what thatmeant--that she had realised to the full her mother's death; so we triedwhat we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, butshe was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly fora long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain withher all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fellinto a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep shetook the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing steppedover and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went onwith the action of tearing, as though the material were still in herhands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scatteringthe fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered asif in thought, but he said nothing.       *       *       *       *       *_19 September._--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraidto sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor andI took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a momentunattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knewthat all night long he patrolled round and round the house.When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy'sstrength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the littlenourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times sheslept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, betweensleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although morehaggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the palegums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer andsharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidentlychanged the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dyingone. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.Quincey went off to meet him at the station.When he arrived it was nearly six o'clock, and the sun was setting fulland warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave morecolour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply chokingwith emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, hadgrown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possiblewere shortened. Arthur's presence, however, seemed to act as astimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than shehad done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke ascheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.It was now nearly one o'clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting withher. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am enteringthis on Lucy's phonograph. Until six o'clock they are to try to rest. Ifear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been toogreat; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all._Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._(Unopened by her.)"_17 September._"My dearest Lucy,--"It seems _an age_ since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. Youwill pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all mybudget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrivedat Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he hadan attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where therewere rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. Afterdinner Mr. Hawkins said:--"'My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may everyblessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, withlove and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home herewith me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and inmy will I have left you everything.' I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan andthe old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one."So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both mybedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedralclose, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellowstone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing andcawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner ofrooks--and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things andhousekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now thatJonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about theclients."How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for aday or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on myshoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning toput some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by thelong illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a suddenway and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usualplacidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as thedays go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And nowI have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married,and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear,and is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it,dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interestsyou which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his'respectful duty,' but I do not think that is good enough from thejunior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as youlove me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tensesof the verb, I send you simply his 'love' instead. Good-bye, my dearestLucy, and all blessings on you."Yours,"MINA HARKER."_Report from Patrick Hennessey, M. D., M. R. C. S. L. K. Q. C. P. I.,etc., etc., to John Seward, M. D._"_20 September._"My dear Sir,--"In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions ofeverything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, thereis more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had adreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattendedwith any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier's cart with two menmade a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house towhich, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped atour gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I wasmyself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, andsaw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window ofRenfield's room, the patient began to rate him from within, and calledhim all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed adecent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to "shut up for afoul-mouthed beggar," whereon our man accused him of robbing him andwanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were toswing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up hismind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: 'Lor' blessyer, sir, I wouldn't mind what was said to me in a bloomin' madhouse. Ipity ye and the guv'nor for havin' to live in the house with a wildbeast like that.' Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told himwhere the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threatsand curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I couldmake out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such awell-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind hadever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and mostgenial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but heblandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believethat he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry tosay, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half anhour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through thewindow of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to theattendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intenton some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart whichhad passed before coming down the road, having on it some great woodenboxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in theface, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him thepatient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began toknock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at themoment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The otherfellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of hisheavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, butseized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to andfro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the otherswere both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as webegan to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoaton him, he began to shout: 'I'll frustrate them! They shan't rob me!they shan't murder me by inches! I'll fight for my Lord and Master!' andall sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerabledifficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the paddedroom. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I setit all right; and he is going on well."The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions fordamages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Theirthreats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology forthe defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if ithad not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying andraising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work ofhim. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinarystate of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature oftheir occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of theirlabours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood theirdrift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, andwith each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and sworethat they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure ofmeeting so 'bloomin' good a bloke' as your correspondent. I took theirnames and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are asfollows:--Jack Smollet, of Dudding's Rents, King George's Road, GreatWalworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley's Row, Guide Court, BethnalGreen. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving andShipment Company, Orange Master's Yard, Soho."I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shallwire you at once if there is anything of importance."Believe me, dear Sir,"Yours faithfully,"PATRICK HENNESSEY."_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra_.(Unopened by her.)"_18 September._"My dearest Lucy,--"Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love himthat it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew eitherfather or mother, so that the dear old man's death is a real blow to me.Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow,deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him afortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond thedream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says theamount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. Hebegins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the graveshock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hardthat a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature whichenabled him by our dear, good friend's aid to rise from clerk to masterin a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of itsstrength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles inthe midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one,for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathantries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread comingup to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr.Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with hisfather. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chiefmourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a fewminutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,"Your loving"MINA HARKER."_Dr. Seward's Diary.__20 September._--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entryto-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the worldand all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heardthis moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he hasbeen flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy's motherand Arthur's father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur togo to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told himthat we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must notall break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreedto go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. "Come, my child," he said;"come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and muchmental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. Youmust not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are twosofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy willbe comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if wesleep." Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy'sface, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She layquite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as itshould be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of thewindow-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck, over the silkhandkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet ofthe same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, andher face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Herteeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than theyhad been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, thecanine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sortof dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeledround--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every nowand again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlicflowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and satwatching her.Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be withher now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hithertoso marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment shebecame conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It wascertainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with thestertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when shewaked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making anymistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had manyspells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.At six o'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then falleninto a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy's faceI could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in asharp whisper: "Draw up the blind; I want light!" Then he bent down,and, with his face almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully. Heremoved the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. Ashe did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, "MeinGott!" as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his faceat its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--"She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, markme, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, andlet him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him."I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, butwhen he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shuttershe thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucywas still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both VanHelsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with hishands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shouldersshook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. "Come," Isaid, "my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be bestand easiest for her."When we came into Lucy's room I could see that Van Helsing had, withhis usual forethought, been putting matters straight and makingeverything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy'shair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When wecame into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whisperedsoftly:--"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!" He was stooping tokiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. "No," he whispered, "notyet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more."So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Thengradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit herbreast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child's.And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed inthe night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the palegums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In asort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, whichwere now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,such as I had never heard from her lips:--"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!" Arthur benteagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him bythe neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength whichI never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almostacross the room."Not for your life!" he said; "not for your living soul and hers!" Andhe stood between them like a lion at bay.Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to door say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realisedthe place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm asof rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champedtogether. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, andputting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing's great brownone; drawing it to her, she kissed it. "My true friend," she said, in afaint voice, but with untellable pathos, "My true friend, and his! Oh,guard him, and give me peace!""I swear it!" he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up hishand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and saidto him: "Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on theforehead, and only once."Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.Lucy's eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, tookArthur's arm, and drew him away.And then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and all at once itceased."It is all over," said Van Helsing. "She is dead!"I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where hesat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way thatnearly broke me down to see.I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, andhis face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks hadrecovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost theirdeadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the workingof the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude asmight be.    "We thought her dying whilst she slept,        And sleeping when she died."I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:--"Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!"He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--"Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!"When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:--"We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see."CHAPTER XIIIDR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_.The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy andher mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastlyformalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff wereafflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked tome, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come outfrom the death-chamber:--"She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It's quite a privilege toattend on her. It's not too much to say that she will do credit to ourestablishment!"I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible fromthe disordered state of things in the household. There were no relativesat hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at hisfather's funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have beenbidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it uponourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy'spapers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being aforeigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, andso might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--"I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. Butthis is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided thecoroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--suchas this."As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had beenin Lucy's breast, and which she had torn in her sleep."When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watchhere in the room and in Miss Lucy's old room all night, and I myselfsearch for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go intothe hands of strangers."I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had foundthe name and address of Mrs. Westenra's solicitor and had written tohim. All the poor lady's papers were in order; explicit directionsregarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed theletter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,saying:--"Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is toyou.""Have you got what you looked for?" I asked, to which he replied:--"I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find Ihave, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and adiary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present saynothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, withhis sanction, I shall use some."When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--"And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both youand I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, butfor the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!"Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker hadcertainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small_chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of thewinding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over andturned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tallwax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy'sloveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,instead of leaving traces of "decay's effacing fingers," had butrestored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyesthat I was looking at a corpse.The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, andthere was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: "Remain till Ireturn," and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlicfrom the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, andplaced the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then hetook from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, andplaced it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and wecame away.I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at thedoor, he entered, and at once began to speak:--"To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortemknives.""Must we make an autopsy?" I asked."Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell younow, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take outher heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen withno tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that makethe rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, thatyou loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shalloperate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but forArthur I must not; he will be free after his father's funeral to-morrow,and he will want to see her--to see _it_. Then, when she is coffinedready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shallunscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replaceall, so that none know, save we alone.""But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor bodywithout need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothingto gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to humanknowledge--why do it? Without such it is monstrous."For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinitetenderness:--"Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the morebecause it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burdenthat you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that youshall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasantthings. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yetdid you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am butman; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that yousend for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nayhorrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she wasdying--and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you sawhow she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, soweak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you nothear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!"Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for manyyears trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things sostrange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friendJohn. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that isnot perhaps well. And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or notrust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!" He paused amoment and went on solemnly: "Friend John, there are strange andterrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work toa good end. Will you not have faith in me?"I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood withoutmoving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she hadher back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucylay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so gratefulto those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girlputting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watchalone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor claymight not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....       *       *       *       *       *I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when VanHelsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside andsaid:--"You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.""Why not?" I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatlyimpressed me."Because," he said sternly, "it is too late--or too early. See!" Here heheld up the little golden crucifix. "This was stolen in the night.""How, stolen," I asked in wonder, "since you have it now?""Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from thewoman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surelycome, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thusunknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait."He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, anew puzzle to grapple with.The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genialand very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands allcares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had forsome time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairsin absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certainentailed property of Lucy's father's which now, in default of directissue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he hadtold us so much he went on:--"Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, andpointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter eitherpenniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonialalliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came intocollision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry outher wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We wereright in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we shouldhave proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form ofdisposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of herwishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have comeinto possession of the property, and, even had she only survived hermother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were nowill--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have beentreated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and theinheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their justrights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assureyou, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced."He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in whichhe was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was anobject-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day andsee Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort tous, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostilecriticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o'clock, soa little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so invery truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, andthere was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits atonce. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would beless harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancée_quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity andexerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left themthe night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelingsas we could avoid were saved.Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwartmanhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of hismuch-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedlyattached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was abitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing hewas sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was someconstraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me tobring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as Ifelt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm andled me in, saying huskily:--"You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there wasno friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don't know how tothank you for all you have done for her. I can't think yet...."Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders andlaid his head on my breast, crying:--"Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from meall at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for."I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need muchexpression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over theshoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man'sheart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I saidsoftly to him:--"Come and look at her."Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing herloveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, hefell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. Atlast, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--"Jack, is she really dead?"I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I feltthat such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer thanI could help--that it often happened that after death faces becamesoftened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this wasespecially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolongedsuffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, afterkneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly andlong, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as thecoffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in hisand kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had saidgood-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's mento proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When hecame out of the room again I told him of Arthur's question, and hereplied:--"I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!"We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to makethe best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; butwhen we had lit our cigars he said--"Lord----"; but Arthur interrupted him:--"No, no, not that, for God's sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir:I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is sorecent."The Professor answered very sweetly:--"I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you'Mr.,' and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--asArthur."Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man's warmly."Call me what you will," he said. "I hope I may always have the title ofa friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you foryour goodness to my poor dear." He paused a moment, and went on: "I knowthat she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I wasrude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember"--theProfessor nodded--"you must forgive me."He answered with a grave kindness:--"I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust suchviolence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that youcannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may bemore times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and maynot--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trustshall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand asthough the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me fromfirst to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for herdear sake to whom I swore to protect.""And, indeed, indeed, sir," said Arthur warmly, "I shall in all waystrust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you areJack's friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like."The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about tospeak, and finally said:--"May I ask you something now?""Certainly.""You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?""No, poor dear; I never thought of it.""And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. Iwant you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy's papers andletters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took thembefore we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touchthem--no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keepthem, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep themsafe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them backto you. It's a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, forLucy's sake?"Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--"Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this Iam doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble youwith questions till the time comes."The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--"And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not beall pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too--you most ofall, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before wereach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do ourduty, and all will be well!"I slept on a sofa in Arthur's room that night. Van Helsing did not go tobed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and wasnever out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn withthe wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,a heavy, overpowering smell into the night._Mina Harker's Journal.__22 September._--In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how muchbetween then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away andno news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, apartner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, andJonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask meabout it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand--see whatunexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it upagain with an exercise anyhow....The service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselvesand the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, hisLondon agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, thePresident of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand inhand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....We came back to town quietly, taking a 'bus to Hyde Park Corner.Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, sowe sat down; but there were very few people there, and it wassad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us thinkof the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old daysbefore I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can't go onfor some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without thepedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and hewas my husband, and we didn't know anybody who saw us--and we didn'tcare if they did--so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautifulgirl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano's,when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he saidunder his breath: "My God!" I am always anxious about Jonathan, for Ifear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to himquickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror andhalf in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose andblack moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the prettygirl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us,and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it washard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked allthe whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal's.Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. Ifeared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I askedJonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking thatI knew as much about it as he did: "Do you see who it is?""No, dear," I said; "I don't know him; who is it?" His answer seemed toshock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it wasto me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:--"It is the man himself!"The poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatlyterrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and tosupport him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out ofthe shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then droveoff. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriagemoved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed ahansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--"I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this beso! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!" He wasdistressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on thesubject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew himaway quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a littlefurther, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It wasa hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.After a few minutes' staring at nothing, Jonathan's eyes closed, and hewent quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought itwas the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twentyminutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:--"Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.Come, and we'll have a cup of tea somewhere." He had evidently forgottenall about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all thatthis episode had reminded him of. I don't like this lapsing intoforgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I mustnot ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehowlearn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when Imust open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will,I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--A sad home-coming in every way--the house empty of the dearsoul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slightrelapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever hemay be:--"You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, andthat Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day."Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poorLucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to havelost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear ourtroubles._Dr. Seward's Diary.__22 September._--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and hastaken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believein my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy's death as anyof us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If Americacan go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the worldindeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to hisjourney. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returnsto-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which canonly be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he sayshe has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor oldfellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even hisiron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, puttingsome terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we werestanding beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part inthe operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy's veins; Icould see Van Helsing's face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur wassaying that he felt since then as if they two had been really marriedand that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word ofthe other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey wentaway together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. Themoment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit ofhysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insistedthat it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under veryterrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw downthe blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried,till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a womandoes. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under thecircumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different inmanifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grewgrave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical andforceful and mysterious. He said:--"Ah, you don't comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad,though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. Butno more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he comejust the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at yourdoor and say, 'May I come in?' is not the true laughter. No! he is aking, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose notime of suitability. He say, 'I am here.' Behold, in example I grieve myheart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, thoughI am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my othersufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her verygrave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon hercoffin and say 'Thud! thud!' to my heart, till it send back the bloodfrom my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so ofthe age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with hishair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yetwhen he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make myfather-heart yearn to him as to no other man--not even to you, friendJohn, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet evenat such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear,'Here I am! here I am!' till the blood come dance back and bring some ofthe sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it isa strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, andtroubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to thetune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, andtears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that hemake with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, thathe is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawntight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and,like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strainbecome too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like thesunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on withour labour, what it may be."I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as Idid not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As heanswered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a differenttone:--"Oh, it was the grim irony of it all--this so lovely lady garlanded withflowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if shewere truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonelychurchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the motherwho loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going 'Toll!toll! toll!' so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the whitegarments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the timetheir eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And allfor what? She is dead; so! Is it not?""Well, for the life of me, Professor," I said, "I can't see anything tolaugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzlethan before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poorArt and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking.""Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins hadmade her truly his bride?""Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.""Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, thenwhat about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist,and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church's law, thoughno wits, all gone--even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife,am bigamist.""I don't see where the joke comes in there either!" I said; and I didnot feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laidhis hand on my arm, and said:--"Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to otherswhen it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh;if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do sonow, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him--forhe go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time--maybe you wouldperhaps pity me the most of all."I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why."Because I know!"And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness willsit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of herkin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teemingLondon; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill,and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.So I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever beginanother. If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal withdifferent people and different themes; for here at the end, where theromance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of mylife-work, I say sadly and without hope,                        "FINIS."_"The Westminster Gazette," 25 September._                          A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY.The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with aseries of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of whatwas known to the writers of headlines as "The Kensington Horror," or"The Stabbing Woman," or "The Woman in Black." During the past two orthree days several cases have occurred of young children straying fromhome or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In allthese cases the children were too young to give any properlyintelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excusesis that they had been with a "bloofer lady." It has always been late inthe evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions thechildren have not been found until early in the following morning. It isgenerally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missedgave as his reason for being away that a "bloofer lady" had asked him tocome for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it asoccasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of thelittle ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. Acorrespondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending tobe the "bloofer lady" is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturistsmight, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing thereality and the picture. It is only in accordance with generalprinciples of human nature that the "bloofer lady" should be the popularrôle at these _al fresco_ performances. Our correspondent naïvely saysthat even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some ofthese grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imaginethemselves--to be.There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some ofthe children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have beenslightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might bemade by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importanceindividually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them hasa system or method of its own. The police of the division have beeninstructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especiallywhen very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dogwhich may be about.               _"The Westminster Gazette," 25 September._                            _Extra Special._                         THE HAMPSTEAD HORROR.                         ANOTHER CHILD INJURED.                         _The "Bloofer Lady."_We have just received intelligence that another child, missed lastnight, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at theShooter's Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, lessfrequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in thethroat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, andlooked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the commonstory to tell of being lured away by the "bloofer lady."CHAPTER XIVMINA HARKER'S JOURNAL_23 September_.--Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad thathe has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terriblethings; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with theresponsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself,and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of hisadvancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come uponhim. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunchat home. My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal,and lock myself up in my room and read it...._24 September_.--I hadn't the heart to write last night; that terriblerecord of Jonathan's upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered,whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truthin it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all thoseterrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shallnever know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that manwe saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! Isuppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on sometrain of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on ourwedding-day he said: "Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back tothe bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane." There seems to bethrough it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count wascoming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with histeeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we mustnot shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriterthis very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for othereyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready,poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never lethim be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite getsover the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask himquestions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him._Letter, Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker._"_24 September._(_Confidence_)"Dear Madam,--"I pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far friend as that Isent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra's death. By the kindness ofLord Godalming, I am empowered to read her letters and papers, for I amdeeply concerned about certain matters vitally important. In them I findsome letters from you, which show how great friends you were and how youlove her. Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me. It isfor others' good that I ask--to redress great wrong, and to lift muchand terrible troubles--that may be more great than you can know. May itbe that I see you? You can trust me. I am friend of Dr. John Seward andof Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy). I must keep it privatefor the present from all. I should come to Exeter to see you at once ifyou tell me I am privilege to come, and where and when. I implore yourpardon, madam. I have read your letters to poor Lucy, and know how goodyou are and how your husband suffer; so I pray you, if it may be,enlighten him not, lest it may harm. Again your pardon, and forgive me."VAN HELSING."_Telegram, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing._"_25 September._--Come to-day by quarter-past ten train if you can catchit. Can see you any time you call."WILHELMINA HARKER."MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL._25 September._--I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the timedraws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect thatit will throw some light upon Jonathan's sad experience; and as heattended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all abouther. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and hersleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the realtruth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of myimagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Ofcourse it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and thatawful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgottenin my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told himof her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all aboutit; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he mayunderstand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs.Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it evena negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. VanHelsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety oflate that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.I suppose a cry does us all good at times--clears the air as other raindoes. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, andthen Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole dayand night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I dohope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing willoccur to upset him. It is two o'clock, and the doctor will be here soonnow. I shall say nothing of Jonathan's journal unless he asks me. I amso glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he asksabout Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how itall makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be allpossible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan's journalfirst, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dearJonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this maynot upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be evena consolation and a help to him--terrible though it be and awful in itsconsequences--to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain didnot deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubtwhich haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matterwhich--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, he will be moresatisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be agood man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur's friend and Dr.Seward's, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look afterLucy. I feel from having seen him that he _is_ good and kind and of anoble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan;and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a goodend. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan'sfriend on "The Exeter News" told him that memory was everything in suchwork--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every wordspoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rareinterview; I shall try to record it _verbatim_.It was half-past two o'clock when the knock came. I took my courage _àdeux mains_ and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, andannounced "Dr. Van Helsing."I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight,strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest anda neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poiseof the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; thehead is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face,clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobilemouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitivenostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and themouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almoststraight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are setwidely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man's moods. Hesaid to me:--"Mrs. Harker, is it not?" I bowed assent."That was Miss Mina Murray?" Again I assented."It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dearchild Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come.""Sir," I said, "you could have no better claim on me than that you werea friend and helper of Lucy Westenra." And I held out my hand. He tookit and said tenderly:--"Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must begood, but I had yet to learn----" He finished his speech with a courtlybow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he atonce began:--"I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to beginto inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you werewith her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary--you need not looksurprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was inimitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certainthings to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. Ingreat perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so muchkindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.""I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.""Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not alwaysso with young ladies.""No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to youif you like.""Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour." Icould not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it issome of the taste of the original apple that remains still in ourmouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a gratefulbow, and said:--"May I read it?""If you wish," I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and foran instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed."Oh, you so clever woman!" he said. "I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was aman of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?Alas! I know not the shorthand." By this time my little joke was over,and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from myworkbasket and handed it to him."Forgive me," I said: "I could not help it; but I had been thinking thatit was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might nothave time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time mustbe precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you."He took it and his eyes glistened. "You are so good," he said. "And mayI read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.""By all means," I said, "read it over whilst I order lunch; and then youcan ask me questions whilst we eat." He bowed and settled himself in achair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not bedisturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and downthe room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me andtook me by both hands."Oh, Madam Mina," he said, "how can I say what I owe to you? This paperis as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with somuch light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But thatyou do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you soclever woman. Madam"--he said this very solemnly--"if ever Abraham VanHelsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as afriend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for youand those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights;you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, andyour husband will be blessed in you.""But, doctor, you praise me too much, and--and you do not know me.""Not know you--I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men andwomen; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs tohim and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that youhave so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in everyline. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of yourmarriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tellall their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things thatangels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something ofangels' eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, foryou trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And yourhusband--tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, andis he strong and hearty?" I saw here an opening to ask him aboutJonathan, so I said:--"He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins'sdeath." He interrupted:--"Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters." I wenton:--"I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last hehad a sort of shock.""A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind ofa shock was it?""He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, somethingwhich led to his brain fever." And here the whole thing seemed tooverwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which heexperienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear thathas been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose Iwas hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands tohim, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my handsand raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held myhand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--"My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have nothad much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here bymy friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen suchnobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancingyears--the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come herefull of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what Iam seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make lifehappy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson forthe children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of someuse to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of mystudy and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do _all_ for himthat I can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happyone. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like notwhere he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eatand smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall notspeak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for Iwant to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought Iwill ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me ofhusband Jonathan's trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eatnow; afterwards you shall tell me all."After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:--"And now tell me all about him." When it came to speaking to this greatlearned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, andJonathan a madman--that journal is all so strange--and I hesitated to goon. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and Itrusted him, so I said:--"Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must notlaugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort offever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that Ihave even half believed some very strange things." He reassured me byhis manner as well as his words when he said:--"Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding whichI am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think littleof any one's belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keepan open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could closeit, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things thatmake one doubt if they be mad or sane.""Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off mymind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long,but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble andJonathan's. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all thathappened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself andjudge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tellme what you think.""I promise," he said as I gave him the papers; "I shall in the morning,so soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may.""Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunchwith us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, whichwill leave you at Paddington before eight." He was surprised at myknowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have madeup all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan incase he is in a hurry.So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit herethinking--thinking I don't know what.       *       *       *       *       *_Letter (by hand), Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker._"_25 September, 6 o'clock._"Dear Madam Mina,--"I have read your husband's so wonderful diary. You may sleep withoutdoubt. Strange and terrible as it is, it is _true_! I will pledge mylife on it. It may be worse for others; but for him and you there is nodread. He is a noble fellow; and let me tell you from experience of men,that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to thatroom--ay, and going a second time--is not one to be injured inpermanence by a shock. His brain and his heart are all right; this Iswear, before I have even seen him; so be at rest. I shall have much toask him of other things.

And yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are inthe world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be reallyin London! I fear to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had awire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 to-night fromLaunceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fearto-night. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please cometo breakfast at eight o'clock, if this be not too early for you? You canget away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bringyou to Paddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall take it that,if I do not hear, you will come to breakfast."Believe me,"Your faithful and grateful friend,"MINA HARKER."_Jonathan Harker's Journal.__26 September._--I thought never to write in this diary again, but thetime has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, andwhen we had supped she told me of Van Helsing's visit, and of her havinggiven him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has beenabout me. She showed me in the doctor's letter that all I wrote down wastrue. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to thereality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and inthe dark, and distrustful. But, now that I _know_, I am not afraid, evenof the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in gettingto London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsingis the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like whatMina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and Ishall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over....He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where hewas, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned myface round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:--"But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock." It wasso funny to hear my wife called "Madam Mina" by this kindly,strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:--"I _was_ ill, I _have_ had a shock; but you have cured me already.""And how?""By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everythingtook a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even theevidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not knowwhat to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto beenthe groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrustedmyself. Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything, evenyourself. No, you don't; you couldn't with eyebrows like yours." Heseemed pleased, and laughed as he said:--"So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am withso much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you willpardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife." Iwould listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply noddedand stood silent."She is one of God's women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men andother women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that itslight can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little anegoist--and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical andselfish. And you, sir--I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from theknowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. Youwill give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all ourlives."We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quitechoky."And now," he said, "may I ask you for some more help? I have a greattask to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here.Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on Imay ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do.""Look here, sir," I said, "does what you have to do concern the Count?""It does," he said solemnly."Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, youwill not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers.You can take them with you and read them in the train."After breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting hesaid:--"Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Minatoo.""We shall both come when you will," I said.I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previousnight, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for thetrain to start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed tocatch something in one of them, "The Westminster Gazette"--I knew it bythe colour--and he grew quite white. He read something intently,groaning to himself: "Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!" I do notthink he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, andthe train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out ofthe window and waved his hand, calling out: "Love to Madam Mina; I shallwrite so soon as ever I can."_Dr. Seward's Diary.__26 September._--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a weeksince I said "Finis," and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rathergoing on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause tothink of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane ashe ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he hadjust started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any troubleto me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it Igather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is withhim, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well ofgood spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear thatArthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as tothem all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to mywork with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I mightfairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becomingcicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be theend God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows,too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. Hewent to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he cameback, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o'clock,and thrust last night's "Westminster Gazette" into my hand."What do you think of that?" he asked as he stood back and folded hisarms.I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but hetook it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyedaway at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached apassage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. Anidea struck me, and I looked up. "Well?" he said."It is like poor Lucy's.""And what do you make of it?""Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injuredher has injured them." I did not quite understand his answer:--"That is true indirectly, but not directly.""How do you mean, Professor?" I asked. I was a little inclined to takehis seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedomfrom burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one's spirits--butwhen I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of ourdespair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern."Tell me!" I said. "I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what tothink, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.""Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as towhat poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only byevents, but by me?""Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.""And how the blood lost or waste?" I shook my head. He stepped over andsat down beside me, and went on:--"You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold;but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your earshear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account toyou. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? Butthere are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men'seyes, because they know--or think they know--some things which other menhave told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants toexplain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing toexplain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs,which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretendto be young--like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do notbelieve in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Norin astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor inhypnotism----""Yes," I said. "Charcot has proved that pretty well." He smiled as hewent on: "Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then youunderstand how it act, and can follow the mind of the greatCharcot--alas that he is no more!--into the very soul of the patientthat he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that yousimply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusionbe a blank? No? Then tell me--for I am student of the brain--how youaccept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, myfriend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science whichwould have been deemed unholy by the very men who discoveredelectricity--who would themselves not so long before have been burnedas wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it thatMethuselah lived nine hundred years, and 'Old Parr' one hundred andsixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men's blood in her poorveins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, wecould have save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Doyou know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore thequalities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell mewhy, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider livedfor centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew,till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Canyou tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats thatcome at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry theirveins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hangon the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giantnuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because thatit is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning arefound dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?""Good God, Professor!" I said, starting up. "Do you mean to tell me thatLucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in Londonin the nineteenth century?" He waved his hand for silence, and wenton:--"Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations ofmen; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; andwhy the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there aresome few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men andwomen who cannot die? We all know--because science has vouched for thefact--that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands ofyears, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth ofthe world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to dieand have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and thecorn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then mencome and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indianfakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?" HereI interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mindhis list of nature's eccentricities and possible impossibilities that myimagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching mesome lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; buthe used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object ofthought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet Iwanted to follow him, so I said:--"Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, sothat I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going inmy mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows anidea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumpingfrom one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on withoutknowing where I am going.""That is good image," he said. "Well, I shall tell you. My thesis isthis: I want you to believe.""To believe what?""To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard onceof an American who so defined faith: 'that faculty which enables us tobelieve things which we know to be untrue.' For one, I follow that man.He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit oftruth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railwaytruck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we valuehim; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth inthe universe.""Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure thereceptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I readyour lesson aright?""Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Nowthat you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step tounderstand. You think then that those so small holes in the children'sthroats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?""I suppose so." He stood up and said solemnly:--"Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,far, far worse.""In God's name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?" I cried.He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed hiselbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--"They were made by Miss Lucy!"CHAPTER XVDR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_.For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her lifestruck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said tohim:--"Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?" He raised his head and looked at me, andsomehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. "Would I were!" hesaid. "Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, myfriend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tellyou so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you allmy life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from afearful death? Ah no!""Forgive me," said I. He went on:--"My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do notexpect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstracttruth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have alwaysbelieved the 'no' of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad aconcrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to proveit. Dare you come with me?"This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byronexcepted from the category, jealousy.    "And prove the very truth he most abhorred."He saw my hesitation, and spoke:--"The logic is simple, no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussockto tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yetvery dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that childin the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the paperssay the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you werein class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if hewill not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that wewish to learn. And then----""And then?" He took a key from his pocket and held it up. "And then wespend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This isthe key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give toArthur." My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearfulordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up whatheart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon waspassing....We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, andaltogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from itsthroat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking thesimilarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat. They were smaller,and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what heattributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of someanimal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to thinkthat it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northernheights of London. "Out of so many harmless ones," he said, "there maybe some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Somesailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even fromthe Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bredthere from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days agoa wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For aweek after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on theHeath and in every alley in the place until this 'bloofer lady' scarecame along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Eventhis poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if hemight go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wantedto play with the 'bloofer lady.'""I hope," said Van Helsing, "that when you are sending the child homeyou will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fanciesto stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out anothernight, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you willnot let it away for some days?""Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is nothealed."Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, andthe sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark itwas, he said:--"There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seeksomewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way."We dined at "Jack Straw's Castle" along with a little crowd ofbicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o'clock westarted from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lampsmade the darkness greater when we were once outside their individualradius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for hewent on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as tolocality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till atlast we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horsepolice going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall ofthe churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--forit was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we foundthe Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me toprecede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in thecourtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. Mycompanion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, aftercarefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then hefumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathedwith fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, somedays afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whitesturning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and thebeetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discolouredstone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnishedbrass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of acandle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have beenimagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--wasnot the only thing which could pass away.Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle sothat he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the spermdropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, hemade assurance of Lucy's coffin. Another search in his bag, and he tookout a turnscrew."What are you going to do?" I asked."To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced." Straightway he begantaking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing thecasing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemedto be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to havestripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually tookhold of his hand to stop him. He only said: "You shall see," and againfumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrewthrough the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, hemade a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point ofthe saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. Wedoctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed tosuch things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor neverstopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side ofthe lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking theedge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of thecoffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me tolook.I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, butVan Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,and so emboldened to proceed in his task. "Are you satisfied now, friendJohn?" he asked.I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me asI answered him:--"I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin; but that onlyproves one thing.""And what is that, friend John?""That it is not there.""That is good logic," he said, "so far as it goes. But how do you--howcan you--account for it not being there?""Perhaps a body-snatcher," I suggested. "Some of the undertaker's peoplemay have stolen it." I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it wasthe only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. "Ahwell!" he said, "we must have more proof. Come with me."He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placedthem in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in thebag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door andlocked it. He handed me the key, saying: "Will you keep it? You hadbetter be assured." I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I ambound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. "A key is nothing," I said;"there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lockof that kind." He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then hetold me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch atthe other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his darkfigure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from mysight.It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distantclock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled andunnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errandand with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenlyobservant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I hada dreary, miserable time.Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a whitestreak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyardfarthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from theProfessor's side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then Itoo moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and Istumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off anearly cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scatteredjuniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dimfigure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hiddenby trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard therustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, andcoming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. Whenhe saw me he held it out to me, and said:--"Are you satisfied now?""No," I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive."Do you not see the child?""Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?" Iasked."We shall see," said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our wayout of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump oftrees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat. It waswithout a scratch or scar of any kind."Was I right?" I asked triumphantly."We were just in time," said the Professor thankfully.We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consultedabout it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have togive some account of our movements during the night; at least, we shouldhave had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when weheard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to findit; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell outwell. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavytramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched untilhe saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamationof astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got acab near the "Spaniards," and drove to town.I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours'sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shallgo with him on another expedition.       *       *       *       *       *_27 September._--It was two o'clock before we found a suitableopportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazilyaway, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we sawthe sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe tillmorning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should notwant more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of thereality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out ofplace; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we wereincurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman deadnearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly toopen the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our owneyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and againcourteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome aslast night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshinestreamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed.He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shockof surprise and dismay shot through me.There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before herfuneral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and Icould not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder thanbefore; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom."Is this a juggle?" I said to him."Are you convinced now?" said the Professor in response, and as he spokehe put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back thedead lips and showed the white teeth."See," he went on, "see, they are even sharper than before. With thisand this"--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that belowit--"the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friendJohn?" Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ notaccept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt toargue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--"She may have been placed here since last night.""Indeed? That is so, and by whom?""I do not know. Some one has done it.""And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would notlook so." I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did notseem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nortriumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raisingthe eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips andexamining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--"Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here issome dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampirewhen she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not knowthat, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance couldhe best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance sheis Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually whenthe Un-Dead sleep at home"--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep ofhis arm to designate what to a vampire was "home"--"their face show whatthey are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back tothe nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and soit make hard that I must kill her in her sleep." This turned my bloodcold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing'stheories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in theidea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change inmy face, for he said almost joyously:--"Ah, you believe now?"I answered: "Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing toaccept. How will you do this bloody work?""I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shalldrive a stake through her body." It made me shudder to think of somutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feelingwas not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning toshudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsingcalled it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,or all objective?I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood asif wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with asnap, and said:--"I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If Idid simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what isto be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that arethousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This issimple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to actnow would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have towant Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw thewounds on Lucy's throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child's atthe hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and fullto-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and morebeautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and knowof the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expectArthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when Itook him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven mebecause in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him saygood-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken ideathis woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we havekilled her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, thathave killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yethe never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he willsometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will painthis dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, hewill think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, sinceI know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that hemust pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black tohim; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind ismade up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and seethat all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in thischurchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to theBerkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too,and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later weshall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly andthere dine, for I must be back here before the sun set."So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of thechurchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly._Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed toJohn Seward, M. D._(Not delivered.)"_27 September._"Friend John,--"I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch inthat churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall notleave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.Therefore I shall fix some things she like not--garlic and acrucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead,and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; theymay not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead isdesperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it maybe. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For MissLucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there thatshe is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that allalong he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy's life, andwe lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always thestrength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strengthto Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf andI know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shallfind me; but none other shall--until it be too late. But it may be thathe will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; hishunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where theUn-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch."Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find thisgreat Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stakethrough it, so that the world may rest from him."If it be so, farewell."VAN HELSING."_Dr. Seward's Diary.__28 September._--It is wonderful what a good night's sleep will do forone. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing's monstrousideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages oncommon sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if hismind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be _some_rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible thatthe Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever thatif he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard tosome fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeedit would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that VanHelsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get somelight on the mystery.       *       *       *       *       *_29 September, morning._.... Last night, at a little before ten o'clock,Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing's room; he told us all that hewanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if allour wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we wouldall come with him too, "for," he said, "there is a grave duty to be donethere. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?" This query wasdirectly addressed to Lord Godalming."I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much troublearound my house of late that I could do without any more. I have beencurious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but themore we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myselfthat I'm about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.""Me too," said Quincey Morris laconically."Oh," said the Professor, "then you are nearer the beginning, both ofyou, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he caneven get so far as to begin."It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame ofmind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he saidwith intense gravity:--"I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, Iknow, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you willknow, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise mein the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for atime--I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such maybe--you shall not blame yourselves for anything.""That's frank anyhow," broke in Quincey. "I'll answer for the Professor.I don't quite see his drift, but I swear he's honest; and that's goodenough for me.""I thank you, sir," said Van Helsing proudly. "I have done myself thehonour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dearto me." He held out a hand, which Quincey took.Then Arthur spoke out:--"Dr. Van Helsing, I don't quite like to 'buy a pig in a poke,' as theysay in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentlemanor my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either ofthese two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, Icannot understand what you are driving at.""I accept your limitation," said Van Helsing, "and all I ask of you isthat if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will firstconsider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate yourreservations.""Agreed!" said Arthur; "that is only fair. And now that the_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?""I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard atKingstead."Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--"Where poor Lucy is buried?" The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: "Andwhen there?""To enter the tomb!" Arthur stood up."Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me,I see that you are in earnest." He sat down again, but I could see thathe sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There wassilence until he asked again:--"And when in the tomb?""To open the coffin.""This is too much!" he said, angrily rising again. "I am willing to bepatient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecrationof the grave--of one who----" He fairly choked with indignation. TheProfessor looked pityingly at him."If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend," he said, "God knows Iwould. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, andfor ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!"Arthur looked up with set white face and said:--"Take care, sir, take care!""Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?" said Van Helsing."And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I goon?""That's fair enough," broke in Morris.After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--"Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong toher. But if she be not dead----"Arthur jumped to his feet."Good God!" he cried. "What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; hasshe been buried alive?" He groaned in anguish that not even hope couldsoften."I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go nofurther than to say that she might be Un-Dead.""Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or whatis it?""There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age theymay solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. ButI have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?""Heavens and earth, no!" cried Arthur in a storm of passion. "Not forthe wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you shouldtorture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want tocast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad that speak such things, oram I mad to listen to them? Don't dare to think more of such adesecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have aduty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall doit!"Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, andsaid, gravely and sternly:--"My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a dutyto you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask younow is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if whenlater I make the same request you do not be more eager for itsfulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever itmay seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship's wishes I shallhold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and whereyou will." His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full ofpity:--"But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life ofacts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wringmy heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that ifthe time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look fromyou will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man canto save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself somuch of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own landto do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, andthen to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--Iam ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what yougave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, herlover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nightsand days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her goodeven now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely." Hesaid this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affectedby it. He took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice:--"Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least Ishall go with you and wait."CHAPTER XVIDR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into thechurchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleamsof moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded acrossthe sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightlyin front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I lookedwell at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with sosorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took itthat the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractantto his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a naturalhesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty byentering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur steppedforward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--"You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in thatcoffin?""It was." The Professor turned to the rest saying:--"You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me." Hetook his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthurlooked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he steppedforward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell awayagain, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in andrecoiled.The coffin was empty!For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken byQuincey Morris:--"Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn't asksuch a thing ordinarily--I wouldn't so dishonour you as to imply adoubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.Is this your doing?""I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nortouched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward andI came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, whichwas then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, andsaw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here inday-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?""Yes.""That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I camehere before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited hereall the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probablethat it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Lastnight there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away mygarlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. Butbear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with meoutside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.So"--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--"now to the outside."He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking thedoor behind him.Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror ofthat vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passinggleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing andpassing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man's life; how sweet it wasto breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; howhumanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and tohear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Eachin his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, Icould see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of themystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again tothrow aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions. QuinceyMorris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, andaccepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has tostake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug oftobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in adefinite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked likethin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a whitenapkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, likedough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into themass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thinstrips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and itssetting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew nearalso, as they too were curious. He answered:--"I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.""And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?" asked Quincey."Great Scott! Is this a game?""It is.""What is that which you are using?" This time the question was byArthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--"The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence." It was ananswer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individuallythat in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor's, apurpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it wasimpossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the placesassigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of anyone approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myselfbeen apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sinkwithin me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, oryew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did treeor grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak somysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such awoeful presage through the night.There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from theProfessor a keen "S-s-s-s!" He pointed; and far down the avenue of yewswe saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held somethingdark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray ofmoonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startlingprominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be afair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as achild gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. Wewere starting forward, but the Professor's warning hand, seen by us ashe stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked thewhite figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to seeclearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features ofLucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness wasturned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuouswantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, weall advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of thetomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by theconcentrated light that fell on Lucy's face we could see that the lipswere crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over herchin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that evenVan Helsing's iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I hadnot seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore hershape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat giveswhen taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy's eyes in formand colour; but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead ofthe pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my lovepassed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could havedone it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholylight, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung tothe ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she hadclutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growlsover a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. Therewas a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; whenshe advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fellback and hid his face in his hands.She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,said:--"Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms arehungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!"There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of thetingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of uswho heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed undera spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. Shewas leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held betweenthem his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with asuddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enterthe tomb.When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as ifarrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face wasshown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now noquiver from Van Helsing's iron nerves. Never did I see such baffledmalice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again bymortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throwout sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds ofthe flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely,blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks ofthe Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks couldkill--we saw it at that moment.And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remainedbetween the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means ofentry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--"Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?"Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as heanswered:--"Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror likethis ever any more;" and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and Isimultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear theclick of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming closeto the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacredemblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrifiedamazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporealbody as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the intersticewhere scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense ofrelief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of puttyto the edges of the door.When this was done, he lifted the child and said:"Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is afuneral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. Thefriends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lockthe gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this ofto-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrownight he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will findhim, as on the other night; and then to home." Coming close to Arthur,he said:--"My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you lookback, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitterwaters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, havepassed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mournovermuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me."Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each otheron the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we allslept with more or less reality of sleep.       *       *       *       *       *_29 September, night._--A little before twelve o'clock we three--Arthur,Quincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd tonotice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Ofcourse, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest ofus wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, andstrolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when thegravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the beliefthat every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all toourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him along leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly offair weight.When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out upthe road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed theProfessor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing itbehind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and alsotwo wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their ownends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to workby. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy's coffin we all looked--Arthurtrembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all itsdeath-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing butloathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without hersoul. I could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked. Presentlyhe said to Van Helsing:--"Is this really Lucy's body, or only a demon in her shape?""It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see heras she was, and is."She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder tosee--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like adevilish mockery of Lucy's sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usualmethodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag andplacing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and someplumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit ina corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blueflame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last around wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and aboutthree feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, andwas sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, suchas in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. Tome, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating andbracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey wasto cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept theircourage, and remained silent and quiet.When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--"Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore andexperience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powersof the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change thecurse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after ageadding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all thatdie from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and preyon their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as theripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had metthat kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last nightwhen you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and wouldall time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Thosechildren whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but ifshe live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by herpower over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with thatso wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tinywounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their playsunknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, whenthis now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poorlady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness bynight and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, sheshall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it willbe a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a betterright? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of thenight when sleep is not: 'It was my hand that sent her to the stars; itwas the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she wouldherself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?' Tell me if there besuch a one amongst us?"We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinitekindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restoreLucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward andsaid bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale assnow:--"My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell mewhat I am to do, and I shall not falter!" Van Helsing laid a hand on hisshoulder, and said:--"Brave lad! A moment's courage, and it is done. This stake must bedriven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived inthat--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice morethan your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as thoughyou tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Onlythink that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray foryou all the time.""Go on," said Arthur hoarsely. "Tell me what I am to do.""Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over theheart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer forthe dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shallfollow--strike in God's name, that so all may be well with the dead thatwe love and that the Un-Dead pass away."Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set onaction his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing openedhis missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as wecould. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I couldsee its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screechcame from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twistedin wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till thelips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthurnever faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling armrose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilstthe blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. Hisface was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of itgave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the littlevault.And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and theteeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. Theterrible task was over.The hammer fell from Arthur's hand. He reeled and would have fallen hadwe not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strainon him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than humanconsiderations he could never have gone through with it. For a fewminutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards thecoffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from oneto the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he hadbeen seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom ofhorror that lay upon it.There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreadedand grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as aprivilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her inher life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True thatthere were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care andpain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truthto what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay likesunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token andsymbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said tohim:--"And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?"The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man's handin his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--"Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,and me peace." He put his hands on the Professor's shoulder, and layinghis head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stoodunmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--"And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, asshe would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinningdevil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she isthe devil's Un-Dead. She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!"Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of thetomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the pointof it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth withgarlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor lockedthe door he gave the key to Arthur.Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and itseemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There wasgladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselveson one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--"Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowingto ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the authorof all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we canfollow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger init, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, allof us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And dowe not promise to go on to the bitter end?"Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said theProfessor as we moved off:--"Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven ofthe clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that youknow not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plansunfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consultabout, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shallreturn to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first Ishall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is aterrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare wemust not draw back."CHAPTER XVIIDR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegramwaiting for him:--     "Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.--MINA     HARKER."The Professor was delighted. "Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina," he said,"pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to yourhouse, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her _enroute_, so that she may be prepared."When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me ofa diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewrittencopy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker's diary at Whitby. "Take these," hesaid, "and study them well. When I have returned you will be master ofall the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keepthem safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all yourfaith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. Whatis here told," he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet ofpapers as he spoke, "may be the beginning of the end to you and me andmany another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk theearth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add inany way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You havekept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then weshall go through all these together when we meet." He then made readyfor his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. Itook my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes beforethe train came in.The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrivalplatforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss myguest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,after a quick glance, said: "Dr. Seward, is it not?""And you are Mrs. Harker!" I answered at once; whereupon she held outher hand."I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----" She stoppedsuddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for itwas a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included atypewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I hadsent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroomprepared at once for Mrs. Harker.In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was alunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudderwhen we entered.She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, asshe had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonographdiary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking atthe papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open beforeme. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have anopportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, orwhat a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Hereshe is!_Mina Harker's Journal.__29 September._--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward'sstudy. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talkingwith some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked atthe door, and on his calling out, "Come in," I entered.To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from thedescription to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was muchinterested."I hope I did not keep you waiting," I said; "but I stayed at the dooras I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.""Oh," he replied with a smile, "I was only entering my diary.""Your diary?" I asked him in surprise."Yes," he answered. "I keep it in this." As he spoke he laid his hand onthe phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--"Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?""Certainly," he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in trainfor speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face."The fact is," he began awkwardly, "I only keep my diary in it; and asit is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--thatis, I mean----" He stopped, and I tried to help him out of hisembarrassment:--"You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, verydear to me."To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--"Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!""Why not?" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.At length he stammered out:--"You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of thediary." Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he saidwith unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naïvetéof a child: "That's quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!" I couldnot but smile, at which he grimaced. "I gave myself away that time!" hesaid. "But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for monthspast, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particularpart of it in case I wanted to look it up?" By this time my mind wasmade up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might havesomething to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, andI said boldly:--"Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on mytypewriter." He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:--"No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn't let you know that terriblestory!"Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something orsome opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting onthe table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning."You do not know me," I said. "When you have read those papers--my owndiary and my husband's also, which I have typed--you will know mebetter. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart inthis cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and I must notexpect you to trust me so far."He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right abouthim. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged inorder a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, andsaid:--"You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you longago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I makethe only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them--thefirst half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrifyyou; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In themeantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be betterable to understand certain things." He carried the phonograph himself upto my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn somethingpleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true loveepisode of which I know one side already...._Dr. Seward's Diary.__29 September._--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of JonathanHarker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on withoutthinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announcedinner, so I said: "She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour," andI went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker's diary, whenshe came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes wereflushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have hadcause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; andnow the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, wentstraight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:--"I greatly fear I have distressed you.""Oh, no, not distressed me," she replied, "but I have been more touchedthan I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it iscruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear themspoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out thewords on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, asI did.""No one need ever know, shall ever know," I said in a low voice. Shelaid her hand on mine and said very gravely:--"Ah, but they must!""Must! But why?" I asked."Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy'sdeath and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we havebefore us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have allthe knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that thecylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know;but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this darkmystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certainpoint; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September,how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wroughtout. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor VanHelsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and hewill be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us;working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger thanif some of us were in the dark." She looked at me so appealingly, and atthe same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing,that I gave in at once to her wishes. "You shall," I said, "do as youlike in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terriblethings yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road topoor Lucy's death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in thedark. Nay, the end--the very end--may give you a gleam of peace. Come,there is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us;we have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learnthe rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask--if there be anythingwhich you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who werepresent."_Mina Harker's Journal.__29 September._--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. Hebrought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. Heplaced me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that Icould touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in caseI should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with hisback to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. Iput the forked metal to my ears and listened.When the terrible story of Lucy's death, and--and all that followed, wasdone, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of afainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with ahorrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from acupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restoredme. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through allthe multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucywas at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it withoutmaking a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if Ihad not known Jonathan's experience in Transylvania I could not havebelieved. As it was, I didn't know what to believe, and so got out of mydifficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off mytypewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:--"Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsingwhen he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here whenhe arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every itemput in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me thatLord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell himwhen they come." He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and Ibegan to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I usedmanifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done withall the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went abouthis work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished hecame back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonelywhilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full ofgood men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him Iremembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor'sperturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station atExeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed thefiles of "The Westminster Gazette" and "The Pall Mall Gazette," and tookthem to my room. I remember how much "The Dailygraph" and "The WhitbyGazette," of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand theterrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall lookthrough the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some newlight. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet._Dr. Seward's Diary.__30 September._--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o'clock. He had got hiswife's wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one canjudge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true--andjudging by one's own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also a manof great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was aremarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I wasprepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,business-like gentleman who came here to-day.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. Theyare hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together inchronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has gotthe letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and thecarriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife'stypescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here itis....     Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be     the Count's hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues     from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters     relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh,     if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!     Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again     collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be     able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the     meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of     index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,     but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing     that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have     found the dates otherwise....     I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands     folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any     one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of     subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own     accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my     knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite     confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I     not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of     his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a     brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All     those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the     Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that     his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph?     Stay; he is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings outside the     chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of "master." This     all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came     away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it     safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,     and then--! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so     I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to     have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need._Jonathan Harker's Journal.__29 September, in train to London._--When I received Mr. Billington'scourteous message that he would give me any information in his power Ithought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, suchinquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargoof the Count's to its place in London. Later, we may be able to dealwith it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, andbrought me to his father's house, where they had decided that I muststay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They allknew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington hadready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I hadseen on the Count's table before I knew of his diabolical plans.Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically andwith precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle whichmight be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carriedout. To use an Americanism, he had "taken no chances," and the absoluteaccuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply thelogical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:"Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes."Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both ofthese I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington couldgive me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customsofficers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of thestrange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in localtradition; but no one could add to the simple description "Fifty casesof common earth." I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me incommunication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Theirtally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except thatthe boxes were "main and mortal heavy," and that shifting them was drywork. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn't anygentleman "such-like as yourself, squire," to show some sort ofappreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a riderthat the thirst then generated was such that even the time which hadelapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took carebefore leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source ofreproach.       *       *       *       *       *_30 September._--The station-master was good enough to give me a line tohis old companion the station-master at King's Cross, so that when Iarrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival ofthe boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the properofficials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the originalinvoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been herelimited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I wascompelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.From thence I went on to Carter Paterson's central office, where I metwith the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in theirday-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King's Crossoffice for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teamingwere waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sendingalso by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with thedelivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeingexactly; the carriers' men were able to supplement the paucity of thewritten words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connectedalmost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequentthirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity,through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at alater period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--"That 'ere 'ouse, guv'nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but itain't been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick inthe place that you might have slep' on it without 'urtin' of yer bones;an' the place was that neglected that yer might 'ave smelled oleJerusalem in it. But the ole chapel--that took the cike, that did! Meand my mate, we thort we wouldn't never git out quick enough. Lor', Iwouldn't take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark."Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew whatI know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.Of one thing I am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived atWhitby from Varna in the _Demeter_ were safely deposited in the oldchapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any havesince been removed--as from Dr. Seward's diary I fear.I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax whenRenfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a gooddeal.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papersinto order._Mina Harker's Journal__30 September._--I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself.It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had:that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might actdetrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave aface as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has,however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, neverso full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, goodProfessor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves understrain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life andhope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. Ifeel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity anything so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is nothuman--not even beast. To read Dr. Seward's account of poor Lucy'sdeath, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity inone's heart.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than weexpected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan withhim, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for itbrought back all poor dear Lucy's hopes of only a few months ago. Ofcourse they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. VanHelsing, too, has been quite "blowing my trumpet," as Mr. Morrisexpressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know allabout the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what tosay or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so theyhad to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, andcame to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to postthem in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward's diary thatthey had been at Lucy's death--her real death--and that I need not fearto betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as Icould, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husbandand I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming gothis and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--"Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?"I nodded, and he went on:--"I don't quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good andkind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that allI can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I havehad one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humbleto the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--"Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hearthe tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laida hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of theroom. I suppose there is something in woman's nature that makes a manfree to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender oremotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for whenLord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa andgave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. Ihope he didn't think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of itafterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I_know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for Icould see that his heart was breaking:--"I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were toher. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not letme be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you havehad, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity canhelp in your affliction, won't you let me be of some little service--forLucy's sake?"In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemedto me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found avent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beathis palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then satdown again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinitepity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid hishead on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook withemotion.We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise abovesmaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this bigsorrowing man's head resting on me, as though it were that of the babythat some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though hewere my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with anapology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that fordays and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had beenunable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time ofsorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or withwhom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow wassurrounded, he could speak freely. "I know now how I suffered," he said,as he dried his eyes, "but I do not know even yet--and none other canever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shallknow better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungratefulnow, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me belike a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy's sake?""For dear Lucy's sake," I said as we clasped hands. "Ay, and for yourown sake," he added, "for if a man's esteem and gratitude are ever worththe winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bringto you a time when you need a man's help, believe me, you will not callin vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break thesunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that youwill let me know." He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, thatI felt it would comfort him, so I said:--"I promise."As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.He turned as he heard my footsteps. "How is Art?" he said. Then noticingmy red eyes, he went on: "Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poorold fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is introuble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him."He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw themanuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realisehow much I knew; so I said to him:--"I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let mebe your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? Youwill know, later on, why I speak." He saw that I was in earnest, andstooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemedbut poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively Ibent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was amomentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--"Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so longas ever you live!" Then he went into the study to his friend."Little girl!"--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but heproved himself a friend!CHAPTER XVIIIDR. SEWARD'S DIARY_30 September._--I got home at five o'clock, and found that Godalmingand Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcriptof the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wifehad made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to thecarriers' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gaveus a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since Ihave lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we hadfinished, Mrs. Harker said:--"Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diaryinterests me so much!" She looked so appealing and so pretty that Icould not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; soI took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that alady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: "Why?""She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it," Ianswered. "Oh, very well," he said; "let her come in, by all means; butjust wait a minute till I tidy up the place." His method of tidying waspeculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxesbefore I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or wasjealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgustingtask, he said cheerfully: "Let the lady come in," and sat down on theedge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so thathe could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he mighthave some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been justbefore he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where Icould seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. Shecame into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once commandthe respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities madpeople most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, andheld out her hand."Good-evening, Mr. Renfield," said she. "You see, I know you, for Dr.Seward has told me of you." He made no immediate reply, but eyed her allover intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to oneof wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, hesaid:--"You're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can't be,you know, for she's dead." Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--"Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I eversaw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.""Then what are you doing here?""My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.""Then don't stay.""But why not?" I thought that this style of conversation might not bepleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--"How did you know I wanted to marry any one?" His reply was simplycontemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--"What an asinine question!""I don't see that at all, Mr. Renfield," said Mrs. Harker, at oncechampioning me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect ashe had shown contempt to me:--"You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is soloved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is ofinterest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by hishousehold and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some ofthem hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes andeffects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, Icannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmateslean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_." Ipositively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own petlunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever metwith--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polishedgentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker's presence which had touchedsome chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in anyway due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift orpower.We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seeminglyquite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as shebegan, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, forhe addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of thecompletest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentionedcertain things."Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my beingput under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive andperpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, nomatter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolonglife. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried totake human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion Itried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers bythe assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of hisblood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood isthe life.' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum hasvulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn't that true,doctor?" I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what toeither think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat uphis spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, Isaw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after sayingpleasantly to Mr. Renfield: "Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,under auspices pleasanter to yourself," to which, to my astonishment, hereplied:--"Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.May He bless and keep you!"When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behindme. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first tookill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been formany a long day.Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of aboy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--"Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I comehere to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I havemuch to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? AndArthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!"As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my owndiary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion; atwhich the Professor interrupted me:--"Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man's brain--a brain that a manshould have were he much gifted--and a woman's heart. The good Godfashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so goodcombination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of helpto us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terribleaffair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men aredetermined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it isno part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail herin so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both inwaking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things tothink of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then shemust consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, andwe go alone." I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what wehad found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought wasthe very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemedto come on him. "Oh that we had known it before!" he said, "for then wemight have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, 'the milkthat is spilt cries not out afterwards,' as you say. We shall not thinkof that, but go on our way to the end." Then he fell into a silence thatlasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare fordinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--"I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband haveput up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.""Not up to this moment, Professor," she said impulsively, "but up tothis morning.""But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all thelittle things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one whohas told is the worse for it."Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, shesaid:--"Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. Itis my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down atpresent everything, however trivial; but there is little in this exceptwhat is personal. Must it go in?" The Professor read it over gravely,and handed it back, saying:--"It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It canbut make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, morehonour you--as well as more esteem and love." She took it back withanother blush and a bright smile.And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are completeand in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o'clock. The rest of ushave already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall allbe informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with thisterrible and mysterious enemy._Mina Harker's Journal.__30 September._--When we met in Dr. Seward's study two hours afterdinner, which had been at six o'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort ofboard or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, towhich Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sitnext to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan satnext to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.Morris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in thecentre. The Professor said:--"I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the factsthat are in these papers." We all expressed assent, and he went on:--"Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind ofenemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to yousomething of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measureaccording."There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that theyexist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, theteachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sanepeoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not thatthrough long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could nothave believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. 'See! see!I prove; I prove.' Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay,had I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many ofus who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that otherpoor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The _nosferatu_ do not dielike the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and beingstronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which isamongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is ofcunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he havestill the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, thedivination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to arefor him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil incallous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appearat will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; hecan, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, thethunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, andthe bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and becomesmall; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we tobegin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and havingfound it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terribletask that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the braveshudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and thenwhere end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is notmere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforwardbecome foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us forever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God'ssunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are faceto face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, hissong of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others areyoung. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. Whatsay you?"Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh somuch, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when Isaw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--sostrong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man's hand can speak foritself; it does not even need a woman's love to hear its music.When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and Iin his; there was no need for speaking between us."I answer for Mina and myself," he said."Count me in, Professor," said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual."I am with you," said Lord Godalming, "for Lucy's sake, if for no otherreason."Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying hisgolden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I tookhis right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right withhis left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands oursolemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not evenoccur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsingwent on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious workhad begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,as any other transaction of life:--"Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are notwithout strength. We have on our side power of combination--a powerdenied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free toact and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we arefree to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end toachieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much."Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us arerestrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider thelimitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular."All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do notat the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nayof more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in thefirst place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--andsecondly, because, after all, these things--tradition andsuperstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest forothers--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us wouldhave received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a beliefthat we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that thevampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for themoment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywherethat men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germanyall over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, sofar from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him atthis day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, thedevil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, wehave all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of thebeliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappyexperience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of thetime; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of theliving. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even growyounger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as thoughthey refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But hecannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friendJonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as againJonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness againJonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help himfrom the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gatherfrom the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be asbat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend Johnsaw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him atthe window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that nobleship's captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distancehe can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. Hecome on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw thosesisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves sawMiss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at thetomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything orinto anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up withfire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this,in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear methrough. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is evenmore prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obeysome of nature's laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at thefirst, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as doesthat of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain timescan he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he isbound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof byinference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when hehave his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the placeunhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide atWhitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It issaid, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the floodof the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has nopower, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as thissymbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, tothem he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off andsilent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on hiscoffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into thecoffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake throughhim, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.We have seen it with our eyes."Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confinehim to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he isclever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, tomake his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what hehas been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won hisname against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier ofTurkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the mostcunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond theforest.' That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to hisgrave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, saysArminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions whowere held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. Theylearned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over LakeHermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In therecords are such words as 'stregoica'--witch, 'ordog,' and'pokol'--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula isspoken of as 'wampyr,' which we all understand too well. There have beenfrom the loins of this very one great men and good women, and theirgraves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For itis not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep inall good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest."Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a littlepause, and then the Professor went on:--"And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we mustproceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathanthat from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of whichwere delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxeshave been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be toascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wallwhere we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If thelatter, we must trace----"Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house camethe sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with abullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck thefar wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shriekedout. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to thewindow and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris's voicewithout:--"Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you aboutit." A minute later he came in and said:--"It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. Butthe fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big batand sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damnedbrutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out tohave a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I haveseen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.""Did you hit it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing."I don't know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood." Withoutsaying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume hisstatement:--"We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we musteither capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so tospeak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours ofnoon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak."And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, youno more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are menand are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and weshall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as weare."All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to megood that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen theirsafety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but theirminds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.Mr. Morris resumed the discussion:--"As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house rightnow. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may saveanother victim."I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came soclose, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if Iappeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leaveme out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,with means to get into the house.Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman cansleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretendto sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns._Dr. Seward's Diary.__1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, anurgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would seehim at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in themorning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--"He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don'tknow but what, if you don't see him soon, he will have one of hisviolent fits." I knew the man would not have said this without somecause, so I said: "All right; I'll go now"; and I asked the others towait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my "patient.""Take me with you, friend John," said the Professor. "His case in yourdiary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind isdisturbed.""May I come also?" asked Lord Godalming."Me too?" said Quincey Morris. "May I come?" said Harker. I nodded, andwe all went down the passage together.We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far morerational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was anunusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had evermet with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons wouldprevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, butnone of the others at first said anything. His request was that I wouldat once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed upwith arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his ownexisting sanity. "I appeal to your friends," he said, "they will,perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you havenot introduced me." I was so much astonished, that the oddness ofintroducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,besides, there was a certain dignity in the man's manner, so much ofthe habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: "LordGodalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.Renfield." He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--"Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at theWindham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is nomore. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in hisyouth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, muchpatronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your greatstate. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may havefar-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may holdalliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove avast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its trueplace as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure atmeeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms ofconventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeuticsby his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him toone of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or bythe possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respectiveplaces in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as atleast the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist aswell as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one tobe considered as under exceptional circumstances." He made this lastappeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its owncharm.I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under theconviction, despite my knowledge of the man's character and history,that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse totell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about thenecessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought itbetter to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of oldI knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appearedto be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with himin the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction ofmeeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he saidquickly:--"But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire togo at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Timepresses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is ofthe essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to putbefore so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet somomentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment." He looked at me keenly, andseeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinisedthem closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--"Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?""You have," I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--"Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask forthis concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implorein such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. Iam not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, Iassure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound andunselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments whichanimate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest ofyour friends." Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growingconviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method wasbut yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to lethim go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, likeall lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing athim with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meetingwith the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tonewhich did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of itafterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--"Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be freeto-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, theprivilege you seek." He shook his head sadly, and with a look ofpoignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--"Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in thehighest degree, since you seek to impress us with your completereasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, sinceyou are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. Ifyou will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how canwe perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and helpus; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish." He still shookhis head as he said:--"Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, andif I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not myown master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I amrefused, the responsibility does not rest with me." I thought it was nowtime to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I wenttowards the door, simply saying:--"Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night."As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. Hemoved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he wasabout to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, weregroundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made hispetition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of hisemotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our oldrelations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little morefixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that hisefforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the sameconstantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request ofwhich at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when hewanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the samesullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got intoquite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held uphis hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth atorrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and hiswhole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--"Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me outof this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in astrait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me goout of this. You don't know what you do by keeping me here. I amspeaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don't knowwhom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.By all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that islost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me outof this and save my soul from guilt! Can't you hear me, man? Can't youunderstand? Will you never learn? Don't you know that I am sane andearnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fightingfor his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!"I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and sowould bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up."Come," I said sternly, "no more of this; we have had quite enoughalready. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly."He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of thebed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I hadexpected.When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in aquiet, well-bred voice:--"You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, lateron, that I did what I could to convince you to-night."CHAPTER XIXJONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL_1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easymind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I amso glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business atall; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy andbrains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a waythat every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, andthat she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all alittle upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from hisroom we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris saidto Dr. Seward:--"Say, Jack, if that man wasn't attempting a bluff, he is about thesanest lunatic I ever saw. I'm not sure, but I believe that he had someserious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get achance." Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--"Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I'm glad of it,for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that lasthysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and inour present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.All is best as they are." Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in adreamy kind of way:--"I don't know but that I agree with you. If that man had been anordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but heseems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I amafraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can't forget howhe prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear mythroat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count 'lord andmaster,' and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to helphim, so I suppose he isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic. Hecertainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what isbest. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,help to unnerve a man." The Professor stepped over, and laying his handon his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--"Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sadand terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we tohope for, except the pity of the good God?" Lord Godalming had slippedaway for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silverwhistle, as he remarked:--"That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I've got an antidote oncall." Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking careto keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shoneout. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took outa lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into fourlittle groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--"My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms ofmany kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has thestrength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes areof the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are notamenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strongin all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt himas we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from histouch. Keep this near your heart"--as he spoke he lifted a little silvercrucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--"put theseflowers round your neck"--here he handed to me a wreath of witheredgarlic blossoms--"for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and thisknife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you canfasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,which we must not desecrate needless." This was a portion of SacredWafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the otherswas similarly equipped. "Now," he said, "friend John, where are theskeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break houseby the window, as before at Miss Lucy's."Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as asurgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; aftera little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rustyclang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, andit slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me inDr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb; I fancy thatthe same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord theyshrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and steppedinto the open door."_In manus tuas, Domine!_" he said, crossing himself as he passed overthe threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should havelit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. TheProfessor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open itfrom within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit ourlamps and proceeded on our search.The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as therays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw greatshadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that therewas some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, sopowerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terribleexperience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at everysound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inchesdeep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding downmy lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. Thewalls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses ofspider's webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like oldtattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in thehall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. Theyhad been used several times, for on the table were several similar rentsin the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professorlifted them. He turned to me and said:--"You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you knowit at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?" I had anidea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able toget admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turningsfound myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands."This is the spot," said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a smallmap of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondenceregarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on thebunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, foras we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhalethrough the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as weencountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at closequarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage ofhis existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, ina ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small andclose, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There wasan earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the foulerair. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was notalone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with thepungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption hadbecome itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breathexhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place andintensified its loathsomeness.Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought ourenterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high andterrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which roseabove merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinkingconsequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about ourwork as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as webegan:--"The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must thenexamine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get someclue as to what has become of the rest." A glance was sufficient to showhow many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there wasno mistaking them.There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulteddoor into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant myheart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed tosee the high lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose, thered eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,as Lord Godalming said, "I thought I saw a face, but it was only theshadows," and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as therewere no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solidwalls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. Itook it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, whichhe was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, forundoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole massof phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drewback. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who wasseemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the greatiron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew thehuge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silverwhistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answeredfrom behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of dogs, and after about aminute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved Inoticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had beentaken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that hadelapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed toswarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on theirmoving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place looklike a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at thethreshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously liftingtheir noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats weremultiplying in thousands, and we moved out.Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed himon the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed torecover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled beforehim so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the otherdogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small preyere the whole mass had vanished.With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, forthe dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts attheir prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them inthe air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening ofthe chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselvesin the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed toslip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost somethingof its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in ourresolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, andbringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We foundnothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and alluntouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even whenwe returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had beenrabbit-hunting in a summer wood.The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, andlocked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocketwhen he had done."So far," he said, "our night has been eminently successful. No harm hascome to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained howmany boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, ourfirst--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has beenaccomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina ortroubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds andsmells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we havelearned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brutebeasts which are to the Count's command are yet themselves not amenableto his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to hiscall, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going andto that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mellfrom the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other mattersbefore us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not usedhis power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunityto cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for thestake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,and we have reason to be content with our first night's work. It may beordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink."The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature whowas screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning soundfrom Renfield's room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing sosoftly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler thanusual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am trulythankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of ourdeliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did notthink so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it issettled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yetto conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once shesuspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be asealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that allis finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. Idaresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after suchconfidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keepdark over to-night's doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything thathas happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.       *       *       *       *       *_1 October, later._--I suppose it was natural that we should have alloverslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had norest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slepttill the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two orthree times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for afew seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort ofblank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. Shecomplained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in theday. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it bethat several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to tracethem all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and thesooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up ThomasSnelling to-day._Dr. Seward's Diary.__1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professorwalking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and itis quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of thebrooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of thenight he suddenly said:--"Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit himthis morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it maybe. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,and reason so sound." I had some work to do which pressed, so I told himthat if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have tokeep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessaryinstructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him againstgetting any false impression from my patient. "But," he answered, "Iwant him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming livethings. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, thathe had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?""Excuse me," I said, "but the answer is here." I laid my hand on thetype-written matter. "When our sane and learned lunatic made that verystatement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actuallynauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.Harker entered the room." Van Helsing smiled in turn. "Good!" he said."Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet itis this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental diseasesuch a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of thefolly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.Who knows?" I went on with my work, and before long was through that inhand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there wasVan Helsing back in the study. "Do I interrupt?" he asked politely as hestood at the door."Not at all," I answered. "Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.I can go with you now, if you like."It is needless; I have seen him!""Well?""I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short.When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, withhis elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullendiscontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such ameasure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. "Don'tyou know me?" I asked. His answer was not reassuring: "I know you wellenough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourselfand your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headedDutchmen!" Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacablesullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room atall. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this soclever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a fewhappy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it doesrejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to beworried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, itis better so.""I agree with you with all my heart," I answered earnestly, for I didnot want him to weaken in this matter. "Mrs. Harker is better out of it.Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who havebeen in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in timeinfallibly have wrecked her."So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quinceyand Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. Ishall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night._Mina Harker's Journal.__1 October._--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day;after Jonathan's full confidence for so many years, to see himmanifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. Thismorning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and thoughJonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he wentout, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word ofwhat had happened in the visit to the Count's house. And yet he musthave known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose itmust have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed thatit was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, andI acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I amcrying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband's greatlove and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; andlest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I keptanything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he hasfeared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of myheart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad andlow-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terribleexcitement.Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they toldme to. I didn't feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. Ikept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came tosee me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fatepressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one doesseems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing whichis most to be deplored. If I hadn't gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dearLucy would be with us now. She hadn't taken to visiting the churchyardtill I came, and if she hadn't come there in the day-time with me shewouldn't have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn't gone there atnight and asleep, that monster couldn't have destroyed her as he did.Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder whathas come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knewthat I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on myown account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dearfellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I dofeel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessonsthat we poor women have to learn....I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearingthe sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like prayingon a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhereunder this. And then there was silence over everything, silence soprofound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlightseeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to bestirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thinstreak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slownessacross the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and avitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts musthave done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargycreeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got outand looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was nowclose up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against thewall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man wasmore loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty onhis part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that theattendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept intobed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must havefallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until themorning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and alittle time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who wasbending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical ofthe way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. Iwas very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and myhands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at theusual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawnupon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back theclothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dimaround. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidentlygrown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that Ihad shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out tomake certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain mylimbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closedmy eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful whattricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) Themist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for Icould see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boilingwater--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings ofthe door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it becameconcentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the topof which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Thingsbegan to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was nowwhirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words "apillar of cloud by day and of fire by night." Was it indeed some suchspiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar wascomposed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in thered eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as Ilooked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog liketwo red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wanderingwhen, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary'sChurch. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathanhad seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mistin the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all becameblack darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was toshow me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must becareful of such dreams, for they would unseat one's reason if there weretoo much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribesomething for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarmthem. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into theirfears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I donot, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; thatcannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night's sleep. Lastnight tired me more than if I had not slept at all.       *       *       *       *       *_2 October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must haveslept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but thesleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak andspiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he wasvery gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God blessme. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. Thisis a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would bemiserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out tilldinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brightenthem up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot howtired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoketogether, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each otherof what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan'smanner that he had something important to communicate. I was not sosleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward togive me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the nightbefore. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave tome, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... Ihave taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hopeI have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fearcomes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of thepower of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.CHAPTER XXJONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL_1 October, evening._--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at BethnalGreen, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. Thevery prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him hadproved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. Ilearned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that hewas only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was theresponsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. JosephSmollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of asaucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliabletype of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered allabout the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog's-earednotebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about theseat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. Therewere, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which hedeposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant toscatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places werechosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute morefully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think thathe could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was nowfixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southernshore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant tobe left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and thevery heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went backto Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes hadbeen taken from Carfax.He replied:--"Well, guv'nor, you've treated me wery 'an'some"--I had given him half asovereign--"an' I'll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name ofBloxam say four nights ago in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley,as 'ow he an' his mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse atPurfect. There ain't a-many such jobs as this 'ere, an' I'm thinkin'that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut." I asked if he could tell mewhere to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address itwould be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the restof his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the searchthen and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--"Look 'ere, guv'nor, there ain't no sense in me a-keepin' you 'ere. Imay find Sam soon, or I mayn't; but anyhow he ain't like to be in a wayto tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address onit, I'll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. Butye'd better be up arter 'im soon in the mornin', or maybe ye won't ketch'im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore."This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny tobuy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When shecame back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet hadagain faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my wayto home. We're on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look asthough she had been crying. Poor dear, I've no doubt it frets her to bekept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and theothers. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed andworried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctorswere quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadfulbusiness. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silencemust rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under anycircumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for sheherself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of theCount or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.       *       *       *       *       *_2 October, evening._--A long and trying and exciting day. By the firstpost I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, onwhich was written with a carpenter's pencil in a sprawling hand:--"Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk forthe depite."I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavyand sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange forher going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home,with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us andin ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where Iwas off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I shouldhave found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with somedifficulty, Potter's Court. Mr. Smollet's spelling misled me, as I askedfor Poter's Court instead of Potter's Court. However, when I had foundthe court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran's lodging-house.When I asked the man who came to the door for the "depite," he shook hishead, and said: "I dunno 'im. There ain't no such a person 'ere; I never'eard of 'im in all my bloomin' days. Don't believe there ain't nobodyof that kind livin' ere or anywheres." I took out Smollet's letter, andas I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the nameof the court might guide me. "What are you?" I asked."I'm the depity," he answered. I saw at once that I was on the righttrack; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put thedeputy's knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, whohad slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night atCorcoran's, had left for his work at Poplar at five o'clock thatmorning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, buthe had a vague idea that it was some kind of a "new-fangled ware'us";and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelveo'clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and thisI got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. Oneof these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street anew "cold storage" building; and as this suited the condition of a"new-fangled ware'us," I at once drove to it. An interview with a surlygatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with thecoin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on mysuggesting that I was willing to pay his day's wages to his foreman forthe privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He wasa smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I hadpromised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told methat he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--"mainheavy ones"--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. Iasked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, towhich he replied:--"Well, guv'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from abig white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was adusty old 'ouse, too, though nothin' to the dustiness of the 'ouse wetooked the bloomin' boxes from.""How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?""There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin' in the 'ouse atPurfleet. He 'elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curseme, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an' him a old feller,with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn't throwa shadder."How this phrase thrilled through me!"Why, 'e took up 'is end o' the boxes like they was pounds of tea, andme a-puffin' an' a-blowin' afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an' I'm nochicken, neither.""How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?" I asked."He was there too. He must 'a' started off and got there afore me, forwhen I rung of the bell he kem an' opened the door 'isself an' 'elped meto carry the boxes into the 'all.""The whole nine?" I asked."Yus; there was five in the first load an' four in the second. It wasmain dry work, an' I don't so well remember 'ow I got 'ome." Iinterrupted him:--"Were the boxes left in the hall?""Yus; it was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in it." I made onemore attempt to further matters:--"You didn't have any key?""Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door 'isselfan' shut it again when I druv off. I don't remember the last time--butthat was the beer.""And you can't remember the number of the house?""No, sir. But ye needn't have no difficulty about that. It's a 'igh 'unwith a stone front with a bow on it, an' 'igh steps up to the door. Iknow them steps, 'avin' 'ad to carry the boxes up with three loaferswhat come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin's, an'they seein' they got so much, they wanted more; but 'e took one of themby the shoulder and was like to throw 'im down the steps, till the lotof them went away cussin'." I thought that with this description I couldfind the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I startedoff for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Countcould, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time wasprecious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount ofdistribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the taskunobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walkedwestward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the housedescribed, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairsarranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been longuntenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters wereup. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the painthad mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had beena large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, beenroughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to havebeen able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, havegiven some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered myexperience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could notbut feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some meansdiscovered of gaining access to the house.There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, andnothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anythingcould be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, thePiccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of thegrooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anythingabout the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately beentaken, but he couldn't say from whom. He told me, however, that up tovery lately there had been a notice-board of "For Sale" up, and thatperhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell mesomething, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm onthe board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant knowor guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolledaway. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so Idid not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office inSackville Street.The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, butuncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that thePiccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a"mansion"--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When Iasked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, andpaused a few seconds before replying:--"It is sold, sir.""Pardon me," I said, with equal politeness, "but I have a special reasonfor wishing to know who purchased it."Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. "It is sold,sir," was again his laconic reply."Surely," I said, "you do not mind letting me know so much.""But I do mind," he answered. "The affairs of their clients areabsolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy." This wasmanifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing withhim. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--"Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of theirconfidence. I am myself a professional man." Here I handed him my card."In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part ofLord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,he understood, lately for sale." These words put a different complexionon affairs. He said:--"I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially wouldI like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter ofrenting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable ArthurHolmwood. If you will let me have his lordship's address I will consultthe House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with hislordship by to-night's post. It will be a pleasure if we can so fardeviate from our rules as to give the required information to hislordship."I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,gave the address at Dr. Seward's and came away. It was now dark, and Iwas tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread Companyand came down to Purfleet by the next train.I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but shemade a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart tothink that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused herinquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on atour conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing ourconfidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution ofkeeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; orelse the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for whenany accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad wemade our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growingknowledge would be torture to her.I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone;so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances evenamongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to meas though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and Icame away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made nodifference between us.When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire inthe study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply readit off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my owninformation; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--"This has been a great day's work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are onthe track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, thenour work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must searchuntil we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt thewretch to his real death." We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.Morris spoke:--"Say! how are we going to get into that house?""We got into the other," answered Lord Godalming quickly."But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had nightand a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing tocommit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don'tsee how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a keyof some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in themorning." Lord Godalming's brows contracted, and he stood up and walkedabout the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one toanother of us:--"Quincey's head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; wegot off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless wecan find the Count's key basket."As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be atleast advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell's,we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a goodwhile we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights andbearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to themoment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Herforehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks evenin her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as shedid this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will beherself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!_Dr. Seward's Diary.__1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change sorapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as theyalways mean something more than his own well-being, they form a morethan interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after hisrepulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.He was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not reallycare for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds andlooked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. Ithought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I askedhim:--"What about the flies these times?" He smiled on me in quite a superiorsort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--ashe answered me:--"The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typicalof the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did wellwhen they typified the soul as a butterfly!"I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I saidquickly:--"Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?" His madness foiled hisreason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his headwith a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--"Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want." Here he brightenedup; "I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; Ihave all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish tostudy zoöphagy!"This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--"Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?" He smiled with anineffably benign superiority."Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of theDeity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If Imay state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns thingspurely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupiedspiritually!" This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recallEnoch's appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I feltthat by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--"And why with Enoch?""Because he walked with God." I could not see the analogy, but did notlike to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--"So you don't care about life and you don't want souls. Why not?" I putmy question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into hisold servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me ashe replied:--"I don't want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don't. I couldn't use them ifI had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn't eat themor----" He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over hisface, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. "And doctor, as tolife, what is it after all? When you've got all you require, and youknow that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--goodfriends--like you, Dr. Seward"; this was said with a leer ofinexpressible cunning. "I know that I shall never lack the means oflife!"I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw someantagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such ashe--a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present itwas useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have comewithout special reason, but just at present I am so interested in himthat I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anythingto help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so areLord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over therecord prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurateknowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wishto be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him withme to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse hemight not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfieldmight not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I werealone.I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a posewhich is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When Icame in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on hislips:--"What about souls?" It was evident then that my surmise had beencorrect. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with thelunatic. I determined to have the matter out. "What about themyourself?" I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all roundhim, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration foran answer."I don't want any souls!" he said in a feeble, apologetic way. Thematter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to "becruel only to be kind." So I said:--"You like life, and you want life?""Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn't worry about that!""But," I asked, "how are we to get the life without getting the soulalso?" This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--"A nice time you'll have some time when you're flying out there, withthe souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzingand twittering and miauing all round you. You've got their lives, youknow, and you must put up with their souls!" Something seemed to affecthis imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is beingsoaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gaveme a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child,though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. Itwas evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreignto himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could andgo with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--"Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?" He seemed towake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--"Not much! flies are poor things, after all!" After a pause he added,"But I don't want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.""Or spiders?" I went on."Blow spiders! What's the use of spiders? There isn't anything in themto eat or"--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbiddentopic."So, so!" I thought to myself, "this is the second time he has suddenlystopped at the word 'drink'; what does it mean?" Renfield seemed himselfaware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distractmy attention from it:--"I don't take any stock at all in such matters. 'Rats and mice and suchsmall deer,' as Shakespeare has it, 'chicken-feed of the larder' theymight be called. I'm past all that sort of nonsense. You might as wellask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try tointerest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is beforeme.""I see," I said. "You want big things that you can make your teeth meetin? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?""What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!" He was getting too wideawake, so I thought I would press him hard. "I wonder," I saidreflectively, "what an elephant's soul is like!"The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from hishigh-horse and became a child again."I don't want an elephant's soul, or any soul at all!" he said. For afew moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, withhis eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. "Tohell with you and your souls!" he shouted. "Why do you plague me aboutsouls? Haven't I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,without thinking of souls!" He looked so hostile that I thought he wasin for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--"Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am soworried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew theproblem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, andtolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. Iwant to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I amsure you will understand!" He had evidently self-control; so when theattendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfieldwatched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerabledignity and sweetness:--"Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me thatI am very, very grateful to you!" I thought it well to leave him in thismood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over inthis man's state. Several points seem to make what the Americaninterviewer calls "a story," if one could only get them in proper order.Here they are:--Will not mention "drinking."Fears the thought of being burdened with the "soul" of anything.Has no dread of wanting "life" in the future.Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads beinghaunted by their souls.Logically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kindthat he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence--theburden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!And the assurance--?Merciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme ofterror afoot!       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him mysuspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for awhile asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the doorwe heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the timewhich now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement thathe had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with theautumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talkof the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. Hewent on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He hadgot a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to comeaway as ignorant as we went in.His is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night._Letter, Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming.__"1 October._"My Lord,"We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, withregard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on yourbehalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale andpurchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executorsof the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreignnobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying thepurchase money in notes 'over the counter,' if your Lordship will pardonus using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whateverof him."We are, my Lord,"Your Lordship's humble servants,"MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY."_Dr. Seward's Diary.__2 October._--I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him tomake an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield's room,and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange hewas to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the firein the study--Mrs. Harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attemptsand discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result,and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.Before going to bed I went round to the patient's room and looked inthrough the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heartrose and fell with regular respiration.This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnighthe was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked himif that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There wassomething about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank ifhe had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having "dozed" fora while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they arewatched.To-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey arelooking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to havehorses always in readiness, for when we get the information which weseek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the importedearth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at hisweakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to theBritish Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The oldphysicians took account of things which their followers do not accept,and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may beuseful to us later.I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity instrait-waistcoats.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track, and ourwork of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. I wonder ifRenfield's quiet has anything to do with this. His moods have sofollowed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of themonster may be carried to him in some subtle way. If we could only getsome hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argumentwith him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us avaluable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.... Is he?---- Thatwild yell seemed to come from his room....       *       *       *       *       *The attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield hadsomehow met with some accident. He had heard him yell; and when he wentto him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.I must go at once....CHAPTER XXIDR. SEWARD'S DIARY_3 October._--Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as wellas I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that Ican recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.When I came to Renfield's room I found him lying on the floor on hisleft side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, itbecame at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the bodywhich marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could seethat it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against thefloor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of bloodoriginated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me aswe turned him over:--"I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg andthe whole side of his face are paralysed." How such a thing could havehappened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quitebewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--"I can't understand the two things. He could mark his face like that bybeating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at theEversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose hemight have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkwardkink. But for the life of me I can't imagine how the two thingsoccurred. If his back was broke, he couldn't beat his head; and if hisface was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks ofit." I said to him:--"Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I wanthim without an instant's delay." The man ran off, and within a fewminutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. Whenhe saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, andthen turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for hesaid very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--"Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and muchattention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you."The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see thathe had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned withextraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He hadevidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before helooked at the patient, he whispered to me:--"Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomesconscious, after the operation." So I said:--"I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can atpresent. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere."The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressedfracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. TheProfessor thought a moment and said:--"We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as faras can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature ofhis injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of thebrain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may betoo late." As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. Iwent over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur andQuincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--"I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Thingsare moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of usthese times. I've been thinking that to-morrow night will not see thingsas they have been. We'll have to look back--and forward a little morethan we have done. May we come in?" I nodded, and held the door opentill they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw theattitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on thefloor, he said softly:--"My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!" I told himbriefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness afterthe operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and satdown on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watchedin patience."We shall wait," said Van Helsing, "just long enough to fix the bestspot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly removethe blood clot; for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasing."The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had ahorrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gatheredthat he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreadedthe words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of menwho have heard the death-watch. The poor man's breathing came inuncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyesand speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and hewould relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sickbeds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almosthear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through mytemples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally becameagonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw fromtheir flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equaltorture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overheadsome dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expectit.At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient wassinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professorand caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as hespoke:--"There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I havebeen thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!We shall operate just above the ear."Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments thebreathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath soprolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a gladsurprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He movedconvulsively, and as he did so, said:--"I'll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. Ihave had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannotmove. What's wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smartsdreadfully." He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort hiseyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then VanHelsing said in a quiet grave tone:--"Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield." As he heard the voice his facebrightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--"That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me somewater, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed"--hestopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--"Thebrandy--it is in my study--quick!" He flew and returned with a glass,the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parchedlips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poorinjured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quiteconscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which Ishall never forget, and said:--"I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality."Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the twofigures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--"If I were not sure already, I would know from them." For an instant hiseyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he werebringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--"Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;and then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandyagain. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poorcrushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you leftme, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn't speak then, for Ifelt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, asI am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you leftme; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brainseemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard thedogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!" As he spoke, VanHelsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine andgripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightlyand said: "Go on," in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--"He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;but he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like aman's when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp whiteteeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the beltof trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn't ask him to come inat first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.Then he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them." Hewas interrupted by a word from the Professor:--"How?""By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when thesun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on theirwings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on theirbacks." Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--"The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the'Death's-head Moth'?" The patient went on without stopping."Then he began to whisper: 'Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and catstoo. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merelybuzzing flies!' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. Hebeckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised hishands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark massspread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; andthen He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that therewere thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, onlysmaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought heseemed to be saying: 'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many moreand greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worshipme!' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to closeover my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself openingthe sash and saying to Him: 'Come in, Lord and Master!' The rats wereall gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was onlyopen an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in throughthe tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size andsplendour."His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, andhe continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working inthe interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call himback to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: "Let him go on. Donot interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at allif once he lost the thread of his thought." He proceeded:--"All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, noteven a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not evenknock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face lookedout of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though heowned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn't even smell the sameas he went by me. I couldn't hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.Harker had come into the room."The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behindhim so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on withoutnoticing:--"When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn't the same;it was like tea after the teapot had been watered." Here we all moved,but no one said a word; he went on:--"I didn't know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn't look thesame. I don't care for the pale people; I like them with lots of bloodin them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn't think of itat the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me madto know that He had been taking the life out of her." I could feel thatthe rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. "So whenHe came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and Igrabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; andas I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to strugglewith me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn'tmean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burnedinto me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, andwhen I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. Therewas a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemedto steal away under the door." His voice was becoming fainter and hisbreath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively."We know the worst now," he said. "He is here, and we know his purpose.It may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the othernight, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare." There was noneed to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them incommon. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that wehad when we entered the Count's house. The Professor had his ready, andas we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--"They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business isover. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!" He stopped; hisvoice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated inmy own heart.Outside the Harkers' door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and thelatter said:--"Should we disturb her?""We must," said Van Helsing grimly. "If the door be locked, I shallbreak it in.""May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady'sroom!"Van Helsing said solemnly, "You are always right; but this is life anddeath. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not theyare all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, ifthe door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and youtoo, my friends. Now!"He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threwourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fellheadlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I sawacross him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I sawappalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,and my heart seemed to stand still.The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the roomwas light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay JonathanHarker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-cladfigure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognisedthe Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his lefthand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her armsat full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smearedwith blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare breast whichwas shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terribleresemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk tocompel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned hisface, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leapinto it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrilsof the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and thewhite sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threwhis victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turnedand sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the SacredWafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outsidethe tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as agreat black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang upunder Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as welooked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its burstingopen, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I movedforward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and withit had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that itseems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For afew seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face wasghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smearedher lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream ofblood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face herpoor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of theCount's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wailwhich made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of anendless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gentlyover her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instantdespairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--"Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We cando nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recoversherself; I must wake him!" He dipped the end of a towel in cold waterand with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the whileholding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that washeart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of thewindow. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see QuinceyMorris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a greatyew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at theinstant I heard Harker's quick exclamation as he woke to partialconsciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might wellbe, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, andthen full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and hestarted up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned tohim with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, heldher hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook."In God's name what does this mean?" Harker cried out. "Dr. Seward, Dr.Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come tothis!" and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildlytogether. "Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!" With a quickmovement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all theman in him awake at the need for instant exertion. "What has happened?Tell me all about it!" he cried without pausing. "Dr. Van Helsing, youlove Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone toofar yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!" His wife, through her terrorand horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantlyforgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--"No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enoughto-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must staywith me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!" Herexpression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, shepulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up hislittle golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--"Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you nofoul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calmand take counsel together." She shuddered and was silent, holding downher head on her husband's breast. When she raised it, his whitenight-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and wherethe thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant shesaw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst chokingsobs:--"Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that itshould be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may havemost cause to fear." To this he spoke out resolutely:--"Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would nothear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by mydeserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!" He put outhis arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay theresobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinkeddamply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After awhile her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said tome, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervouspower to the utmost:--"And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broadfact; tell me all that has been." I told him exactly what had happened,and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitchedand his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count hadheld his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth tothe open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, tosee, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively overthe bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffledhair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at mequestioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage oftheir coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husbandand wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescenceto him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalminganswered:--"I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. Ilooked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,however----" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure onthe bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--"Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope nowis in knowing all. Tell freely!" So Art went on:--"He had been there, and though it could only have been for a fewseconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had beenburned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; thecylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the waxhad helped the flames." Here I interrupted. "Thank God there is theother copy in the safe!" His face lit for a moment, but fell again as hewent on: "I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I lookedinto Renfield's room; but there was no trace there except----!" Again hepaused. "Go on," said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head andmoistening his lips with his tongue, added: "except that the poor fellowis dead." Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other ofus she said solemnly:--"God's will be done!" I could not but feel that Art was keeping backsomething; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--"And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?""A little," he answered. "It may be much eventually, but at present Ican't say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count wouldgo when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise fromRenfield's window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in someshape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. Hewill not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and thedawn is close. We must work to-morrow!"He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhapsa couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I couldhear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing hishand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker's head:--"And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly whathappened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it isneed that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be donequick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that mustend all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live andlearn."The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nervesas she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower andlower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and heldout one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping andkissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in thatof her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, shebegan:--"I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for along time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriadsof horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of themconnected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble."Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and saidlovingly: "Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help methrough the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to meto tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much Ineed your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its workwith my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself tosleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember nomore. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side whennext I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that Ihad before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will findit in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vagueterror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that itseemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. Itried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and Ilooked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: besidethe bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the misthad turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood atall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description ofthe others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the lightfell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp whiteteeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in thesunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby. I knew, too, thered scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instantmy heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I wasparalysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--"'Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains outbefore your very eyes.' I was appalled and was too bewildered to do orsay anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulderand, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he didso, 'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as wellbe quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins haveappeased my thirst!' I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did notwant to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse thatsuch is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pityme! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!" Her husband groanedagain. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as ifhe were the injured one, and went on:--"I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How longthis horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long timemust have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. Isaw it drip with the fresh blood!" The remembrance seemed for a while tooverpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for herhusband's sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself andwent on:--"Then he spoke to me mockingly, 'And so you, like the others, would playyour brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me andfrustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. Theyshould have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst theyplayed wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intriguedfor them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they wereborn--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are nowto me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountifulwine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and myhelper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shallminister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what youhave done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to mycall. When my brain says "Come!" to you, you shall cross land or sea todo my bidding; and to that end this!' With that he pulled open hisshirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. Whenthe blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holdingthem tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth tothe wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Ohmy God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such afate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all mydays. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!" Then she began to rub herlips as though to cleanse them from pollution.As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,and everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet;but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey lookwhich deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the firstred streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly outagainst the whitening hair.We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappypair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.Of this I am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house inall the great round of its daily course.CHAPTER XXIIJONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL_3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. Itis now six o'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour andtake something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreedthat if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, Godknows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I darenot stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the endthe little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, couldnot have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However,we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tearsrunning down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that ourfaith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid usup to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poorRenfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Sewardtold us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room belowthey had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face wasall bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he hadheard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed tohalf dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfieldhad called out loudly several times, "God! God! God!" after that therewas a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lyingon the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsingasked if he had heard "voices" or "a voice," and he said he could notsay; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but asthere was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swearto it, if required, that the word "God" was spoken by the patient. Dr.Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go intothe matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and itwould never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. Asit was, he thought that on the attendant's evidence he could give acertificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case thecoroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarilyto the same result.When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our nextstep, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in fullconfidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should bekept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitifulto see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth ofdespair. "There must be no concealment," she said, "Alas! we have hadtoo much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that cangive me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!"Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenlybut quietly:--"But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but forothers from yourself, after what has happened?" Her face grew set in itslines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as sheanswered:--"Ah no! for my mind is made up!""To what?" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each inour own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answercame with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--"Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign ofharm to any that I love, I shall die!""You would not kill yourself?" he asked, hoarsely."I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such apain, and so desperate an effort!" She looked at him meaningly as shespoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her andput his hand on her head as he said solemnly:"My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself Icould hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But mychild----" For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in histhroat; he gulped it down and went on:--"There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must notdie. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Untilthe other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must notdie; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would makeyou even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive tolive, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Deathhimself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or thenight; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that youdo not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past." Thepoor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen aquicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were allsilent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning tohim said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--"I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shallstrive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror mayhave passed away from me." She was so good and brave that we all feltthat our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and webegan to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have allthe papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs wemight hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if "pleased" couldbe used in connection with so grim an interest.As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and wasprepared with an exact ordering of our work."It is perhaps well," he said, "that at our meeting after our visit toCarfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that laythere. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, andwould doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such aneffort with regard to the others; but now he does not know ourintentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such apower exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot usethem as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge asto their disposition that, when we have examined the house inPiccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours;and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morningguards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster mustretain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitationsof his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappearthrough cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, hemust open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt outall his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catchhim and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catchingand the destroying shall be, in time, sure." Here I started up for Icould not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds sopreciously laden with Mina's life and happiness were flying from us,since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held uphis hand warningly. "Nay, friend Jonathan," he said, "in this, thequickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall allact and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, inall probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will havedeeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that hewrite on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongingsthat he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in thevery vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there andsearch that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what ourfriend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt 'stop the earths' and so werun down our old fox--so? is it not?""Then let us come at once," I cried, "we are wasting the precious,precious time!" The Professor did not move, but simply said:--"And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?""Any way!" I cried. "We shall break in if need be.""And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?"I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a goodreason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--"Don't wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I amin.""Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add toyour anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be atmovement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and itseems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to getinto the house, but we have no key; is it not so?" I nodded."Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and couldnot still get it; and think there was to you no conscience of thehousebreaker, what would you do?""I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick thelock for me.""And your police, they would interfere, would they not?""Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.""Then," he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, "all that is in doubt isthe conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as towhether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Yourpolice must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in readingthe heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, myfriend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in thisyour London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as suchthings are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so finehouse in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerlandand lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back andgot in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk outand in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then hehave an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods ofthat other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell himthat house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all awaywithin a certain time. And your police and other authority help him allthey can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerlandhe find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done_en règle_; and in our work we shall be _en règle_ too. We shall not goso early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deemit strange; but we shall go after ten o'clock, when there are manyabout, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of thehouse."I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina'sface became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. VanHelsing went on:--"When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some ofus can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there bemore earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End."Lord Godalming stood up. "I can be of some use here," he said. "I shallwire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be mostconvenient.""Look here, old fellow," said Morris, "it is a capital idea to have allready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don't you think that oneof your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway ofWalworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; andeven leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.""Friend Quincey is right!" said the Professor. "His head is what youcall in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go todo, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may."Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to seethat the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time theterrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale--almostghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth insomewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should giveher needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think ofwhat had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. Asyet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yetwas short, and there was time for fear.When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of thedisposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It wasfinally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy theCount's lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, weshould thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and hispresence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give ussome new clue.As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalmingand Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Countmight appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might beable to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able tofollow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far asmy going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protectMina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina wouldnot listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matterin which I could be useful; that amongst the Count's papers might besome clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania;and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required tocope with the Count's extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina'sresolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ thatwe should all work together. "As for me," she said, "I have no fear.Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen musthave in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, ifHe wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present." So Istarted up crying out: "Then in God's name let us come at once, for weare losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than wethink.""Not so!" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand."But why?" I asked."Do you forget," he said, with actually a smile, "that last night hebanqueted heavily, and will sleep late?"Did I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget thatterrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; butthe pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, andshuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall herfrightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part inthe affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said,he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. "Oh,Madam Mina," he said, "dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who soreverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid oldlips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you willforget it, will you not?" He bent low beside her as he spoke; she tookhis hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--"No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it Ihave so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it alltogether. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and wemust all eat that we may be strong."Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful andencourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful ofus. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--"Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are weall armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy'slair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?" We all assuredhim. "Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safehere until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shallreturn! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. Ihave myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placingof things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guardyourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in thename of the Father, the Son, and----"There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As hehad placed the Wafer on Mina's forehead, it had seared it--had burnedinto the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poordarling's brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly asher nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her thather overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But thewords to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceasedto ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on herknees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hairover her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--"Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I mustbear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day." Theyall paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helplessgrief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes oursorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned awaytheir eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and saidgravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in someway inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--"It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit,as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs ofthe earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, MadamMina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when thatred scar, the sign of God's knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely aswe live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift theburden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son didin obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments ofHis good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that otherthrough stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts andfears, and all that makes the difference between God and man."There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the oldman's hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we allknelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to eachother. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from thehead of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for helpand guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting whichneither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be avampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terribleland alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meantmany; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, sothe holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as onthe first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaicsurroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for suchfear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had therenot been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceededwith our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; andin the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--"And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise thisearth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a fardistant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it hasbeen holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it moreholy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it toGod." As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, andvery soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelledmusty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attentionwas concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of theSacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting downthe lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and leftthem as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portionof the Host.When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--"So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we canbe so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on MadamMina's forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!"As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch ourtrain we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in thewindow of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded totell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded inreply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving herhand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the stationand just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached theplatform.I have written this in the train.       *       *       *       *       *_Piccadilly, 12:30 o'clock._--Just before we reached Fenchurch StreetLord Godalming said to me:--"Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us incase there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances itwouldn't seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are asolicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that youshould have known better." I demurred as to my not sharing any dangereven of odium, but he went on: "Besides, it will attract less attentionif there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right withthe locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You hadbetter go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park,somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened andthe smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on thelookout for you, and shall let you in.""The advice is good!" said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalmingand Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the cornerof Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the GreenPark. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope wascentred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongstits more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a benchwithin good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as littleattention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as wewaited for the coming of the others.At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurelyfashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descendeda thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paidthe cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the twoascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikesof the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then saunteredalong. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling downplaced his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out aselection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderlyfashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, andturning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, andthe man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, hebegan to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumblingabout for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once thedoor opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two othersentered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but VanHelsing's went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw theworkman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partlyopen, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse andgave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on hiscoat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the wholetransaction.When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked atthe door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stoodLord Godalming lighting a cigar."The place smells so vilely," said the latter as we came in. It didindeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with ourprevious experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using theplace pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping togetherin case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to dealwith, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in thehouse. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we foundeight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found themissing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked outacross a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were nowindows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did notlose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we hadbrought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we hadtreated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that theCount was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search forany of his effects.After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effectswhich might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examinethem. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-roomtable. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle;deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thinwrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothesbrush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containingdirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was alittle heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging tothe other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalmingand Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of thehouses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a greatbunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of usare, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming ofthe Count.CHAPTER XXIIIDR. SEWARD'S DIARY_3 October._--The time seemed terrible long whilst we were waiting forthe coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keepour minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficentpurpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthfulface, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn,haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burningeyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; infact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, ifall go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then,in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, Ithought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! The Professor knowsthis well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What hehas been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. Sowell as I can remember, here it is:--"I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, allthe papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, thegreater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through thereare signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge ofit. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth,he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, andalchemist--which latter was the highest development of thescience-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyondcompare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even toattend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his timethat he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived thephysical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he isgrowing, and some things that were childish at the first are now ofman's stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had notbeen that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if wefail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road mustlead through Death, not Life."Harker groaned and said, "And this is all arrayed against my darling!But how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!""He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly butsurely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, asyet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certainthings he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he meansto succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to waitand to go slow. _Festina lente_ may well be his motto.""I fail to understand," said Harker wearily. "Oh, do be more plain tome! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain."The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--"Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, thismonster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has beenmaking use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friendJohn's home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come whenand how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto byan inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we notsee how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. Heknew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so greatchild-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether hemight not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when hefound that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so heprogress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know wherethey are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. Sothat he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change hisform, they do him equal well; and none may know these are hishiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to himjust too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where hecan move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Isthere not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be evenmore careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all bewell, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is ourday, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there arefive of us when those absent ones return."Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, thedouble postman's knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to thehall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us tokeep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in adespatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at thedirection, opened it and read aloud."Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly andhastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may wantto see you: Mina."There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice:--"Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!" Van Helsing turned to himquickly and said:--"God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoiceas yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.""I care for nothing now," he answered hotly, "except to wipe out thisbrute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!""Oh, hush, hush, my child!" said Van Helsing. "God does not purchasesouls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keepfaith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and yourdevotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would bedoubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we areall devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time iscoming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man,and till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrivehere--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some timesbefore he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope foris that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first."About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker's telegram, therecame a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinaryknock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it madethe Professor's heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, andtogether moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our variousarmaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. VanHelsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stoodback, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our heartsmust have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, wesaw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closedthe door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along thehall:--"It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and wedestroyed them all!""Destroyed?" asked the Professor."For him!" We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--"There's nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn't turn upby five o'clock, we must start off; for it won't do to leave Mrs. Harkeralone after sunset.""He will be here before long now," said Van Helsing, who had beenconsulting his pocket-book. "_Nota bene_, in Madam's telegram he wentsouth from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he couldonly do so at slack of tide, which should be something before oneo'clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet onlysuspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he wouldsuspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only ashort time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went toMile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to becarried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall nothave long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so thatwe may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all yourarms! Be ready!" He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all couldhear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which adominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties andadventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had alwaysbeen the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had beenaccustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to berenewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at oncelaid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with agesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I werejust behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor couldguard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready tomove in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made theseconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came alongthe hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at leasthe feared it.Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way pastus before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was somethingso panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemedto sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act wasHarker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the doorleading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, ahorrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth longand pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare oflion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a singleimpulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not somebetter organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered whatwe were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons wouldavail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he hadready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. Theblow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count'sleap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shornethrough his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of goldfell out. The expression of the Count's face was so hellish, that for amoment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knifealoft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with aprotective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. Ifelt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that Isaw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneouslyby each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression ofhate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came overthe Count's face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrastof his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on thepallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuousdive he swept under Harker's arm, ere his blow could fall, and, graspinga handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threwhimself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of theshivering glass I could hear the "ting" of the gold, as some of thesovereigns fell on the flagging.We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing upthe steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.There he turned and spoke to us:--"You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, likesheep in a butcher's. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You thinkyou have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge isjust begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Yourgirls that you all love are mine already; and through them you andothers shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be myjackals when I want to feed. Bah!" With a contemptuous sneer, he passedquickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as hefastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of usto speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of followinghim through the stable, we moved toward the hall."We have learnt something--much! Notwithstanding his brave words, hefears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? Hisvery tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? Youfollow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. Forme, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that hereturn." As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; tookthe title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept theremaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them witha match.Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker hadlowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however,bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open therewas no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the backof the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had torecognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with theProfessor when he said:--"Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can dojust now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we neednot despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to findit; when that is done all may yet be well." I could see that he spoke asbravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite brokendown; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--hewas thinking of his wife.With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harkerwaiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to herbravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became aspale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she werein secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--"I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!" As she spoke,she took her husband's grey head in her hands and kissed it--"Lay yourpoor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protectus if He so will it in His good intent." The poor fellow groaned. Therewas no place for words in his sublime misery.We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered usall up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungrypeople--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the senseof companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all lessmiserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True toour promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; andalthough she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed tothreaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her wasmanifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to thepart where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung toher husband's arm, and held it tight as though her clinging couldprotect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however,till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right upto the present time. Then without letting go her husband's hand shestood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of thescene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beautyof her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of whichshe was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of ourteeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness againstour grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; andwe, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness andpurity and faith, was outcast from God."Jonathan," she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it wasso full of love and tenderness, "Jonathan dear, and you all my true,true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all thisdreadful time. I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even asyou destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter;but it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all thismisery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy whenhe, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may havespiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it maynot hold your hands from his destruction."As she spoke I could see her husband's face darken and draw together, asthough the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.Instinctively the clasp on his wife's hand grew closer, till hisknuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew shemust have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealingthan ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearinghis hand from hers as he spoke:--"May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy thatearthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could sendhis soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!""Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don't say such things,Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Justthink, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that someother like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! Oh,my husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thoughthad there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasuredyour wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving andsorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidenceof what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whomso many sorrows have come."We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we weptopenly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his armsround her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckonedto us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alonewith their God.Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any comingof the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for herhusband's sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was,I think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed athand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we shouldsit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of thepoor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of usshall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in,for his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall goto bed._Jonathan Harker's Journal.__3-4 October, close to midnight._--I thought yesterday would never end.There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind beliefthat to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change mustnow be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next stepwas to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that oneearth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If hechooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in themeantime!--the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now.This I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, thatone is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for hersweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monsterseem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorerby the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all driftingreefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina issleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might belike, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been socalm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there cameover her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on herface, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepymyself, though I am weary--weary to death. However, I must try to sleep;for there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for meuntil....       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who wassitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face. I could see easily,for we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a warning handover my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:--"Hush! there is someone in the corridor!" I got up softly, and crossingthe room, gently opened the door.Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. Heraised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me:--"Hush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here allnight. We don't mean to take any chances!"His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina.She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, paleface as she put her arms round me and said softly:--"Oh, thank God for good brave men!" With a sigh she sank back again tosleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.       *       *       *       *       *_4 October, morning._--Once again during the night I was wakened byMina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the comingdawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame waslike a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly:--"Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at once.""Why?" I asked."I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and maturedwithout my knowing it. He must hypnotise me before the dawn, and then Ishall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close." Iwent to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeingme, he sprang to his feet."Is anything wrong?" he asked, in alarm."No," I replied; "but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.""I will go," he said, and hurried into the Professor's room.In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in hisdressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward atthe door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina a smile--apositive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as hesaid:--"Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan,we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!" Thenturning to her, he said, cheerfully: "And what am I do for you? For atthis hour you do not want me for nothings.""I want you to hypnotise me!" she said. "Do it before the dawn, for Ifeel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time isshort!" Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Minagazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beatlike a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Graduallyher eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving ofher bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a fewmore passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead wascovered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but shedid not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, andher voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand toimpose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at thefoot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. Thestillness was broken by Van Helsing's voice speaking in a low level tonewhich would not break the current of her thoughts:--"Where are you?" The answer came in a neutral way:--"I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own." For severalminutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stoodstaring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The roomwas growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina's face, Dr. VanHelsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemedjust upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuseitself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--"Where are you now?" The answer came dreamily, but with intention; itwere as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use thesame tone when reading her shorthand notes."I do not know. It is all strange to me!""What do you see?""I can see nothing; it is all dark.""What do you hear?" I could detect the strain in the Professor's patientvoice."The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I canhear them on the outside.""Then you are on a ship?" We all looked at each other, trying to gleansomething each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer camequick:--"Oh, yes!""What else do you hear?""The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is thecreaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstanfalls into the rachet.""What are you doing?""I am still--oh, so still. It is like death!" The voice faded away intoa deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light ofday. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's shoulders, and laid herhead down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a fewmoments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to seeus all around her. "Have I been talking in my sleep?" was all she said.She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though shewas eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated theconversation, and she said:--"Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!" Mr.Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor's calmvoice called them back:--"Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchorwhilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment inyour so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God bethanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us weknow not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men,since when we can look back we see what we might have seen lookingforward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, butthat sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in theCount's mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan's so fierceknife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hearme, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of menfollowing like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. Hehave take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. Hethink to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur wouldsay when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, andwe must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in alittle while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are watersbetween us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if hewould--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full orslack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is tous. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land withus." Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--"But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?" Hetook her hand and patted it as he replied:--"Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer allquestions." He would say no more, and we separated to dress.After breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely fora minute and then said sorrowfully:--"Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find himeven if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!" She grew paler asshe asked faintly:--"Why?""Because," he answered solemnly, "he can live for centuries, and you arebut mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded--since once he put that markupon your throat."I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.CHAPTER XXIVDR. SEWARD'S PHONOGRAPH DIARY, SPOKEN BY VAN HELSINGThis to Jonathan Harker.You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go to make oursearch--if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and weseek confirmation only. But do you stay and take care of her to-day.This is your best and most holiest office. This day nothing can find himhere. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already,for I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away; he have gone backto his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand offire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in some way, andthat last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took themoney; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sungo down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb thathe think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him.But there was not of time. When that fail he make straight for his lastresource--his last earth-work I might say did I wish _double entente_.He is clever, oh, so clever! he know that his game here was finish; andso he decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he came,and he go in it. We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound;when we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. Then we willcomfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hopewhen you think it over: that all is not lost. This very creature that wepursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet inone day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He isfinite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.But we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strongtogether. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle isbut begun, and in the end we shall win--so sure as that God sits on highto watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return.VAN HELSING._Jonathan Harker's Journal.__4 October._--When I read to Mina, Van Helsing's message in thephonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. Already thecertainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort;and comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horribledanger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible tobelieve in it. Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seemlike a long-forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the brightsunlight----Alas! how can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought my eye fell onthe red scar on my poor darling's white forehead. Whilst that lasts,there can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of it willkeep faith crystal clear. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have beenover all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the realityseems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There issomething of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. It maybe! I shall try to think as she does. We have never spoken to each otheryet of the future. It is better to wait till we see the Professor andthe others after their investigations.The day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could runfor me again. It is now three o'clock._Mina Harker's Journal.__5 October, 5 p. m._--Our meeting for report. Present: Professor VanHelsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, JonathanHarker, Mina Harker.Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day todiscover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:--"As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure thathe must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, sinceby that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. _Omneignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find whatships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, sinceMadam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go inyour list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion ofLord Godalming, to your Lloyd's, where are note of all ships that sail,however so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship goout with the tide. She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail fromDoolittle's Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up theDanube. 'Soh!' said I, 'this is the ship whereon is the Count.' So offwe go to Doolittle's Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of woodso small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquireof the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_. He swear much, and he red faceand loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quinceygive him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, andput it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, hestill better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and askmany men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when theyhave been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and ofothers which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; butnevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know."They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about fiveo'clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high noseand teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all inblack, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or thetime. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what shipsails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office andthen to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end ofgang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, whentold that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first heagree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horseand cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himselfdriving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though ittake several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk tocaptain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain likeit not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like hecan come and see where it shall be. But he say 'no'; that he come notyet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that hehad better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave theplace--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. Then the thinman smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but hewill be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again,polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that hewill so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before thesailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tellhim that he doesn't want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and alsowith blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. And so, after askingwhere there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase shipforms, he departed."No one knew where he went 'or bloomin' well cared,' as they said, forthey had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soonbecame apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail aswas expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.The captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom andblood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began tofear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood,when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again andasked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain repliedthat he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom andblood--were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went downwith the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhileon deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, andall was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that wasof bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain's swearsexceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full ofpicturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement upand down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen anyof fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the shipwent out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down theriver mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea."And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, forour enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to theDanube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and whenwe start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hopeis to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for thenhe can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. Thereare days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all aboutwhere he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown usinvoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed inVarna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there presenthis credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph andhave inquiry made at Varna, we say 'no'; for what is to be done is notfor police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our ownway."When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certainthat the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: "We have thebest proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance thismorning." I asked him again if it were really necessary that they shouldpursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know thathe would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion,at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and moreforceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least someof that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongstmen:--"Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! For your sake in the first,and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harmalready, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the shorttime when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure indarkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, mydear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, orin that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving hisown barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where lifeof man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was thework of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to dowhat he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that havebeen, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces ofnature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together insome wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead forall these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemicalworld. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out watersof strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations ofoccult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and inhimself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warliketime he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have instrange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow andthrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid whichis surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He haveinfect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is forgood of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he dono more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; andso in time, death, which is of man's common lot and with God's sanction,shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn togetherthat it must not. Thus are we ministers of God's own wish: that theworld, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem onesoul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeemmore. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, ifwe fall, we fall in good cause." He paused and I said:--"But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been drivenfrom England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village fromwhich he has been hunted?""Aha!" he said, "your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shalladopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has oncetasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowlunceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is atiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself heis not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he goover the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he bebeaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again.Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was tohim he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. Whatdoes he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise forhim. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. Hefind in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. Hestudy new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of oldways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a newland and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse thathe have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it helphim to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was atthe first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from aruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greaterworld of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we knowhim; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off wholepeoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil,what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But weare pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and ourefforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe noteven what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greateststrength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weaponsto destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own soulsfor the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for thehonour and glory of God."After a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothingbe definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try tothink out the proper conclusions. To-morrow, at breakfast, we are tomeet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, weshall decide on some definite cause of action.       *       *       *       *       *I feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night. It is as if some hauntingpresence were removed from me. Perhaps ...My surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in themirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was stillunclean._Dr. Seward's Diary.__5 October._--We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much foreach and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was moregeneral cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experienceagain.It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Letany obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even bydeath--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. Morethan once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whetherthe whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when Icaught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I wasbrought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving thematter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all ourtrouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of hertrouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when somethingrecalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are tomeet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course ofaction. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinctrather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fearthat in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker's tongue is tied. I _know_that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I canguess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, orcannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, andhe and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some ofthat horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. TheCount had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called "theVampire's baptism of blood." Well, there may be a poison that distilsitself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines isa mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if myinstinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker's silences, then there is aterrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The samepower that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not thinkfurther; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shalltry to open the subject with him.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state ofthings. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted tosay, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beatingabout the bush a little, he said suddenly:--"Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, justat the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into ourconfidence"; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--"Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing." A cold shiver ranthrough me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsingcontinued:--"With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warnedbefore things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult thanever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. Ican see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is nowbut very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to noticewithout to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyesare more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence nowoften; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when shewrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. Ifit be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see andhear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and whohave drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if hewill, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?" I noddedacquiescence; he went on:--"Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant ofour intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painfultask! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be.When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will notto speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded byus." He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspirationat the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poorsoul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfortto him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for atany rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and theeffect was as I expected.It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing hasgone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. Ireally believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief wasexperienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent amessage by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, asshe thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movementswithout her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at eachother for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my ownpart, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it wasmuch pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances weagreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, topreserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able toconfer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. VanHelsing roughly put the facts before us first:--"The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will takeher at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks toreach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship's voyage, owing to suchweather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and ifwe allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quitesafe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any ratebe in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make suchpreparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed--armedagainst evil things, spiritual as well as physical." Here Quincey Morrisadded:--"I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may bethat he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters toour armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is anytrouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the packafter us at Tobolsk? What wouldn't we have given then for a repeaterapiece!""Good!" said Van Helsing, "Winchesters it shall be. Quincey's head islevel at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be moredishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime wecan do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any ofus, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, wefour can set out on our journey.""We four?" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another ofus."Of course!" answered the Professor quickly, "you must remain to takecare of your so sweet wife!" Harker was silent for awhile and then saidin a hollow voice:--"Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult withMina." I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him notto disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at himsignificantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips andturned away._Jonathan Harker's Journal.__5 October, afternoon._--For some time after our meeting this morning Icould not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state ofwonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina's determination notto take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could notargue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever froma solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; thelast time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be nomore concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmlyand sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beamswith happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina's happy sleep, andcame as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As theevening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinkinglower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All atonce Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--"Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. Apromise made to me, but made holily in God's hearing, and not to bebroken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bittertears. Quick, you must make it to me at once.""Mina," I said, "a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may haveno right to make it.""But, dear one," she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyeswere like pole stars, "it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you maydo as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolvedfrom the promise.""I promise!" I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; thoughto me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.She said:--"Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed forthe campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, orimplication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!" and shesolemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and saidsolemnly:--"I promise!" and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door hadbeen shut between us.       *       *       *       *       *_Later, midnight._--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infectedsomewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pallof gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retiredearly. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thingthat her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terribletrouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shalltry it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep.       *       *       *       *       *_6 October, morning._--Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about thesame time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thoughtthat it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question wentfor the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I foundhim dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear theopening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into theroom, he asked Mina if the others might come, too."No," she said quite simply, "it will not be necessary. You can tellthem just as well. I must go with you on your journey."Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment's pause heasked:--"But why?""You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer,too.""But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnestduty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable thanany of us from--from circumstances--things that have been." He paused,embarrassed.As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--"I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun iscoming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills meI must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come bywile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan." God saw the look thatshe turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angelthat look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp herhand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief oftears. She went on:--"You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for youcan defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who hadto guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise meand so learn that which even I myself do not know." Dr. Van Helsing saidvery gravely:--"Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; andtogether we shall do that which we go forth to achieve." When he hadspoken, Mina's long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallenback on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled upthe blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsingmotioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and withina minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.He told them what Mina had said, and went on:--"In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with anew factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agonyto tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we arewarned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must beready to act the instant when that ship arrives.""What shall we do exactly?" asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professorpaused before replying:--"We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identifiedthe box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shallfasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says thesuperstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it wasman's faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then,when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, weshall open the box, and--and all will be well.""I shall not wait for any opportunity," said Morris. "When I see the boxI shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousandmen looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!" Igrasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.I think he understood my look; I hope he did."Good boy," said Dr. Van Helsing. "Brave boy. Quincey is all man. Godbless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind orpause from any fear. I do but say what we may do--what we must do. But,indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many thingswhich may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various thatuntil the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways; andwhen the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. Nowlet us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touchon others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of uscan tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my ownaffairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go makearrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth forour journey."There was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settleup all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if shesurvive is my sole heir. If it should not be so, then the others whohave been so good to us shall have remainder.It is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina's uneasiness calls myattention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which thetime of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowingtimes for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some newdanger--some new pain, which, however, may in God's will be means to agood end. I write all these things in the diary since my darling mustnot hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, theyshall be ready.She is calling to me.CHAPTER XXVDR. SEWARD'S DIARY_11 October, Evening._--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as hesays he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs.Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come tounderstand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduingor restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or conditionbegins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and laststill either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow withthe rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort ofnegative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolutefreedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases thechange-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell ofwarning silence.To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all thesigns of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making aviolent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very fewminutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioningher husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband's handin hers began:--"We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know,dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end." This was toher husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. "Inthe morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be instore for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take mewith you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weakwoman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rateat stake--you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are.There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; whichmust destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, youknow as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know thereis one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!" She lookedappealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband."What is that way?" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. "What is thatway, which we must not--may not--take?""That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, beforethe greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were Ionce dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as youdid my poor Lucy's. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thingthat stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst thefriends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to diein such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to bedone, is God's will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here thecertainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be theblackest things that the world or the nether world holds!" We were allsilent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. Thefaces of the others were set and Harker's grew ashen grey; perhaps heguessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:--"This is what I can give into the hotch-pot." I could not but note thequaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with allseriousness. "What will each of you give? Your lives I know," she wenton quickly, "that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God's, and youcan give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?" She lookedagain questioningly, but this time avoided her husband's face. Quinceyseemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. "Then I shall tellyou plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in thisconnection between us now. You must promise me, one and all--even you,my beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me.""What is that time?" The voice was Quincey's, but it was low andstrained."When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better thatI die that I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,without a moment's delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head;or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!"Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before herand taking her hand in his said solemnly:--"I'm only a rough fellow, who hasn't, perhaps, lived as a man should towin such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred anddear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the dutythat you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make allcertain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time hascome!""My true friend!" was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,bending over, she kissed his hand."I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!" said Van Helsing."And I!" said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her totake the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to herwan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness ofhis hair, and asked:--"And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?""You too, my dearest," she said, with infinite yearning of pity in hervoice and eyes. "You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest andall the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and alltime. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killedtheir wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into thehands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more becausethose that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men's dutytowards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, mydear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be atthe hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have notforgotten your mercy in poor Lucy's case to him who loved"--she stoppedwith a flying blush, and changed her phrase--"to him who had best rightto give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to makeit a happy memory of my husband's life that it was his loving hand whichset me free from the awful thrall upon me.""Again I swear!" came the Professor's resonant voice. Mrs. Harkersmiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back andsaid:--"And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget:this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and insuch case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such atime I myself might be--nay! if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leaguedwith your enemy against you.""One more request;" she became very solemn as she said this, "it is notvital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing forme, if you will." We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no needto speak:--"I want you to read the Burial Service." She was interrupted by a deepgroan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over herheart, and continued: "You must read it over me some day. Whatever maybe the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweetthought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, forthen it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may!""But oh, my dear one," he pleaded, "death is afar off from you.""Nay," she said, holding up a warning hand. "I am deeper in death atthis moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!""Oh, my wife, must I read it?" he said, before he began."It would comfort me, my husband!" was all she said; and he began toread when she had got the book ready."How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, itssolemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, itssweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bittertruth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the hearthad he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneelinground that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion ofher husband's voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often hehad to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burialof the Dead. I--I cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!"       *       *       *       *       *She was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it mayhereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, itcomforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker's comingrelapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to anyof us as we had dreaded._Jonathan Harker's Journal.__15 October, Varna._--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th,got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in theOrient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about fiveo'clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram hadarrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--"theOdessus." The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eagerto get on, to care for them. Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes intoport there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour iscoming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she sleptnearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is verywakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing tohypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and hehad to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if byhabit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power atthese particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. Healways asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:--"Nothing; all is dark." And to the second:--"I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushingby. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind ishigh--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam."It is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening onher way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had fourtelegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:that the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd's fromanywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent shouldsend him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. Hewas to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might besure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.We had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see theVice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the shipas soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to geton the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes theform of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, andso cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man's form withoutsuspicion--which he evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in thebox. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy;for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy,before he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count formuch. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or theseamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything,and we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that theship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our beingwarned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, Ithink!       *       *       *       *       *_16 October._--Mina's report still the same: lapping waves and rushingwater, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, andwhen we hear of the _Czarina Catherine_ we shall be ready. As she mustpass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.       *       *       *       *       *_17 October._--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcomethe Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers thathe fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen froma friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his ownrisk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him everyfacility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also asimilar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, whowas much impressed with Godalming's kindly manner to him, and we are allsatisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. Wehave already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If theCount is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once anddrive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shallprevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shallhave ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count's body,it will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be noevidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. Buteven if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhapssome day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us anda rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if itwere to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out ourintent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the_Czarina Catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by a specialmessenger.       *       *       *       *       *_24 October._--A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming,but only the same story: "Not yet reported." Mina's morning and eveninghypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creakingmasts._Telegram, October 24th.__Rufus Smith, Lloyd's, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M.Vice-Consul, Varna._"_Czarina Catherine_ reported this morning from Dardanelles."_Dr. Seward's Diary.__25 October._--How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen isirksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild withexcitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd's. Iknow now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs.Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. Afterall, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not tolet her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show anyexcitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I amsure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; butin this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. Thelethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and isgetting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. Wetalk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. Itwould break poor Harker's heart--certainly his nerve--if he knew that wehad even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me,her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, forhe says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no activedanger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would benecessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have tobe, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We shouldneither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate."Euthanasia" is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful towhoever invented it.It is only about 24 hours' sail from the Dardanelles to here, at therate the _Czarina Catherine_ has come from London. She should thereforearrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get inbefore then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at oneo'clock, so as to be ready.       *       *       *       *       *_25 October, Noon_.--No news yet of the ship's arrival. Mrs. Harker'shypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possiblethat we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever ofexcitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, andan hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knifewhich he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for theCount if the edge of that "Kukri" ever touches his throat, driven bythat stern, ice-cold hand!Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. Aboutnoon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although wekept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. Shehad been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to knowthat she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casuallythat she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went toher room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked sowell and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her thananything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonderthat sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleepof some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she hadbeen for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever hemay be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. Tohis doom, I trust!       *       *       *       *       *_26 October._--Another day and no tidings of the _Czarina Catherine_.She ought to be here by now. That she is still journeying _somewhere_ isapparent, for Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report at sunrise was still thesame. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fogboth to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, asthe ship may now be signalled any moment.       *       *       *       *       *_27 October, Noon._--Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for.Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: "lappingwaves and rushing water," though she added that "the waves were veryfaint." The telegrams from London have been the same: "no furtherreport." Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that hefears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly:--"I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina's. Souls and memories can dostrange things during trance." I was about to ask him more, but Harkerjust then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-nightat sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.       *       *       *       *       *     _28 October._--Telegram. _Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming,     care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna._     "_Czarina Catherine_ reported entering Galatz at one o'clock     to-day."_Dr. Seward's Diary.__28 October._--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz Ido not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have beenexpected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt wouldcome; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that thingswould not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where thechange would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I supposethat nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe againstourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should knowthat they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even ifit be a will-o'-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we alltook it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for amoment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not aword, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. LordGodalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself halfstunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morristightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in ourold wandering days it meant "action." Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, sothat the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her handsmeekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled--actually smiled--thedark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time hisaction belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt ofthe great Kukri knife and rested there. "When does the next train startfor Galatz?" said Van Helsing to us generally."At 6:30 to-morrow morning!" We all started, for the answer came fromMrs. Harker."How on earth do you know?" said Art."You forget--or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and sodoes Dr. Van Helsing--that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter Ialways used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to myhusband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study ofthe time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to CastleDracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so Ilearned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn,as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.""Wonderful woman!" murmured the Professor."Can't we get a special?" asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook hishead: "I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; evenif we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as ourregular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get thetickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Doyou, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from himletters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the shipjust as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and gethis aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our waysmooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will staywith Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long youmay be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am herewith Madam to make report.""And I," said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than shehad been for many a long day, "shall try to be of use in all ways, andshall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shiftingfrom me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!"The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed torealise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning toeach other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at thetime, however.When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part ofHarker's journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the doorwas shut upon her he said to me:--"We mean the same! speak out!""There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it maydeceive us.""Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?""No!" said I, "unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.""You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tellyou something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk;but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said thosewords that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. Inthe trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read hermind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the shipwith water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learnthen that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life witheyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not."He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;but he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, thatso she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains thathave been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, willcome higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish andtherefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just whenwe want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her greatbrain which is trained like man's brain, but is of sweet woman and havea special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take awayaltogether--though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shalllearn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I neverfeared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!"I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlledhimself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped intothe room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seeminglyforgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheetsof typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his facebrightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger andthumb he said:--"Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too,dear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever tothink. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear tolet him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back towhere that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thoughtat all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yetstrong to use his little wings. Nay, like the "Ugly Duck" of my friendHans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought thatsail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See Iread here what Jonathan have written:--"That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, broughthis forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he wasbeaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to comealone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.""What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count's child-thought seenothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; myman-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another wordfrom some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not whatit mean--what it _might_ mean. Just as there are elements which rest,yet when in nature's course they move on their way and they touch--thenpouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and killand destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues andleagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you everstudy the philosophy of crime? 'Yes' and 'No.' You, John, yes; for it isa study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--notbut once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari aduniversale_. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant,in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not muchfrom philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is tobe empiric. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the truecriminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning andresourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be ofchild-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crimealso; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what hehave done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn notby principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is tohim the ground to start from to do more. '_Dos pou sto_,' saidArchimedes. 'Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!' To do once,is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he havethe purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time,just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes areopened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues," forMrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:--"Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see withthose so bright eyes." He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively andunconsciously, as she spoke:--"The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso wouldso classify him, and _quâ_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is aclue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his ownlips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a'tight place,' he went back to his own country from the land he hadtried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himselffor a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when allhope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back overthe sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danubefrom Turkey Land.""Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!" said Van Helsing,enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later hesaid to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-roomconsultation:--"Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope." Turning toher again, he said with keen expectation:--"But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;John and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.Speak, without fear!""I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.""Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.""Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is smalland his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to onepurpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on beingsafe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhatfrom the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadfulnight. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soulis freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts meis a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge forhis ends." The Professor stood up:--"He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up toGalatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is inGod's Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on forhis selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is takenin his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think heis free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with somany hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him tosleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! Thatterrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to himin spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when thesun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his;and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from yoursuffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he knowit not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from hisknowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believethat God is with us through all this blackness, and these many darkhours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we perilourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a greathour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribeand write him all down, so that when the others return from their workyou can give it to them; then they shall know as we do."And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harkerhas written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.CHAPTER XXVIDR. SEWARD'S DIARY_29 October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Lastnight we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of ushad done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, andfor our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer andmore serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usuallynecessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; butthis time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them prettyresolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--"I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only asteady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hearmen's voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars inthe rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are draggedalong. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the airblowing upon me."Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she layon the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting aweight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilstHarker's hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. Therewas a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak waspassing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly shesat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--"Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!" Wecould only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to gettea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--"You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left hisearth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may liehidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship donot touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it bein the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he didat Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless hebe carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs menmay discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not onshore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall comeon him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be histrue self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered."There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for herresponse in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in comingthan before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise wasso short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his wholesoul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she madereply:--"All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking asof wood on wood." She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait tillto-night.And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony ofexpectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannotpossibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two morehypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throwmore light on what is happening.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time whenthere was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at astation, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily thanthis morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count'ssensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me thather imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trancehitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goeson it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count's powerover her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would bea happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she didspeak, her words were enigmatical:--"Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I canhear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues,fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves." She stopped and ashudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, evenin answer to the Professor's imperative questioning. When she woke fromthe trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind wasall alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and insilence.       *       *       *       *       *_30 October, 7 a. m._--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have timeto write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced noeffect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a stillgreater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professorlost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--"All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and thecreaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, aqueer one like----" She stopped and grew white, and whiter still."Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!" said Van Helsing in an agonisedvoice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sunwas reddening even Mrs. Harker's pale face. She opened her eyes, and weall started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmostunconcern:--"Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can't? I don't rememberanything." Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,turning from one to the other with a troubled look:--"What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I waslying here, half asleep, and heard you say go on! speak, I command you!'It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a badchild!""Oh, Madam Mina," he said, sadly, "it is proof, if proof be needed, ofhow I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken moreearnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom Iam proud to obey!"The whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire withanxiety and eagerness._Mina Harker's Journal.__30 October._--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had beenordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, sincehe does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributedmuch as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to theVice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of somesort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the twodoctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrivalof the _Czarina Catherine_.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and theVice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power._Jonathan Harker's Journal.__30 October._--At nine o'clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I calledon Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm ofHapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to LordGodalming's telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility intheir power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at onceon board the _Czarina Catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the riverharbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of hisvoyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable arun."Man!" he said, "but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we shouldhave to pay for it wi' some rare piece o' ill luck, so as to keep up theaverage. It's no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi' a windahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin' on yer sail for hisain purpose. An' a' the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigha ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi' us,till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing couldwe see. We ran by Gibraltar wi'oot bein' able to signal; an' till wecame to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, wenever were within hail o' aught. At first I inclined to slack off sailand beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if theDeil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do itwhether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to ourmiscredit wi' the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an' the Old Mon whohad served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for nohinderin' him." This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstitionand commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--"Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; andhe know when he meet his match!" The skipper was not displeased with thecompliment, and went on:--"When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o' them,the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which hadbeen put on board by a queer lookin' old man just before we had startedfrae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twafingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but thesupersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboottheir business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us Ifelt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn't say it wasagin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn't let up forfive days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to getsomewheres--well, he would fetch it up a'reet. An' if he didn't, well,we'd keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way anddeep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin' sun camethrough the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out thebox and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi' them aboot it wi' ahandspike; an' when the last o' them rose off the deck wi' his head inhis hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, theproperty and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in theriver Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready tofling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I'd let itlie till we discharged in the port an' get rid o't althegither. Wedidn't do much clearin' that day, an' had to remain the nicht at anchor;but in the mornin', braw an' airly, an hour before sun-up, a man cameaboard wi' an order, written to him from England, to receive a boxmarked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready tohis hand. He had his papers a' reet, an' glad I was to be rid o' thedam' thing, for I was beginnin' masel' to feel uneasy at it. If the Deildid have any luggage aboord the ship, I'm thinkin' it was nane itherthan that same!""What was the name of the man who took it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing withrestrained eagerness."I'll be tellin' ye quick!" he answered, and, stepping down to hiscabin, produced a receipt signed "Immanuel Hildesheim." Burgen-strasse16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; sowith thanks we came away.We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the AdelphiTheatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments werepointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a littlebargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple butimportant. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, tellinghim to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a boxwhich would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was togive in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovakswho traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work byan English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the DanubeInternational Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him tothe ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was allhe knew.We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of hisneighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he hadgone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated byhis landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the housetogether with the rent due, in English money. This had been between tenand eleven o'clock last night. We were at a standstill again.Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out thatthe body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard ofSt. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wildanimal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, thewomen crying out "This is the work of a Slovak!" We hurried away lest weshould have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were allconvinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but wherethat might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came hometo the hotel to Mina.When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Minaagain into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is atleast a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I wasreleased from my promise to her._Mina Harker's Journal.__30 October, evening._--They were so tired and worn out and dispiritedthat there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I askedthem all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everythingup to the moment. I feel so grateful to the man who invented the"Traveller's" typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one forme. I should have felt quite; astray doing the work if I had to writewith a pen....It is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered,what must he be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming tobreathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit; hisface is drawn with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I cansee his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. Oh!if I could only help at all.... I shall do what I can.I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that Ihave not yet seen.... Whilst they are resting, I shall go over allcarefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion. I shall try tofollow the Professor's example, and think without prejudice on the factsbefore me....       *       *       *       *       *I do believe that under God's providence I have made a discovery. Ishall get the maps and look over them....       *       *       *       *       *I am more than ever sure that I am right. My new conclusion is ready, soI shall get our party together and read it. They can judge it; it iswell to be accurate, and every minute is precious._Mina Harker's Memorandum._(Entered in her Journal.)_Ground of inquiry._--Count Dracula's problem is to get back to his ownplace.(_a_) He must be _brought back_ by some one. This is evident; for had hepower to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf,or bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery orinterference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be--confinedas he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.(_b_) _How is he to be taken?_--Here a process of exclusions may helpus. By road, by rail, by water?1. _By Road._--There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving thecity.(_x_) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint,a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.(_y_) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.(_z_) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in orderto prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, evenhis victim--me!2. _By Rail._--There is no one in charge of the box. It would have totake its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemieson the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, ifleft in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is notwhat he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.3. _By Water._--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with mostdanger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; eventhen he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But werehe wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he wouldindeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it wereunfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position wouldstill be desperate.We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to dois to ascertain _what_ water.The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,then, get a light on what his later task is to be._Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as partof his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and hadto arrange as best he could._Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts weknow of, what he has done here.As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sentinvoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means ofexit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to ImmanuelHildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There isalso the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; butthere must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came toHildesheim.That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson'ssuspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canninessplayed the Count's game for him, and he ran with his favouring windthrough fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That theCount's arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim clearedthe box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and herewe lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have beenavoided.Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_onland_, at Galatz.The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count couldappear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all toaid in the work? In my husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealingwith the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man'sremark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the generalfeeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to hiscastle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought fromthe castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovakswho took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange thisservice. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, hecame out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as toarranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, andhe knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,by murdering his agent.I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for theSlovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read inthe typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirlinglevel with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars orpoles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. Therewould be no such sound if floating down stream.Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we maypossibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the moreeasily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritzawhich runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly asclose to Dracula's castle as can be got by water._Mina Harker's Journal--continued._When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. Theothers kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said:--"Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have been wherewe were blinded. Now we are on the track once again, and this time wemay succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come onhim by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but heis powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carryhim may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throwhim in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men,to our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and allshall do.""I shall get a steam launch and follow him," said Lord Godalming."And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land," said Mr.Morris."Good!" said the Professor, "both good. But neither must go alone. Theremust be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong andrough, and he carries rude arms." All the men smiled, for amongst themthey carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:--"I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, andthere may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some otherprecautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker couldnot quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points." Dr.Seward said:--"I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunttogether, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may comealong. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight theSlovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don't suppose these fellows carryguns--would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; weshall, not rest until the Count's head and body have been separated, andwe are sure that he cannot re-incarnate." He looked at Jonathan as hespoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear wastorn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then theboat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He wassilent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--"Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because youare young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at thelast; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which haswrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; shewill be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run asonce; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or tofight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight inother way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now letme say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming andfriend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, andwhilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might belanded, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy'scountry. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the runningstream whence he cannot escape to land--where he dares not raise the lidof his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him toperish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritzover the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, MadamMina's hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--alldark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are nearthat fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to bemade sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated." HereJonathan interrupted him hotly:--"Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil's illness, rightinto the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven orHell!" He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--"Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellishinfamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and everyspeck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?Have you felt the Vampire's lips upon your throat?" Here he turned tome, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry:"Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!" and he sankdown on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor's voice, as hespoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmedus all:--"Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awfulplace that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into thatplace. There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may notsee. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes whatis to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are interrible straits. If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong andsubtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and thenin time our dear one"--he took my hand--"would come to him to keep himcompany, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You havetold us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as theyclutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; andwell may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it isnecessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving,possibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay,it is I who would have to go to keep them company.""Do as you will," said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, "weare in the hands of God!"       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, andso brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it dowhen basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, andthat both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willingto spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition couldnot start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will withinanother hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part eachof us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steamlaunch, with steam up ready to start at a moment's notice. Dr. Sewardand Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We haveall the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. ProfessorVan Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti,where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We arebringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage andhorses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trustin the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages,so we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me alarge-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed likethe rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on myforehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling methat I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is gettingcolder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go aswarnings.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--It took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling. We maynever meet again. Courage, Mina! the Professor is looking at you keenly;his look is a warning. There must be no tears now--unless it may be thatGod will let them fall in gladness._Jonathan Harker's Journal.__October 30. Night._--I am writing this in the light from the furnacedoor of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is anexperienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of hisown on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding ourplans, we finally decided that Mina's guess was correct, and that if anywaterway was chosen for the Count's escape back to his Castle, theSereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We tookit, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be theplace chosen for the crossing the country between the river and theCarpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river atnight; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart tomake steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me tosleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be onwatch. But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hangingover my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My onlycomfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it wouldbe easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr.Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started;they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higherlands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the followingof its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and leadtheir spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. Whenthey dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves lookafter the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so theycan mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, andcan be easily adapted for Mina, if required.It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along throughthe darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strikeus; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comeshome. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; intoa whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting thefurnace door....       *       *       *       *       *_31 October._--Still hurrying along. The day has come, and Godalming issleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heatis grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed onlya few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package ofanything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared everytime we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees andprayed.       *       *       *       *       *_1 November, evening._--No news all day; we have found nothing of thekind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrongin our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, bigand little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat,and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters,so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got aRoumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which wehave over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had everydeference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we choseto ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. Thiswas before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether theboat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Funduwe could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in thenight. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tellupon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that heshall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poordear Mina and me.       *       *       *       *       *_2 November, morning._--It is broad daylight. That good fellow would notwake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully andwas forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have sleptso long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a newman this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can doall that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, andkeeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back tome. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got toVeresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get thecarriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, theywould be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I amafraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but wecannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder howDr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endlessstreams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of themare very large--at present, at all events, though they are terribledoubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not havemet much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may seethem; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may benecessary to take counsel together what to do next._Dr. Seward's Diary.__2 November._--Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write itif there had been, for every moment is precious. We have had only therest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully.Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on;we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.       *       *       *       *       *_3 November._--We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up theBistritza. I wish it wasn't so cold. There are signs of snow coming; andif it falls heavy it will stop us. In such case we must get a sledge andgo on, Russian fashion.       *       *       *       *       *_4 November._--To-day we heard of the launch having been detained by anaccident when trying to force a way up the rapids. The Slovak boats getup all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge. Some went uponly a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, andevidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they gotup the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chaseafresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; thepeasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she keptstopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must pushon harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon._Mina Harker's Journal.__31 October._--Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professor tells me thatthis morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all, and that all Icould say was: "dark and quiet." He is off now buying a carriage andhorses. He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, sothat we may be able to change them on the way. We have something morethan 70 miles before us. The country is lovely, and most interesting; ifonly we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be tosee it all. If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what apleasure it would be. To stop and see people, and learn something oftheir life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour andpicturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaintpeople! But, alas!--       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the carriage andhorses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. Thelandlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions; it seems enoughfor a company of soldiers. The Professor encourages her, and whispers tome that it may be a week before we can get any good food again. He hasbeen shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coatsand wraps, and all sorts of warm things. There will not be any chance ofour being cold.       *       *       *       *       *We shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what may happen to us. We aretruly in the hands of God. He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him,with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch overmy beloved husband; that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that Iloved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest andtruest thought will be always for him.CHAPTER XXVIIMINA HARKER'S JOURNAL_1 November._--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. Thehorses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they gowillingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so manychanges and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged tothink that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them wellto make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; andoff we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginablekinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem fullof nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the firsthouse where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on myforehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, tokeep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting anextra amount of garlic into our food; and I can't abide garlic. Eversince then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so haveescaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have nodriver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresaythat fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. TheProfessor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though hemade me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and hesays that I answered as usual "darkness, lapping water and creakingwood"; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think ofJonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I writethis whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr.Van Helsing is sleeping, Poor dear, he looks very tired and old andgrey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror's; even in his sleephe is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must makehim rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,and we must not break down when most of all his strength will beneeded.... All is ready; we are off shortly.       *       *       *       *       *_2 November, morning._--I was successful, and we took turns driving allnight; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strangeheaviness in the air--I say heaviness for want of a better word; I meanthat it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keepus comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered"darkness, creaking wood and roaring water," so the river is changing asthey ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance ofdanger--more than need be; but we are in God's hands.       *       *       *       *       *_2 November, night._--All day long driving. The country gets wilder aswe go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemedso far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round usand tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make aneffort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr.Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. Thehouses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horsewe got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. Hegot two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rudefour-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us notrouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I candrive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrivebefore. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, whatwill to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poordarling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, andthat He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in Hissight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deignto let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurredHis wrath._Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing.__4 November._--This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., ofPurfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It ismorning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have keptalive--Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the greyheavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for allwinter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to haveaffected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she wasnot like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usualso alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have losther appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write sofaithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well.However, to-night she is more _vif_. Her long sleep all day have refreshand restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunsetI try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grownless and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well,God's will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, Imust, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not gounrecorded.We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When Isaw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped ourcarriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made acouch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, butmore slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. Asbefore, came the answer: "darkness and the swirling of water." Then shewoke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some newguiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--"This is the way.""How know you it?" I ask."Of course I know it," she answer, and with a pause, add: "Have not myJonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?"At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only onesuch by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coachroad from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, andmore of use.So we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were wesure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snowhave fallen--the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, andthey go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathanhave note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, longhours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, andshe succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself tosuspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I maynot wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harmher; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times beall-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feelguilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with thereins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. Ilook down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunsettime, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as thoughit were the end of the world.Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, andthen I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being asthough I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her andmyself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when wefirst enter the Count's house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but sheis so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. Ilight a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and sheprepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I goto help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--thatshe was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I havegrave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. Shehelp me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside thefire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget allof watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lyingquiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twicemore the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When Iwake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyesobedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and thensleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I haveto lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I haveharnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she lookin her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like itnot. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--evento think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life anddeath, or more than these, and we must not flinch.       *       *       *       *       *_5 November, morning._--Let me be accurate in everything, for though youand I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first thinkthat I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so longstrain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, andmoving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have heldsometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though Idid have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food. Ibegan to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted asshe is with that Vampire baptism. "Well," said I to myself, "if it bethat she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep atnight." As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient andimperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I wakedwith a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina stillsleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowningmountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of asteep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tellof in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,the end was near.I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--foreven after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, andall was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fedthem in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I makeMadam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amidher rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying thatshe had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. ButI myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with thefear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, roundwhere Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, andI broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all thetime--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till thesnow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, sheclung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head tofeet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, whenshe had grown more quiet:--"Will you not come over to the fire?" for I wished to make a test ofwhat she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step shestopped, and stood as one stricken."Why not go on?" I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, satdown in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one wakedfrom sleep, she said simply:--"I cannot!" and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what shecould not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might bedanger to her body, yet her soul was safe!Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till Icame to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, theywhinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for atime. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive tothe cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming waswith quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I wasabout stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flyingsweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light ofsome kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though thesnow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women withtrailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horseswhinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began tofear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in thatring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were ofthe night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, andall the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan'shorrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mistbegan to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowyglimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horsescowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Eventhe madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. Ifeared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near andcircled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; whenI would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and heldme back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so lowit was:--"No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!" I turned to her, andlooking in her eyes, said:--"But you? It is for you that I fear!" whereat she laughed--a laugh, lowand unreal, and said:--"Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from themthan I am," and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff ofwind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for thewheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever withoutthe Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have nottake away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before mein actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, whenthey would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, thebright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuouslips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh camethrough the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed toher, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said wereof the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--"Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!" In fear I turned to my poorMadam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! theterror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to myheart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. Iseized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of theWafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, andlaughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; forI knew that we were safe within our protections. They could notapproach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained withinthe ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. Thehorses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell onthem softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poorbeasts no more of terror.And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through thesnow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; butwhen that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in thewhirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved awaytowards the castle, and were lost.Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intendingto hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which Icould not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she madeno response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I havemade my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I havemuch to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for theremay be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mistobscure it, will be to me a safety.I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terriblework. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in hersleep...._Jonathan Harker's Journal.__4 November, evening._--The accident to the launch has been a terriblething for us. Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago;and by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her,off on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and wefollow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. Wehave our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if onlyMorris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no moreGood-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you._Dr. Seward's Diary.__5 November._--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashingaway from the river with their leiter-wagon. They surrounded it in acluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightlyand there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our ownfeelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling ofwolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there aredangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready,and we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who,or where, or what, or when, or how it may be...._Dr. Van Helsing's Memorandum.__5 November, afternoon._--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercyat all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I leftMadam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti wasuseful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rustyhinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so thatbeing entered I might not get out. Jonathan's bitter experience servedme here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for Iknew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as ifthere was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Eitherthere was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.The dilemma had me between his horns.Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from theVampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! Iresolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we mustsubmit, if it were God's will. At any rate it was only death andfreedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself thechoice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in thanthe grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.I knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that areinhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in herVampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder asthough I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, whensuch things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine,found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay,and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of thewanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunsetcome, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fairwoman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to akiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampirefold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presenceof such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age andheavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour suchas the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing,with all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to ayearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog myvery soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and thestrange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain itwas that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yieldsto a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air along, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the soundof a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenchingaway tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared notpause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I shouldbegin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find ina high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sisterwhich, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms ofthe mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, soexquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which callssome of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirlwith new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear MadamMina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wroughtfurther upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I hadsearched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and asthere had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in thenight, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent.There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, andnobly proportioned. On it was but one word                                DRACULA.This then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many morewere due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through myawful work, I laid in Dracula's tomb some of the Wafer, and so banishedhim from it, Un-Dead, for ever.Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, ithad been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I hadbeen through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweetMiss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survivedthrough centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of theyears; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved bythoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall offear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, thoughtill all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seenthe repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it justere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had beenwon, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not haveendured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging ofwrithing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror andleft my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity themnow and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of deathfor a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knifesevered the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away andcrumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have comecenturies agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud "Iam here!"Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more canthe Count enter there Un-Dead.When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from hersleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much."Come!" she said, "come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet myhusband who is, I know, coming towards us." She was looking thin andpale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I wasglad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of thefresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meetour friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ arecoming to meet us._Mina Harker's Journal.__6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and Itook our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We didnot go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to takeheavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of beingleft without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of ourprovisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as wecould see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign ofhabitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavywalking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where theclear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky; for we were so deep underthe hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of theCarpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and withseemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountainon any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. Wecould hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but thesound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, wasfull of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching aboutthat he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be lessexposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; wecould trace it through the drifted snow.In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joinedhim. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by thehand and drew me in: "See!" he said, "here you will be in shelter; andif the wolves do come I can meet them one by one." He brought in ourfurs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions andforced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so wasrepulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I couldnot bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did notreproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the topof the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--"Look! Madam Mina, look! look!" I sprang up and stood beside him on therock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now fallingmore heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginningto blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between thesnow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where wewere it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond thewhite waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon inkinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not faroff--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came agroup of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, along leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tailwagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against thesnow as they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they werepeasants or gypsies of some kind.On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for Ifelt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, andwell I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisonedthere, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude allpursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Roundthe rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in lastnight. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--"At least you shall be safe here from _him_!" He took the glasses fromme, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us."See," he said, "they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, andgalloping as hard as they can." He paused and went on in a hollowvoice:--"They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God's will bedone!" Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the wholelandscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more hisglasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--"Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from thesouth. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snowblots it all out!" I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Sewardand Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.At the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking aroundI saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding atbreak-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party withthe cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, helaid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at theopening of our shelter. "They are all converging," he said. "When thetime comes we shall have gypsies on all sides." I got out my revolverready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves camelouder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank downtowards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I couldsee here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and largernumbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now infierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us incircling eddies. At times we could not see an arm's length before us;but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed toclear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had oflate been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knewwith fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long thesun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was lessthan an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the variousbodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercerand more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seeminglyhad driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of eachparty, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued didnot seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; theyseemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lowerand lower on the mountain tops.Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behindour rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determinedthat they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of ourpresence.All at once two voices shouted out to: "Halt!" One was my Jonathan's,raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris' strong resolutetone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, butthere was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words werespoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalmingand Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on theother. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat hishorse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to hiscompanions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprangforward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in anunmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. VanHelsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drewup. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of thegypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and heldhimself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out infront, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hilltops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horsesand dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeingJonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have beenupon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of ourparties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantlyformed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each oneshouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out theorder.In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ringof men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it wasevident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sunshould set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither thelevelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, northe howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract theirattention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of hispurpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively theycowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon thecart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the greatbox, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring ofSzgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and hadseen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, andthey cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at firstI thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprangbeside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see thatwith his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood wasspurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, foras Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attackedthe other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men thelid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, andthe top of the box was thrown back.By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and madeno resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and theshadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Countlying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling fromthe cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxenimage, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which Iknew too well.As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in themturned to triumph.But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife.I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the samemoment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart.It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in thedrawing of a breath, the whole body crumble into dust and passed fromour sight.I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of finaldissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I nevercould have imagined might have rested there.The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stoneof its broken battlements was articulated against the light of thesetting sun.The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinarydisappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away asif for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon theleiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leavingus alone.Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding hishand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. Iflew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did thetwo doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back hishead on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my handin that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish ofmy heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--"I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!" he criedsuddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, "It wasworth for this to die! Look! look!"The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleamsfell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulsethe men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest "Amen" broke from allas their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying manspoke:--"Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is notmore stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!"And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, agallant gentleman.                                  NOTESeven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness ofsome of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. Itis an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy's birthday is the sameday as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, thesecret belief that some of our brave friend's spirit has passed intohim. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; butwe call him Quincey.In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and wentover the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid andterrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the thingswhich we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears wereliving truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. Thecastle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.When we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could alllook back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happilymarried. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever sinceour return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all themass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly oneauthentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the laternote-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing's memorandum.We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these asproofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, withour boy on his knee:--"We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some dayknow what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows hersweetness and loving care; later on he will understand how some men soloved her, that they did dare much for her sake."JONATHAN HARKER.                                THE END       *       *       *       *       *                       _There's More to Follow!_     More stories of the sort you like; more, probably, by the author of     this one; more than 500 titles all told by writers of world-wide     reputation, in the Authors' Alphabetical List which you will find     on the _reverse side_ of the wrapper of this book.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tmProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution ofelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computersincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It existsbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations frompeople in all walks of life.Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with theassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm'sgoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection willremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the ProjectGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secureand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundationand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary ArchiveFoundationThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of thestate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the InternalRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identificationnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted athttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby     Chief Executive and Director     gbnewby@pglaf.orgSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project GutenbergLiterary Archive FoundationProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission ofincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can befreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widestarray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donationsare particularly important to maintaining tax exemptstatus with the IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulatingcharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the UnitedStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep upwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locationswhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  ToSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for anyparticular state visit http://pglaf.orgWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where wehave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibitionagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states whoapproach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot makeany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received fromoutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donationmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of otherways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donateSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.orgThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.The Project Gutenberg EBook of Gypsy Sorcery and Fortune Telling, by Charles Godfrey LelandThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and mostother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictionswhatsoever.

GYPSIES, TOADS, AND TOAD-LORE                             255PREFACE.This work contains a collection of the customs, usages, and ceremoniescurrent among gypsies, as regards fortune-telling, witch-doctoring,love-philtering, and other sorcery, illustrated by many anecdotes andinstances, taken either from works as yet very little known to theEnglish reader or from personal experiences. Within a very few years,since Ethnology and Archæology have received a great inspiration, andmuch enlarged their scope through Folk-lore, everything relating tosuch subjects is studied with far greater interest and to much greaterprofit than was the case when they were cultivated in a languid,half-believing, half-sceptical spirit which was in reality rather oneof mere romance than reason. Now that we seek with resolution to findthe whole truth, be it based on materialism, spiritualism, or theiridentity, we are amazed to find that the realm of marvel and mystery,of wonder and poetry, connected with what we vaguely call "magic,"far from being explained away or exploded, enlarges before us aswe proceed, and that not into a mere cloudland, gorgeous land, butinto a country of reality in which men of science who would once havedisdained the mere thought thereof are beginning to stray. Hypnotismhas really revealed far greater wonders than were ever established bythe fascinatores of old or by mesmerists of more modern times. Memory,the basis of thought according to Plato, which was once held to bea determined quantity, has been proved, (the word is not too bold),by recent physiology, to be practically infinite, and its perfectdevelopment to be identical with that of intellect, so that wenow see plainly before us the power to perform much which was onceregarded as miraculous. Not less evident is it that men of scienceor practical inventors, such as Darwin, Wallace, Huxley, Tyndale,Galton, Joule, Lockyer, and Edison, have been or are all working incommon with theosophists, spiritualists, Folk-lorists, and many more,not diversely but all towards a grand solution of the Unknown.Therefore there is nothing whatever in the past relating to theinfluences which have swayed man, however strange, eccentric,superstitious, or even repulsive they may seem, which is not of greatand constantly increasing value. And if we of the present time beginalready to see this, how much more important will these facts be to themen of the future, who, by virtue of more widely extended knowledge andcomparison, will be better able than we are to draw wise conclusionsundreamed of now. But the chief conclusion for us is to collect asmuch as we can, while it is yet extant, of all the strange lore of theolden time, instead of wasting time in forming idle theories about it.In a paper read before the Congrès des Traditions populaires in Paris,1889, on the relations of gypsies to Folk-lore, I set forth my beliefthat these people have always been the humble priests of what is reallythe practical religion of all peasants and poor people; that is theirmagical ceremonies and medicine. Very few have any conception of thedegree to which gypsies have been the colporteurs of what in Italyis called "the old faith," or witchcraft.As regards the illustrative matter given, I am much indebted toDr. Wlislocki, who has probably had far more intimate personalexperience of gypsies than any other learned man who ever lived,through our mutual friend, Dr. Anthon Herrmann, editor of theEthnologische Mitteilungen, Budapest, who is also himself anaccomplished Romany scholar and collector, and who has kindly takena warm interest in this book, and greatly aided it. To these I mayadd Dr. Friedrich S. Krauss, of Vienna, whose various works on thesuperstitions and Folk-lore of the South Slavonians--kindly presentedby him to me--contain a vast mine of material, nearly all that of whichhe treats being common property between peasants and the Romany, asother sources abundantly indicate. With this there is also much whichI collected personally among gypsies and fortune-tellers, and similarcharacters, it being true as regards this work and its main object,that there is much cognate or allied information which is quite asvaluable as gypsy-lore itself, as all such subjects mutually explainone of the others.Gypsies, as I have said, have done more than any race or class onthe face of the earth to disseminate among the multitude a beliefin fortune-telling, magical or sympathetic cures, amulets and suchsmall sorceries as now find a place in Folk-lore. Their women haveall pretended to possess occult power since prehistoric times. Bythe exercise of their wits they have actually acquired a certainart of reading character or even thought, which, however it beallied to deceit, is in a way true in itself, and well worth carefulexamination. Matthew Arnold has dwelt on it with rare skill in hispoem of "The Gypsy Scholar." Even deceit and imposture never heldits own as a system for ages without some ground-work of truth, andthat which upheld the structure of gypsy sorcery, has never been verycarefully examined. I trust that I have done this in a rational andphilosophic spirit, and have also illustrated my remarks in a mannerwhich will prove attractive to the general reader.There are many good reasons for believing that the greatest portion ofgypsy magic was brought by the Romany from the East or India. This isspecially true as regards those now dwelling in Eastern Europe. Andit is certainly interesting to observe that among these people thereis still extant, on a very extended scale indeed, a Shamanism whichseems to have come from the same Tartar-Altaic source which wasfound of yore among the Accadian-Babylonians, Etruscan races, andIndian hill-tribes. This, the religion of the drum and the demon as adisease--or devil doctoring--will be found fully illustrated in manycurious ways in these pages. I believe that in describing it I havealso shown how many fragments of this primitive religion, or cult,still exist, under very different names, in the most enlightenedcentres of civilization. And I respectfully submit to my reader,or critic, that I have in no instance, either in this or any othercase, wandered from my real subject, and that the entire work formsa carefully considered and consistent whole. To perfect my title,I should perhaps have added a line or two to the effect that I haveillustrated many of the gypsy sorceries by instances of Folk-lore drawnfrom other sources; but I believe that it is nowhere inappropriate,considering the subject as a whole. For those who would lay stresson omissions in my book, I would say that I have never intended orpretended to exhaust gypsy superstitions. I have not even given allthat may be found in the works of Wlislocki alone. I have, accordingto the limits of the book, cited so much as to fully illustrate themain subject already described, and this will be of more interest tothe student of history than the details of gypsy chiromancy or morespells and charms than are necessary to explain the leading ideas.What is wanted in the present state of Folk-lore, I here repeat, iscollection from original sources, and material, that is from peopleand not merely from books. The critics we have--like the poor--alwayswith us, and a century hence we shall doubtless have far better onesthan those in whom we now rejoice--or sorrow. But material abidesno time, and an immense quantity of it which is world-old perishesevery day. For with general culture and intelligence we are killingall kinds of old faiths, with wonderful celerity. The time is near athand when it will all be incredibly valuable, and then men will wishsorrowfully enough that there had been more collectors to accumulateand fewer critics to detract from their labours and to discouragethem. For the collector must form his theory, or system great orsmall, good or bad, such as it is, in order to gather his facts;and then the theory is shattered by the critic and the collectionmade to appear ridiculous. And so collection ends.There is another very curious reflection which has been ever presentto my mind while writing this work, and which the reader will do wellcarefully to think out for himself. It is that the very first effortsof the human mind towards the supernatural were gloomy, strange, andwild; they were of witchcraft and sorcery, dead bodies, defilement,deviltry, and dirt. Men soon came to believe in the virtue of therepetition of certain rhymes or spells in connection with dead men'sbones, hands, and other horrors or "relics." To this day this oldreligion exists exactly as it did of yore, wherever men are ignorant,stupid, criminal, or corresponding to their prehistoric ancestors. Imyself have seen a dead man's hand for sale in Venice. Accordingto Dr. Block, says a writer in The St. James's Gazette, January 16,1889, the corpse-candle superstition is still firmly enshrined amongthe tenets of thieves all over Europe. In reality, according to TheStandard, we know little about the strange thoughts which agitate theminds of the criminal classes. Their creeds are legends. Most of themare the children and grandchildren of thieves who have been broughtup from their youth in the densest ignorance, and who, constantlyat war with society, seek the aid of those powers of darkness in thedread efficacy of which they have an unshaken confidence.   "Fetishism of the rudest type, or what the mythologists have    learned to call 'animism' is part and parcel of the robber's    creed. A 'habit and repute' thief has always in his pocket, or    somewhere about his person, a bit of coal, or chalk, or a 'lucky    stone,' or an amulet of some sort on which he relies for safety    in his hour of peril. Omens he firmly trusts in. Divination is    regularly practised by him, as the occasional quarrels over the    Bible and key, and the sieve and shears, testify. The supposed    power of witches and wizards make many of them live in terror,    and pay blackmail, and although they will lie almost without    a motive, the ingenuity with which the most depraved criminal    will try to evade 'kissing the book,' performing this rite with    his thumb instead, is a curious instance of what may be termed    perverted religious instincts. As for the fear of the evil eye, it    is affirmed that most of the foreign thieves of London dread more    being brought before a particular magistrate who has the reputation    of being endowed with that fatal gift than of being summarily    sentenced by any other whose judicial glare is less severe."This is all true, but it tells only a small part of the truth. Notonly is Fetish or Shamanism the real religion of criminals, but ofvast numbers who are not suspected of it. There is not a town inEngland or in Europe in which witchcraft (its beginning) is notextensively practised, although this is done with a secrecy thesuccess of which is of itself almost a miracle. We may erect churchesand print books, but wherever the prehistoric man exists--and he isstill to be found everywhere by millions--he will cling to the oldwitchcraft of his remote ancestors. Until you change his very nature,the only form in which he can realize supernaturalism will be by meansof superstition, and the grossest superstition at that. Research andreflection have taught me that this sorcery is far more widely anddeeply extended than any cultivated person dreams--instead of yieldingto the progress of culture it seems to actually advance with it. CountAngelo de Gubernatis once remarked to one of the most distinguishedEnglish statesmen that there was in the country in Tuscany ten timesas much heathenism as Christianity. The same remark was made to meby a fortune-teller in Florence. She explained what she meant. Itwas the vecchia religione--"the old religion"--not Christianity,but the dark and strange sorceries of the stregha, or witch, thecompounding of magical medicine over which spells are muttered, themaking love-philters, the cursing enemies, the removing the influenceof other witches, and the manufacture of amulets in a manner prohibitedby the Church.It would seem as if, by some strange process, while advancedscientists are occupied in eliminating magic from religion, thecoarser mind is actually busy in reducing it to religion alone. Ithas been educated sufficiently to perceive an analogy between deadman's hands and "relics" as working miracles, and as sorcery is moreentertaining than religion, and has, moreover, the charm of secrecy,the prehistoric man, who is still with us, prefers the former. Becausecertain forms of this sorcery are no longer found among the educatedclasses we think that superstition no longer exists; but though weno longer burn witches or believe in fairies, it is a fact that ofa kind and fashion proportionate to our advanced culture, it is,with a very few exceptions, as prevalent as ever. Very few personsindeed have ever given this subject the attention which it merits,for it is simply idle to speculate on the possibility of cultivatingor sympathizing with the lowest orders without really understandingit in all its higher forms. And I venture to say that, as regards aliteral and truthful knowledge of its forms and practices, this workwill prove to be a contribution to the subject not without value.I have, in fact, done my best to set forth in it a very singular truthwhich is of great importance to every one who takes any real interestin social science, or the advance of intelligence. It is that whilealmost everybody who contributes to general literature, be it booksof travel or articles in journals, has ever and anon something cleverto say about superstition among the lower orders at home or abroad,be it in remote country places or in the mountains of Italy, with theusual cry of "Would it be believed--in the nineteenth century?" &c.;it still remains true that the amount of belief in magic--call it bywhat name we will--in the world is just as great as ever it was. Andhere I would quote with approbation a passage from "The Conditions forthe Survival of Archaic Customs," by G. L. Gomme, in The ArchæologicalReview of January, 1890:--   "If Folk-lore has done nothing else up to this date it has    demonstrated that civilization, under many of its phases, while    elevating the governing class of a nation, and thereby no doubt    elevating the nation, does not always reach the lowest or even the    lower strata of the population. As Sir Arthur Mitchell puts it,    'There is always a going up of some and a going down of others,'    and it is more than probable that just as the going up of the    few is in one certain direction, along certain well-ascertained    lines of improvement or development, so the going down of the    many is in an equally well-ascertained line of degradation    or backwardness. The upward march is always towards political    improvement, carrying with it social development; the downward    march is always towards social degradation, carrying with it    political backwardness. It seems difficult indeed to believe that    monarchs like Ælfred, Eadward, William, and Edward, could have had    within their Christianized kingdom groups of people whose status    was still that of savagery; it seems difficult to believe that    Raleigh and Spenser actually beheld specimens of the Irish savage;    it seems impossible to read Kemble and Green and Freeman and yet    to understand that they are speaking only of the advanced guard of    the English nation, not of the backward races within the boundary    of its island home. The student of archaic custom has, however,    to meet these difficulties, and it seems necessary, therefore,    to try and arrive at some idea as to what the period of savagery    in these islands really means."Which is a question that very few can answer. There is to be foundin almost every cheap book, or "penny dreadful" and newspaper shopin Great Britain and America, for sale at a very low price a Bookof Fate--or something equivalent to it, for the name of these worksis legion--and one publisher advertises that he has nearly thirty ofthem, or at least such books with different titles. In my copy thereare twenty-five pages of incantations, charms, and spells, every oneof them every whit as "superstitious" as any of the gypsy ceremoniesset forth in this volume. I am convinced, from much inquiry, that nextto the Bible and the Almanac there is no one book which is so muchdisseminated among the million as the fortune-teller, in some formor other. [1] That is to say, there are, numerically, many millionsmore of believers in such small sorcery now in Great Britain thanthere were centuries ago, for, be it remembered, the superstitionsof the masses were always petty ones, like those of the fate-books;it was only the aristocracy who consulted Cornelius Agrippa, andcould afford la haute magie. We may call it by other names, but fry,boil, roast, powder or perfume it as we will, the old faith in thesupernatural and in "occult" means of getting at it still exists in oneform or another--the parable or moral of most frequent occurrence init being that of the Mote and the Beam, of the real and full meaningof which I can only reply in the ever-recurring refrain of the Edda:"Understand ye this--or what?"CHAPTER I.THE ORIGIN OF WITCHCRAFT, SHAMANISM, AND SORCERY.--VINDICTIVE ANDMISCHIEVOUS MAGIC.As their peculiar perfume is the chief association with spices,so sorcery is allied in every memory to gypsies. And as it has notescaped many poets that there is something more strangely sweetand mysterious in the scent of cloves than in that of flowers, sothe attribute of inherited magic power adds to the romance of thesepicturesque wanderers. Both the spices and the Romany come from thefar East--the fatherland of divination and enchantment. The latterhave been traced with tolerable accuracy, if we admit their affinitywith the Indian Dom and Domar, back to the threshold of history, orwell-nigh into prehistoric times, and in all ages they, or their women,have been engaged, as if by elvish instinct, in selling enchantments,peddling prophecies and palmistry, and dealing with the devil generallyin a small retail way. As it was of old so it is to-day--    Ki shan i Romani    Adoi san' i chov'hani.    Wherever gypsies go,    There the witches are, we know.It is no great problem in ethnology or anthropology as to how gypsiesbecame fortune-tellers. We may find a very curious illustration ofit in the wren. This is apparently as humble, modest, prosaic littlefowl as exists, and as far from mystery and wickedness as an oldhen. But the ornithologists of the olden time, and the myth-makers,and the gypsies who lurked and lived in the forest, knew better. Theysaw how this bright-eyed, strange little creature in her elvish wayslipped in and out of hollow trees and wood shade into sunlight,and anon was gone, no man knew whither, and so they knew that it wasan uncanny creature, and told wonderful tales of its deeds in humanform, and to-day it is called by gypsies in Germany, as in England,the witch-bird, or more briefly, chorihani, "the witch." Just so thegypsies themselves, with their glittering Indian eyes, slipping likethe wren in and out of the shadow of the Unknown, and anon away andinvisible, won for themselves the name which now they wear. WhereverShamanism, or the sorcery which is based on exorcising or commandingspirits, exists, its professors from leading strange lives, or fromsolitude or wandering, become strange and wild-looking. When men havethis appearance people associate with it mysterious power. This isthe case in Tartary, Africa, among the Eskimo, Lapps, or Red Indians,with all of whom the sorcerer, voodoo or medaolin, has the eye ofthe "fascinator," glittering and cold as that of a serpent. So thegypsies, from the mere fact of being wanderers and out-of-doorslivers in wild places, became wild-looking, and when asked if theydid not associate with the devils who dwell in the desert places,admitted the soft impeachment, and being further questioned as towhether their friends the devils, fairies, elves, and goblins had nottaught them how to tell the future, they pleaded guilty, and findingthat it paid well, went to work in their small way to improve their"science," and particularly their pecuniary resources. It was an easycalling; it required no property or properties, neither capital norcapitol, shiners nor shrines, wherein to work the oracle. And as Ibelieve that a company of children left entirely to themselves wouldform and grow up with a language which in a very few years wouldbe spoken fluently, [2] so I am certain that the shades of night,and fear, pain, and lightning and mystery would produce in the sametime conceptions of dreaded beings, resulting first in demonology andthen in the fancied art of driving devils away. For out of my ownchildish experiences and memories I retain with absolute accuracymaterial enough to declare that without any aid from other peoplethe youthful mind forms for itself strange and seemingly supernaturalphenomena. A tree or bush waving in the night breeze by moonlight isperhaps mistaken for a great man, the mere repetition of the sightor of its memory make it a personal reality. Once when I was a childpowerful doses of quinine caused a peculiar throb in my ear which Ifor some time believed was the sound of somebody continually walkingupstairs. Very young children sometimes imagine invisible playmates orcompanions talk with them, and actually believe that the unseen talkto them in return. I myself knew a small boy who had, as he sincerelybelieved, such a companion, whom he called Bill, and when he couldnot understand his lessons he consulted the mysterious William, whoexplained them to him. There are children who, by the voluntary orinvoluntary exercise of visual perception or volitional eye-memory,[3] reproduce or create images which they imagine to be real, and thisfaculty is much commoner than is supposed. In fact I believe that whereit exists in most remarkable degrees the adults to whom the childrendescribe their visions dismiss them as "fancies" or falsehoods. Evenin the very extraordinary cases recorded by Professor Hale, in whichlittle children formed for themselves spontaneously a language inwhich they conversed fluently, neither their parents nor anybody elseappears to have taken the least interest in the matter. However, thefact being that babes can form for themselves supernatural conceptionsand embryo mythologies, and as they always do attribute to strangeor terrible-looking persons power which the latter do not possess,it is easy, without going further, to understand why a wild Indiangypsy, with eyes like a demon when excited, and unearthly-looking athis calmest, should have been supposed to be a sorcerer by credulouschild-like villagers. All of this I believe might have taken place,or really did take place, in the very dawn of man's existence asa rational creature--that as soon as "the frontal convolution ofthe brain which monkeys do not possess," had begun with the "genialtubercule," essential to language, to develop itself, then also certainother convolutions and tubercules, not as yet discovered, but whichad interim I will call "the ghost-making," began to act. "Genial,"they certainly were not--little joy and much sorrow has man got out ofhis spectro-facient apparatus--perhaps if it and talk are correlativehe might as well, many a time, have been better off if he were dumb.So out of the earliest time, in the very two o'clock of a mistymorning in history, man came forth believing in non-existent terrorsand evils as soon as he could talk, and talking about them as fastas he formed them. Long before the conception of anything good orbeneficent, or of a Heavenly Father or benevolent angels came to him,he was scared with nightmares and spirits of death and darkness,hell, hunger, torture, and terror. We all know how difficult itis for many people when some one dies out of a house-hold to getover the involuntary feeling that we shall unexpectedly meet thedeparted in the usual haunts. In almost every family there is arecord how some one has "heard a voice they cannot hear," or thedead speaking in the familiar tones. Hence the belief in ghosts,as soon as men began to care for death at all, or to miss those whohad gone. So first of all came terrors and spectres, or revenants,and from setting out food for the latter, which was the most obviousand childlike manner to please them, grew sacrifices to evil spirits,and finally the whole system of sacrifice in all its elaboration.It may therefore be concluded that as soon as man began to thinkand speak and fear the mysterious, he also began to appease ghostsand bugbears by sacrifices. Then there sprung up at once--quite asearly--the magus, or the cleverer man, who had the wit to do thesacrificing and eat the meats sacrificed, and explain that he hadarranged it all privately with the dead and the devils. He knew allabout them, and he could drive them away. This was the Shaman. Heseems to have had a Tartar-Mongol-mongrel-Turanian origin, somewherein Central Asia, and to have spread with his magic drum, and songs,and stinking smoke, exorcising his fiends all over the face of theearth, even as his descendant, General Booth, with his "devil-drivers"is doing at the present day. But the earliest authentic recordsof Shamanism are to be found in the Accadian, proto-Chaldæan andBabylon records. According to it all diseases whatever, as well as alldisasters, were directly the work of evil spirits, which were to bedriven away by songs of exorcism, burning of perfumes or evil-smellingdrugs, and performing ceremonies, many of which, with scraps of theexorcisms are found in familiar use here and there at the presentday. Most important of all in it was the extraordinary influence ofthe Shaman himself on his patient, for he made the one acted on sleepor wake, freed him from many apparently dire disorders in a minute,among others of epilepsies which were believed to be caused by devilsdwelling in man--the nearest and latest explanation of which magicpower is given in that very remarkable book, "Psycho-Therapeutics, orTreatment by Sleep and Suggestion," by C. Lloyd Tuckey, M.D. (London:Bailliere and Co., 1889), which I commend to all persons interestedin ethnology as casting light on some of the most interesting andperplexing problems of humanity, and especially of "magic."It would seem, at least among the Laplanders, Finns, Eskimo, andRed Indians, that the first stage of Shamanism was a very horriblewitchcraft, practised chiefly by women, in which attempts were made toconciliate the evil spirits; the means employed embracing everythingwhich could revolt and startle barbarous men. Thus fragments ofdead bodies and poison, and unheard-of terrors and crimes formed itsbasis. I think it very probable that this was the primitive religionamong savages everywhere. An immense amount of it in its vilestconceivable forms still exists among negroes as Voodoo.After a time this primitive witchcraft or voodooism had itsreformers--probably brave and shrewd men, who conjectured that thepowers of evil might be "exploited" to advantage. There is greatconfusion and little knowledge as yet as regards primitive man, buttill we know better we may roughly assume that witch-voodooism wasthe religion of the people of the paleolithic period, if they couldtalk at all, since language is denied to the men of the Neanderthal,Canstadt, Egnisheim, and Podhava type. All that we can declare withsome certainty is that we find the advanced Shamanism the religion ofthe early Turanian races, among whose descendants, and other peopleallied to them, it exists to this day. The grandest incident in thehistory of humanity is the appearance of the Man of Cromagnon. He itwas who founded what M. de Quatrefages calls "a magnificent race,"probably one which speedily developed a high civilization, and arefined religion. But the old Shamanism with its amulets, exorcisms,and smoke, its noises, more or less musical, of drums and enchantedbells, and its main belief that all the ills of life came from theaction of evil spirits, was deeply based among the inferior races andthe inferior scions of the Cromagnon stock clung to it in forms moreor less modified. Just as the earlier witchcraft, or the worship andconciliation of evil, overlapped in many places the newer Shamanism, sothe latter overlapped the beautiful Nature-worship of the early Aryans,the stately monotheism of the Shemites, and the other more advancedor ingenious developments of the idea of a creative cause. There are,in fact, even among us now, minds to whom Shamanism or even witchcraftis deeply, or innately adapted by nature, and there are hundred ofmillions who, while professing a higher and purer doctrine, clingto its forms or essentials, believing that because the apparatusis called by a different name it is in no respect whatever the samething. Finally there are men who, with no logical belief whatever inany kind of supernaturalism, study it, and love it, and are moved byit, owing to its endless associations with poetry, art, and all thelegends of infancy or youth. Heine was not in his reasoning momentsanything more or less than a strict Deist or Monotheist, but all thedreams and spectres, fairies and goblins, whether of the Middle Ages orthe Talmud, were inexpressibly dear to him, and they move like myriadmotes through the sunshine of his poetry and prose, often causinglong rays when there were bars at the window--like that on whichthe saint hung his cloak. It is probable or certain that Shamanism(or that into which it has very naturally developed) will influenceall mankind, until science, by absorbing man's love of the marvellousin stupendous discoveries shall so put to shame the old thaumaturgy,or wonder-working, that the latter will seem poor and childish. Inall the "Arabian Nights" there is nothing more marvellous than thenew idea that voices and sounds may be laid aside like real books,and made to speak and sing again years afterwards. And in all of thatvast repertory of occult lore, "Isis Unveiled," there is nothing sowonderful as the simple truth that every child may be educated topossess an infinitely developed memory of words, sights, sounds, andideas, allied to incredible quickness of perception and practice ofthe constructive faculties. These, with the vast fields of adjustingimproved social relations and reforms--all of which in a certain wayopens dazzling vistas of a certain kind of enchantment or brillianthope--will go fast and far to change the old romance to a radicallydifferent state of feeling and association.It is coming--let it come! Doubtless there was an awful romanceof darkness about the old witchcraft which caused its worshippersto declare that the new lights of Shamanism could never dissipateit. Just so many millions of educated people at present cannot bebrought to understand that all things to which they are used are notbased on immutable laws of nature, and must needs be eternal. They willfind it hard to comprehend that there can ever be any kind of poetry,art, or sentiment, utterly different from that to which they and theirancestors have been accustomed. Yet it is clear and plain before them,this New Era, looking them directly in the face, about to usher in areformation compared to which all the reformations and revolutions,and new religions which the world has ever seen were as nothing;and the children are born who will see more than the beginning of it.In the next chapter I will examine the Shamanic spells and charmsstill used among certain gypsies. For, be it observed, all the gypsymagic and sorcery here described is purely Shamanic--that is to say,of the most primitive Tartar type--and it is the more interestingas having preserved from prehistoric times many of the most markedcharacteristics of the world's first magic or religion. It treatsevery disease, disorder, trouble, or affliction as the work of anevil spirit; it attempts to banish these influences by the aid ofceremonies, many of which, by the disgusting and singular natureof the ingredients employed, show the lingering influences of theblack witchcraft which preceded Shamanism; and it invokes favourablesupernatural agencies, such as the spirits of the air and Mashmurdalo',the giant of the forests. In addition to this there will be found tobe clearly and unmistakably associated with all their usages, symbolsand things nearly connected with much which is to be found in Greek,Roman, and Indian mythology or symbolism. Now whether this was drawnfrom "classic" sources, or whether all came from some ancient andobscure origin, cannot now be accurately determined. But it certainlycannot be denied that Folk-lore of this kind casts a great deal oflight on the early history of mankind, and the gradual unfolding orevolution of religion and of mind, and that, if intelligently studied,this of the gypsies is as important as any chapter in the grand work.The gypsies came, historically speaking, very recently from India. Ithas not been so carefully observed as it might that all Indians arenot of the religion of Brahma, much less of Buddha or of Mahommed,and that among the lower castes, the primæval Altaic Shamanism, witheven earlier witchcraft, still holds its own. Witchcraft, or Voodoo,or Obi, relies greatly on poisoning for its magic, and the firstgypsies were said to poison unscrupulously. Even to this day thereis but one word with them as with many Hindoos for both medicine andpoison--id est drab. How exactly this form of witchcraft and Shamanismexists to-day in India appears from the following extract from TheSt. James's Gazette, September 8, 1888:--    THE HINDOO PRIEST.    In India, the jadoo-wallah, or exorcist, thrives apace; and    no wonder, for is not the lower-caste Hindoo community bhut,    or demon-ridden? Every village, graveyard, burning-ghat, has    its special bhut or bhuts; and the jadoo-wallah is the earthly    mediator between their bhutships and the common folk. The exorcist    is usually the spiritual adviser to the population of a low-caste    village, and is known as a gooroo, or priest: that is to say, he    professes to hold commune with the spirits of defunct Hindoos which    have qualified for their unique position in the other world--by    their iniquity in this one, perhaps. Every Hindoo has a guardian    bhut that requires propitiating, and the gooroo is the medium.    Amongst the Jaiswars and other low-caste Hindoos, caste is    regulated by carnal pice, and a man is distinguished amongst    them by a regulated monetary scale. One person may be a 14-anna    caste man while another may only be a 12-anna caste man. Does the    12-anna caste man wish to supersede the 14-anna caste man, then    he consults the gooroo, who will, in consideration of a certain    contribution, promote him to a higher-caste grade. A moneyed man    having qualms about his future state should join the Jaiswars,    where at least he would have an opportunity of utilizing his spare    cash for the good of his soul. The average gooroo will be only too    glad to procure him everlasting glory for a matter of a few rupees.    The gooroo, then, serves as regulator of the lower-caste Hindoo    system. But it is our intention to exhibit him in his peculiar    position of exorcist-general to the people. This will perhaps    be best explained by an account of the case of one Kaloo. Kaloo    was a grass-cutter, and had been offended by Kasi, a brother    grass-cutter. Kasi, it appears, had stolen Kaloo's quilt one night    during his temporary absence at a neighbouring liquor-shop. Kaloo,    on his return, finding his quilt gone, raised the hue-and-cry;    and Mooloo, the village policeman, traced the robbery to Kasi's    hut. Yet, in spite of this damning proof, the village panchayet,    or bench of magistrates, decided that, as Kaloo could not swear    to the exact colour of his lost quilt--Kaloo was colour-blind--it    could not possibly be his. Anyhow, Kaloo kept Kasi in view and    hit upon a plan to do him a grievous bodily injury. Scraping    together a few rupees, he went to the village gooroo and promised    that worthy a reward if he would only exorcise the bhuts and get    them to "make Kasi's liver bad." The gooroo, in consideration    of five rupees cash, promised compliance. So that night we find    the gooroo busy with sandal-wood and pig's blood propitiating the    neighbouring bhuts. Needless to say that Kasi had in a very short    space of time all the symptoms of liver complaint. Whether the    bhuts gave Kasi a bad liver or the gooroo gave him a few doses    of poison is a question. Anyhow, Kasi soon died. Another case    in point is that of Akuti. Akuti was a retired courtesan who had    long plied a profitable trade in the city. We find her, however,    at her native village of Ramghur, the wife of one Balu. Balu    soon got tired of his Akuti, and longed for the contents of her    strong box wherein she kept her rupees, bracelets, nose-rings,    and other valuables. This was a rather awkward matter for Balu,    for Akuti was still in the prime of life. Balu accordingly visits    the gooroo and wants Akuti's liver made bad. "Nothing easier,"    says the gooroo: "five rupees." Balu has reckoned without his    host, however: for the gooroo, as general spiritual adviser to    the Ramghur community, visits Akuti and tells her of Balu's little    scheme. Naturally Balu's liver is soon in a decline, for Akuti's    ten rupees were put in the opposite side of the gooroo's scales.    Knaves of the gooroo genus flourish in India, and when their    disposition is vicious the damage they can do is appalling. That    these priests exist and do such things as I have illustrated is    beyond question. Ask any native of India his views on the bhut    question, and he will tell you that there are such things, and,    further, that the gooroo is the only one able to lay them, so to    speak. According to the low-caste Hindoo, the bhut is a spiteful    creature which requires constant supplies of liquor and pork;    otherwise it will wreak its vengeance on the forgetful votary who    neglects the supply. A strange idea, too, is this of pork being    pleasing to the bhuts; but when it is remembered that the Jaiswars,    Chamars, and other low-caste Hindoos are inordinately fond of    that meat themselves, they are right in supposing pig to be the    favourite dish of the bhuts, who, after all, are but the departed    spirits of their own people. Naturally bhai (brother) Kaloo, or    bahin (sister, English gypsy pen) Akuti, the quondam grass-cutter    and courtesan of Ramghur village, who in this life liked nothing    better than a piece of bacon and a dram of spirits, will, in their    state of bhuthood hanker after those things still. Acting on these    notions of the people, the gooroo lives and thrives exceedingly.Yet of all this there is nothing "Hindoo," nothing of the Vedas. It isall pre-Aryan, devil-worshipping, poisoning, and Turanian; and it isexactly like voodooing in Philadelphia or any other city in America. Itis the old faith which came before all, which existed through andunder Brahminism, Buddhism, and Mahommedanism, and which, as is wellknown, has cropped out again and flourishes vigorously under Britishtoleration. And this is the faith which forms the basis of Europeangypsy sorcery, as it did of yore that of the Chaldæan and Etrurian,which still survive in the witchcraft of the Tuscan Romagna. Everygypsy who came to Europe a few centuries ago set up as a gooroo,and did his sorceries after the same antique fashion. Even to-day itis much the same, but with far less crime. But the bhut or malignantspirit is, under other names, still believed in, still doctored bygypsies with herbs and smoke, and "be-rhymed like an Irish rat,"and conjured into holes bored in trees, and wafted away into runningstreams, and naïvely implored to "go where he is wanted," to wherehe was nursed, and to no longer bother honest folk who are tiredof him. And for all this the confiding villager must pay the gypsywise-woman "so much monies"--as it was in the beginning and is now ingood faith among millions in Europe who are in a much better classof society. And from this point of view I venture to say that thereis not a charm or spell set down in this work or extant which willnot be deeply interesting to every sincere student of the history ofculture. Let me, however, say in this beginning once for all thatI have only given specimens sufficient to illustrate my views, formy prescribed limits quite forbid the introduction of all the gypsycures, spells, &c., which I have collected.CHAPTER II.CHARMS AND CONJURATIONS TO CURE THE DISORDERS OF GROWNPEOPLE. HUNGARIAN GYPSY MAGIC.Though not liable to many disorders, the gypsies in Eastern Europe,from their wandering, out-of-doors life, and camping by marshes andpools where there is malaria, suffer a great deal from fevers, which intheir simple system of medicine are divided into the shilale--i.e.,chills or cold--and the tate shilalyi, "hot-cold," or fever andague. For the former, the following remedy is applied: Three lungsand three livers of frogs are dried and powdered and drunk in spirits,after which the sick man or woman says:--   "Cuckerdya pal m're per    Cáven save miseçe!    Cuckerdya pal m're per    Den miseçeske drom odry prejiál!"   "Frogs in my belly    Devour what is bad!    Frogs in my belly    Show the evil the way out!"By "the evil" is understood evil spirits. According to the oldShamanic belief, which was the primæval religion of all mankind,every disease is caused by an evil spirit which enters the bodyand can only be driven out by magic. We have abundant traces ofthis left in our highest civilization and religion among people whogravely attribute every evil to the devil instead of the unavoidableantagonisms of nature. Nothing is more apparent in the New Testamentthan that all diseases were anciently regarded as coming from devils,or evil occult, spiritual influences, their negative or cure beingholiness in some form. This the Jews, if they did not learn it fromthe Assyrians in the first place, had certainly studied deeply inBabylon, where it formed the great national cult. "It was the devilput it into my head," says the criminal; and there is not a point ofthis old sorcery which is not earnestly and seriously advocated by theRoman Catholic Church and the preachers of the Salvation Army. Amongthe American Red Indians the idea of evil spirits is carried tological extremes. If a pen drops from our fingers, or a penny rollsfrom our grasp, the former of course falls on our new white dress,while the latter nine times out of ten goes directly to the nearestgrating, or crack or rat-hole. I aver that it is literally true,if I ever search for a letter or paper it is almost always at thebottom of the rest, while ink-wipers and pens seem to be endowedwith more than mere instinct or reason--they manifest genius inconcealing themselves. The Indians having observed this have cometo the conclusion that it is all the work of certain busy littlemischievous goblins, in which I, to a certain extent, agree with them,holding, however, that the dwelling-place of these devilkins, is inour own brain. What are our dreams but the action of our other mind,or a second Me in my brain? Certainly it is with no will or effort,or act of mine, that I go through a diabolical torturing nightmare,or a dreadful dream, whose elaborate and subtle construction betraysvery often more ingenuity than I in my waking hours possess. I have hadphilosophical and literary dreams, the outlines of which I have oftenremembered waking, which far transcended anything of the kind which Icould ever hope to write. The maker of all this is not I or my will,and he is never about, or on hand, when I am self-conscious. But in theinadvertent moments of oblivion, while writing, or while performingany act, this other I, or I's, (for there may be a multitude of themfor aught I know) step in and tease--even as they do in dreams. Nowthe distinction between this of subjective demons acting objectively,and objective or outside spirits, is really too fine to be seen evenby a Darwinian-Carpenterian-Häeckelite, and therefore one need notbe amazed that Piel Sabadis or Tomaquah, of the Passamaquoddy tribe,or Obeah Gumbo of New Orleans, should, with these experiences, jump atghosts and "gobblers," is not to be wondered at; still less that theyshould do something to conciliate or compel these haunting terrors,or "buggs," as they were once called--whence bogeys. It is a factthat if one's ink-wipers get into the habit of hiding all we haveto do is to deliberately destroy them and get others, or at leastwatch them carefully, and they will soon be cured of wandering. Onthe other hand, sacrifices to conciliate and please naturally occur,and the more expensive these are the better are they supposed tobe. And as human beings were of old the most valuable property, theywere as naturally supposed to be most acceptable to the gods, or,by the monotheists, to God. A West Indian voodoo on being reproachedfor human sacrifices to the serpent, and for eating the bodies slain,replied, "Do you believe that the Son of God was sacrificed to saveman, and do you not eat what your priests say is His very body?" Sodifficult is it to draw distinctions between that which is spiritualand the mockeries which appear to be such!The scape-goat, or sufferer, who is martyred that many may escape--orin other words, the unfortunate minority--is a natural resultof sacrifice. There is a curious trace of it in Hungarian GypsyShamanism. On Easter Monday they make a wooden box or receptaclewhich is called the bicápen, pronounced like the English gypsy wordbitchapen and meaning the same, that is--a sending, a thing sent orgift. In this, at the bottom, are two sticks across, "as in a cradle,"and on these are laid herbs and other fetish stuff which every onetouches with the finger; then the whole is enveloped in a windingof white and red wool, and carried by the oldest person of the tribefrom tent to tent; after which it is borne to the next running streamand left there, after every one has spat upon it. By doing this theythink that all the diseases and disorders which would have befallenthem during the coming year are conjured into the box. But woe tohim who shall find the box and open it, instead of throwing it atonce into the stream! All the diseases exorcised by the gypsy bandwill fall upon him and his in full measure.It would be an interesting question to know how many good people thereare, let us say in London, who, if they had an opportunity to work offall their colds, gouts, scarlet-fevers, tooth- head- and stomach-aches,with the consequent doctors' bills, or all suffering and expenses,on some other family by means of secret sorcery, would or wouldnot "try it on"? It is curious to observe the resemblance of thegypsy ceremony, with its box full of mischief, and the Jewish goat;not forgetting the red wool handed down from heathen sacrifice andsorcery of old. In the Bible white wool is the symbol of purification(Isaiah i. 18). The feet of the statues of the gods were enveloped inwool--Dü laneos habent pedes--to signify that they are slow to avenge,if sure. It is altogether an interesting object, this gypsy casket,and one would like to know what all the channels were through whichthe magic ran ere it came to them.Another cure against the fever is to go to a running stream and castpieces of wood nine times backwards into the running water, repeatingthe rhymes:--   "Shilályi prejiá,    Páñori me tut 'dáv!    Náñi me tut kámáv;    Andakode prejiá,    Odoy tut cuciden,    Odoy tut ferinen,    Odoy tut may kámen!    Mashurdalo sástyár!"   "Fever go away from me,    I give it, water, unto thee!    Unto me thou art not dear,    Therefore go away from here    To where they nursed thee,    Where they shelter thee,    Where they love thee,      Mashurdalo--help!"This is a very remarkable invocation which takes us into trueheathenism. Mashurdálo, or, correctly speaking, Mashmurdálo (it wouldbe Masmérdo in English gypsy), means meat-killer. He is a sylvangiant--he has his hold by wode and wolde as outlawes wont to do,in far-away forests and lonely rocky places, where he lurks to catchbeast and men in order to devour them. It is needless to say to thosewho are aware that the taste of white people's flesh is like that ofvery superior chicken, and a negro's something much better than grouse,that Mashmurdálo prefers, like a simple, unsophisticated savage ashe is, men to animals. Like the German peasant who remarked, "It'sall meat, anyhow," when he found a mouse in his soup, Mashmurdálois not particular. He is the guardian of great treasures; like mostmen in the "advance business" he knows where the "money" is to befound--unlike them he is remarkably stupid, and can be easily cheatedof his valuables. But if anybody does this Morgante a service he isvery grateful, and aids his benefactor either with a loan or with hisenormous strength. In many respects he bears a remarkable resemblanceto two giants in the American Algonkin mythology, especially toAt-was-kenni ges--the Spirit of the Forest--who is equally powerful,good-natured, and stupid, and to the Chenoo, who is a cannibal giantand yet grateful to friends, and also to several Hindoo gods. Thegypsies have here evidently fused several Oriental beings intoone. This is a process which occurs in the decline of mythologies asin languages. In the infancy of a speech, as in its old age, manywords expressing different ideas, but which sound somewhat alike,become a single term. In English gypsy I have found as many as eightor ten Hindi words thus concentrated into one.Another cure for a fever. The sufferer goes in the forest and findsa young tree. When the first rays of the rising sun fall on it thepatient shakes it with all his might and exclaims:--   "Shilályi, shilályi prejia    Káthe tu beshá, káthe tu beshá!"   "Fever, fever, go away!    Here shalt thou stay. Here shalt thou stay!"It is here plain that the shaking the sapling is intended to transferthe shakes, as the chill and shuddering of the fever is called inAmerica, to the tree."Then the fever passes into the tree." Perhaps it was in this waythat the aspen learned to tremble. But among the gypsies in the southof Hungary, among whom the vaccination or inoculation of trees isgreatly the fashion, a hole is bored into the wood, into which thepatient spits thrice, repeats the spell, and then stops the hole witha plug. The boring of holes in trees or transferring illness to themis also practised without formulas of speech. Thus, if while a man islying down or sitting in the spring he hears the song of the cuckoohe believes that he will be ill all the time for a year to come,especially with fevers, unless he goes nine times to a tree, bores ahole in it, and spits into it three times. Then he is safe. In Germanmythology "the cuckoo is a bird which brings bad luck" (Friedrich),and the inhabitants of Haiterbach were so persuaded of this that theyintroduced a prayer against it into their church service, whence theygot the name of cuckoos (Wolf, "Zeitschrift für Deutsche Myth.,"vol. i. p. 440). It announces to men the infidelity of wives, andtells listeners how many years they have to live.It is possible that this is a relic of an old form of sacrifice, orproof that the idea occurs to all men of thus making a casket of atree. The occasional discovery of stone axe-heads in very old treesin America renders this probable. And where the wood grows up andencloses the object it would very rarely happen that it would everbe discovered. It should be added to the previous instance that whenthey have closed the hole, the Transylvanian gypsies eat some of thebark of the next tree.Another cure for fever is effected by going in the morning beforesunrise to the bank of a stream, and digging a hole with someobject--for instance, a knife--which has never been used. Into thishole the patient makes water, then fills up the hole, saying:--   "Shilályi ác kathe    Ná ává kiyá mánge!    Sutyárá andré cik!    Avá kiyá mánge    Káná káthe ná hin páñi!"   "Fever stay here!    Do not come to me!    Dry up in dust,    Come unto me    When no water is here."Dr. Wlislocki translates this last line, "When there is no more waterin the river," which is certainly what is meant. "While water runsor grass grows," &c. is a formula common to all countries. Anothercure for fever is this: the patient must take a kreutzer, an egg, anda handful of salt, and before sunrise go with them to a cross-road,throw them away backwards, and repeat:--   "Káná ádálá kiyá mánge áven    Ava tu kiya mánge shilályi."   "When these things again I see,    Fever then return to me."Or literally, "When these things to me come." For the next threedays the invalid must not touch money, eggs, or salt. There is an oldMS. collection of English charms and ceremonies, professedly of "blackwitchcraft," in which we are told that if a girl will walk stark-nakedby the light of the full moon round a field or a house, and cast behindher at every step a handful of salt, she will get the lover whom shedesires. Salt, says Moresinus, was sacred to the infernal deities,and it was a symbol of the soul, or of life, because it preservedthe body while in it (Pitiscus, "Leg. Ant. Rom." ii. p. 675). Thedevil never eats salt. Once there was in Germany a peasant who hada witch for a wife, and the devil invited them to supper. But allthe dishes were without any seasoning, and the peasant, despite allnudges and hints to hold his tongue kept crying for salt. And when itwas brought and he said, "Thank God, here is salt at last!" the wholeSpuck, or ghastly scene, vanished (Horst, "Dæmonomagie," Frankfurt,1818, vol. ii. p. 213). For a great deal of further informationand symbolism on and of salt, including all the views of the ancientRabbis and modern rationalists on the subject of Lot's wife, the readermay consult "Symbolik und Mythologie der Natur," by J. B. Friedrich,Würzburg, 1859: "Salt is put into love-philtres and charms to ensurethe duration of an attachment; in some Eastern countries it is carriedin a little bag as an amulet to preserve health."Another cure for fever. The patient must drink, from a new jug, waterfrom three brooks, and after every drink throw into the running streama handful of salt. Then he must make water into the first and say:--   "Káthe hin t'ro sherro!"   "Here is thy head!"At the second he repeats the sacred ceremony and murmurs:--   "Káthe hin t'ro perá!"   "Here is thy belly!"And again at the third he exclaims:--   "Te kathehin t're punrá.    Já átunci ándre páñi!"   "And here are thy feet.    Go now into the water!"But while passing from one stream to another he must not look backonce, for then he might behold the dread demon of the fever whichfollows him, neither must he open his mouth, except while uttering thecharm, for then the fever would at once enter his body again throughthe portal thus left unclosed. This walking on in apprehension ofbeholding the ugly spectre will recall to the reader a passage in the"Ancient Mariner," of the man who walks in fear and dread,   "Nor turns around his head,    For well he knows a frightful fiend    Doth close behind him tread."The wise wives among the gypsies in Hungary have many kinds ofmiraculous salves for sale to cure different disorders. These theydeclare are made from the fat of dogs, bears, wolves, frogs, and thelike. As in all fetish remedies they are said to be of strange orrevolting materials, like those used by Canidia of yore, the witchesof Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, and of Burns in Tam O'Shanter.When a man has been "struck by a spirit" there results a sore, swellingor boil, which is cured by a sorceress as follows: The patient is putinto a tent by himself, and is given divers drinks by his attendant;then she rubs the sufferer with a salve, the secret of which is knownonly to her, while she chants:--   "Prejiá, prejiá, prejiá,    Kiyá miseçeske, ác odoy;    Trianda sapa the çaven tut,    Trianda jiuklá tut cingeren,    Trianda káçná tut cunáven!"   "Begone, begone, begone    To the Evil One; stay there.    May thirty snakes devour thee,    Thirty dogs tear thee,    Thirty cocks swallow thee!"After this she slaughters a black hen, splits it open, and lays iton the boil. Then the sufferer must drink water from three springsor rivulets, and throw wood nine times into the fire daily untilhe is well. But black hens cost money, according to Wlislocki;albeit the gypsies, like the children of the Mist in "Waverley,"are believed to be acquainted with a far more economical and directmethod of obtaining such commodities. Therefore this expensive andhigh-class cure is not often resorted to, and when it is the sorceressgenerally substitutes something cheaper than poultry. It may be hereobserved that the black hen occurs frequently in mediæval witch-loreand legend as a demon-symbol (Wolf, "Niederländische Sagen," pp. 647,650). Thus the bones of sorcerors turn into black hens and chickens,and it is well if your black hen dies, for if she had not you wouldhave perished in her place. Black hens were walled up in castlesas sacrifices to the devil, that the walls might long endure; hencethe same fowl occurs in the arms of the family of Henneberg (Nork,"Mythologie der Volkssagen," p. 381). The lore on this subject isvery extensive.The following remedy against headache is in general use amongTransylvanian gypsies. The patient's head is rubbed, and then washed,with vinegar or hot water while the following charm is repeated:--   "Oh duk ándro m'ro shero    The o dád miseçescro,    Adá dikhel ákáná,    Man tu máy dostá, márdyás,    Miro shero tu márdyás!    Tu ná ac tu ándre me.    Já tu, já tu, já kere.    Káy tu miseç cucides,    Odoy, odoy sikoves!    Ko jál pro m'ro ushályin,    Adáleske e duk hin!"   "Oh, pain in my head,    The father of all evil,    Look upon thee now!    Thou hast greatly pained me,    Thou tormentest my head,    Remain not in me!    Go thou, go thou, go home,    Whence thou, Evil One, didst suck,    Thither, thither hasten!    Who treads upon my shadow,    To him be the pain!"It will be seen that the principle of treading on the tail of thecoat practised in Ireland is much outdone by the gypsies who give aheadache to any one who so much as treads on their shadows. And itis not difficult to understand that, as with children, the rubbingthe head, the bathing it with warm water or vinegar, and, finally,the singing a soothing song, may all conduce to a cure. The readers of"Helen's Babies" will remember the cures habitually wrought on Budgeby singing to him, "Charley boy one day." Gypsies are in many respectsmere children, or little Budges. There can be no doubt that wherefaith is very strong, and imagination is lively, cures which seem toborder on the miraculous are often effected--and this is, indeed, thebasis of all miracle as applied to relieving bodily afflictions. Allof this may be, if not as yet fully explained by physiology, at leastshown to probably rest on a material basis. But no sound system ofcure can be founded on it, because there is never any certainty,especially for difficult and serious disorders, that they can ever behealed twice in succession. The "faith" exacted is sometimes a purelyhereditary gift, at other times merely a form of blind ignorance andcredulity. It may vividly influence all the body, and it may fail toact altogether. But the "Faith Healer" and "Christian Scientist," or"Metaphysical Doctor," push boldly on, and when they here and thereheal a patient once, it is published to the four winds as a proofof invariable infallibility. And as everybody believes that he has"faith," so he hopes to be cured. In popular custom for a man to sayhe believes in anything, and to be sure that he really has nothingagainst it, constitutes as much "faith" as most men understand. Aman may be utterly destitute of any moral principle and yet live ina constant state of "faith" and pious conviction. Here the capacityfor cure by means of charms is complete.In connection with these charms for the head we may find not lessinteresting those in reference to the hair, as given by the sameauthority, Dr. von Wlislocki. The greatest pains are taken to ensureeven for the new-born child what is called a full head, because everyone who dies bald is turned into a fish, and must remain in this formtill he has collected as many hairs as would make an ordinary wig. Butthis lasts a long time, since he can find but a single hair everymonth or moon. The moon is in many ways connected in gypsy faith withthe hair. He who sleeps bare-headed in its light will lose his hair,or else it will become white. To have a heavy growth a man must scoopup with his left hand water from a running brook, against the current,and pour it on his head.Immediately after the first bathing of a newly-born child, and itsanointing, its forehead and neck are marked with a semicircle--perhapsmeant to indicate the moon--made with a salve called barcali, intendedto promote the growth of the hair. A brew, or mess, is made frombeans and the blood of a cow. Hairs are taken from the heads of thefather and mother, which hairs are burnt to a powder and mixed withthe brew. It is remarkable that the beans are only used for a boy,their object being to insure for him great virile or sexual power. "Thebean," says Friedrich ("Sym. d. N."), "is an erotic symbol, or onesignifying sexual pleasure." Hence it was forbidden to the Egyptianpriests, the Pythagoreans, the priests of Jupiter in Rome, and to theJewish high priests on certain festivals. But if the child is a girl,the seeds of the pumpkin or sunflower are substituted for beans,because the latter would make her barren.It is an old belief, and one widely spread, that if the witches or thedevil can get a lock of anybody's hair, they can work him evil. Thegypsies have the following articles of faith as regards hairs:--Should birds find any, and build them into their nests, the man wholost them will suffer from headaches until, during the wane of themoon, he rubs his head with the yolk of eggs and washes it clean inrunning water. It would be very curious if this method of cleaning thehair and giving it a soft gloss, so much in vogue among English ladies,should have originated in sorcery. Beyond this, the sufferer mustmix some of his hairs with food and give them to a white dog to eat.If hairs which have fallen or been cut away are found by a snake andcarried into its hole, the man from whom they came will continue tolose more until those in the snake's nest are quite decayed.If you see human hairs in the road do not tread on them, since, in thatcase, if they came from a lunatic, you, too, will go mad. Accordingto Marcellus Burdigalensis, if you pick up some hairs in the roadjust before entering a city gate, tie one to your own head, and,throwing the rest away, walk on without looking behind you, you cancure a headache. I have found nearly the same charm for the samepurpose in Florence, but accompanied by the incantation which iswanting in Marcellus. Also his cure for headache with ivy from thehead of a statue, which is still used in Tuscany with the incantationwhich the Roman omits.Finding a hair hanging to your coat, carefully burn it, since youmay by so doing escape injury by witchcraft. And we may remark inconfirmation of this, that when you see a long hair on a man's coatit is an almost certain sign that he has been among the witches,or is bewitched; as the Countess thought when she found one clingingto the button of her lover, Von Adelstein, as set forth in "MeisterKarl's Sketch-book."But to bewitch your enemy get some of his combed-out hair, steep itin your own water, and then throw it on his garments. Then he willhave no rest by night or day. I have observed that in all the Tuscancharms intended to torment a foe, the objects employed are like thisof a disgusting nature.If a wife will hold her husband to her in love, she must take ofher own hair and bind it to his. This must be done three times byfull moonlight.Or if a maid will win the love of a young man, she must take of herown hair, mix it with earth from his footsteps--"und mischt diese mitdem Speichel einer läufigen Hundinn auf"--burn the whole to powder,and so manage that the victim shall eat it--which, it is needlessto say, it is not likely that he will do, knowing what it is. Earthfrom the footsteps of any one is regarded as a very powerful meansof bewitching him in Italian and ancient sorcery.If a man bind the combings of his hair to the mane of a strange horseit will be wild and shy till the hairs are removed.For easy childbirth red hair is sewed in a small bag and carried onthe belly next the skin during pregnancy. Red hair indicates goodluck, and is called bálá kámeskro, or sun-hairs, which indicates itsIndian origin.If any one dreams much of the dead, let him sew some of his hair intoan old shoe, and give it to any beggar. Thereby he will prevent evilspirits from annoying him.If a child suffers from sleeplessness, some of its mother's hairshould be sewed into its wrappings, and others pulverized, mixedwith a decoction of elderberries, be given it to drink. In GermanFolk-lore, as I shall show more fully anon, the elder often occursas a plant specially identified with sorcery. In gypsy it is calledyakori bengeskro, or the devil's eye, from its berries.Nails cut on Friday should be burned, and the ashes mingled withthe fodder of cattle, who are thus ensured against being stolen orattacked by wild beasts. If children are dwarfish, the same ashesin their food will make them grow. If a child suffers from pains inthe stomach, a bit of nail must be clipped from its every finger;this is mixed with the dried dung of a foal, and the patient exposedto the smoke while it is burned.A child's first tooth must, when it falls out, be thrown into a hollowtree. Those which come out in the seventh year are carefully kept, andwhenever the child suffers from toothache, one is thrown into a stream.Teeth which have been buried for many years, serve to make a singularfetish. They are mingled with the bones of a tree-frog, and the wholethen sewed up in a little bag. If a man has anything for sale, and willdraw or rub this bag over it, he will have many offers or customersfor the articles thus enchanted. The bones are prepared by puttingthe frog into a glass or earthen receptacle full of small holes. Thisis buried in an ant-hill. The ants enter the holes and eat away allthe flesh, leaving the bones which after a few weeks are removed. [4]To bear healthy and strong children women wear a string of bears'claws and children's teeth. Dr. von Wlislocki cites, apropos of this,a passage from Jacobus Rueff, "Von Empfengnussen": "Etlich schwangerwyber pflägend einen bären klauen von einem bären tapen yngefaszet amhals zuo tragen" (Some women when with child are accustomed to wearmounted bears' claws on their necks). In like manner boars' teeth,which much resemble them, are still very commonly worn in Austriaand Italy and almost over all Europe and the East. It is but a fewdays since I here, in Florence, met with a young English lady whohad bought a very large one mounted in silver as a brooch, but whowas utterly unaware that there was any meaning attached to it. [5]I have a very ancient bear's tooth and whistle in silver, meant fora teething child. It came from Munich.Pain in the eyes is cured with a wash made of spring or well waterand saffron. During the application the following is recited:--   "Oh dukh ándrál yákhá    Já ándré páñi    Já andrál páñi    André safráne    André pçuv.    Já andrál pçuv    Kiyá Pçuvusheske.--    Odoy hin cerçá,    Odoy ja te ça."   "Oh, pain from the eyes    Go into the water,    Go out of the water    Into the saffron,    Go out of the saffron    Into the earth.    To the Earth-Spirit.    There's thy home.    There go and eat."This incantation casts light upon the earliest Shamanic remedies. Whenit was discovered that certain herbs really possessed curativequalities, this was attributed to inherent magic virtues. The increaseof their power by combining them with water, or mingling them, was dueto mystic affinities by which a spirit passed from one to another. TheSpirit of Earth went into saffron, that of saffron into water. Themagician thus by a song sent the pain into its medical affinity, andso on back to the source whence it came. From early times saffron,as one of the earliest flowers of spring, owing to its colour, wasconsecrated to magic and love. Eos, the goddess of the Aurora, wascalled krokotieplos, the one with the saffron garment. Therefore thepublic women wore a yellow robe. Even in Christian symbolism it meantlove, as Portalis declares: "In the Christian religion the colourssaffron and orange were the symbols of God embracing the heart andilluminating the souls of the faithful" ("Des Couleurs Symboliques,"Paris, 1837, p. 240). So we can trace the chain from the prehistoricbarbarous Shamanism, preserved by the gypsies, to the Greek, and fromthe Greek to the mediæval form still existent.The same sympathetic process of transmission may be traced in theremedy for the erysipelas. The blood of a bullfinch is put into a newvessel with scraped elder-bark, and then laid on a cloth with whichthe eyes are bound up overnight. Meanwhile the patient repeats:--   "Duy yákhá hin mánge    Duy punrá hin mánge    Dukh ándrál yákhá    Já ándre punrá    Já ándrál punrá.    Já ándre pçuv,    Já ándrál pçuv    Andro meriben!"   "I have two eyes,    I have two feet,    Pain from my eyes    Go into my feet!    Go from my feet,    Go into the earth!    Go from the earth    Into death!"We have here in the elder-bark associations of magic which areancient and widely spread, and which still exist; for at the presentday country people in New England attribute to it curative virtueswhich it really does not possess. From the earliest times among theNorthern races the Lady Elder, as we may learn from the Edda, orFin Magnusen ("Priscæ veterum Borealium Mythologiæ Lexicon," pp. 21,239), and Nyerup ("Worterbuch der Scandinavischen Mythologie"), hadan unearthly, ghostly reputation. Growing in lonely, gloomy placesits form and the smell of its flowers seemed repulsive, so that it wasassociated with death, and some derived its name from Frau Holle, thesorceress and goddess of death. But Schwenki ("Mythologie der Slaven")with more probability traces it from hohl, i.e., hollow, and as spiritswere believed to dwell in all hollow trees, they were always in itsjoints. The ancient Lithuanians, he informs us, worshipped their godPuschkeit, who was a form of Pluto, in fear and trembling at dusk,and left their offerings under the elder-tree. Everybody has seenthe little puppets made of a piece of elder-pith with half a bulletunder them, so that they always stand upright, and jump up whenthrown down. Among the Slovaks these seem to have had some magicalapplication. Perhaps their priests persuaded them that these jumpingJacks were miraculous, for they called them Pikuljk, a name derivedfrom Peklo, the under-world. They still believe in a Pikuljk, whois a servant of the Evil One. He does all kinds of favours for men,but ends by getting their souls. The ancestors of the Poles wereaccustomed to bury all their sins and sorrows under elder-trees,thinking that they thereby gave to the lower world what properlybelonged to it. This corresponds accurately to the gypsy incantationwhich passes the disease on from the elder bark into the earth, andfrom earth unto death. Frau Ellhorn, or Ellen, was the old Germanname for this plant. "Frau, perhaps, as appropriate to the femaleelf who dwelt in it" (Friedrich, "Symbolik," p. 293). When it wasnecessary to cut one down, the peasant always knelt first beforeit and prayed: "Lady Ellhorn, give me of thy wood, and I will givethee of mine when it shall grow in the forest." Grimm ("DeutscheMythologie," cxvi.) cites from a MS. of 1727 the following: "Paganismo ortum debet superstitio, sambucam non esse exscindendum nisiprius rogata permissione his verbis: Mater Sambuci permitte mihi tuæcoedere sylvam!" On the other hand, Elder had certain protective andhealing virtues. Hung before a stable door it warded off witchcraft,and he who planted it conciliated evil spirits. And if a twig of itwere planted on a grave and it grew, that was a sign that the soul ofthe deceased was happy, which is the probable reason why the very oldJewish cemetery in Prague was planted full of elders. In a very curiousand rare work, entitled "Blockesberge Berichtung" (Leipzig, 1669),by John Prætorius, devoted to "the Witch-ride and Sorcery-Sabbath,"the author tells us that witches make great use of nine specialherbs--"nam in herbis, verbis et lapidibus magna vis est." Amongthese is Elder, of which the peasants make wreaths, which, if theywear on Walpurgis night, they can see the sorceresses as they sweepthrough the air on their brooms, dragons, goats, and other strangesteeds to the Infernal Dance. Or when they anderswo herumvagiren--"govagabonding anywhere else." "Yea, and I know one fellow who sware untomen, that by means of this herb he once saw certain witches churningbutter busily, and that on a roof, but I mistrust that this was a sell(Schnake), and that the true name of this knave was Butyrolambius"("Blocksberg," p. 475). The same author informs us that Hollunder(or Elder) is so called from hohl, or hollow, or else is an anagramof Unholden, unholy spirits, and some people call it Alhuren, fromits connection with witches and debauchery, even as Cordus writes:--   "When elder blossoms bloom upon the bush,    Then women's hearts to sensual pleasure rush."He closes his comments on this subject with the dry remark that ifthe people of Leipzig wear, as is their wont, garlands of elder withthe object of preventing breaches of the seventh commandment amongthem, it has in this instance, at least, utterly failed to producethe expected effect. "Quasi! creadt Judæus Apella!"It should be mentioned that in the gypsy spell the next morningthe cloth with the elder-bark must be thrown into the next runningwater. To cure toothache the Transylvanian gypsies wind a barley-strawround a stone, which is thrown into a running stream, while saying:--   "Oh dukh ándre m're dándá,    Tu ná báres cingerá!    Ná ává kiyá mánge,    Mire muy ná hin kere!    Tut ñikáná me kámáv,    Ac tu mánge pál pácá;    Káná e pçus yárpakri    Avel tele páñori!"   "Oh, pain in my teeth,    Trouble me not so greatly!    Do not come to me,    My mouth is not thy house.    I love thee not all,    Stay thou away from me;    When this straw is in the brook    Go away into the water!"Straw was anciently a symbol of emptiness, unfruitfulness, anddeath, and it is evidently used in this sense by the gypsies, orderived by them from some tradition connected with it. A feigned orfruitless marriage is indicated in Germany by the terms Strohwittwerand Strohwittwe. From the earliest times in France the breaking astraw signified that a compact was broken with a man because therewas nothing in him. Thus in 922 the barons of Charles the Simple, indethroning him, broke the straws which they held (Charlotte de La Tour,"Symbols of Flowers").Still, straws have something in them. She who will lay straws on thetable in the full moonlight by an open window, especially on Saturdaynight, and will repeat--   "Straw, draw, crow craw,    By my life I give thee law"--then the straws will become fairies and dance to the cawing of a crowwho will come and sit on the ledge of the window. And so witches werewont to make a man of straw, as did Mother Gookin, in Hawthorne's tale,and unto these they gave life, whence the saying of a man of straw andstraw bail, albeit this latter is deemed by some to be related to thebreaking of straws and of dependence, as told in the tale of Charlesthe Simple. Straw-lore is extensive and curious. As in elder-stalks,small fairies make their homes in its tubes. To strew chopped strawbefore the house of a bride was such an insult to her character, inGermany, and so common that laws were passed against it. I possessa work printed about 1650, entitled "De Injuriis quæ haud raroNovis Nuptis inferri solent. I. Per sparsionem dissectorum culmorumfrugum. Germ. Dusch das Werckerling Streuen," &c. An immense amountof learned quotation and reference by its author indicates that thiscustom which was influenced by superstition, was very extensivelywritten on in its time. It was allied to the binding of knots andother magic ceremonies to prevent the consummation of marriages.There is a very curious principle involved in curing certain disordersor afflictions by means of spells or verses. A certain word isrepeated many times in a mysterious manner, so that it strikesthe imagination of the sufferer. There is found in the Slavoniancountries a woolly caterpillar called Wolos, whose bite, or rathertouch, is much dreaded. I have myself, when a boy, been stung by sucha creature in the United States. As I remember, it was like the stingof a bee. The following (Malo Russian) spell against it was given meby Prof. Dragomanoff in Geneva. It is supposed that a certain kindof disorder, or cutaneous eruption, is caused by the Wolos:--   "Wolosni--Wolosnicéh!    Holy Wolos.    Once a man drove over empty roads    With empty oxen,    To an empty field,    To harvest empty corn,    And gather it in empty ricks.    He gathered the empty sheaves,    Laid them in empty wagons,    Drove over empty roads,    Unto an empty threshing-floor.    The empty labourers threshed it,    And bore it to the empty mill.    The empty baker (woman)    Mixed it in an empty trough,    And baked it in an empty oven.    The empty people ate the empty bread.    So may the Wolos swallow this disorder    From the empty ---- (here the name of the patient.)What is here understood by "empty" is that the swelling is taken away,subtracted, or emptied, by virtue of the repetition of the word,as if one should say, "Be thou void. Depart! depart! depart! Avoid me!"There is a very curious incantation also apparently of Indian-gypsyorigin, since it refers to the spirits of the water who causediseases. In this instance they are supposed to be exorcised by SaintPaphnutius, who is a later Slavonian-Christian addition to the oldShamanic spell. In the Accadian-Chaldæan formulas these spirits areseven; here they are seventy.The formula in question is against the fever:--    "In the name of God and his Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen!    "Seventy fair maids went up out of the ocean.    "They met the Saint Paphnutius, who asked:    "'Whence come ye, oh Maidens?'    "They answered, 'From the ocean-sea.    "'We go into the world to break the bones of men.    "'To give them the fever. (To make hot and cold).'"Then the holy Paphnutius began to beat them, and gave them every oneseventy-seven days:--    "They began to pray, 'O holy Paphnutius!    "'Forgive us, (and) whoever shall bear with him (thy) name,    or write it, him we will leave in peace.    "'We will depart from him    "Over the streams, over the seas.    "'Over the reeds (canes) and marshes.    "'O holy Paphnutius, sua misericordia, of thy mercy,    "'Have pity on thy slave, even on the sick man ---- (the name is    here uttered),    "'Free him from fever!'"It is remarkable that, as a certain mysterious worm, caterpillar, orsmall lizard (accounts differ) among the Algonkin Indians is supposedto become at will a dragon, or sorcerer, or spirit, to be invoked orcalled on, so the Wolos worm is also invoked, sometimes as a saintor sorcerer, and sometimes as a spirit who scatters disease. Thefollowing gypsy-Slavonian incantation over an invalid has much incommon with the old Chaldæan spells:--   "Wolosni, Wolosnicéh!    Thou holy Wolos!    God calls thee unto his dwelling,    Unto his seat.    Thou shalt not remain here,    To break the yellow bones.    To drink the red blood,    To dry up the white body.    Go forth as the bright sun    Goes forth over the mountains,    Out from the seventy-seven veins,    Out from the seventy limbs (parts of the body).    Before I shall recognize thee,    Before I did not name thee (call on thee).    But now I know who thou art;    I began to pray to the mother of God,    And the mother of God began to aid me.    Go as the wind goes over the meadows or the shore (or banks),    As the waves roll over the waters,    So may the Wolos go from ----    The man who is born,    Who is consecrated with prayer."The Shamanic worship of water as a spirit is extremely ancient,and is distinctly recognized as such by the formulas of the Churchin which water is called "this creature." The water spirits play aleading part in the gypsy mythology. The following gypsy-Slav charm, toconsecrate a swarm of bees, was also given to me by Prof. Dragomanoff,who had learned it from a peasant:--   "One goes to the water and makes his prayer and greets the    water thus:--       "Hail to thee, Water!        Thou Water, Oliana!        Created by God,        And thou, oh Earth, Titiana!        And ye the near springs, brooks and rivulets,        Thou Water, Oliana,        Thou goest over the earth,        Over the neighbouring fountains and streams,        Down unto the sea,        Thou dost purify the sea,        The sand, the rocks, and the roots--        I pray thee grant me        Of the water of this lake,        To aid me,        To sprinkle my bees.        I will speak a word,        And God will give me help,        The all-holy Mother of God,        The mother of Christ,        Will aid me,        And the holy Father        The holy Zosimos, Sabbateus and the holy Friday Parascabeah!   "When this is said take the water and bear it home without looking    back. Then the bees are to be sprinkled therewith."The following Malo-Russian formula from the same authority, thoughrepointed and gilt with Greek Christianity, is old heathen, andespecially interesting since Prof. Dragomanoff traces it to a FinnicShaman source:--   "Charm Against the Bite of a Serpent.                  "The holy Virgin sent a man                   Unto Mount Sion,                   Upon this mountain                   Is the city of Babylon,                   And in the city of Babylon                   Lives Queen Volga.                   Oh Queen Volga,                   Why dost thou not teach                   This servant of God    (Here the name of the one bitten by a serpent is mentioned)                   So that he may not be bitten                   By serpents?"    (The reply of Queen Volga)                  "Not only will I teach my descendants                   But I also will prostrate myself                   Before the Lord God."   "Volga is the name of a legendary heathen princess of Kief, who    was baptized and sainted by the Russian Church. The feminine    form, Olga, or Volga, corresponds to the masculine name Oleg,    or Olg, the earliest legendary character of Kief. His surname    was Viechtchig--the sage or sorcerer" (i.e., wizard, and from a    cognate root). "In popular songs he is called Volga, or Volkh,    which is related to Volkv, a sorcerer. The Russian annals speak    of the Volkv of Finland, who are represented as Shamans." Niya    Predania i Raskazi ("Traditions and Popular Tales of Lesser    Russia," by M. Dragomanoff, Kief, 1876) in Russian.I have in the chapter on curing the disorders of children spoken ofLilith, or Herodias, who steals the new-born infants. She and hertwelve daughters are also types of the different kinds of fever forwhich the gypsies have so many cures of the same character, preciselyas those which were used by the old Bogomiles. The characteristicpoint is that this female spirit is everywhere regarded as the causeof catalepsy or fits. Hence the invocation to St. Sisinie is used indriving them away. This invocation written, is carried as an amuletor fetish. I give the translation of one of these from the Roumanian,in which the Holy Virgin is taken as the healer. It is against crampin the night:--   "Spell Against Night-cramp.   "There is a mighty hill, and on this hill is a golden apple-tree.   "Under the golden apple-tree is a golden stool.   "On the stool--who sits there?   "There sits the Mother of God with Saint Maria; with the boxes    in her right hand, with the cup in her left.   "She looks up and sees naught, she looks down and sees my Lord    and Lady Disease.   "Lords and Ladies Cramp, Lord and Lady Vampire--Lord Wehrwolf    and his wives.   "They are going to ---- (the sufferer), to drink his blood and    put in him a foul heart.   "The Mother of God, when she saw them, went down to them, spoke    to them, and asked them, 'Whither go ye, Lord and Lady Disease,    Lords and Ladies Cramp, &c.?'  "'We go to ---- to drink his blood, to change his heart to a    foul one.'  "'No, ye shall return; give him his blood back, restore him his    own heart, and leave him immediately.'   "Cramps of the night, cramps of the midnight, cramps of the day,    cramps wherever they are. From water, from the wind, go out from    the brain, from the light of the face, from the hearing of the    ears, from his heart, from his hands and feet, from the soles of    his feet.   "Go and hide where black cocks never crow, [6] where men never go,    where no beast roars.   "Hide yourself there, stop there, and never show yourself more!   "May ---- remain pure and glad, as he was made by God, and was    fated by the Mother of God!   "The spell is mine--the cure is God's."In reference to the name Herodias (here identified with Lilith, theHebrew mother of all devils and goblins); it was a great puzzle tothe writers on witchcraft why the Italian witches always said theyhad two queens whom they worshipped--Diana and Herodias. The latterseems to have specially presided at the witch-dance. In this we cansee an evident connection with the Herodias of the New Testament.I add to this a few more very curious old Slavonian spells fromDr. Gaster's work, as they admirably illustrate one of the principaland most interesting subjects connected with the gypsy witchcraft;that is to say, its relation to early Shamanism and the forms inwhich its incantations were expressed. In all of these it may betaken for granted, from a great number of closely-allied examples,that the Christianity in them is recent and that they all go back tothe earliest heathen times. The following formula, dating from 1423,against snake-bites bears the title:--   "Prayer of St. Paul against Snakes.   "In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. I once    was a persecutor, but am now a true follower; and I went from    my dwelling-place in Sicily, and they set light to a trunk,    and a snake came therefrom and bit my right hand and hung from    it. But I had in me the power of God, and I shook it off into the    burning fire and it was destroyed, and I suffered no ill from the    bite. I laid myself down to sleep; then the mighty angel said:    'Saul, Paul, stand up and receive this writing'; and I found in    it the following words:  "'I exorcise you, sixty and a half kinds of beasts that creep on    the earth, in the name of God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth,    and in the name of the immovable throne.  "'Serpent of Evil, I exorcise thee in the name of the burning    river which rises under the footstool of the Saviour, and in the    name of His incorporeal angels!  "'Thou snake of the tribe of basilisks, thou foul-headed snake,    twelve-headed snake, variegated snake, dragon-like snake, that art    on the right side of hell, whomsoever thou bitest thou shalt have    no power to harm, and thou must go away with all the twenty-four    kinds. If a man has this prayer and this curse of the true, holy    apostle, and a snake bites him, then it will die on the spot, and    the man that is bitten shall remain unharmed, to the honour of the    Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, now and for all time. Amen.'"It is not improbable that we have in Paul and the Serpent and theformula for curing its bite (which is a common symbol for all disease)a souvenir of Esculapius, the all-healer, and his serpent. Thefollowing is "a prayer against the toothache, to be carried aboutwith one," i.e., as an amulet prayer:--   "Spell for the Toothache.   "Saint Peter sat on a stone and wept. Christ came to him and said,   'Peter, why weepest thou?' Peter answered, 'Lord, my teeth pain    me.' The Lord thereupon ordered the worm in Peter's tooth to come    out of it and never more go in again. Scarcely had the worm come    out when the pain ceased. Then spoke Peter, 'I pray you, O Lord,    that when these words be written out and a man carries them he    shall have no toothache.' And the Lord answered, ''Tis well,    Peter; so may it be!'"It will hardly be urged that this Slavonian charm of Eastern origincould have been originated independently in England. The following,which is there found in the north, is, as Gaster remarks, "in thesame wording":--   "Peter was sitting on a marble stone,    And Jesus passed by.    Peter said, 'My Lord, my God,    How my tooth doth ache!'    Jesus said, 'Peter art whole!    And whosoever keeps these words for My sake    Shall never have the toothache.'"The next specimen is a--   "Charm against Nose-bleeding.   "Zachariah was slain in the Lord's temple, and his blood turned    into stone. Then stop, O blood, for the Lord's servant, ----. I    exorcise thee, blood, that thou stoppest in the name of the    Saviour, and by fear of the priests when they perform the liturgy    at the altar."Those who sell these charms are almost universally supposed to bemere quacks and humbugs. If this were the case, why do they so verycarefully learn and preserve these incantations, transmitting them          "as a rich legacy    Unto their issue."But they really do believe in them, and will give great prices forthem. Prof. Dragomanoff told me that once in Malo-Russia it becamegenerally known that he had made a MS. collection of such spells. Apeasant who was desirous of becoming a sorcerer, but who had very fewincantations of his own, went whenever he could by stealth into theProfessor's library and surreptitiously copied his incantations. Andwhen Prof. Dragomanoff returned the next year to that neighbourhood, hefound the peasant doing a very good business as a conjuring doctor, orfaith-healer. I have a lady correspondent in the United States who hasbeen initiated into Voodoo and studied Indian-negro witchcraft undertwo eminent teachers, one a woman, the other a man. The latter, whowas at the very head of the profession, sought the lady's acquaintancebecause he had heard that she possessed some very valuable spells. Inthe fourth or highest degree, as in Slavonian or Hungarian gypsy-magic,this Indian-Voodoo deals exclusively with the spirits of the forestand stream.M. Kounavine, as set forth by Dr. A. Elysseeff (Gypsy-Lore Journal,July, 1890), gives a Russian gypsy incantation by which the fire isinvoked to cure illness. It is as follows:--   "Great Fire, my defender and protector, son of the celestial fire,    equal of the sun who cleanses the earth of foulness, deliver this    man from the evil sickness that torments him night and day!"The fire is also invoked to punish, or as an ordeal, e.g.:--   "Fire, who punishest the evil-doer, who hatest falsehood,    who scorchest the impure, thou destroyest offenders; thy flame    devoureth the earth. Devour ---- if he says what is not true,    if he thinks a lie, and if he acts deceitfully."These are pronounced by the gypsy sorcerer facing the burninghearth. There is another in which fire is addressed as Jandra, andalso invoked to punish an offender:--   "Jandra, bearer of thunderbolts, great Periani (compare Parjana,    an epithet of Indra, Slavonic Perun), bearer of lightning, slay    with thy thunderbolt and burn with thy celestial fire him who    dares to violate his oath."CHAPTER III.GYPSY CONJURATIONS AND EXORCISMS--THE CURE OF CHILDREN--HUNGARIANGYPSY SPELLS--A CURIOUS OLD ITALIAN "SECRET"--THE MAGIC VIRTUE OFGARLIC--A FLORENTINE INCANTATION LEARNED FROM A WITCH--LILITH, THECHILD-STEALER, AND QUEEN OF THE WITCHES.In all the schools of Shamanic sorcery, from those of theAssyrian-Accadian to the widely-spread varieties of the present day,the Exorcism forms the principal element. An exorcism is a formula,the properties or power of which is that when properly pronounced,especially if this be done with certain fumigations and ceremonies, itwill drive away devils, diseases, and disasters of every description;nay, according to very high, and that by no means too ancient,authority, it is efficacious in banishing bugs, mice, or locusts,and it is equal to Persian powder as a fuge for fleas, but is,unfortunately, too expensive to be used for that purpose save by thevery wealthy. It has been vigorously applied against the grape disease,the Colorado beetle, the army worm, and the blizzard in the UnitedStates, but, I believe, without effect, owing possibly to differencesof climate or other antagonistic influences.Closely allied to the Exorcism is the Benediction, which soon grewout of it as a cure. The former being meant to repel and drive awayevil, the latter very naturally suggested itself, by a law of moralpolarity, as a means of attracting good fortune, blessings, health, andpeace. As the one was violently curative, the other was preventive. Thebenediction would keep the devils and all their works away from a manor his home--in fact, if stables be only well blessed once a year,no mishaps can come to any of the animals who inhabit them; and Imyself have known a number of donkeys to receive a benediction inRome, the owner being assured that it would keep them safe from allthe ills which donkeys inherit. And in the year 1880, in one of theprincipal churches of Philadelphia, blessed candles were sold to acongregation under guarantee that the purchase of one would preserveits possessor for one year against all disorders of the throat, onwhich occasion a sermon was preached, in the which seven instanceswere given in which people had thus been cured.Between blessing and banning it soon became evident that many formulasof words could be used to bring about mysterious results. It isprobable that the Exorcism in its original was simply the angry,elevated tone of voice which animals as well as men instinctivelyemploy to repel an enemy or express a terror. For this unusual languagewould be chosen, remembered, and repeated. With every new utterancethis outcry or curse would be more seriously pronounced or enlargedtill it became an Ernulphian formula. The next step would be to giveit metric form, and its probable development is very interesting. Itdoes not seem to have occurred to many investigators that in earlyages all things whatever which were remembered and repeated weredroned and intoned, or sing-sung, until they fell of themselves intoa kind of metre. In all schools at the present day, where boys arerequired to repeat aloud and all together the most prosaic lessons,they end by chanting them in rude rhythm. All monotone, be it thatof a running brook, falls into cadence and metre. All of the sagas,or legends, of the Algonkin-Wabanaki were till within even fifty yearschants or songs, and if they are now rapidly losing that character itis because they are no longer recited with the interest and accuracywhich was once observed in the narrators. But it was simply becauseall things often repeated were thus intoned that the exorcisms becamemetrical. It is remarkable that among the Aryan races it assumed whatis called the staff-rhyme, like that which Shakespeare, and Ben Jonson,and Byron, and many more employ, as it would seem, instinctively,whenever witches speak or spells or charms are uttered. It will notescape the reader that, in the Hungarian gypsy incantations in thiswork, the same measure is used as that which occurs in the Norsesagas, or in the scenes of Macbeth. It is also common in Italy. Thisis intelligible--that its short, bold, deeply-marked movement hasin itself something mysterious and terrible. If that wofully-abusedword "weird" has any real application to anything, it is to thestaff-rhyme. I believe that when a man, and particularly a woman, doesnot know what else to say, he or she writes "lurid," or "weird," and Ilately met with a book of travels in which I found the latter appliedseventy-six times to all kinds of conundrums, until I concluded that,like the coachman's definition of an idea in Heine's "Reisebilder," itmeant simply "any d----d nonsense that a man gets into his head." Butif weird really and only means that which is connected with fate ordestiny, from the Anglo-Saxon Weordan, to become, German, Werden,then it is applicable enough to rhymes setting forth the future andspoken by the "weird sisters," who are so-called not because they areawful or nightmarish, or pokerish, or mystical, or bug-a-boorish,but simply because they predict the future or destiny of men. "TheAthenians as well as Gentiles excelled in these songs of sorcery,hence we are told (Varro, "Q. de Fascin") that in Achaia, when theylearned that a certain woman who used them was an Athenian they stonedher to death, declaring that the immortal gods bestowed on man thepower of healing with stones, herbs, and animals, not with words"("De Rem. Superstit. Cognos cendis"). Truly, doctors never agree.It was in 1886 that I learned from a girl in Florence two exorcismsor invocations which she was accustomed to repeat before tellingfortunes by cards. This girl, who was of the Tuscan Romagna andwho looked Etruscan with a touch of gypsy blood, was a repertory ofpopular superstitions, especially witch-lore, and a maker and wearerof fetishes, always carrying a small bag full of them. Bon sang nepeut mentir.The two formulas were as follows. I omit a portion from each:--   "Venti cinque carte siete!    Venti cinque diavoli diventerete,    Diventerete, anderete    Nel' corpo, nel' sangue nell' anima,    Nell' sentimenti del corpo;    Del mio amante non posso vivere,    Non passa stare ne bere,    Ne mangiare ne ...    Ne con uomini ne con donne non passa favellare,    Finche a la porta di casa mia    Non viene picchiare!"   "Ye are twenty-five cards,    Become twenty-five devils!    Enter into the body, into the blood, into the soul;    Into the feelings of the body    Of my lover, from whom I cannot live.    For I cannot stand (exist), or drink,    Or eat ...    Nor can I converse with men or women    Till at the door of my house    He shall come to knock."The second incantation was the same, but beginning with these words:--   "I put five fingers on the wall,    I conjure five devils,    Five monks and five friars,    That they may enter the body    Into the blood, into the soul," &c.If the reader will take Le Normant's "Magie Chaldaienne," and carefullycompare these Italian spells with those of ancient Nineveh, he willnot only find a close general resemblance, but all the several detailsor actual identity of words. And it is not a little curious that thesame formulas which were repeated--   "Once on a time when Babylon was young"--should still be current in Italy. So it passed through the ages--racescame and went--and among the people the old sorcery was handedacross and adown, so that it still lives. But in a few years morethe Folk-lorist will be its only repository.This chapter is devoted to conjuring diseases of children bygypsies. It bears a great likeness to one in the very devout workof Peter Pipernus, "De Pueris affectis morbis magicis" ("Of Boys whohave been Bewitched into Disease"), only that Pipernus uses Catholicincantations, which he also employs "pro ligatis in matrimonio,""pro incubo magico," "de dolóribus stomachi magicis," &c., for to him,as he declares, all disease is of magic origin.The magic of the gypsies is not all deceit, though they deceive withit. They put faith themselves in their incantations, and practisethem on their own account. "And they believe that there are women,and sometimes men, who possess supernatural power, partly inheritedand partly acquired." The last of seven daughters born in succession,without a boy's coming into the series, is wonderfully gifted, forshe can see hidden treasure or spirits, or enjoy second sight of manythings invisible to men. And the same holds good for the ninth in aseries of boys, who may become a seer of the same sort. Such a girl,i.e., a seventh daughter, being a fortune in herself, never lackslovers. In 1883 the young Vojvode, or leader, of the Kukaya gypsytribe, named Danku Niculai, offered the old gypsy woman, Pale Boshe,one hundred ducats if she would persuade her seventh daughter tomarry him. In the United States of America there are many women whoadvertise in the newspapers that they also are seventh daughtersof seventh daughters at that, and who make a good thing of it asfortune-tellers; but they have a far more speedy, economical, andeffective way of becoming the last note in an octave, than by awaitingthe slow processes of being begotten or born, inasmuch as they boldlydeclare themselves to be sevenths, which I am assured answers everypurpose, as nobody ever asks to see their certificates of baptismany more than of marriage. [7]Most of these witch-wives--also known in Hungary as cohalyi, or "wisewomen," or gule romni, "sweet" or "charming women"--are trained upfrom infancy by their mothers in medicine and magic. A great partof this education consists in getting by heart the incantations orformulas of which specimens will be given anon, and which, in commonwith their fairy tales, show intrinsic evidence of having been drawnat no very distant period from India, and probably in common withthe lower or Shamanic religion of India from Turanian sources. Butthere is among the Hungarian gypsies a class of female magicians whostand far above their sisters of the hidden spell in power. Theseare the lace romni, or "good women," who draw their power directlyfrom the Nivasi or Pchuvusi, the spirits of water and earth, or offlood and fell. For the Hungarian gypsies have a beautiful mythologyof their own which at first sight would seem to be a composition ofthe Rosicrucian as set forth by Paracelsus and the Comte de Gabalis,with the exquisite Indo-Teutonic fairy tales of the Middle Ages. Infact, in some of the incantations used we find the Urme, or fairies,directly appealed to for help.With the gypsies, as among the early Accadians, diseases are supposedto be caused by evil supernatural influences. This is more naturallythe case among people who lead very simple lives, and with whomsickness is not almost a natural or normal condition, as it iswith ladies and gentlemen, or the inhabitants of cities, who have"always something the matter with them." Nomadic life is conducive tolongevity. "Our grandfathers died on the gallows--we die from losingour teeth," said an old gypsy to Doctor von Wlislocki, when asked whathis age was. Therefore among all people who use charms and spells thosewhich are devoted to cure occupy the principal position. However,the Hungarian Romany have many medicines, more or less mysterious,which they also apply in connection with the "healing rhymes." Andas in the struggle for life the weakest go first to the wall, theremedies for the diseases of children are predominant.When a mother begins to suffer the pangs of childbirth, a fire is madebefore her tent, which is kept up till the infant is baptized, in orderto drive away evil spirits. Certain women feed this fire, and whilefanning it (fans being used for bellows) murmur the following rhyme:--   "Oh yakh, oh yakh pçabuva,                     Pçabuva,    Te cavéstár tu trádá,                Tu trada,    Pçúvushen te Nivashen    Tire tçuva the traden!    Lace Urmen ávená,    Caves báçtáles dena,    Káthe hin yov báçtáles,    Andre lime báçtáles!    Motura te ráná,    Te átunci but' ráná,    Motura te ráná,    Te átunci, but' ráná,    Me dav' andre yákherá!    Oh yákh, oh yákh pçabuva,    Rovel cavo: áshuna!"It may here be remarked that the pronunciation of all these wordsis the same as in German, with the following additions. C = teh inEnglish, or to ch in church. C = ch in German as in Buch. J = azs,or the English j, in James; n, as in Spanish, or nj in German, whilesh and y are pronounced as in English. Á is like ah. The literaltranslation is:--   "Oh Fire, oh Fire, burn!                      Burn!    And from the child (do) thou drive away                                 Drive away!    Pçuvuse and Nivashi    And drive away thy smoke (pl.)    (Let) good fairies come (and)    Give luck to the child,    Here it is lucky (or fortunate)    In the world fortunate    Brooms and twigs (fuel)    And then more twigs,    And then yet more twigs    I put (give) to the fire.    Oh fire, oh fire--burn!    The child weeps: listen!"In South Hungary the gypsy women on similar occasions sing thefollowing charm:--   "Eftá Pçuvushá, efta Niváshá    André mal avená    Pçabuven, pçabuven, oh yákhá!    Dáyákri punro dindálen,    Te gule caves mudáren;    Pçabuven, pçabuven, oh yákhá;    Ferinen o caves te daya!"   "Seven Pçuvushe, seven Nivasi    Come into the field,    Burn, burn, oh fire!    They bite the mother's foot,    They destroy the sweet child;    Fire, fire, oh burn!    Protect the child and the mother!"When the birth is very difficult, the mother's relations come to help,and one of them lets an egg fall, zwischen den Beinen derselben. Onthis occasion the gypsy women in Southern Hungary sing:--   "Ánro, ánro in obles,    Te e pera in obles:    Ava cavo sástávestes!    Devlá, devlá, tut akharel!"   "The egg, the egg is round,    And the belly is round,    Come child in good health!    God, God calls thee!"If a woman dies in child-bed two eggs are placed under her arms andthe following couplet is muttered:--   "Kana anro kirnes hin,    Kathe nañi tçudá hin!"   "When this egg is (shall be) decayed,    Here (will be) is no milk!"When the after-pains begin it is the custom with some of the gypsytribes in the Siebenburgen to smoke the sufferer with decayedwillow-wood which is burned for the purpose while the women inattendance sing:--   "Sik te sik o tçu urál,    Te urál o con urál!    Kana len hádjináven    Sascipená tut' áven;    Káná o tçu ná urál--    Tute náñi the dukhal,    Tute náñi the dukhal."   "Fast and fast the smoke flies,    And flies, the moon flies,    When they find (themselves)    Health (yet) will come to thee,    "When the smoke no (longer) flies    Thou wilt feel pain no more!"There is a strange, mysterious affinity between gypsies and the moon. Awonderful legend, which they certainly brought from India since in itMekran is mentioned as the place where its incident occurred, detailsthat there, owing to the misrepresentations of a sorcerer, the gypsyleader, Chen, was made to marry his sister Guin, or Kan, which broughtthe curse of wandering upon his people. Hence the Romany are calledChen-Guin. It is very evident that here we have Chon and Kan, or Kam,the Moon and Sun, which is confirmed by another gypsy legend whichdeclares that the Sun, because he once violated or still seeks toseduce his sister, the Moon, continually follows her, being destinedto wander for ever. And as the name Chen-Kan, or Zingan, or Zigeuner,is known all over the East, and, as this legend shows, is of Indianorigin, it is hardly worth while to believe with Miklosich that it isderived from an obscure Greek heretical sect of Christians--the moreso as it is most difficult to believe that the Romany were originallyeither Greeks or Christians or Christian heretics.When a gypsy woman is with child she will not, if she can help it,leave her tent by full moonshine. A child born at this time it isbelieved will make a happy marriage. So it is said of birth in theWestern World:--   "Full moon, high sea,    Great man thou shalt be;    Red dawning, cloudy sky,    Bloody death shalt thou die.   "Pray to the Moon when she is round,    Luck with you will then abound,    What you seek for shall be found    On the sea or solid ground."Moon-worship is very ancient; it is alluded to as a forbiddenthing in the Book of Job. From early times witches and other womenworked their spells when stark-naked by the light of the full moon,which is evidently derived from the ancient worship of that planetand the shameless orgies connected with it. Dr. Wlislocki simplyremarks on this subject that the moon has, in the gypsy incantation,"eine Phallische Bedeutung." In ancient symbolism the horns of themoon were regarded as synonymous with the horns of the ox--hencetheir connection with agriculture, productiveness, and fertility,or the generative principle, and from this comes the beneficentinfluence not only of the horns, but of horse-shoes, boars' tusks,crabs' claws, and pieces of coral resembling them.The great love of gypsy mothers for their children, says Wlislocki,induces their friends to seek remedies for the most triflingdisorders. At a later period, mother and child are left to MotherNature--or the vis medicatrix Naturæ. What is greatly dreaded is theBerufen, or being called on, "enchanted," in English "overlooked,"or subjected to the evil eye. An universal remedy for this is thefollowing:--A jar is filled with water from a stream, and it must be taken with,not against, the current as it runs. In it are placed seven coals,seven handfuls of meal, and seven cloves of garlic, all of which isput on the fire. When the water begins to boil it is stirred with athree-forked twig, while the wise woman repeats:--   "Miseç' yakhá tut dikhen,    Te yon káthe mudáren!    Te átunci eftá coká    Te çaven miseçe yakhá;    Miseç' yakhá tut dikhen,    Te yon káthe mudáren!    But práhestár e yakhá    Atunci kores th'ávená;    Miseç' yakhá tut dikhen    Te yon káthe mudáren!    Pçábuvená pçábuvená    Andre develeskero yakhá!"   "Evil eyes look on thee,    May they here extinguished be!    And then seven ravens    Pluck out the evil eyes;    Evil eyes (now) look on thee,    May they soon extinguished be!    Much dust in the eyes,    Thence may they become blind,    Evil eyes now look on thee;    May they soon extinguished be!    May they burn, may they burn    In the fire of God!"Dr. Wlislocki remarks that the "seven ravens" are probably representedby the seven coals, while the three-pointed twig, the meal and thegarlic, symbolize lightning. He does not observe that the stick may bethe triçula or trident of Siva--whence probably the gipsy word trushul,a cross; but the connection is very obvious. It is remarkable that thegypsies assert that lightning leaves behind it a smell like that ofgarlic. As garlic forms an important ingredient in magic charms, thefollowing from "The Symbolism of Nature" ("Die Symbolik und Mythologieder Natur"), by J. B. Friedrich, will be found interesting:--   "We find in many forms spread far and wide the belief that    garlic possesses the magic power of protection against poison and    sorcery. This comes, according to Pliny, from the fact that when    it is hung up in the open air for a time, it turns black, when    it is supposed to attract evil into itself--and, consequently, to    withdraw it from the wearer. The ancients believed that the herb    which Mercury gave to Ulysses to protect him from the enchantment    of Circe, and which Homer calls moly, was the alium nigrum, or    garlic, the poison of the witch being a narcotic. Among the modern    Greeks and Turks, garlic is regarded as the most powerful charm    against evil spirits, magic, and misfortune. For this reason they    carry it with them, and hang it up in their houses as a protection    against storms and bad weather. So their sailors carry with them    a sack of it to avert shipwreck. If any one utters a word of    praise with the intention of fascinating or of doing harm, they    cry aloud 'Garlic!' or utter it three times rapidly. In Aulus    Persius Flaccus (Satyr. V.) to bite garlic averts magic and the    evils which the gods send to those who are wanting in reverence    for them. According to a popular belief the mere pronunciation of    'Garlic!' protects one from poison."It appears to be generally held among them and the Poles that thisword prevents children from "beschreien werden" that is, from beingbanned, or overlooked, or evil-eyed. And among the Poles garlicis laid under children's pillows to protect them from devils andwitches. (Bratraneck, "Beiträge zur Æsthetik der Pflanzenwelt,"p. 56). The belief in garlic as something sacred appears to have beenvery widely spread, since the Druids attributed magic virtues to it;hence the reverence for the nearly allied leek, which is attached toKing David and so much honoured by the Welsh.   "Tell him I'll knock his leek about his pate    Upon Saint David's Day."--Shakespeare.The magic virtues of garlic were naturally enough also attributed toonions and leeks, and in a curious Italian work, entitled "Il Librodel Comando," attributed (falsely) to Cornelius Agrippa, I findthe following:--   "Segreto magico d'indovinare, colle cipole, la salute d'una    persona lontana. A magic secret to divine with onions the health    of a person far distant. Gather onions on the Eve of Christmas    and put them on an altar, and under every onion write the name    of the persons as to whom one desires to be informed, ancorche    non scrivano, even if they do not write.   "The onion (planted) which sprouts the first will clearly announce    that the person whose name it bears is well.   "And in the same manner we can learn the name of the husband or    wife whom we should choose, and this divination is in use in many    cantons of Germany."Very much allied to this is the following love charm from an Englishgypsy:--   "Take an onion, a tulip, or any root of the kind (i.e. a bulbous    root?), and plant it in a clean pot never used before; and while    you plant it repeat the name of the one whom you love, and every    day, morning and evening, say over it:--  "'As this root grows    And as this blossom blows,    May her heart be    Turned unto me!'"And it will come to pass that every day the one whom you love willbe more and more inclined to you, till you get your heart's desire."A similar divination is practised by sowing cress or lettuce seed inthe form of names in gardens. If it grows well the one who plants itwill win the love of the person indicated.As regards the use of coals in incantations, Marcellus Burdigalensis,[8] a Latin physician of the third century, who has left us acollection of Latin and Gaelic charms, recommends for a cure fortoothache: "Salis granum, panis micam, carbonem mortuum in phoenicioalligabis," i.e., to carry a grain of salt, a crumb of bread, and acoal, in a red bag.When the witch-brew of coals, garlic, and meal is made, and boileddown to a dry residuum, it is put into a small three-cornered bag,and hung about the child's neck, on which occasion the appropriaterhyme is repeated nine times. "And it is of special importance thatthe bag shall be made of a piece of linen, which must be stolen,found, or begged."To learn whether a child has been overlooked, or evil-eyed, orenchanted, the "wise woman" takes it in her arms, and goes to thenext running stream. There she holds the face of the babe as nearlyas she can to the water, and repeats:--   "Páñi, páñi sikova,    Dikh the upré, dikh télé!    Buti páñi sikovel    Buti pál yákh the dikhel    Te ákáná mudárel."   "Water, water, hasten!    Look up, look down!    Much water hastens    (May) as much come into the eye    Which looked evil on thee,    And may it now perish."If the running brook makes a louder sound than usual then it issupposed to say that the child is enchanted, but if it runs on asbefore then something else is the matter, and to ascertain what itis other charms and ceremonies are had recourse to. This incantationindicates, like many others, a constant dwelling in lonely places,by wood and stream, as gypsies wont to do, and sweet familiarity withNature, until one hears sermons in stones, books in the running brooks,and voices in the wind. [9] Civilized people who read about Red Indiansorcerers and gypsy witches very promptly conclude that they are merehumbugs or lunatics--they do not realize how these people, who passhalf their lives in wild places watching waving grass and fallingwaters, and listening to the brook until its cadence speaks in realsong, believe in their inspirations, and feel that there is the samemystical feeling and presence in all things that live and move andmurmur as well as in themselves. Now we have against this the lifeof the clubs and family, of receptions and business, factories andstock-markets, newspapers and "culture." Absolutely no one who livesin "the movement" can understand this sweet old sorcery. But natureis eternal, and while grass grows and rivers run man is ever likelyto fall again into the eternal enchantments. And truly until he doeshe will have no new poetry, no fresh art, and must go on copying oldideas and having wretchedly worn-out exhibitions in which there isnot one original idea.If it appears that the child is overlooked, or "berufen," many meansare resorted to, "one good if another fails," but we have here to doonly with those which are connected with incantations. A favouriteone is the following: Three twigs are cut, each one from a differenttree, and put into a pipkin which has been filled with water dippedor drawn with, not against, the current of a stream. Three handfulsof meal are then put in and boiled down to a Brei, or pudding. Ahorse hair is then wound round a needle, which is stuck not by thepoint but by the head into the inner bottom of a tub, which is filledwith water, and placed upon this is the pipkin with the pudding. Thenthe "overlooked," or evil-seen child is held over the tub while thefollowing rhyme is chanted:--   "Páñi, páñi lunjárá,    Páñi, páñi isbiná;    Te náshválipen çucá    Náshválipen mudárá,    Mudára te ákáná,    Káthe beshá ñikáná,    Sár práytiña sutyárel,    Káthe ándre piri, ándre piri,    Nivasheshe les dávás!"   "Water, water, spread!    Water, water, stretch!    And sickness disappear,    Sickness be destroyed,    Be destroyed now.    Remain not here at all!    Who ever has overlooked this child    As this leaf in the pot (maybe)    Be given to the Nivashi!"This is repeated nine times, when the water in the tub, with thepipkin and its contents, are all thrown into the stream from which thewater was drawn. This is a widely-spread charm, and it is extremelyancient. The pipkin placed across the tub or trough--trog--heresignifies a bridge, and Wlislocki tells us that no Transylvaniantent-gypsy will cross a bridge without first spitting thrice overthe rails into the water. The bridge plays an important part inthe mythology and Folk-lore of many races. The ancient Persianshad their holy mountain, Albordi, or Garotman, the abode of godsand blessed souls, to which they passed by the bridge Cin-vat, orChinevad, whence the creed: "I believe in the resurrection of thedead; that all bodies shall live renewed again, and I believe thatby the bridge Cin-vat all good deeds will be rewarded, and all evildeeds punished." The punishment is apparent from the parallel ofthe bridge Al Sirat, borrowed by the Mahommedans from the Persians,over which the good souls passed to reward, and from which the wickedtumbled down into hell.When I first met Emerson in 1849 I happened to remark that a bridgein a landscape was like a vase in a room, the point on which aneye trained to the picturesque involuntarily rested. Nearly thirtyyears after, when we were both living at Shepherd's Hotel in Cairo,he reminded me of this one day when by the Nile we were lookingat a bridge. As a bridge must cross a stream, or a torrent whichis generally beautiful by itself, and as the cross or span has theeffect of defining and framing the picture, as a circlet or tiarasets off a beautiful head, it is not remarkable that in all agesmen have made such objects subjects of legend and song. Hence theoft-repeated Devil's Bridge, so-called because it seemed to simplepeasants impossible for mere mortals to build, although bridges arehabitually and more naturally connected with salvation and saints. Hewho in early ages built a bridge, did a great deed in times whenroads were rare; hence the great priest was called the Pontifex.Another spell for the purpose of averting the effects of the evil eyeis as follows: The mother of the overlooked child fills her mouth withsalt water, and lets it drop or trickle on the limbs of the infant,and when this has been done, repeats:--   "Miseç yákhá tut dikhen    Sár páñori--    Mudaren!    Náshvalipen prejia:    Andral t'ro shero    Andral t're kolyin,    Andral t're por    Andral t're punrá    Andral t're vástá    Kathe prejánen,--    Andre yákhá yon jánen!"   "False (evil) eyes see thee,    Like this water    May they perish!    Sickness depart    From thy head,    From thy breast,    From thy belly,    From thy feet,    From thy hands,    May they go hence    Into the evil eyes!"It may be observed that meal forms an ingredient in several of thesesorceries. It is a very ancient essential to sacrifices, and is offeredto the spirits of the stream to appease them, as it was often givenfor the same purpose to the wind. The old Germans, says Prætorius,imagined the storm-wind as a starving, ravenous being, and sought toappease it by throwing meal to it. So it happened once even of lateryears near Bamberg when a mighty wind was raging one night that anold woman took her meal-bag and threw its contents out of the window,saying:--   "Lege dich, lieber Wind,    Bringe dies deinem Kind!"   "Dear Wind, be not so wild,    Take that unto thy child!""In which thing," adds the highly Protestant Prætorius ("AnthropodemusPlutonicus," p. 429), "she was like the Papists who would fain appeasethe Donnerwetter, or thunderstorms, with the sound of baptized bells,as though they were raging round like famished lions, or grim wolves,or a soldier foraging, seeking what they may devour." The Wind hererepresents the Wild Hunter, or the Storm, the leader of the WüthendeHeer, or "raging army," who, under different names, is the hero ofso many German legends.That the voice of the wind should seem like that of wild beastsroaring for food would occur naturally enough to any one who wasfamiliar with both.When a child refuses the breast the gypsies believe that a Pçuvus-wife,or a female spirit of the earth has secretly sucked it. In sucha case they place between the mother's breasts onions, and repeatthese words:--   "Pçuvushi, Pçuvushi,    Ac tu náshvályi    Tiro tçud ac yakhá,    Andre pçuv tu pçábuvá!    Thávdá, thávdá miro tçud,    Thávdá, thávdá, parno tçud,    Thávdá, thávdá, sár kámáv,--    Mre cáveske bokhale!"   "Earth-spirit! Earth-spirit!    Be thou ill.    Let thy milk be fire!    Burn in the earth!    Flow, flow, my milk!    Flow, flow, white milk!    Flow, flow, as I desire    To my hungry child!"The same is applied when the milk holds back or will not flow, asit is then supposed that a Pçuvus-wife has secretly suckled her ownchild at the mother's breast. It is an old belief that elves puttheir own offspring in the place of infants, whom they sometimessteal. This subject of elf-changelings is extensively treated byall the writers on witchcraft. There is even a Latin treatise, orthesis, devoted to defining the legal and social status, rights,&c., of such beings. It is entitled, "De Infantibus Supposititiis,vulgo Wechsel-Bälgen," Dresden, 1678. "Such infants," says the author(John Valentine Merbitz), "are called Cambiones, Vagiones (à continuovagitu), Germanis Küllkräpfe, Wechselkinder, Wechselbälge, all ofwhich indicates, in German belief, children which have nothing humanabout them except the skin."When the child is subject to convulsive weeping or spasms, and losesits sleep, the mother takes a straw from the child's sleeping-placeand puts into her mouth. Then, while she is fumigated with driedcow-dung, into which the hair of the father and mother have beenmingled, she chants:--   "Bala, bálá pçubuven,    Cik te bálá pçubuven,    Cik te bálá pçubuven,    Pçábuvel náshvályipen!"   "Hair, hair, burn!    Dirt and hair burn!    Dirt and hair burn!    Illness be burned!"This bears manifest mark of Hindoo origin, and I have no doubt thatthe same ceremony in every detail is practised in India at the presentday. In Southern Hungary convulsive weeping in children is curedas follows: In the evening, when the fire burns before the tent,the mother takes her child in her arms and carries it three timesaround the fire, putting on it a pipkin full of water, into which sheputs three coals. With this water she washes the head of her child,and pours some of it on a black dog. Then she goes to the next streamor brook, and lets fall into it a red twist, saying:--   "Lává Niváshi ádá bolditori te láhá m're caveskro rovipen! Káná    sástavestes ánáv me tute pçábáyá te yándrá."   "Nivashi take this twist, and with it the weeping of my child. When    it is well I will bring thee apples and eggs."When a child "bumps" its head the swelling is pressed with the bladeof a knife, and the following spell is muttered thrice, seven, ornine times, according to the gravity of the injury:--   "Ac tu, ac tu, ac kovles,    The may sik tu mudarés!    Andre pcuv tu jiá,    Dikav tut me ñikáná!    Shuri, shuri, áná,    De pal pçuv!"   "Be thou, be thou, be thou weak (i.e., soft)    and very soon perish!    Go thou into the earth,    May I see thee never more!    Bring knives, knives,    Give (i.e., put) into the earth."Then the knife is stuck three, seven, or nine times into the earth. Ifthe child or a grown person has a bleeding at the nose, some of theblood is covered with earth, and the following verse repeated:--   "Pçuvush, dáv tute    Pçuvush, lává mánge,    De tre cáveske    Hin may táte!    Sik lava!"   "Pcuvus, I give to thee,    Pcuvus, oh take from me,    Give it to thy child,    It is very warm,    Take it quickly!"If the child has pains in the stomach, the hair of a black dog isburned to powder and kneaded with the mother's milk and some ofthe fæces of the child into a paste. This prescription occurs in themagical medical formulas of Marcellus Burdigalenis, the court-physicianat Rome in the fourth century: "Cape mel atticum et stercus infantisquod primum demittit, statim ex lacte mulieris quoe puerum allactatpermiscebis et sic inunges," &c. Most of the prescriptions of Marcelluswere of ancient Etrurian origin, and I have found many of them stillin use in the Romagna Toscana. This is put into a cloth and boundon the belly of the child. When it falls asleep a hole is bored ina tree and the paste put into it. The hole is then stopped up with awooden plug, and while this is being done the following is repeated:--   "Andrál por prejiá,    André selene beshá!    Beshá beshá tu káthe!    Penáv, penáv me tute!"   "Depart from the belly    Live in the green! (tree)    Remain, remain thou here!    I say, I say to thee!"The black dog is in many countries associated with sorcery anddiabolical influences, and "in European heathendom it was an emblemof the evil principle. The black demon Cernobog was represented bythe Slavs as a black dog. Among the Wallachians there is a horriblevampire-like creature called Priccolitsh, or Priculics, who appearsas a man in fine healthy condition, but by night he becomes a dog,kills people by the mere touch, and devours them." The black dogs ofFaust and of Cornelius Agrippa will occur to most readers.Gypsies have always been regarded as sorcerers and child-stealers,and it is remarkable that Lilith, the mother of all witchcraft,did the same. At the present day the Slavonian gypsies have spellsagainst such a spirit.In the Chaldæan magic, as set forth by Lenormant, as I have alreadystated, the powers of evil are incarnate diseases, they are sevenin number, and they are invoked by means of verses which bear anextraordinary resemblance to those which are still current in Italyas well as in other countries. According to some writers this is allmere chance coincidence, or due to concurrent causes and similarconditions in different countries. That diseases, like hunger, ordeath, or the terrors of the night, may have been incarnated as evilspirits naturally by all mankind may be granted, but when we find themarranged in categories of numbers, in widely different countries,employing the same means of banishing them--that is, by short songsand drum-beating--when we find these incantations in the same generalforms, often with the same words, our belief as to the identity oforigin is confirmed at every step. We can admit that the Jews werein Babylon and wandered thence all over the world, but that any otherreligious or superstitious system should have done the same would beobstinately denied. And by an incredible inconsistency, scholars whoadmit the early migrations of whole races on a vast scale, from theremotest regions of the East to Western Europe, deny that legendsand myths come with them or that they could have spread in like manner.One of the attributes of the witch of the Middle Ages in which she hasbeen confused with the Queen of the Fairies, and fairies in general, isthat she steals newly-born children. This is a very ancient attributeof the female demon or sorceress or strega, and it is found among Jewsat the present day who believe in the Benemmerinnen, or witches whohaunt women in childbirth as well as in Lilith. "The Jews banish thisfirst wife of Adam by writing on the walls, 'Adam chava chuz Lilith,'('Keep away from here, Lilith!')" ("Anthropodemus Plutonicus," byJohn Prætorius, 1666). That it is very ancient is rendered probablebecause the famous Bogomile formula of incantation against thetwelve fever-fits (Tresevica), or kinds of fever, turns entirely onthe legend of six children stolen by the demon who is compelled torestore them. Here we have the very oldest form of witchcraft known,that is incarnate disease in numbers allied to child-stealing. Thisspell of the Tresevica is attributed, says Dr. Gaster, to PopeJeremia, the founder of Bogomilism (the great Oriental Slavonianheresy which spread over Europe in the Middle Ages and prepared theway for Protestanism). "There is no doubt, therefore, that the spellis derived from the East, and I have elsewhere proved its existencein that quarter as early as the eighth century. It may have been ofManichæan origin. It has been preserved up to the present day in allthe lands of Eastern Europe and, with certain modifications, existsamong Germans and Jews." Though attributed to Sisynios, the immediatefollower of Manes, as chief of the Manichæans, it seems to have beenderived from an earlier Oriental tale which became the basis of alllater formulæ. I give it here in the Roumanian form, which closelyresembles the old one. Here, as in all the other variants, the demonis a feminine one. The following is the legend:--   "I, Sisveas, I came down from the Mount of Olives, saw the    Archangel Gabriel as he met the Avestitza, wing of Satan, and    seized her by the hair and asked her where she was going. And she    answered that she was going to cheat the holy Virgin by her tricks,    steal the new-born child, and drink its blood. The archangel asked    her how she could get into houses so as to steal the children,    and she answered that she changed herself into a fly or a cat or    such forms. But whosoever knew her twelve and a half (nineteen)    names and wrote them out she could not touch. She told him these    names, and they were written down."There is a Coptic as well as a Greek parallel to this. The fairy whosteals the children is called Lilith, and is further identified withHerodias and her twelve daughters as personifications of differentkinds of fever. This is extremely interesting, as it casts some lighton a question which has greatly puzzled all writers on witchcraft asto how or why Herodias was so generally worshipped in company withDiana by witches as a goddess in Italy. This is mentioned by Pipernus,Grillandus, Mirandola, and Horst. The name is probably much olderthan that of the Herodias of the New Testament.CHAPTER IV.SOUTH SLAVONIAN AND OTHER GYPSY WITCH-LORE.--THE WORDS FOR AWITCH--VILAS AND THE SPIRITS OF EARTH AND AIR--WITCHES, EGG-SHELLS,AND EGG-LORE--EGG PROVERBS--OVA DE CRUCIBUS.There is current in the whole of the Southern Slavonian provinces avast mass of legends and other lore relating to witches, which, in theopinion of Dr. Friedrich S. Krauss, may also be regarded as Romany,since it is held in common with the gypsies. There can, indeed, bevery little doubt that most of it was derived from, or disseminatedby, them, since they have been the principal masters in magic anddoctors in medicine in the Slavonic lands for many centuries. Thereare others deeply learned in this subject who share the same opinion,it being certain that the gypsies could hardly have a separate lore forthemselves and one for magic practices on others, and I entertain nodoubt that they are substantially the same; but to avoid possible errorand confusion, I give what I have taken in this kind from Dr. Krauss[10] and others by itself.As the English word witch, Anglo-Saxon Wicca, comes from aroot implying wisdom, [11] so the pure Slavonian word vjestica,Bulgarian, vjescirica (masculine, viestae), meant originally theone knowing or well informed, and it has preserved the same powerin allied languages, as Veaa (New Slovenish), knowledge, Vedavica,a fortune-teller by cards, Viedma (Russian), a witch, and Vedwin,fatidicus. In many places, especially in Dalmatia, witches are moregently or less plainly called Krstaca, the crossed, from Krst, a cross,i.e., christos, or Rogulja, "horned," derived from association withthe horns of devils. In Croatia the Italian Striga is used, whileamong the Slovenes and Kai-Kroats the term copernica (masculine,coprnjak). "But it enrages the witches so much to be called bythis word that when they hear that any one has used it they cometo his house by night and tear him in four pieces, which they castafar into the four quarters of the earth, yea, and thereunto carryaway all the swine, horses, and cattle, so intolerable is theirwrath." Therefore men use the word hmana zena, or "common woman,"hmana being the Slavonic pronunciation of the German word gemein, orcommon. In Dalmatia and far into Servia a witch is called macisnica,and magic, macija, which is, evidently enough, the Italian magia. Butthere are witches and witches, and it appears that among the learnedthe vjestica differs from the macionica, and this from the Zlokobnicawho, as the "evil-meeter," or one whom it is unlucky to encounter inthe morning, is probably only one who has the evil eye. A quotationfrom a Servian authority, given by Dr. Krauss, is as follows:--   "I have often heard from old Hodzas and Kadijas, that every female    Wallach, as soon as she is forty years old, abandons the 'God be    with us!' and becomes a witch (vjestica), or at least a zlokobnica    or macionica. A real witch has a mark of a cross under her nose, a    zlokobnica has some hairs of a beard, and a macionica may be known    by a forehead full of dark folds (frowns), with blood-spots in her    face" ("Niz srpskih pripoviedaka. Vuk. vit. Vecevica. Pancevo,"    p, 93. 1881).Of the great number of South Slavonian terms for the verb to enchantor bewitch, it may suffice to say that the commencement, carati,cari carani, carovnik, &c., appear to have much more affinity tothe gypsy chor-ava, to steal or swindle, and chov-hani, a witch,than to the Italian ciarlatano, and the French and English charlatan,from which Dr. Krauss derives them.THE VILAS-SYLVANA ELEMENTARY SPIRITS.Among the Slavonic and gypsy races all witchcraft, fairy- andFolk-lore rests mainly upon a belief in certain spirits of the wood andwold, of earth and water, which has much in common with that of theRosicrucians and Paracelsus, but much more with the gypsy mythology(as given by Wlislocki, "Vom Wandernden Zigeunervolke," pp. 49-309),which is apparently in a great measure of directly Indian origin."In the Vile" says Dr. Krauss, "also known as Samovile, Samodivi,and Vilevrjaci, we have near relations to the forest and fieldspirits, or the 'wood-' and 'moss-folk' of Middle Germany, France,and Bavaria; the 'wild people' of Eifel, Hesse, Salzburg, and theTyrol; the wood-women and wood-men of Bohemia; the Tyrolese Fanggen,Fänken, Nörkel, and Happy Ladies; the Roumanish Orken, Euguane,and Dialen; the Danish Ellekoner; the Swedish Skogsnufvaz; and theRussian Ljesje; while in certain respects they have affinity with theTeutonic Valkyries." Yet they differ on the whole from all of these,as from English fairies, in being more like divinities, who exert aconstant and familiar influence for good or evil on human beings, andwho are prayed to or exorcised on all occasions. They have, however,their exact parallel among the Red Indians of North America as amongthe Eskimo, and it is evident that they are originally derived fromthe old or primeval Shamanic faith, which once spread all over theearth. It is very true, as Dr. Krauss remarks, that in the West ofEurope it is becoming almost impossible to trace this true origin ofspirits now regarded as merely diabolical, or otherwise put into newrôles; but among the South Slavonians and gypsies we can still findthem in very nearly their old form and playing the same parts. We canstill find the Vila as set forth in old ballads, the incarnation ofbeauty and power, the benevolent friends of sufferers, the geniusesof heroes, the dwellers by rock and river and greenwood tree. Butthey are implacable in their wrath to all who deceive them, or whobreak a promise; nay, they inflict terrible punishment even on thosewho disturb their rings or the dances which they make by midsummermoonlight. Hence the proverb applied to any man who suddenly fell ill:"Naiso je na vilinsko kolo" ("He stepped on a fairy-ring"). From thisarbitrary exercise of power we find the Vila represented at times asa spirit who punishes and torments.Thus we are told that there was once a shepherd named Stanko, whoplayed beautifully on the flute. One evening he was so absorbed inhis own music that when the Ave Maria bell rung, instead of repeatingthe prayer he played it. As he ended he saw a Vila sitting on ahedge. And from that hour she never left him. By table, by his bed,at work or play, the white form and unearthly eyes of the spirit wereclose to him.   "By a spell to him unknown,    He could never be alone."Witches and wizards were summoned to aid him, but to no avail; nay,it made matters worse, for the Vila now often beat him, and whenpeople asked him why it was, he replied that the Vila did so becausehe refused to wander out into the world with her. And yet again hewould be discovered in the top of a tree, bound with bast; and so itwent on for years, till he was finally found one morning drowned ina ditch. So in the Wolf Dietrich legend the hero refuses the loveof die rauhe Else, and is made mad by the witch and runs wild. Allof which is identical with what is told in an Algonkin tale (vide"The Algonkin Legends of New England").There are three kinds of witches or spirits among the SouthernSlavonians which correspond in every respect exactly to those inwhich the gypsies believe. The first of these are the Zracne Vile,or aerial spirits. These, like the spirits of the air of Scripture,are evily-disposed to human beings, playing them mischievous tricksor inflicting on them fatal injuries. They lead them astray by night,like Friar Rush and Robin Goodfellow, or the English gypsy Mullo doods,or bewilder and frighten them into madness. Of the second kind are theEarth spirits, Pozemne Vile, in gypsy Pcuvushi or Puvushi. These areamiable, noble, and companionable beings, who often give sage counselto men. Thirdly are the Water sprites, in Slavonic Povodne Vile,in gypsy Nivashi, who are to the highest degree vindictive at times,yet who behave kindly to men when they meet them on land. But woe tothose who, while swimming, encounter them in streams or lakes, forthen the goblins grasp and whirl them about until they perish. Fromthis account by Dr. Krauss, it appears as if this Slavonic mythologywere derived from the gypsy, firstly, because it is more imperfectthan the latter, and secondly, because in it Vilas, or spirits,are confused with witches, while among the gypsies they are clearlyseparated and distinctly defined.Dr. Wlislocki says ("Vom Wand. Zigeunervolke," p. 253) that "gypsiesare still a race given to Shamanism, but yet they reverence ahighest being under the name of devla or del." This is, however,the case to-day with all believers in Shaman or Sorcery-religion, thedifference between them and monotheists being that this highest godis little worshipped or even thought of, all practical devotion beingpaid to spirits who are really their saints. By close examination theGypsy religion, like that of the country-folk in India, appears tobe absolutely identical in spirit with that of American Indians. AndI should say that the monk mentioned by Prætorius, who declaredthat though God and Christ should damn him, yet he could be savedby appealing to Saint Joseph, was not very far removed from beinga Shamanist.The Hungarian gypsies are divided into tribes, and one of these,the Kukaya, believes itself to be descended from the Pçuvushi, orearth-fairies, according to the following story, narrated by Dr. H. vonWlislocki in his paper on the genealogy and family relations of theTransylvanian Tent Gypsies:--   "Many thousand years ago there were as yet in the world very    few Pchuvushi. These are beings of human form dwelling under    the earth. There they have cities, but they very often come to    the world above. They are ugly, and their men are covered with    hair. (All of this indicates a prehistoric subterranean race    like the Eskimo, fur-clad. [12]) They carry off mortal girls for    wives. Their life is hidden in the egg of a black hen."This is the same as that of the Orco or Ogre in the Italian tale, "IRacconti delle Fate, Cesare da Causa," Florence, 1888. Whoever killsthe hen and throws the egg into a running stream, kills the pchuvush.   "Once a young Pchuvush woman came up to the world and sat in a    fair green forest. She saw a very beautiful youth sleeping in    the shade, and said: 'What happiness it must be to have such a    husband. Mine is so ugly!' Her husband, who had stolen silently    after her, heard this, and reflected: 'What a good idea it would    be to lend my wife to this young man till she shall have borne a    family of beautiful children! Then I could sell them to my rich    Pchuvus friends.' So he said to his wife: 'You may live with    this youth for ten years if you will promise to give me either    the boys or the girls which you may bear to him.' She agreed to    this. Then the Pchuvus began to sing:--      "'Kuku, kukáya        Kames to adala?        Kuku, kukaya.'   "That is in English:--      "'Kuku, kukaya        Do you want this (one) here?        Kuku, kukaya.'   "Then the young man awoke, and as the goblin offered him much gold    and silver with his wife, he took her and lived with her ten years,    and every year she bore him a son. Then came the Pchuvush to get    the children. But the wife said she had chosen to keep all the    sons, and was very sorry but she had no girls to give him! So he    went away sorrowfully, howling:--      "'Kuku, kukáya!        Ada kin jirklá!        Kuku, kukaya!'   "That is to say:--      "'Kuku, kukaya!        These are dogs here!        Kuku, kukaya!'   "Then the ten boys laughed and said to their father: 'We will    call ourselves Kukaya.' And so from them came the race."Dr. Wlislocki points out that there are races which declare themselvesto be descended from dogs, or, like the Romans, from wolves. It isa curious coincidence that the Eskimo are among the former.In all parts of Eastern Europe, as in the West, many people are notonly careful to burn the parings of their nails [13] and the combingsof hair, for fear lest witches and imps should work sorcery with themto the injury of those from whom they came, but they also destroy theshells of eggs when they have eaten their contents. So A. Wuttke tellsus in his book, "Der Deutsche Volks Aberglaube der Gegenwart," 1869:"When one has eaten eggs the shells must be broken up or burned,or else the hens will lay no more, or evil witches will come overthem." And in England, Spain, the Netherlands, or Portugal, there aremany who believe or say that if the witches can get such shells fromwhich people have eaten, unbroken, they can, by muttering spells,cause them to grow so large that they can use them as boats. DomLeitas Ganet ("Dona Branca ou a Conquista do Algarve," Paris, 1826),however, assures us that is a very risky thing for the witches, becauseif they do not return home before midnight the shell-boat perishes,"whence it hath come to pass that many of these sorceresses have beenmiserably drowned."However, an egg hung up in a house is a lucky amulet, hence theostrich eggs and cocoanuts resembling them which are so common in theEast. And it is to be observed that every gypsy in England declaresthat a pivilioi, or cocoanut, as a gift brings bak or luck, I myselfhaving had many given to me with this assurance. This is evidentlyand directly derived from India, in which country there are a massof religious traditions referring to it.   "Once there was a gypsy girl who noticed that when anybody ate    eggs they broke up the shells, and asking why this was done    received for answer:--  "'You must break the shell to bits for fear    Lest the witches should make it a boat, my dear.    For over the sea away from home,    Far by night the witches roam.'"Then the girl said: 'I don't see why the poor witches should nothave boats as well as other people.' And saying this she threw theshell of an egg which she had been eating as far as she could, andcried, 'Chovihani, lav tro bero!' ('Witch--there is your boat!') Butwhat was her amazement to see the shell caught up by the wind andwhirled away on high till it became invisible, while a voice cried,'Paraka!' ('I thank you!')"Now it came to pass some time after that the gypsy girl was on anisland, where she remained some days. And when she wished to return,behold a great flood was rising, and it had washed her boat away, shecould see nothing of it. But the water kept getting higher and higher,and soon there was only a little bit of the island above the flood,and the girl thought she must drown. Just then she saw a white boatcoming; there sat in it a woman with witch eyes; she was rowing witha broom, and a black cat sat on her shoulder. 'Jump in!' she criedto the girl, and then rowed her to the firm land."When she was on the shore the woman said: 'Turn round three timesto the right and look every time at the boat.' She did so, and everytime she looked she saw the boat grow smaller till it was like anegg. Then the woman sang:--  "'That is the shell you threw to me,    Even a witch can grateful be.'"Saying this she vanished, cat, broom, shell, and all.   "Now my story is fairly done,    I beg you to tell a better one."As regards these boats which grow large or small at will we find themin the Norse ship Skidbladnir, which certain dwarfs made and gave toFrey. It is so large that all the gods and their army can embark init. But when not in use it may be so contracted that one may hava ipungi sino--put it in his purse or pocket. The Algonkin god Glooskaphas not only the counterpart of Skidbladnir, but the hammer of Thorand his belt of strength. He has also the two attendant birds whichbring him news, and the two wolves which mean Day and Night.Another legend given by Dr. Krauss, relative to witches and egg-shellsis as follows:--   "By the Klek lived a rich tavern-keeper and his wife. He was thin    and lean--hager und mager--while she was as fat as a well-fed pig.   "One day there came a gypsy woman by. She began to tell his    fortune by his hand. And as she studied it seriously she became    herself serious, and then said to him, 'Listen, you good-natured    dolt (moré)! Do you know why you are so slim and your wife so    stout?' 'Not I.' 'My good friend (Latcho pral), your wife is    a witch. Every Friday when there is a new moon (mladi petak)    she rides you up along the Klek to the devil's dance' (Uraze    kolo). 'How can that be?' 'Simply enough. As soon as you fall    asleep, she slips a magic halter over your head. Then you become a    horse, and she rides you over the hills and far away over mountains    and woods, cities and seas, to the witches' gathering.      "'Little you know where you have been,        Little you think of what you have seen,  "'For when you awake it is all forgotten, but the ride is hard    for you, and you are wasting away, and dying. Take great care of    yourself on the next Friday when there is a new moon!'   "So the gypsy went her way, and he thought it over. On the    next Friday when the moon was new he went to bed early, but    only pretended to sleep. Then his wife came silently as a cat    to the bed-side with the magic halter in her hand. As quick as    lightning he jumped up, snatched it from her, and threw it over    her head. Then she became, in a second, a mare. He mounted her,    and away she flew through the air--over hills and dales like the    wind, till they came to the witches' meeting.   "He dismounted, bound the mare to a tree, and, unseen by the    company, watched them at a little distance. All the witches carried    pots or jars. First they danced in a ring, then every one put    her pot on the ground and danced alone round it. And these pots    were egg-shells.   "While he watched, there came flying to him a witch in whom    he recognized his old godmother. 'How did you come here?' she    inquired. 'Well, I came here on my mare, I know not how.' 'Woe    to you--begone as soon as possible. If the witches once see you    it will be all up with you. Know that we are all waiting for one'    (this one was his wife), 'and till she comes we cannot begin.' Then    the landlord mounted his mare, cried 'Home!' and when he was    there tied her up in the stable and went to bed.   "In the morning his servant-man said to him: 'There is a mare in    the stable.' 'Yes,' replied the master; 'it is mine.' So he sent    for a smith, and made him shoe the mare. Now, whatever is done    to a witch while she is in the form of an animal remains on or    in her when she resumes her natural shape.   "Then he went out and assembled a judicial or legal commission. He    led the members to his house, told them all his story, led forth    the mare, and took off the halter. She became a woman as before,    but horse-shoes were affixed to her feet and hands. She began to    weep and wail, but the judge was pitiless. He had her thrown into    a pit full of quicklime, and thus she was burnt to death. And    since that time people break the shells of eggs after eating    their contents, lest witches should make jars or pots of them."The following story on the same subject is from a different source:--   "There was once a gypsy girl who was very clever, and whenever    she heard people talk about witches she remembered it well. One    day she took an egg-shell and made a small round hole in it very    neatly, and ate the yolk and white, but the shell she put on a    heap of white sand by a stream, where it was very likely to be    seen. Then she hid herself behind a bush. By and by, when it was    night, there came a witch, who, seeing the shell, pronounced a    word over it, when it changed to a beautiful boat, into which    the witch got and sailed on the water, over the sea.   "The girl remembered the word, and soon ate another egg and turned    it into a boat. Whenever she willed it went over the world to    places where fruit and flowers abounded, or where people gave her    much gold for such things as knives and scissors. So she grew rich    and had a fine house. The boat she hid away carefully in a bush.   "There was a very envious, wicked woman, whom the girl had    befriended many a time, and who hated her all the more for it. And    this creature set to work, spying and sneaking, to find out the    secret of the girl's prosperity. And at last she discovered the    boat, and, suspecting something, hid herself in the bush hard by    to watch.   "By and by the girl came with a basket full of wares for her    trade, and, drawing out the boat, said, 'To Africa!'--when off    it flew. The woman watched and waited. After a few hours the girl    returned. Her boat was full of fine things, ostrich feathers and    gold, fruit and strange flowers, all of which she carried into    her house.   "Then the woman put the boat on the water, and said, 'To    Africa!' But she did not know the word by means of which it was    changed from an egg-shell, and which made it fly like thought. So    as it went along the woman cried, 'Faster!' but it never heeded    her. Then she cried again in a great rage, and at last exclaimed,   'In God's name get on with you!' Then the spell was broken, and    the boat turned into an egg-shell, and the woman was drowned in    the great rolling sea."Egg-lore is inexhaustible. The eggs of Maundy Thursday (WittenDonnertag), says a writer in The Queen, protect a house against thunderand lightning, but, in fact, an egg hung up is a general protection,hence the ostrich eggs and cocoanuts of the East. Some other veryinteresting items in the communication referred to are as follows:--   "Witches and Eggs.--'To hang an egg laid on Ascension Day in the    roof of a house,' says Reginald Scot in 1584, 'preserveth the    same from all hurts.' Probably this was written with an eye to the   'hurts' arising from witchcraft, in connection with which eggs were    supposed to possess certain mysterious powers. In North Germany,    if you have a desire to see the ladies of the broomstick on May    Day, their festival, you must take an egg laid on Maundy Thursday,    and stand where four roads meet; or else you must go into church    on Good Friday, but come out before the blessing. It was formerly    quite an article of domestic belief that the shells must be broken    after eating eggs, lest the witches should sail out to sea in them;    or, as Sir Thomas Browne declared, lest they 'should draw or prick    their names therein, and veneficiously mischief' the person who    had partaken of the egg. North Germans, ignoring this side of the    question, say, 'Break the shells or you will get the ague;' and    Netherlanders advise you to secure yourself against the attacks    of this disagreeable visitor by eating on Easter Day a couple of    eggs which were laid on Good Friday.   "Scottish Superstitions.--Scotch fishers, who may be reckoned    among the most superstitious of folks, believe that contrary    winds and much consequent vexation of spirit will be the result of    having eggs on board with them; while in the west of England it    is considered very unlucky to bring birds' eggs into the house,    although they may be hung up with impunity outside. Mr. Gregor,    in his 'Folklore of the North-East of Scotland,' gives us some    curious particulars concerning chickens, and the best methods of    securing a satisfactory brood. The hen, it seems, should be set on    an odd number of eggs, or the chances are that most, if not all,    will be addled--a mournful prospect for the henwife; also they    must be placed under the mother bird after sunset, or the chickens    will be blind. If the woman who performs this office carries the    eggs wrapped up in her chemise, the result will be hen birds; if    she wears a man's hat, cocks. Furthermore, it is as well for her    to repeat a sort of charm, 'A' in thegeethir, A' oot thegeethir.'   "Unlucky Eggs.--There are many farmers' wives, even in the present    day, who would never dream of allowing eggs to be brought into    the house or taken out after dark--this being deemed extremely    unlucky. Cuthbert Bede mentions the case of a farmer's wife in    Rutland who received a setting of ducks' eggs from a neighbour at    nine o'clock at night. 'I cannot imagine how she could have been so    foolish,' said the good woman, much distressed, and her visitor,    upon inquiry, was told that ducks' eggs brought into a house    after sunset would never be hatched. A Lincolnshire superstition    declares that if eggs are carried over running water they will be    useless for setting purposes; while in Aberdeen there is an idea    prevalent among the country folks that should it thunder a short    time before chickens are hatched, they will die in the shell. The    same wiseacres may be credited with the notion that the year the    farmer's gudewife presents him with an addition to his family    is a bad season for the poultry yard. 'Bairns an' chuckens,'    say they, 'dinna thrive in ae year.' The probable explanation    being that the gudewife, taken up with the care of her bairn,    has less time to attend to the rearing of the 'chuckens.'   "Fortune-telling in Northumberland.--Besides the divination    practised with the white of an egg, which certainly appears    of a vague and unsatisfactory character, another species of    fortune-telling with eggs is in vogue in Northumberland on the eve    of St. Agnes. A maiden desirous of knowing what her future lord    is like, is enjoined to boil an egg, after having spent the whole    day fasting and in silence, then to extract the yolk, fill the    cavity with salt, and eat the whole, including the shell. This    highly unpalatable supper finished, the heroic maid must walk    backwards, uttering this invocation to the saint:--      "'Sweet St. Agnes, work thy fast,        If ever I be to marry man,        Or man be to marry me,        I hope him this night to see.'"Friedrich and others assert that the saying in Luke xi. 12--"Or if heshall ask an egg shall he give him a scorpion?"--is a direct referenceto ancient belief that the egg typified the good principle, and thescorpion evil, and which is certainly supported by a cloud of witnessesin the form of classic folk-lore. The egg, as a cosmogenic symbol, andindicating the origin of all things, finds a place in the mythologiesof many races. These are indicated with much erudition by Friedrich,"Symbolik der Natur," p. 686.In Lower Alsatia it is believed that if a man will take an Easter egginto the church and look about him, if there be any witches in thecongregation he may know them by their having in their hands piecesof pork instead of prayer-books, and milk-pails on their heads forbonnets (Wolf, "Deutsche Mährchen und Sagen," p. 270). There is alsoan ancient belief that an egg built into a new building will protectit against evil and witchcraft. Such eggs were found in old houses inAltenhagen and Iserlohen, while in the East there is a proverb, "theegg of the chamber" ("Hamasa" of Abu Temman, v. Rückert, Stuttgart,1846), which seems to point to the same practice.The Romans expressed a disaster by saying, "Ovum ruptum est" ("Theegg is smashed"). Among other egg-proverbs I find the following:--    His eggs are all omelettes (French); i.e., broken up.    Eggs in the pan give pancakes but nevermore chicks (Low German).    Never a chicken comes from broken eggs (Low German).    Bad eggs, bad chickens. Hence in America "a bad egg" for a man    who is radically bad, and "a good egg" for the contrary.    Eggs not yet laid are uncertain chickens; i.e., "Do not count    your chickens before they are hatched."    Tread carefully among eggs (German).    The egg pretends to be cleverer than the hen.    He waits for the eggs and lets the hen go.    He who wants eggs must endure the clucking of the hen    (Westphalian).    He thinks his eggs are of more account than other people's hens.    One rotten egg spoils all the pudding.    Rotten eggs and bad butter always stand by one another; or "go    well together."        Old eggs, old lovers, and an old horse,        Are either rotten or for the worse.    (Original:        Alte Eyer        Alte Freier--        Alter Gaul        Sind meistens faul.)   "All eggs are of the same size" (Eggs are all alike), he said,    and grabbed the biggest.    As like as eggs (Old Roman).    As sure as eggs.    His eggs all have two yolks.    If you have many eggs you can have many cakes.    He who has many eggs scatters many shells.    To throw an egg at a sparrow.    To borrow trouble for eggs not yet hatched.    Half an egg is worth more than all the shell.    A drink after an egg, and a leap after an apple.    A rotten egg in his face.In the early mythology, the egg, as a bird was hatched from it, and asit resembled seeds, nuts, &c., from which new plants come, was regardedas the great type of production. This survives in love-charms, as whena girl in the Tyrol believes she can secure a man's love by givinghim a red Easter egg. This giving red eggs at Easter is possiblyderived from the ancient Parsees, who did the same at their springfestival. Among the Christians the reproductive and sexual symbolism,when retained, was applied to the resurrection of the body and theimmortality of the soul. Hence Easter eggs. And as Christ by Hiscrucifixion caused this, or originated the faith, we have the ovade crucibus, the origin of which has puzzled so many antiquaries;for the cross itself was, like the egg, a symbol of life, in earliertimes of reproduction, and in a later age of life eternal. These eggsare made of a large size of white glass by the Armenian Christians.CHAPTER V.CHARMS OR CONJURATIONS TO CURE OR PROTECT ANIMALS.From the earliest ages a drum or tambourine has formed such anindispensable adjunct of Shamanic sorcery among Tartars, Lapps,Samoyedes, Eskimo, and Red Indians, that, taking it with otherassociations, I can hardly believe that it has not been transmittedfrom one to the other. In Hungary the gypsies when they wish toknow if an invalid will recover, have recourse to the cováçanescrobuçlo (chovihanescro buklo) or "witch-drum." This is a kind ofrude tambourine covered with the skin of an animal, and marked withstripes which have a special meaning. On this are placed from nineto twenty-one seeds of the thorn-apple (stramonium). The side of thedrum is then gently struck with a little hammer, and according to theposition which the seeds take on the marks, the recovery or death ofthe patient is predicted. The following is a picture of a gypsy drumas given by Dr. Wlislocki.The wood for this is cut on Whitsunday. A is turned towards thefortune-teller; nine seeds are now thrown on the drum, and withthe left hand, or with a hammer held in it, the tambourine istapped. Should all the seeds come within the four lines all willgo well, especially if three come within a, d, e, f. If two rollinto the space between a, i, it is lucky for a woman, between i andf for a man. But if nearly all fall outside of b, c, g, h, all isunfavourable. The same divination is used to know whether animalswill get well, and where stolen property is concealed. All of thiscorresponds exactly to the use of the same instrument by the Laplandersfor the same purposes. The thorn-apple is a very poisonous plant, andthe gypsies are said to have first brought it to England. This is nottrue, but it is extremely possible that they used it in stupefying,killing, and "bewitching." It is very much employed at present bythe Voodoo poisoners in America.The Turks are a Tartar race, and the drum is used among them verygenerally for magical purposes. I have one of these tambouri which,I was assured when I bought it, was made for incantations. It is of adiamond shape, has parchment on both sides, and is inscribed with thename Allah, in Arabic, and the well-known double triangle of Solomon,with the moon and star.To keep domestic animals from straying or being stolen, or falling ill,they are, when a gypsy first becomes their owner, driven up before afire by his tent. Then they are struck with a switch, which is halfblacked with coal, across the back, while the following is repeated:--   "Ac tu, ac kathe!    Tu hin mange!    Te Nivasa the jiánen--    Ná dikh tu ádálen!    Trin lánca hin mánge,    Me pçándáv tute:    Yeká o devlá, ávri    O Kristus, trite Maria!"   "Stay thou, stay here!    Thou art mine!    And the Nivasi when they go--    Thou shalt not see them!    Three chains I have,    I bind thee:    One is God, the other (beyond)    The Christ, the third, Maria!"To charm a horse, they draw, with a coal, a ring on the left hoofand on the right a cross, and murmur:--   "Obles, obles te obles!    Ac tu, ac tù máy sástes    Ná th' ávehás beng tute    Devlá, devlá ac tute!    Gule devlá bishálá    E gráyeskro perá    Miseçescro dád!    Niko mánushenge ác    Káske me dáv, leske ac    Shukáres tu ác,    Voyesá te láccs ac,    Ashunen eftá Pçuvuse:    Eftá láncá hin mánge,    Ferinen ádálá    Táysá, táysá e pedá!"   "Round, round, and round!    Be thou, be thou very sound    The devil shall not come to thee,    God, God shall be with thee!    Sweet God drive away    From the horse's body    The Father of Evil!    Be to (go not to) any other man    To whom I give (sell) unto him    Be beautiful!    Frolicsome and good,    Seven spirits of earth hear!    I have seven chains,    Protect this animal    Ever, ever!"Then a piece of salted bread is given to the horse, and the ownerspits seven times into his eyes, by which he is supposed to loseall fear for supernatural beings. According to the gypsies, horses,especially black ones, can see beings which are invisible to humaneyes. I have known an old English gypsy who believed that dogs couldsee ghosts when men could not. The mysterious manner in which dogsand horses betray fear when there is apparently nothing to dread,the howling of the former by night, and the wild rushes of the latter,doubtless led to this opinion. The bread and salt will recall to thereader the fact that the same was given at the ancient mysteriesapparently for the purpose of strengthening the neophyte so thathe should not fear the supernatural beings whom he was supposedto meet. It is curious to find this peculiar form of the sacramentadministered to a horse. Another protective charm is common among theSouthern Hungarian gypsies. The dung of a she-goat dried and powderedis sifted on a horse's back and this spell recited:--   "Miseçes prejiá,    Andrál t're perá!    Trádá cik buscákri    Miseçes perákri,--    Andral punrá, andral dumno,    Andral yákhá, andral kánná!    Nevkerádyi av ákána,    Ac tu, ac tu cá mánge:    Ác tu, ác tu, ác káthe!"   "Evil be gone    From thy belly!    Drive away she-goat's dung    Evil from the belly,    From the feet, from the back,    From the eyes, from the ears!    New-born be now,    Be thou, be thou only mine:    Stay thou, stay thou, stay here!"There is evidently a relation here between the dung of the she-goatand certain ancient symbols. Whatever was a sign of fruitfulness,generation, or productiveness, whether it was set forth by thegenerative organs, sexual passion, or even manure which fertilises,was connected with Life which is the good or vital principle opposed todeath. As the goat was eminently a type of lechery, so the she-goat,owing to the great proportion of milk which she yielded, set forthabundance; hence the cornucopia of Amalthea, the prototype of theshe-goat Heidrun of the Northern mythology, who yielded every dayso much milk that all the Einheriar, or dwellers in Valhall, couldsatisfy themselves therewith. [14] But the forms or deities indicatinglife were also those which shielded and protected from evil, thereforeHere, the mother of life and of birth, had in Sparta a shrine whereshe-goats were sacrificed to her, while at Canuvium the statue of JunoSospita (who was also Here), was covered with a she-goat's skin. Itis in the ancient sense of fertility identified with protection,that the she-goat's dung is used to exorcise evil from the horse bythe gypsies. There is, in fact, in all of these charms and exorcismsa great deal which evidently connects them with the earliest ritesand religions.In the Hungarian gypsy-tribe of the Kukuya, the following method ofprotecting horses is used: The animal is placed by the tent-fire andthere a little hole is dug before him into which ninefold grass andsome hairs from his mane and tail are put. Then his left fore-hoofis traced on the ground, and the earth within it is carefully takenout and shaken into the hole, while these lines are repeated:--   "Yeká cunul yeká bál,    Tute e bokh náñi sál,    Ko tut corel, the merel    Sar e bálá, cunulá,    Pal e pçuv the yov ável!    Pçuvus, adalen tute,    Sástes gráy ác mánge!"   "A straw, a hair!    May you never be hungry!    May he who steals you die!    Like the hair and the straw,    May he go to the ground!    Earth, these things to thee!    May a sound horse be mine!"If the animal be a mare and it is desired that she shall be with foal,they give her oats to eat out of an apron or a gourd, and say:--   "Trin kánályá, trin jiuklá,    Jiánen upre pláyá!    Cábá, pçares hin perá!    Trin kánályá, trin jiuklá    Jiánen tele pláyá,    É çevá ándrasaváren    Yek cumut ándre çasáren,    Tre perá sik pçáreven!"   "Three asses, three dogs,    Go up the hill!    Eat, fill thy belly with young!    Three asses, three dogs,    Go down the hill,    They close the holes,    They put the moon in (them)    Thy belly be soon fruitful!""The moon has here," remarks Wlislocki, "a phallic meaning, themention of the ass, and the use of the gourd and apron are symbolsof fertility. Vide De Gubernatis, 'Animals in Indian Mythology,'in the chapter on the ass."There is another formula for protecting and aiding cattle, whichis practised among other races besides that of the gypsies; as, forinstance, among the Slovacks of Northern Hungary. This I shall leavein the original:--   "Dieses Verwahrungsmittel besteht darin, dass dem gekauften    weiblichen Thiere der Mann den blanken Hintern zeigt, einem    männlichen Thiere aber eine weibliche Person. Hiebei werden die    Worte gesagt:--       "Sár o kár pál e punrá,        Kiyá mánge ác táysá!        Wie der Schwantz am Bein,        Sollst du stets bei mir sein!"Or else:--   "Sár e minc pal e per,    Kiyá mánge ác buter!    Wie das Loch im Leib,    Also bei mir bleib!"To secure swine to their owner a hole is dug in the turf which isfilled with salt and charcoal dust, which is covered with earth,and these words uttered:--   "Adá hin tute    Ná ává pál menge    Dáv tute, so kámáv    Pçuvusheyá, áshuná,    Cores tuna muká    Hin menge trin láncá,    Trin máy láce Urmá,    Ke ferinen men!"   "This is thine,    Come not to us!    I give thee what I can    Oh Spirit of earth, hear!    Let not the thief go!    We have three chains,    Three very good fairies    Who protect us."If the swine find the hole and root it up--as they will be tolerablycertain to do owing to their fondness for salt and charcoal--theywill not be stolen or run away.The Urmen, or Fairies, are supposed to be very favourable tocattle, therefore children who torment cows are told "Urme tute nábica somnakune pçábáy"--"The fairies will not send you any goldenapples!" If the English gypsies had the word Urme (and it may be thatit exists among them even yet), this would be, "I Urme ná bitchertute sonnakai pábya!"But the mighty charm of charms to protect cattle from theft is thefollowing: Three drops of blood are made to fall from the finger of alittle child on a piece of bread which is given to the animal to eat,with these words:--   "Dav tute trinen rátá    Ternes te láces ávná!    Ko tut corel, ádáleske    Hin rát te más shutyárdye!    Káná rátá te rátá    Paltire per ávná,    Yákh te yákh te báre yákh    Sikoves çál te çál    Ko kámel tut te çál!"   "I give three (drops of) blood    To become young and good;    Who steals thee to him    Shall be (is) blood and flesh dried up!    When blood and blood    Pass into thy belly,    Fire and fire and great fire    Shall devour and devour all    Who will eat thee!"This incantation takes us back to grim old heathenism with hints ofhuman sacrifice. When the thief was suspected or privately detectedit is probable that a dose of some burning poison made good theprediction. "The word young" remarks Dr. Wlislocki, "may be hereunderstood to mean innocent, since, according to ancient belief, therewas a powerful magic virtue in the blood of virgins and of littlechildren. Every new tent is therefore sprinkled by the gypsies witha few drops of a child's blood to protect it from magic or any otheraccident." So in prehistoric times, and through the Middle Ages, ahuman being was often walled up alive in the foundations of a castleto insure its durability. (Vide P. Cassel, "Die Symbolik des Blutes,"p. 157.)When the wandering, or tent-gypsies, find that cattle are ill and donot know the nature of the disease, they take two birds--if possiblequails, called by them bereçto or füryo--one of which is killed, butthe other, besprinkled with its blood, is allowed to fly away. Withwhat remains of the blood they sprinkle some fodder, which is putbefore the animal, with the words:--   "So ándre tu miseç hin            Avri ává!    Káthe ker ná ávlá,            Miseçeske!    Káná rátá ná ávná,    Násvályipen ná ávná!    Miseç, tu ávri ává,    Ada ker ná láce;    Dáv rátá me káthe!"   "What in thee is evil            Come forth!    Here is no home            For the evil one!    When (drops of) blood come not,    Sickness comes not,    Thou evil one, come forth!'   "Trin párne, trin kále,    Trin tçule páshlajen káthe,    Ko len hádjinel    Ac kivá mánge!"   "Three white, three black,    Three fat lie together here.    Whoever disturbs them    Remain to me! (Be mine!)"To insure pigs thriving by a new owner, some charcoal-dust is mingledwith their food and these words spoken:--   "Nivaseske ná muká,    The çál t're çábená!    Miseç yákhá tut díkhen,    The yon káthe mudáren,    Tu atunci çábá len!"   "Do not let the Nivasi    Eat thy food,    Evil eyes see thee,    And they here shall perish,    Then do thou eat them!"As a particularly powerful conjuration against thieves, the ownerruns thrice, while quite naked, round the animal or object which hewishes to protect, and repeats at every turn:--   "Oh coreyá ná prejiá.    Dureder ná ává!    T're vástá, t're punrá    Avená kirñodyá    Te ádá pedá láves!"   "Oh, thief, do not go,    Further do not come!    Thy hands, thy feet    Shall decay    If thou takest this animal!"Another "thieves' benediction" is as follows: The owner goes atmidnight with the animal or object to be protected to a cross-roads,and while letting fall on the ground a few hairs of the beast, or abit of the thing whatever it be, repeats:--     "Ada hin tute,      Ná ává pál menge,      Dav tute, so kámáv;      Pçuvuseyá áshuná!"   "This home is not good,    Here I give (thee) blood!""The gypsies call the quail the devil's bird (Ciriclo bengeskro),and ascribe diabolic properties to it. (Vide Cassel, 6 and 162.) Thedaughters of the Nivasi appear as quails in the fields by day, butduring the night they steal the corn. To keep them away it is heldgood during sowing-time to place in each of the four corners of thefield, parts of a quail, or at least some of the feathers of a blackhen which has never laid an egg. This superstition is also currentamong the Roumanian peasants of the Siebenbürgen."The primitive meaning of the myth may perhaps be found in the Greektradition which regarded the quail, because it was a bird of passage,as a type of revival of spring or of life. Hercules awakes fromhis swoon when his companion Iolaus (from the Greek ioulos, youth),holds a quail to his nose. Hercules suffered from epilepsy, for whichdisease the ancients thought the brain of a quail was a specific. Theplacing pieces of a quail, by the gypsies, in the corners of a fieldwhen corn is sown, connects the bird with spring. Artemis, a goddessof spring and life, was called by the Romans Ortygyia, from ortyx,a quail. Therefore, as signifying new life, the quail became itselfa cure for many diseases. And it seems to be like the Wren, also abird of witchcraft and sorcery, or a kind of witch itself. It is aprotector, because, owing to its pugnacity, it was a type of pluck,battle and victory. In Phoenicia it was sacrificed to Hercules, andthe Romans were so fanatical in regard to it that Augustus punisheda city-father for serving upon his table a quail which had becomecelebrated for its prowess. And so it has become a devil's bird amongthe gypsies because in the old time it was regarded as a devil of abird for fighting.The gypsies are hardly to be regarded as Christians, but when theywish to contend against the powers of darkness they occasionallyinvoke Christian influences. If a cow gives bloody milk it is thoughtto be caused by her eating Wachtelkraut, or quail weed, which is apoison. In such a case they sprinkle the milk on a field frequentedby quails and repeat:--   "Dav rátá tumenge    Adá ná hin láce!    Ráyeskro Kristeskro rátá    Adá hin máy láce    Adá hin ámenge!"   "I give to you blood,    Which is not good!    The Lord Christ's blood    Is truly good,    That is ours!"If a cow makes water while being milked, she is bewitched, andit is well in such a case to catch some of the urine, mix it withonion-peelings and the egg of a black hen. This is boiled and mixedwith the cow's food while these lines are repeated:--   "Ko ándré hin, avriává,    Trin Urma cingárden les,    Trin Urma tráden les    Andre yándengré ker    Beshel yov ándre ker    Hin leske máy yakhá,    Hin leske máy páña!"   "Who is within, let him come out!    Three Urme call him,    Three Urme drive him    Into the egg-shell house,    There he lives in the house;    He has much fire,    He has much water!"Then half the shell of the egg of the black hen is thrown into arunning stream and the other half into a fire.Next to the Nivasi and Pçuvuse, or spirits of earth and air, and humansorcerers or witches, the being who is most dreaded as injuring cattleis the Chagrin or Cagrino. These demons have the form of a hedgehog,are of yellowish colour, and are half a yard in length, and a spanin breadth. "I am certain," says Wlislocki, "that this creatureis none other than the equally demoniac being called Harginn, stillbelieved in by the inhabitants of North-western India. (Vide Liebrecht,p. 112, and Leitner, 'Results of a Tour in Dardistan Kashmir,' &c.,vol. i. p. 13.) The exact identity of the description of the two, aswell as that of the name, prove that the gypsies brought the belieffrom their Indian home." It may here be observed that the Indian nameis Harginn, and the true gypsy word is pronounced very nearly like'Hágrin--the o being an arbitrary addition. The transposition ofletters in a word is extremely common among the Hindu gypsies. TheChagrin specially torments horses, by sitting on their backs andmaking water on their bodies. The next day they appear to be weary,sad, sick, and weak, bathed in sweat, with their manes tangled. Whenthis is seen the following ceremony is resorted to: The horse istied to a stake which has been rubbed with garlic juice, then a redthread is laid in the form of a cross on the ground, but so far fromthe heels of the horse that he cannot disturb it. And while layingit down the performer sings:--   "Sáve miseç ac káthe,    Ác ándre lunge táve,    Andre leg páshader páñi.    De tu tire páñi    Andre çuca Cháriñeyá,    Andre tu sik mudárá!"   "All evil stay here,    Stay in the long thread,    In the next brook (water).    Give thy water,    Jump in Chagrin!    Therein perish quickly!"Of the widely-spread and ancient belief in the magic virtues of garlicand red wool I have elsewhere spoken. That witches and goblins orimps ride horses by night and then restore them in the morning totheir stalls in a wretched condition--trembling, enfeebled, and withtangled manes--is believed all the world over, and it would probablybe found that the Chagrin also gallops them.Another charm against this being consists of taking some of the hairof the animal, a little salt, and the blood of a bat, which is allmixed with meal and cooked to a bread. With this the foot of the horseis smeared, and then the empty pipkin is put into the trunk of a hightree while these words are uttered:--   "Ac tu cin kathe,    Cin ádá tçutes ávlá!"   "Stay so long here,    Till it shall be full!"The blood of the bat may be derived from an Oriental belief thatthe bat being the most perfect of birds, because it has breastsand suckles its young, it is specially adapted to magical uses. Inthe Tyrol he who bears the left eye of a bat may become invisible,and in Hesse he who wears the heart of a bat bound to his arm withred thread will always win at cards. The manes of the horses whichhave been tangled and twisted by the Chagrin must not be cut off ordisentangled unless these words are spoken:--   "Cin tu jid', cin ádá bálá jiden."   "So long live thou, long as these hairs shall live."It is an European belief that knots of hair made by witches must notbe disentangled. The belief that such knots are made intentionallyby some intelligence is very natural. I have often been surprised tofind how frequently knots form themselves in the cord of my eye-glass,even when pains are taken at night to lay it down so as to be free ofthem. Apropos of which I may mention that this teasing personalityof the eye-glass and cord seems to have been noted by others. I wasonce travelling on the Nile in company with a Persian prince, whobecame convinced that his eye-glass was very unlucky, and thereforethrew it into the river.The Chagrin specially torments mares which have recently foaled;therefore it is held needful, soon after the birth, to put into thewater which the mother drinks glowing hot coals, which are thrice takenfrom the fire. With these are included pieces of iron, such as nails,knives, &c., and the following words are solemnly murmured:--   "Piyá tu te ña ac sovnibnastár!"   "Drink, and do not be sleepy!"Many readers may here observe that charcoal and iron form a real tonic,or very practical strengthening dose for the enfeebled mare. But here,as in many cases medicine makes a cure and the devil or the doctorgets the credit. The Chagrin is supposed to attack horses only whilethey are asleep. Its urine often causes swellings or sores. Theseare covered by day with a patch of red cloth, which is stuck at nightinto a hole in a tree, which is closed with a cork, while these wordsare pronounced:--   "Ac tu káthe    Cin áulá táv pedá    Cin pedá yek ruk    Cin ruk yek mánush    Ko mudarel tut."   "Remain thou here    Till the rag become an animal,    Till the animal, a tree,    Till the tree, a man,    Who will destroy thee!"Dr. Wlislocki suggests that "the idea of the tree's becoming a man,is derived from the old gypsy belief that the first human beingswere made from the leaves of trees," and refers to what he haselsewhere written on a tradition of the creation of the world, asheld by Transylvanian gypsies. The following is a children's song,in which the belief may be traced:--   "Amaro dád jál ándro bes    Cingerel odoy caves,    Del dáyákri andre pádá    Yek cavoro ádá ávla."   "Our father went into a wood,    There he cut a boy,    Laid it in mother's bed,    So a boy comes."The Greeks believed that man was made from an ash-tree, and theNorsemen probably derived it from the same source with them. In1862 I published in The Continental Magazine (New York) a paper onthe lore connected with the ash, in which effort was made to showthat in early times in India the Banyan was specially worshipped,and that the descendants of men familiar with this cult had, aftermigrating to the Far West, transferred the worship and traditionsof the banyan to the ash. It has been observed that the ash-treesometimes--like the banyan--sends its shoots down to the ground,where they take root. The Algonkin Indians seem to have taken thisbelief of man's origin from the ash from the Norsemen, as a verylarge proportion of their myths correspond closely to those of theEdda. But, in brief, if the Greeks and Norsemen were of Aryan origin,and had ever had a language in common, they probably had common myths.The following is the remedy for the so-called Würmer, or worms, i.e.,external sores. Before sunrise wolf's milk (Wolfsmilch, rukeskro tçud)is collected, mixed with salt, garlic, and water, put into a pot,and boiled down to a brew. With a part of this the afflicted spot isrubbed, the rest is thrown into a brook, with the words:--   "Kirmora jánen ándre tçud    Andrál tçud, andré sir    Andrál sir, andré páñi,    Panensá kiyá dádeske,    Kiyá Niváseske    Pçándel tumen shelehá    Eñávárdesh teñá!"   "Worms go in the milk,    From the milk into the garlic,    From the garlic into the water,    With the water to (your) father,    To the Nivasi,    He shall bind you with a rope,    Ninety-nine (yards long)."A common cure of worms in swine among the Transylvanian tent-gypsiesis to stand ere the sun rises before a çadcerli, or nettle, and whilepouring on it the urine of the animal to be cured, repeat:--   "Láce, láce detehárá!    Hin mánge máy bute trásha    Kirmora hin [báleceske],    Te me penáv, penáv tute!    Káles hin yon, loles, párnes,    Deisislá hin yon mulánes!"   "Good, good morrow!    I have much sorrow.    Worms are in [my swine to-day]    And I say, to you I say,    Black are they or white or red    By to-morrow be they dead!"The nettle has its own peculiar associations. According to the gypsiesit grows chiefly in places where there is a subterranean passageto the dwellings of the Pçuvus, or Earth-fairies, therefore it isconsecrated to them and called Kásta Pçuvasengré, Pcuvus-wood. Hencethe gypsy children while gathering nettles for pigs sing:--   "Cádcerli ná pçábuvá!    André ker me ná jiáv,    Kiyá Pçuvus ná jiáv,    Tráden, tráden kirmorá!"   "Nettle, nettle do not burn,    In your house no one shall go,    No one to the Pcuvus goes,    Drive, drive away the worms!""The nettle," says Friedrich ("Symbolik der Natur," p. 324), "becauseit causes a burning pain is among the Hindoos a demoniac symbol, for,as they say, the great serpent poured out its poison on it. But as evilis an antidote for evil, the nettle held in the hand is a guard againstghosts, and it is good for beer when laid upon the barrel." "From itsemployment as an aphrodisiac, and its use in flagellation to restoresexual power, it is regarded as sacred to Nature by the followers of asecret sect or society still existing in several countries, especiallyPersia" (MS. account of certain Secret Societies). The gypsies believethat the Earth-fairies are the foes of every kind of worm and creepinginsect with the exception of the snail, which they therefore callthe "gráy Pçuvusengré," the Pçuvus-horse. Gry-puvusengree wouldin English gypsy mean the earthy-horse. English gypsies, and theEnglish peasantry, as well as gypsies, call snails "cattle, becausethey have horns." Snails are a type of voluptuousness, because theyare hermaphrodite, and exceedingly giving to sexual indulgence, sothat as many as half a dozen may be found mutually giving and takingpleasure. Hence in German Schnecke, a snail, is a term applied tothe pudendum muliebre. And as anything significant of fertility,generation, and sexual enjoyment was supposed to constitute a charmor amulet against witchcraft, i.e., all evil influences, which areallied to sterility, chastity, and barrenness, a snail's shell formsa powerful fetish for a true believer. The reference to white, black,or red in the foregoing charm, or rather the one before it, refers,says Dr. Wlislocki, to the gypsy belief that there are white, black,and red Earth-fairies. A girl can win (illicit) love from a man byinducing him to carry a snail shell which she has had for some timeabout her person. To present a snail shell is to make a very directbut not very delicate declaration of love to any one. I have heardof a lady who caused an intense excitement in a village by collectingabout a hundred large snails, gilding their shells, and then turningthem loose in several gardens, where their discovery excited, as maybe supposed, great excitement among the finders.If pigs lose their appetites a brew is made of milk, charcoal dust,and their own dung, which is put before them with the words: "FrissHexe und verreck!""In this place I must remark that the Transylvanian tent-gypsies usefor grumus merdoe also the expression Hirte (feris)" (Wlislocki). Tocure a cough in animals one should take from the hoofs of the firstriding horse, dirt or dust, and put it into the mouth of the sufferinganimal with the words:--   "Prejiál te náñi yov ável!"   "May he go away and never return!"To have a horse always in good spirits and lively during the waningmoon his spine is rubbed with garlic, while these words are uttered:--   "Miseç ándre tut,    O beng the çal but!    Laces ándre tut    Acel ándre tut!"   "(What is) evil in thee,    May the devil eat it much!    (What is) good in thee,    May it remain in thee!"But it is far more effective when the garlic is put on a rag of theclothes of one who has been hanged, and the place rubbed with it: inwhich we have a remnant of the earliest witchcraft, before Shamanism,which had recourse to the vilest and most vulgar methods of excitingawe and belief. This is in all probability the earliest form in whichmagic, or the power of controlling invisible or supernatural influencesmanifested itself, and it is very interesting to observe that it stillsurvives, and that the world still presents every phase of its faiths,ab initio.There is a very curious belief or principle attached to the use ofsongs in conjuring witches, or in averting their own sorcery. Itis that the witch is obliged, willy nilly, to listen to the endto what is in metre, an idea founded on the attraction of melody,which is much stronger among savages and children than with civilizedadults. Nearly allied to this is the belief that if the witch seesinterlaced or bewildering and confused patterns she must follow themout, and by means of this her thoughts are diverted or scattered. Hencethe serpentine inscriptions of the Norsemen and their intertwiningbands which were firmly believed to bring good luck or avert evilinfluence. A traveller in Persia states that the patterns of thecarpets of that country are made as bewildering as possible "to avertthe evil eye." And it is with this purpose that in Italian, as inall other witchcraft, so many spells and charms depend on interwovenbraided cords.   "Twist ye, twine ye, even so,    Mingle threads of joy and woe."The basis for this belief is the fascination, or instinct, whichmany persons, especially children, feel to trace out patterns, tothread the mazes of labyrinths or to analyze and disentangle knots and"cat's cradles." Did space permit, nor inclination fail, I could pointout some curious proofs that the old belief in the power of long andcurling hair to fascinate was derived not only from its beauty butalso because of the magic of its curves and entanglements.The gypsies believe that the Earth-spirits are specially interestedin animals. They also teach women the secrets of medicine andsorcery. There are indications of this in the negro magic. MissMary Owen, an accomplished Folk-lorist of St. Joseph, Missouri, whohas been deeply instructed in Voodooism, informs me that a woman tobecome a witch must go by night into a field and pull up a weed bythe roots. From the quantity of soil which clings to it, is inferredthe degree of magic power which the pupil will attain. I am notastonished to learn that when this lady was initiated, the amountof earth collected was unusually great. In such cases the Pchuvus(or Poovus in English gypsy), indicate their good-will by bestowing"earth," which, from meaning luck or good-fortune, has passed inpopular parlance to signifying money.CHAPTER VI.OF PREGNANCY AND CHARMS, OR FOLK-LORE CONNECTED WITH IT--BOARS'TEETH AND CHARMS FOR PREVENTING THE FLOW OF BLOOD.Like all Orientals the gypsy desires intensely to have afamily. Superstition comes in to increase the wish, for a barren womanin Eastern Europe is generally suspected of having had intercourse witha vampire or spirit before her marriage, and she who has done this,willingly or unconsciously, never has children. They have recourseto many magic medicines or means to promote conception; one of themost harmless in Hungary is to eat grass from the grave in which awoman with child has been buried. While doing this the woman repeats:--   "Dui riká hin mire minc,    Dui yará hin leskro kor,    Avnás dui yek jelo,    Keren ákána yek jeles."Or else the woman drinks the water in which the husband has cast hotcoals, or, better still, has spit, saying:--   "Káy me yákh som    Ac tu ángár,    Káy me brishind som,    Ac tu pani!"   "Where I am flame    Be thou the coals!    Where I am rain    Be thou the water!"Or at times the husband takes an egg, makes a small hole at each end,and then blows the yolk and white into the mouth of his wife whoswallows them.There are innumerable ways and means to ensure pregnancy, some of whichare very dangerous. Faith in the so-called "artificial propagation" isextensively spread. "Will der Zigeuner einen Sohn erzielen, so gürteter sich mit dem Halfterzaume eines männlichen Pferdes und umgekehrtmit dem einer Stute, will er eine Tochter erzeugen." ("Gebräuched. Trans. Zig." Dr. H. von Wlislocki. "Ill. Zeitschrift. Band,"51. No. 16.)If a gypsy woman in Transylvania wishes to know whether she be withchild, she must stand for nine evenings at a cross-road with anaxe or hammer, which she must wet with her own water, and then burythere. Should it be dug up on the ninth morning after, and found rusty,it is a sign that she is "in blessed circumstances."To bring on the menses a gypsy woman must, while roses are in bloom,wash herself all over with rose-water, and then pour the water overa rose-bush. Or she takes an egg, pours its contents into a jug, andmakes water on it. If the egg swims the next morning on the surfaceshe is enceinte; if the yolk is separate from the white she will beara son, if they are mingled a daughter. In Tuscany women wishing forchildren go to a priest, get a blessed apple and pronounce over it anincantation to Santa Anna, which was probably addressed in Roman daysto Lucina, who was very probably, according to the Romagna dialect,lu S'anna--Santa Anna herself. I have several old Roman spells fromMarcellus, which still exist word for word in Italian, but fitted tomodern usage in this manner like old windows to new houses.Should a woman eat fish while pregnant the child will be slow inlearning to speak, but if she feed on snails it will be slow inlearning to walk. The proverbs, "Dumb as a fish," and "Slow as asnail," appear here.To protect a child against the evil eye it is hung with amulets,generally with shells (die eine Aehnlichkeit mit der weiblichenScham haben). And these must be observed on all occasions, andfor everything, ceremonies, of which there are literally hundreds,showing that gypsies, notwithstanding their supposed freedom fromconventionalisms, are, like all superstitious people, harassed andvexed to a degree which would seem incredible to educated Europeans,with observances and rites of the most ridiculous and vexatiousnature. The shells alluded to are, however, of great interest,as they indicate the transmission of the old belief that symbolstypical of generation, pleasure, and reproductiveness, are repugnantto witchcraft which is allied to barrenness, destruction, negation,and every kind of pain and sterility.Hence a necklace of shells, especially cowries or snail shells,or the brilliant and pretty conchiglie found in such abundance nearVenice, are regarded as protecting animals or children from the evileye, and facilitating love, luxury, and productiveness. I have readan article in which a learned writer rejects with indignation the"prurient idea" that the cowrie, which gave its name porcellana toporcelain, derived it from porcella, in sensu obsceno; porcella beinga Roman word not only for pig but for the female organ. But everydonkey-boy in Cairo could have told him that the cowrie is used instrings on asses as on children because the shell has the likenesswhich the writer to whom I refer rejects with indignation. The pig,as is well known, is a common amulet, the origin thereof being thatit is extremely prolific. It has within a few years been very muchrevived in silver as a charm for ladies, and may be found in mostshops where ornaments for watch-chains are sold. The boar's tooth,as I have before mentioned, has been since time immemorial a charm; Ihave found them attached to chatelaines and bunches of keys, especiallyin Austria, from one to four or five centuries past. They are foundin prehistoric graves. The tusk is properly a male emblem; a pig issometimes placed on the base. These are still very commonly made andsold. I saw one worn by the son of a travelling basket-maker, who spokeRomany, and I purchased several in Vienna (1888), also in Copenhagenin 1889. In Florence very large boars' tusks are set as brooches, andmay be found generally in the smaller jewellers' shops and on the PonteVecchio. They are regarded as protective against malocchio--a generalterm for evil influences--especially for women during pregnancy, andas securing plenty, i.e., prosperity and increase, be it of worldlygoods, honour, or prosperity. There is in the museum at Budapesta boar's tusk, mounted or set as an amulet, which is apparently ofCeltic origin, and which certainly belongs to the migration of races,or a very early period. And it is in this eastern portion of Europethat it is still most generally worn as a charm.In connection with pregnancy and childbirth there is the profluvium,excessive flow of blood, or menses or hemorrhages, for which thereexist many charms, not only among gypsies but all races. This includesthe stopping any bleeding--an art in which Scott's Lady of Delorainewas an expert, and which many practised within a century.   "Tom Potts was but a serving man,      And yet he was a doctor good,    He bound a handkerchief on the wound,      And with some kind of words he staunched the blood."What these same kind of words were among old Germans and Romans maybe learned from the following: Jacob Grimm had long been familiarwith a German magic spell of the eleventh century--ad stringendumsanguinem, or stopping bleeding--but, as he says, "noch nicht zudeuten vermochte," could not explain them. They were as follows:--   "Tumbo saz in berke,    Mit tumbemo kinde in arme,    Tumb hiez der berc    Tumb hiez daz kint,    Der heiligo Tumbo    Versegne dise wunta."   "Tumbo (i.e., dumm or stupid) sat in the hill    With a stupid child in arms,    Dumb (stupid) the hill was called    Dumb was called the child,    The holy Tumbo (or dumb).    Heal (bless) this wound!"Some years after he found the following among the magic formulas ofMarcellus Burdigalensis:--   "Carmen utile profluvio mulieri:--       "Stupidus in monte ibat,        Stupidus stupuit,        Adjuro te matrix        Ne hoc iracunda suscipias.   "Pari ratione scriptum ligabis."I.e.: "A song useful for a flow of blood in woman:--   "The stupid man went into the mountain,    The stupid man was amazed;    I adjure thee, oh womb,    Be not angry!""Which shall also be bound as a writing," i.e., according to aprevious direction that it shall be written on virgin parchment,and bound with a linen cord about the waist of him or of her--quæpatietur de qualibet parte corporis sanguinis fluxum--who suffersanywhere from flow of blood.It is possible that the Stupidus and his blessing of women has heresome remotely derived reference to the reverence amounting to worshipof idiots in the East, who are described as being surrounded in someparts of India by matrons seeking for their touch and benediction,and soliciting their embraces. This is effected very often in analmost public manner; that is to say, by a crowd of women closelysurrounding the couple, i.e., the idiot or lunatic and one of theirnumber are joined, so that passers-by cannot see what is going on. Thechildren born of these casual matches are not unusually themselvesof weak mind, but are considered all the more holy. This recalls theallusion in the charm:--   "Stupid sat in the hill    With a stupid child in arms."This obscure myth of the stupid god appears to be very ancient.   "This Tritas is called intelligent. How then does he appear    sometimes stupid? The language itself supplies the explanation. In    Sanskrit bâlas means both child and stolid, and the third    brother is supposed to be stolid because, at his first appearance    especially, he is a child. (Tritas is one of the three brothers    or gods, i.e., the trinity)." ("Zoological Mythology," by Angelo    de Gubernatis, 1872).I am indebted to the as yet unpublished collection of Gypsyana madeby Prof. Anton Herrmann for the following:--There is a superstition among our gypsies that if the shadow of a crosson a grave falls on a woman with child she will have a miscarriage, andthis seems to be peculiarly appropriate to girls who have "anticipatedthe privileges of matrimony." The following rhyme seems to describethe hesitation of a girl who has gone to a cross to produce the resultalluded to, but who is withheld by love for her unborn infant:--   "Cigno trussul pal handako    Hin ada usalinako;    The ziav me pro usalin,    Ajt' mange lasavo na kin.    Sar e praytin kad' chasarel,    Save sile barval marel,    Pal basavo te prasape,    Mre cajori mojd kamale."   "Cross upon a grave so small    Here I see thy shadow fall,    If it fall on me they say    All my shame will pass away.    As the autumn leaf is blown,    By the wind to die alone,    Yet in shame and misery,    My baby will be dear to me!"There is a belief allied to this of the power of the dead in gravesto work wonders, to the effect that if any one plucks a rose from agrave, he or she will soon die. In the following song a gypsy picksa rose from the grave of the one he loved, hoping that it will causehis death:--   "Cignoro hrobosa    Hin sukares rosa    Mange la pchagavas,    Doi me na kamavas.    Bes'las piranake,    Hrobas hin joy mange,    Pchgavas, choc zanav    Pal lele avava    Te me ne brinzinav.    The me pocivinav."   "On her little tomb there grows    By itself a lovely rose,    All alone the rose I break,    And I do it for her sake.    I sat by her I held so dear,    Now her grave and mine are near,    I break the rose because I know    That to her I soon must go,    Grief cannot my spirit stir,    Since I know I go to her!"M. Kounavine (contribution by Dr. A. Elysseeff, Gypsy-Lore Journal,July, 1890), gives the following as a Russian gypsy spell againstbarrenness:--   "Laki, thou destroyest and dost make everything on earth; thou    canst see nothing old, for death lives in thee, thou givest birth    to all upon the earth for thou thyself art life. By thy might    cause me ---- to bear good fruit, I who am deprived of the joy    of motherhood, and barren as a rock."According to Dr. Elysseeff, Laki is related to the Indian goddessLakshmi, although differing from her in character. Another incantationof the same nature is as follows:--   "Thou art the mother of every living creature and the distributor    of good: thou doest according to thy wisdom in destroying what is    useless or what has lived its destined time; by thy wisdom thou    makest the earth to regenerate all that is new.... Thou dost    not seek the death of any one, for thou art the benefactress    of mankind."CHAPTER VII.THE RECOVERY OF STOLEN PROPERTY--LOVE-CHARMS--SHOES AND LOVE-POTIONS,OR PHILTRES.When a man has lost anything, or been robbed, he often has in hisown mind, quite unconsciously, some suspicion or clue to it. A cleverfortune-teller or gypsy who has made a life-long study of such clues,can often elicit from the loser, hints which enable the magician tosurmise the truth. Many people place absolute confidence in theirservants, and perhaps suspect nobody. The detective or gypsy has nosuch faith in man, and suspects everybody. Where positive knowledgecannot be established there is, however, another resource. The thiefis often as superstitious as his victim. Hence he fears that somemysterious curse may be laid on him, which he cannot escape. Inthe Pacific Islands, as among negroes everywhere, a man will die iftaboo or voodoo attaches to the taking of objects which have beenconsecrated by a certain formula. Therefore such formulas are commonlyemployed. Among the Hungarian gypsies to recover a stolen animal,some of its dung is taken and thrown to the East and the West withthe words:--   "Kay tut o kam dikhel:    Odoy ává kiyá mánge!"   "Where the sun sees thee,    Hence return to me!"But when a horse has been stolen, they take what is left of hisharness, bury it in the earth and make a fire over it, saying:--   "Kó tut cordyás    Nasvales th' ávlás    Leske sor ná ávlás,    Tu ná ac kiyá leske    Avá sástes kiyá mánge!    Leskro sor káthe pashlyol    Sár e tçuv avriurál!"   "Who stole thee    Sick may he be    May his strength depart!    Do not thou remain by him,    Come (back) sound to me,    His strength lies here    As the smoke goes away!"To know in which direction the stolen thing lies, they carry a suckingbabe to a stream, hold it over the water and say:--   "Pen mánge, oh Nivaseya    Caveskro vástehá    Kay hin m'ro gráy,    Ujes hin cavo,    Ujes sár o kam    Ujes sár páni    Ujes sár cumut    Ujes sár legujes?    Pen mánge, oh Niváseyá,    Cáveskro vastehá    Kay hin m'ro gráy!"   "Tell me, oh Nivaseha,    By the child's hand!    Where is my horse?    Pure is the child    Pure as the sun,    Pure as water,    Pure as the moon,    Pure as the purest.    Tell me, oh Nivaseha,    By the child's hand!    Where is my horse?"In this we have an illustration of the widely spread belief that aninnocent child is a powerful agent in prophecy and sorcery. The oath"by the hand" is still in vogue among all gypsies. "Apo miro dadeskrovast!" ("By my father's hand!") is one of their greatest oaths inGermany, ("Die Zigeuner," von Richard Liebich), and I have met withan old gypsy in England who knew it.If a man who is seeking for stolen goods finds willow twigs growninto a knot, he ties it up and says:--   "Me avri pçándáv coreskro báçht!"   "I tie up the thief's luck!"There is also a belief among the gypsies that these knots are twinedby the fairies, and that whoever undoes them undoes his own luck,or that of the person on whom he is thinking. (Vide Rocholz,"Alemannisches Kinderlied und Kinderspiel aus der Schweiz,"p. 146). These willow-knots are much used in love-charms. To winthe love of a maid, a man cuts one of them, puts it into his mouth,and says:--   "T're báçt me çáv,    T're baçt me piyáv,    Dáv tute m're baçt,    Káná tu mánge sál."   "I eat thy luck,    I drink thy luck;    Give me that luck of thine,    Then thou shalt be mine."Then the lover, if he can, secretly hides this knot in the bed ofthe wished-for bride. It is worth noting that these lines are so muchlike English Gypsy as it was once spoken that there are still men whowould, in England, understand every word of it. Somewhat allied tothis is another charm. The lover takes a blade of grass in his mouth,and turning to the East and the West, says:--   "Kay o kám, avriável,    Kiya mánge lele beshel!    Kay o kám tel' ável,    Kiya lelákri me beshav."   "Where the sun goes up    Shall my love be by me!    Where the sun goes down    There by her I'll be."Then the blade of grass is cut up into pieces and mingled withsome food which the girl must eat, and if she swallow the least bitof the grass, she will be gewogen und treugesinnt--moved to love,and true-hearted. On which Dr. Wlislocki remarks on the old custom"also known to the Hindoos," by which any one wishing to deprecatethe wrath of another, or to express complete subjection, takes ablade of grass in his mouth. Of which Grimm writes: "This custommay have sprung from the idea that the one conquered gave himselfup like a domestic animal to the absolute power of another. And withthis appears to be connected the ancient custom of holding out grassas a sign of surrender. The conquered man took the blade of grass inhis mouth and then transferred it to his conqueror."If a gypsy girl be in love she finds the foot-print of her "object,"digs out the earth which is within its outline and buries this undera willow-tree, saying:--   "Upro pçuv hin but pçuvá;    Kás kámáv, mange th' ávlá!    Bárvol, bárvol, sálciye,    Brigá ná hin mánge!    Yov tover, me pori,    Yov kokosh, me cátrá,    Ádá, ádá me kamav!"   "Many earths on earth there be,    Whom I love my own shall be,    Grow, grow willow tree!    Sorrow none unto me!    He the axe, I the helve,    He the cock, I the hen,    This, this (be as) I will!"Another love-charm which belongs to ancient black witchcraft, and isknown far and wide, is the following: When dogs are coupling (Wenn Hundund Hündin bei der Paarung zusammenhängen) the lover suddenly coversthem with a cloth, if possible, one which is afterwards presented tothe girl whom he seeks, while he says:--   "Me jiuklo, yoy jiukli,    Yoy tover, me pori,    Me kokosh, yoy cátrá,    Ádá, ádá me kamáv!"   "I the dog, she the bitch,    I the helve, she the axe,    I the cock (and) she the hen,    That, that I desire."He or she who finds a red ribbon, tape, or even a piece of red stuffof any kind, especially if it be wool, will have luck in love. Itmust be picked up and carried as an amulet, and when raising it fromthe ground the finder must make a wish for the love of some person,or if he have no particular desire for any one, he may wish for luckin love, or a sweetheart. This is, I believe, pretty generally knownin some form all over the world. A yellow ribbon or flower, especiallyif it be floating on water, presages gold; a white object, silver,or peace or reconciliation with enemies.It is also lucky for love to find a key. In Tuscany there is a specialformula which must be spoken while picking it up. Very old keys arevaluable amulets. Those who carry them will learn secrets, penetratemysteries, and succeed in what they undertake.If you can get a shoe which a girl has worn you may make sad havocwith her heart if you carry it near your own. Also hang it up overyour bed and put into it the leaves of rue.During November, 1889, not a few newspaper commentators busiedthemselves with conjectures as to why a Scotch constable buried theboots of a murdered man. That it was done through some superstitiousbelief is conceded; but what the fashion of the superstition isseems unknown. It originated, beyond question, in the old Norsecustom of always burying the dead in their shoes or with them. Forthey believed that the deceased would have, when he arrived in theother world, to traverse broad and burning plains before he couldreach his destination, be it Valhalla or the dreary home of Hel;and to protect his feet from the fire his friends bound on them the"hell-shoon." Other cares were also taken: and in the saga of OlofTryggvasen we are told that one monarch was thoughtfully providedwith a cow; while the Vikings were buried in their ships, so thatthey could keep on pirating "for ever and ever."The superstition of the burial of the boots probably survives inEngland. It is about seventeen years since the writer heard from anold gypsy that when another gypsy was "pûvado," or "earthed," a verygood pair of boots was placed by him in the grave. The reason was notgiven; perhaps it was not known. These customs often survive afterthe cause is forgotten, simply from some feeling that good or badluck attends their observance or the neglect of it. Many years sincea writer in an article on shoes in The English Magazine stated that,"according to an Aryan tradition, the greater part of the way fromthe land of the living to that of death lay through morasses and vastmoors overgrown with furzes and thorns. That the dead might not passover them bare-foot, a pair of shoes was laid with them in the grave."The shoe was of old in many countries a symbol of life, liberty, orentire personal control. In Ruth we are told that "it was the customin Israel concerning changing, that a man plucked off his shoe anddelivered it to his neighbour." So the bride, who was originallyalways a slave, transferred herself by the symbol of the shoe. Whenthe Emperor Waldimir made proposals of marriage to the daughter ofRagnald, she replied scornfully that she would not take off her shoesto the son of a slave. Gregory of Tours, in speaking of wedding, says:"The bridegroom, having given a ring to the bride, presents her witha shoe."As regards the Scandinavian hel-shoe, or hell-shoon, Kelley, in his"Indo-European Folk-lore," tells us that a funeral is still calleda dead shoe in the Henneberg district; and the writer already citedadds that in a MS. of the Cotton Library, containing an account ofCleveland in Yorkshire, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, there is apassage which illustrates this curious custom. It was quoted by SirWalter Scott in the notes to "Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border,"and runs thus:--   "When any dieth certaine women sing a song to the dead bodie,    reciting the journey that the partye deceased must goe; and they    are of beliefe that once in their lives it is goode to give a    pair of new shoes to a poor man; forasmuch as before this life    they are to pass bare-foote through a great lande, full of thornes    and furzen--excepte by the meryte of the almes aforesaid they have    redeemed the forfeyte--for at the edge of the launde an oulde man    shall meet them with the same shoes that were given by the partie    when he was lyving, and after he hath shodde them dismisseth them    to go through thick and thin without scratch or scalle.This must be a very agreeable reflection to all gentlemen who havebestowed their old boots on waiters, or ladies who have in likefashion gifted their maids. It is true, the legend specifies newshoes; but surely a pair of thirty-shilling boots only half worn countfor as much as a new pair of half a sovereign chaussures. However,if one is to go "through thick and thin without scratch or scalle,"it may be just as well to be on the safe side, and give a good newextra stout pair to the gardener for Christmas. For truly thesesuperstitions are strange things, and no one knows what may be in them.There are one or two quaint shoe stories of the olden time whichmay be of value to the collector. It befell once in the beginningsof Bohemia, that, according to Schafarik ("Slawische Alterthümer,"vol. ii. p. 422), Lïbussa, queen of that land, found herself compelledby her council to wed. And the wise men, being consulted, declared thathe who was to marry the queen would be found by her favourite horse,who would lead the way till he found a man eating from an iron table,and kneel to him. So the horse went on, and unto a field where a mansat eating a peasant's dinner from a ploughshare. This was the farmerPrschemischl. So they covered him with the royal robes and led him tothe queen expectant. But ere going he took his shoes of willow-woodand placed them in his bosom and kept them to remind him ever afterof his low origin. It will, of course, at once strike the reader,as it has the learned, that this is a story which would naturallyoriginate in any country where there are iron ploughshares, horses,queens, and wooden shoes: and, as Schafarik shrewdly suggests, thatit was all "a put-up job;" since, of course, Prschemischl was alreadya lover of the queen, the horse was trained to find him and to kneelbefore him, and, finally, that the ploughshare and wooden shoes werethe prepared properties of the little drama. The only little flaw inthis evidence is the name Prschemischl, which, it must be admitted,is extremely difficult to get over.The Seven League Boots and the shoes of Peter Schlemihl, which takeone over the world at will, have a variation in a pair recordedin another tale. There was a beautiful and extremely proud damsel,who refused a young man with every conceivable aggravation of theoffence, informing him that when she ran after him, and not beforethat, he might hope to marry her; and at the same time meeting a poorold gypsy woman who begged her for a pair of old shoes. To which theproud Princess replied:--   "Shoes here, shoes there;    Give me a couple, I'll give thee a pair."To which the old gypsy, who was a witch, grimly muttered, "I'll givethee a pair which----" The rest of the expression was really toounamiable to repeat. Well, the youth and the witch met, and, going tothe lady's shoemaker, "made him make" a superbly elegant pair of shoes,which were sent to the damsel as a gift. Such a gift! No sooner werethey put on than off they started, carrying the Princess, malgré elle,over hill and dale. By and by she saw that a man--the man, of course,whom she had refused--was in advance of her. As in the song of theCork Leg, "the shoes never stopped, but kept on the pace." And theyoung man led her to a lonely castle and reasoned with her. And asshe had promised to marry should she ever run after him, and as shehad pursued him a whole day, she kept her word. The shoes she sentto the witch filled with gold; and they were wedded, and all went asmerry as a thousand grigs in a duck-pond.The shoe, as has been shown by a Danish writer in a book chieflydevoted to the subject, is a type of life, especially as shown inproductiveness and fertility. Hence old shoes and grain are thrownafter a bride, as people say, for luck; but the Jews do it crying,"Peru urphu"--"Increase and multiply." For this, and much more, thereader may consult that wonderful treasury of Folk-lore, "Die Symbolikund Mythologie der Natur," J. B. Friedrich, Würzburg, 1859. To whichwe would add our mite by remarking as a curious confirmation of thistheory, that--    There was an old woman who lived in a shoe,    Who had so many children she didn't know what to do.This passes now for a mere nursery-rhyme; but doubtless there arethose who will trace it back to the early morning of mythology,and prove that it was once a Himaritic hymn, sung to some Melittawho has long passed away down the back entry of time.For several additional Hungarian gypsy love-charms and spells,collected by Dr. Wlislocki, published in Ethnographia, and subsequentlyin The Gipsy-Lore Journal for June, 1890, I am greatly indebted tothe kindness of Mr. D. MacRitchie:--   "The gypsy girls of Transylvania believe that spells to 'know    your future husband' can be best carried out on the eves of    certain days, such as New Year, Easter, and Saint George. 'On    New Year's Eve they throw shoes or boots on a willow tree, but    are only allowed to throw them nine times.' Compare this with the    throwing of the old shoe after the bride in many countries. 'If    the shoe catches in the branches the girl who threw it will be    married within a year.'   "On the same eve they go to a tree and shake it by turns,    singing:--      "'Per de, per de prájtina,        Varekaj hin, hász kamav?        Basá, párro dzsiuklo,        Pirano dzsal mai szigo.'      "'Scattered leaves around I see,        Where can my true lover be?        Ah, the white dog barks at last!        And my love comes running fast!'   "If during the singing the bark of a dog should be heard, the    damsel will be 'wedded and bedded ere New Year comes again. This    is virtually the same with a charm practised in Tuscany, which from    other ancient witness I believe to be of Etruscan origin. Allied to    this is the following: On the night of Saint George's Day (query,    Saint George's Eve?) gypsy girls blindfold a white dog, then,    letting it loose, place themselves quietly in several places. She    to whom the dog runs first will be the first married. Blindman's    buff was anciently an amorous, semi-magical, or witches' game,    only that in place of the dog a man was blindfolded.  "'Or the girl pulls a hair from her head, fastens a ring to it,    and dangles it in a jug. The ring vibrates or swings, and so    often as it touches the side of the jug so many years will it    be before she marries.' This is an ancient spell of Eastern    origin. As performed according to old works the thread must be    wound around the ring-finger and touch the pulse. On the edge of a    bowl the letters of the alphabet, or numerals, are marked, and the    ring swinging against these spells words or denotes numbers. The    touching of the latter indicates the number of lovers a girl is    to have.   "Early on Whitsunday morning the girls go out, and if they see    clouds in the East they throw twigs in that direction, saying:--      "'Predzsia, csirik leja,        Te ná tráda m're píranes.'      "'Fly my bird--fly, I say,        Do not chase my love away.'   "For they think that if on Whitsun-morn there are many clouds in    the East few girls will be married during the coming year. This    peculiar, seemingly incomprehensible, custom of the gypsies    originated in an old belief, the germ of which we find in    the Hindoo myth, according to which the spring morning which    spreads brightness and blessings descends from the blue bird    of heaven, who, on the other hand, also represents night or    winter. Special preparations are made so that the predictions shall    be fulfilled. On the days mentioned the girls are neither allowed    to wash themselves, nor to kiss any one, nor go to church. At    Easter, or on the Eve of Saint George, the girl must eat fish,    in order to see the future in her dreams.   "On Easter morning the girls boil water, in the bubbles of which    they try to make out the names of their future husbands.   "To find out whether the future husband is young or old the girl    must take nine seeds of the thorn-apple, ploughed-up earth of    nine different places, and water from as many more. With these    she kneads a cake, which is laid on a cross-road on Easter or    Saint George's morning. If a woman steps first on the cake her    husband will be a widower or an old man, but if a man the husband    will be single or young.   "To see the form of a future husband a girl must go on the night    of Saint George to a cross-road. Her hair is combed backwards,    and, pricking the little finger of the left hand, she must let    three drops of blood fall on the ground while saying:--      "'Mro rat dav piraneszke,        Kász dikhav, avava adaleske.'      "'I give my blood to my loved one,        Whom I shall see shall be mine own!'   "Then the form of her future husband will rise slowly out of the    blood and fade as slowly away. She must then gather up the dust,    or mud-blood, and throw it into a river, otherwise the Nivashi,    or Water-spirits, will lick up the blood, and the girl be drowned    within the year. It is said that about twenty years ago the    beautiful Roszi (Rosa), the daughter of Peter Danku, the waywode,    or chief of the Kukuja tribe, was drowned during the time of    her betrothal because when she performed this ceremony she had    neglected to gather up the sprinkled blood.   "If a girl wishes to see the form of her future husband, and    also to know what luck awaits her love, she goes on any of the    fore-named nights to a cross-road, and sits down on the ground,    putting before her a fried fish and a glass of brandy. Then the    form of her future husband will appear and stand before her for    a time, silent and immovable. Should he then take the fish the    marriage will be happy, but if he begin with the brandy it will    be truly wretched. But if he takes neither, one of the two will    die during the year.   "That the laying of cards, the interpretation of dreams, the    reading of the future in the hand, and similar divinations are    constantly practised is quite natural, but it would lead us too    far to enlarge on all these practices. But there are charms to    win or cause love which are more interesting. Among these are    the love-potions or philtres, for preparing which gypsies have    always been famed.   "The simplest and least hurtful beverage which they give unknown to    persons to secure love is made as follows:--On any of the nights    mentioned they collect in the meadows gander-goose (Romání, vast    bengeszkero--devil's hand; in Latin, Orchis maculata; German,    Knabenkraut), the yellow roots of which they dry and crush and    mix with their menses, and this they introduce to the food of    the person whose love they wish to secure."Of the same character is a potion which they prepare as follows:On the day of Saint John they catch a green frog and put it in aclosed earthen receptacle full of small holes, and this they placein an ant-hill. The ants eat the frog and leave the skeleton. This isground to powder, mixed with the blood of a bat and dried bath-fliesand shaped into small buns, which are, as the chance occurs, putsecretly into the food of the person to be charmed.There is yet another charm connected with this which I leave inthe original Latin in which it is modestly given by Dr. Wlislocki:"Qualibet supradictarum noctium occiduntur duo canes nigri, mas etfemina, quorum genitalia exstirpata ad condensationem coquntur. Hujusmateriæ particula consumpta quemvis invincibili amore facit exardescarein eam eamve, qui hoc medio prodigioso usus est."It may be remarked that these abominable charms are also not onlyknown to the Tuscan witches of the present day, but are found in Voodoosorcery, and are indeed all over the world. To use revolting means inblack sorcery may be, or perhaps certainly is, spontaneous-sporadic,but when we find the peculiar details of the processes identical,we are so much nearer to transmission or history that the burden ofdisproving must fall on the doubter.   "To the less revolting philtres belongs one in which the girl    puts the ashes of a burnt piece of her dress which had been wet    with perspiration and has, perhaps, hair adhering to it, into a    man's food or drink (also Tuscan).   "To bury the foot of a badger (also Voodoo), or the eye of a crow,    under one's sleeping-place is believed to excite or awaken love.   "According to gypsy belief one can spread love by transplanting    blood, perspiration, or hair into the body of a person.   "By burning the hair, blood, or saliva of any one, his or her    love can be extinguished.   "The following is a charm used to punish a faithless lover. The    deceived maid lights a candle at midnight and pricks it several    times with a needle, saying:--      "'Pchagerav momely        Pchagera tre vodyi!'      "'Thrice the candle's broke by me        Thrice thy heart shall broken be!'   "If the faithless lover marries another, the girl mixes the broken    shell of a crab in his food or drink, or hides one of her hairs    in a bird's nest. This will make the marriage unhappy, and the    husband will continually pine for his neglected sweetheart."This last charm is allied to another current among the Slavonians,and elsewhere mentioned, by which it is believed that if a bird getsany of a man's hair and works it into a nest he will suffer terriblytill it is completely decayed.CHAPTER VIII.ROUMANIAN AND TRANSYLVANIAN SORCERIES AND SUPERSTITIONS, CONNECTEDWITH THOSE OF THE GYPSIES.In her very interesting account of Roumanian superstitions,Mrs. E. Gerard ("The Land Beyond the Forest"), finds three distinctsources for them: firstly, the indigenous, which seems to have beenformed by or adapted to the wild and picturesque scenery and characterof the country; secondly, those derived from the old German customsand beliefs brought by the so-called Saxon, in reality Lower Rhenishcolonists; and thirdly, the influence of the gypsies, "themselves arace of fortune-tellers and witches." All these kinds of superstitionhave twined and intermingled, acted and reacted upon one another sothat in many cases it becomes a difficult matter to determine theexact parentage of some particular belief or custom.It may be often difficult to ascertain in what particular country oramong what people a superstition was last found, but there is verylittle trouble when we compare the great body of all such beliefsof all races and ages and thereby find the parent sources. It isnot many years since philologists, having taken up some favouritelanguage--for instance, Irish--discovering many words in manytongues almost identical with others in "Earse," boldly claimedthat this tongue was the original of all the others. Now we find theroots of them all in the Aryan. So when we examine Folk-lore, it isdoubtless of great importance that we should learn where a traditionlast lived; but we must not stop there--we must keep on inquiringtill we reach the beginning. As a rule, with little exception, whenwe find anywhere the grosser forms of fetish and black witchcraft,we may conclude that we have remains of the world's oldest faith,or first beginning of supernaturalism in suffering and terror, a fearof mysterious evil influences. For with all due respect to the factthat such superstitions might have sprung up sporadically whereversimilar causes existed to create them, it is, in the first place, avery rare chance that they should assume exactly like forms. Secondly,we must consider that as there are even now millions of people whoreceive with ready faith and carefully nurse these primæval beliefs,so there has been from the beginning of time abundant opportunityfor their transmission and growth. Thirdly, nothing is so quicklytransmitted as Folk-lore, which in one sense includes myths andreligion. If jade was in the prehistoric stone age carried from Ionaor Tartary all over Europe, it is even more probable that myths wentwith it quite as far and fast.It is not by loose, fanciful, and careless guess-work as to how theresemblance of Greek or Norse legends to those of the Red Indians isdue to similar conditions of climate and life, that we shall arriveat facts; neither will the truth be ascertained by assuming that therewas a certain beginning of them all in a certain country, or that theywere all developed out of one mythology, be it solar or Shemitic,Hindoo or Hebrew. What we want is impartial examination--comparisonand analysis. On this basis we find that all the Folk-lore or magicof Europe, and especially of its Eastern portion, has a great dealwhich is derived from black witchcraft, or from the succeedingShamanism. When we find that a superstition is based on fertility,the "mystery of generation," or "Phallic worship"--as, for instance,wearing boars' teeth or a little pig for a charm--we may concludethat it is very ancient, but still not older than the time whenwise men had begun to reflect on the mysteries of birth and deathand weave them into myths. The exorcism of diseases as devils, andthe belief that they, in common with other evils, may be drummed, orsmoked, or incanted away into animals, trees, and streams, belongsin most cases to Shamanism. In all probability the oldest sorceryof all was entirely concerned with driving out devils and injuringenemies--just as most of the play of small boys runs to fighting orthe semblance of it, or as the mutual relations of most animals inthe lower stages consist of devouring one another. This was the verybeginning of the beginnings, and it would be really marvellous that somuch of it has survived were it not that to the one who is not quitedazzled or blinded by modern enlightenment there is still existenta great outer circle of human darkness, and that this darkness maybe found in thousands of intermittent varying shadows or marvellouschiaroscuro, even in the brightest sun-pictures of modern life. As Iwrite I have before me a copy of the Philadelphia Press, of April 14,1889, in which a J. C. Batford, M.D., advertises that if any one willsend him two two-cent postage stamps--i.e., twopence--"with a lock ofyour hair, name, age, and sex," he will send a clairvoyant diagnosis ofyour disease. This divining by the lock of hair is extremely ancient,and had its origin in the belief that he who could obtain one from anenemy could reach his soul and kill him. From communicating a diseaseby means of such a lock, and ascertaining what was the matter witha man, in the same manner, was a very obvious step forward.Of all people living in Europe the peasantry of Italy and Sicilyand the gypsies seem to have retained most of this Shamanism andwitchcraft, and as the latter have been for centuries its chiefpriests, travelling here and there disseminating it, we may concludethat even where they did not originate it they have been active inkeeping the old faith alive. In Roumania, where the gypsy is calledin to conjure on all occasions, "people believe themselves to besurrounded by whole legions of devils, witches, and goblins." Thereis scarcely a day or hour in which these bad spirits have not power,"and a whole complicated system, about as laborious as the masteringan unknown language, is required in order to teach an unfortunatepeasant to steer clear of the dangers by which he supposes himselfto be beset."On Wednesday and Friday no one should use needle or scissors, bakebread, or sow flax. No bargain should ever be concluded on a Friday,and Venus, here called Paraschiva, to whom this day is sacred,punishes all infractions of the law. There was among the Wends aflax-goddess, Pscipolnitza, and the shears as emblematic of death arenaturally antipathetic to Venus, the source of life. Whether Marshas anything in common with Mors I know not, but in Roumania he isdecidedly an evil spirit of death, whence Marti, or Tuesday, is one,when spinning is positively prohibited (here we have Venus again),and washing the hands and combing the hair are not unattended withdanger. Whence it appears that the devil agrees with not a few saintsin detesting neatness of the person. And as it is unlucky to washanything on Saturday, or to spin on Thursday, or to work in the fieldson Thursday between Easter and Pentecost, it will be seen that Lazinessand Dirt have between them a fine field in Roumania. Add to this that,as in Russia, more than half the days in the year are Saints' days,or fast days or festivals on which it is "unlucky" to work at all,and we find that industry cannot be said to be much encouraged by Faithin any of its forms. This belief in holy days which bring ill-luck tothose who work on them, which is still flourishing in every countryin the world, goes back to time whereof the memory of man hath naughtto the contrary. A distinct difference is here to be observed howeverbetween naturally resting from work on certain days, which is of coursean inherent instinct in all mankind, and the declaring such rest to beobligatory, and its infraction punishable by death, disaster, and badluck, and still more the increasing such Sabbaths to such an extentas to interfere with industry, or the turning them into fast daysor Saints' days with "observances." Here the old Shamanism comes in,if not the evil witchcraft itself which exacted penance and fasting,and ceremonies to exorcise the devils. The first belief was that evilspirits inflicted pain on man, and that man, by efforts which costhim suffering, could repel or retaliate on them. This was simpleaction and reaction, and the repulsion was effected with starving,enduring smoke, or using repulsive and filthy objects. Out of thisin due time came penance of all kinds.The Oriental or Greek Church is found at every turn, even morethan the Catholic, interchanged, twined, and confused with ancientsorcery. Theodore, like Saint Simeon and Anthony in Tuscany, isvery much more of a goblin than a holy man. His weakness is youngwomen, and sometimes in the shape of a beautiful youth, at othersof a frightful monster, he carries off those who are found workingon his day--that is the 23rd of January. Theodore, according to theSolar mythologists personifies the sun. (De Gubernatis, "ZoologicalMythology," vol. ii. p. 296). In any case the saint who seizes girlsis the Hindoo Krishna or his prototype, and therefore may have comethrough the gypsies. The overworked solar myth derives some supportfrom the fact that among the Serbs on Theodore's day the Sintotere--orcentaur, as the name declares--who is half horse and half man, ridesover the people who fall in his power. The Centaurs were connectedwith the "rape of maidens," as shown in the legend of the Lapithæ,and it is very probable that Theodore himself is, in the languageof the Western Americans, "half a horse," which they regard as thegreatest compliment which can be paid to a man. [15]"Wonderful potions and salves," says Mrs. Gerard, "composed of thefat of bears, dogs, snakes, and snails, with the oil of rain-worms,spiders, and midges, rubbed into a paste, are concocted by theseBohemians (i.e., gypsies). Saxon and Roumanian mothers are oftenin the habit of giving a child to be nursed for nine days to someTzigane women supposed to have power to undo the spell."These revolting ingredients are not the result of modern invention, butrelics of the primitive witchcraft or Ur-religion, which was foundedon pain, terror, and the repulsive. Among other Roumanian-Romanytraditions are the following:--Swallows here as elsewhere are luck-bringing birds, and termedGaliniele lui Dieu--fowls of the Lord. So in England we hear that:--   "The robin and the wren    Are God Almighty's cock and hen."There is always a treasure to be found where the first swallow isseen. Among the Romans when it was observed one ran to the nearestfountain and washed his eyes, and then during the whole year to come,dolorem omnem oculorum tuorum hirundines auferant--the swallows willcarry away all your complaints of the eyes.The skull of a horse over the gate of a courtyard, or the bonesof fallen animals buried under the doorstep are preservativesagainst ghosts. In Roman architecture the skulls of oxen, rams,and horses continually occur as a decoration, and they are usedas charms to-day in Tuscany. Black fowls are believed to be in theservice of witches. The skull of a ram placed at the boundary of aparish in Roumania keeps off disease from cattle; it was evidentlya fetish in all ages. In Slavonian, Esthonian, and Italian talesblack poultry occur as diabolical--to appease the devil a black cockmust be sacrificed. But in Roumania the (black) Brahmaputra fowl isbelieved, curiously enough, to be the offspring of the devil and aJewish girl--truly an insignificant result of such clever parentage.A cow that has wandered away will be safe from witches if the ownersticks a pair of scissors or shears in the centre crossbeam ofthe dwelling-room. The Folk-lore of shears is extensive; Friedrichderives it from the cutting of the threads of life by the Fates. ThusJuno appears on a Roman coin (Eckhel, "Numis. Vet." viii. p. 358)as holding the shears of death. The swallow is said in a Swedishfairy tale to have been the handmaid of the Virgin Mary, and to havestolen her scissors, for which reason she was turned into a bird--theswallow's tail being supposed to resemble that article. Gypsies inEngland use the shears in incantations.A whirlwind denotes that the devil is dancing with a witch, and hewho approaches too near it may be carried off bodily to hell (as hasindeed happened to many a wicked Pike in a cyclone or blizzard inWestern America), though he may escape by losing his cap.It is very dangerous to point at a rainbow or an approachingthunderstorm. Probably the devil who here guides the whirlwind ordirects the storm regards the act as impolite. He punishes those whothus indicate the rainbow by a gnawing disease. Lightning is avertedby sticking a knife in a loaf of bread and spinning the two on thefloor of the loft of the house while the storm lasts. The knife appearsnot only in many gypsy spells, but in the Etruscan-Florentine magic.The legends of Domdaniel and the College of Sorcery in Salamanca appearin the gypsy Roumanian Scholomance, or school which exists somewherefar away deep in the heart of the mountains, "where the secrets ofnature, the language of animals, and all magic spells are taught by thedevil in person." Only ten scholars are admitted at a time, and whenthe course of learning has expired nine are dismissed to their homes,but the tenth is detained by the professor in payment. Henceforth,mounted on an ismeju, or dragon, he becomes the devil's aide-de-camp,and assists him in preparing thunderbolts and managing storms andtempests. "A small lake, immeasurably deep, high up in the mountains,south of Hermanstadt, is supposed to be the caldron in which thedragon lies sleeping and where the thunder is brewed.""Whoever turns three somersaults the first time he hears thunderwill be free from pains in the back during the twelvemonth." Of thisprescription--which reads as if it had originated with Timothy, in"Japhet in Search of a Father," when he practised as a mountebank--itmay be said that it is most unlikely that any person who is capableof putting it in practice should suffer with such pains.To be free from headache rub the forehead with a piece of iron orstone. This may be a presage of the electric cure or of that by"metallic tractors."It is unfortunate in all Catholic countries to meet with a priestor nun, especially when he or she is the first person encounteredin the morning. In Roumania this is limited to the Greek popa. Butto be first met by a gypsy on going forth is a very fortunate omenindeed. According to a widely-spread and ancient belief it is alsovery lucky to meet with any woman of easy virtue--the easier thebetter. This is doubtless derived from the ancient worship of Venus,and the belief that any thing or person connected with celibacyand chastity, such as a nun, is unlucky. It would appear from thisthat the Roumanians, or their gypsy oracles, have formed an opinionthat their own popas are strictly abstinent as regards love, whileProtestant priests marry and are accordingly productive. Why theCatholic clergy are included with the latter is not at all clear. Itis lucky also to meet a gypsy at any time, and doubtless this beliefhas been well encouraged by the Romany.   "It's kushti bak to wellán a Rom,    When tute's a pirryin pré the drom."   "When you are going along the street    It's lucky a gypsy man to meet."Likewise, it is lucky to meet with a woman carrying a jug full ofwater, &c., but unlucky if it be empty. So in the New Testament thevirgins whose lamps were full of oil received great honour. The lampwas an ancient symbol of life; hence it is very often found coveredwith aphrodisiac symbols or made in Phallic forms. It is barelypossible that common old popular simile of "Not by a jug-full"--meaning"not by a great deal"--is derived from this association of a fullvessel with abundance.It is a Roumanian gypsy custom to do homage to the Wodna zena, or"Water-woman" (Hungarian gypsy, Nivashi), by spilling a few drops ofwater on the ground after filling a jug, and it is regarded as aninsult to offer drink without observing this ceremony. A Roumanianwill never draw water against the current (also as in the Hungariangypsy charms), as it would provoke the water-spirit. If water isdrawn in the night-time, whoever does so must blow three times overthe brimming jug, and pour a few drops on the coals.The mythology of the Roumanians agrees with that of the gypsies. Itis sylvan, and Indian. In deep pools of water lurks the dreadfulbalaur or Wodna muz--i.e., the Waterman (Muz is both gypsy andSlavonian)--who lies in wait for victims. In every forest lives themama padura, or weshni dye--"the forest mother"--who is believed tobe benevolent to human beings, especially towards children who havelost their way in the wood. But the Panusch is an amorous spirit who,like the wanton satyrs of old, haunts the silent woodland shades,and lies in wait for helpless maids. "Surely," observes Mrs. Gerard,"this is a corruption of 'great Pan,' who is not dead after all,but merely banished to the land beyond the forest." What a find thiswould have been for Heine when writing "The Gods in Exile"!"In deep forests and lonely mountain gorges there wanders about awild huntsman of superhuman size." He appears to be of a mysteriousnature, and is very seldom seen. Once he met a peasant who had shotninety-nine bears, and warned him never to attempt to kill another. Butthe peasant disregarded his advice, and, missing his aim, was tornin pieces by the bear.Very singular is the story that this Lord of the Forest once taught ahunter--that if he loaded his gun on New Year's Night with a live adderhe would never miss a shot during the ensuing year. It is not probablethat he was told to put a live and "wiggling" snake into his gun. Thestory of itself suggests the firing out the ramrod for luck. It hasbeen observed by C. Lloyd Morgan that if a drop of the oil of a foultobacco pipe be placed in the mouth of a snake the muscles instantlybecome set in knotted lumps and the creature becomes rigid. If much isgiven the snake dies, but if only a small amount is employed it may berestored. This, as Mr. Oakley has suggested, may explain the storiesof Indian snake-charmers being able to turn a snake into a stick. It isperformed by spitting into the snake's mouth and then placing the handon its head till it becomes stiffened. "The effect may be produced byopium or some other narcotic." And it may also occur to the reader thatthe jugglers who performed before Pharaoh were not unacquainted withthis mystery. It is probable that the hunter in the gypsy Roumanianstory first gave his adder tobacco before firing it off.The Om ren, or wild man, is a malevolent forest spectre, the terrorof hunters and shepherds. He is usually seen in winter, and when hefinds an intruder on his haunts, he tears up pine trees by the rootswith which he slays the victim, or throws him over a precipice, oroverwhelms him with rocks. In every detail he corresponds to a beinggreatly feared by the Algonkin Indians of America.The oameni micuti, or "small men," are grey-bearded dwarfs, dressedlike miners. They are the kobolds or Bergmännchen of Germany. Theyseldom harm a miner, and when one has perished in the mine they makeit known to his family by three knocks on his door. They may be heardquarrelling among themselves and hitting at one another with theiraxes, or blowing their horns as a signal of battle. These "horns ofElf-land blowing" connect them with the Korriagan of Brittany, who arefairies who always carry and play on the same instrument. Prætoriusdevotes a long chapter to all the learning extant on the subject ofthese Bergmännrigen, or Subterraneans.The mountain monk is the very counterpart of Friar Rush in Englishfairy-lore, and is also of Indian origin. He delights in kicking overwater-pails, putting out lamps, and committing mischief, merry, mad, orsad. Sometimes he has been known to strangle workmen whom he dislikes,though, on the other hand, he often helps distressed miners by fillingtheir empty lamps or guiding those who have lost their way. But healways bids them keep it a secret, and if they tell they suffer for it.Gana is queen of the witches, and corresponds to the Diana of theItalians. Gana is probably only a variation of the word Diana. Amongthe Wallachians this goddess is in fact known as Dina and Sina. She,like the wilde Jäger, rushes in headlong hunt over the heavens orthrough the skies followed by a throng of witches and fairies. "Peopleshow the places where she has passed, and where the grass andleaves are dry" (Friedrich). She is a powerful enchantress, and isstrongest in her sorcery about Easter-tide. To guard against her theWallachians at this time carry a piece of lime-tree or linden wood. Sheis a beautiful but terrible enchantress, who presides over the evilspirits who meet on May eve. She was the ruler of all Transylvania(a hunting country) before Christianity prevailed there. Her beautybewitched many, but whoever let himself be lured into drinking meadfrom her urus (or wild ox) drinking-horn perished. She is like theNorse Freya, a cat goddess, and seems to be allied to the Chesme,or cat, or fountain-spirit of the Turks. According to ancient Indianmythology the moon is a cat who chases the mice (stars) of night,and in the fifth book of Ovid's "Metamorphoses," when the gods fledfrom the giants Diana took the form of a cat:--   "Fele soror Phoebi, nivea Saturni a vacca    Pisce Venus latuit."                                    (V. 325, 332.)"According to the Hellenic cosmogony the sun and moon createdthe animals--the sun creating the lion and the moon the cat" (DeGubernatis, "Zoological Mythology," ii. 58). Gertrude, the chiefsorceress or queen of the witches in old German lore, appears when deadas surrounded by mice; she is, in fact, a cat. The Turkish Chesme,or fountain-cat, inveigles youths to death like the Gana, Diana,or Lorelei, who does the same, and is also a water-sprite.The Dschuma is a fierce virgin, or sometimes an old witch, who isincarnate disease, such as the cholera. She is supposed to suffer fromcold and nakedness, and may be heard at night when disease is raging,wailing for want. Then the maidens make garments and hang them out;but it is a most effective charm when seven old women spin, weave,and sew for her a scarlet shirt all in one night without once speaking.A curious book might be written on the efficacy of nakedness inwitch-spells. In some places in Roumania there is a spirit always naked(at least appearing such), who requires a new suit of clothes everyyear. These are given by the inhabitants of the district hauntedby such an elf, who on New Year's Night lay them out in some placesupposed to be frequented by him or her.In 1866, in a Wallachian village in the district of Bihar, to avertthe cholera, six youths and maidens, all quite naked, traced witha ploughshare a furrow round their village to form a charmed circleover which the disease could not pass.When the land is suffering from long droughts the Roumanians ascribeit to the gypsies, who by occult means make dry weather in order tofavour their own trade of brickmaking. When the necessary rain cannotbe obtained by beating the guilty Tziganes, the peasants resort tothe Papaluga, or Rain-maiden. For this they strip a young gypsy girlstark-naked, and then cover her up in flowers and leaves, leaving onlythe head visible. Thus adorned the Papaluga, or Miss Jack-in-the-Green,is conducted with music round the village, every person pouring wateron her as she passes. When a gypsy girl cannot be had, or the Tziganesare supposed to be innocent, a Roumanian maiden may be taken. Thiscustom is very widely spread.Forty years ago there was a strange mania in the northern cities ofthe United States for "fast" girls of the most reckless kind to go outnaked very late by night into the street to endeavour to run arounda public square or block of houses and regain their homes withoutbeing caught by the police. I suspect that superstition suggestedthis strange risk. It is an old witch-charm that if a girl can,when the moon is full, go forth and run around a certain enclosure,group of trees, or dwelling, without being seen, she will marry theman whom she loves. There are also many magical ceremonies which,to ensure success, must be performed in full moonlight and when quitenaked. "Among the Saxons in Transylvania when there is a very severedrought it is customary in some places for several girls, led by anold woman, and all of them absolutely naked, to go at midnight to thecourtyard of some peasant and steal his harrow. With this they walkacross fields to the nearest stream, where the harrow is put afloatwith a burning light on each corner" (Mrs. Gerard, "Land Beyond,"&c.). This is evidently the old Hindoo floating of lamps by maidenson the Ganges, and in all probability of gypsy importation.She who will pronounce a certain spell, strip herself quite naked,and can steal into the room where a man is lying sound asleep andcan clip from his head a lock of hair and escape without awakeninghim or meeting any one will obtain absolute mastery over him, or atleast over his affections. The hair must be worn in a bag or ring onthe person. But woe unto her who is caught, since in that case theenchantment "all goes the other way." Once a beautiful but very poorHungarian maid gave all she had to a young gypsy girl for a charm towin the love of a certain lord, and was taught this, which proved tobe a perfect success. Having clipped the lock of hair she wove it in aring and wedded him. After a time she died, and the gypsy being calledin to dress the corpse found and kept the ring. Then the lord fell inlove with the gypsy and married her. But ere long she too died, andwas buried, and the ring with her. And from that day the lord seemedas if possessed to sit by her grave, and finally built a house there,and never seemed happy save when in it."If a Roumanian maid," says Mrs. Gerard, "desires to see her futurehusband's face in the water she has only to step naked at midnightinto the nearest lake or river, or, if she shrink from this, let hertake a stand on the more congenial dung-hill with a piece of Christmascake in her mouth, and as the clock strikes twelve listen attentivelyfor the first sound of a dog's bark. From whichever side it proceedswill also come the expected suitor."A naked maid standing on a "congenial dung-hill" with a piece ofChristmas cake in her mouth would be a subject for an artist whichshould be eagerly seized in these days when "excuses for the nude inart" are becoming so rare. It is worth observing that this conjurationis very much like one observed in Tuscany, in which Saint Anthony isinvoked to manifest by a dog's barking at night, as by other sounds,whether the applicant, or invoker, shall obtain her desire.At the birth of a child in Wallachia every one present takes a stoneand throws it behind him, saying, "This into the jaws of the Streghoi"[16]--"a custom," says Mrs. Gerard, "which would seem to suggestSaturn and the swaddled up stones." It is much more suggestive ofthe stones thrown by Deucalion and Pyrrha. Strigoi is translated as"evil spirits"--it is evidently, originally at least, the streghe,or witches of Italy, from the Latin strix, the dreaded witch-birdof Ovid. "Festus derives the word à stringendo from the opinion thatthey strangle children." Middle Latin strega (Paulus Grillandus). Formuch learning on this subject of the Strix the reader may consult DeGubernatis, "Myth of Animals," vol. ii. p. 202."As long as the child is unbaptized it must be carefully watched forfear lest it be changed or stolen away." This is common to Christians,heathen, and gypsies to watch it for several days. "A piece of iron,or a broom laid beneath the pillow will keep spirits away." So inRoumania and Tuscany. Quintus Serenus, however, recommends that whenthe striga atra presses the infant, garlic be used, the strong odourof which (to their credit be it said) is greatly detested by witches."The Romans used to cook their coena demonum for the house-spirits,and the Hindoos prepared food for them." From them it has passedthrough the gypsies to Eastern Europe, and now the Roumanian, whohas by a simple ceremony made a contract with the devil, receivesfrom him an attendant spirit called a spiridsui or spiridush which will   "Serve his master faithfully    For seven long year,"but in return expecting the first mouthful of every dish eaten byhis master.   "So many differing fancies have mankind,    That they the master-sprites may spell and bind."Nearly connected with the Roumanian we have the beliefs in magic ofthe Transylvanian Saxons, all of them shared with the gypsies andprobably partially derived from them. Many people must have wonderedwhat could have been the origin of the saying in reference to a verysmall place that "there was not room to swing a cat in it." "But Idon't want to swing a cat in it," was the very natural rejoinderof a well-known American litterateur to this remark applied tohis house. It is possible that we may find the origin of this oddsaying in a superstition current in Transylvania, whither it in allprobability was carried by the gypsies, whose specialty it is tobear the seeds of superstitions about here and there as the windsdo those of plants. In this country it is said that if a cat runsaway, when recovered she must be swung three times round to attachher to the dwelling. The same is done by a stolen cat by the thiefif he would retain it. Truly this seems a strange way to induce anattachment--or pour encourager les autres. It is evident, however,that to the professional cat-stealer the size of his room must be amatter of some importance. It is a pity that this saying and faithwere unknown to Moncrief-Maradan, "the Historiogriffe of Cats,"("OEuvres," Paris, 1794), who would assuredly have made the most of it.As regards entering new houses in Transylvania the rule is not "Deviltake the hindmost," but the foremost. The first person or being whoenters the maiden mansion must die, therefore it is safe to throw ina preliminary dog or cat. The scape-cat is, however, to be preferred.I can remember once, when about six years of age, looking down intoa well in Massachusetts and being told that the reflection which Isaw was the face of a little boy who lived there. This made a deepimpression on me, and I reflected that it was very remarkable thatthe dweller in the well could assume the appearance of every one wholooked at him. In Transylvania it is, says Mrs. E. Gerard, "dangerousto stare down long into a well, for the well-dame who dwells at thebottom is easily offended. But children are often curious, and so,bending over the edge, they call out mockingly, 'Dame of the Well,pull me down into it!' and then run away rapidly."Whoever has been robbed and wishes to find the thief should take ablack hen, and for nine Fridays must with the hen fast strictly; thethief will then either bring back the plunder or die. This is called"taking up the black fast" against any one. It is said that a peasantof Petersdorf returned one day from Bistritz with 200 florins, whichhe had received for oxen. Being very tipsy he laid down to sleep,having first hidden his money in a hole in the kitchen wall. When heawoke he missed his coin, and having quite forgotten what he had donewith it believed it had been stolen. So he went to an old Wallachian,probably a gypsy, and induced him to take up the black fast againstthe thief. But as he himself had the money the spell worked againsthim and he grew weaker and pined away as it went on. By some chanceat the last moment he found his money, but it was too late, andhe died. Pages of black hen-lore may be gathered from the works ofFriedrich, De Gubernatis and others; suffice it to say that Bubastis,the Egyptian moon-goddess, appears to have been the original mistressof the mysterious animal, if not the black hen as well as cat herself,and mother of all the witches.Magic qualities are attached in Hungary as in Germany to the limeor linden tree; in some villages it is usual to plant one before ahouse to prevent witches from entering. From very early times thelime tree was sacred to Venus among the Greeks, as it was to Ladaamong the Slavonians. This, it is said, was due to its leaves beingof the shape of a heart. In a Slavonian love-song the wooer exclaims:--   "As the bee is drawn by the lime-perfume (or linden-bloom)    My heart is drawn by thee."This was transmitted to Christian symbolism, whence the penance laidby Christ on Mary Magdalen was that "she should have no other foodsave lime-tree leaves, drink naught except the dew which hung onthem, and sleep on no other bed save one made of its leaves" (Menzel,"Christliche Symbolik," vol. ii. p. 57). "For Magdalena had loved much,therefore her penance was by means of that which is a symbol of love."Mrs. Gerard tells us that "a particular growth of vine leaf, whoseexact definition I have not succeeded in rightly ascertaining, iseagerly sought by Saxon girls in some villages. Whoever finds it,puts it in her hair, and if she then kisses the first man she meets onher way home she will soon be married. A story is related of a girl,who having found this growth, meeting a nobleman in a carriage stoppedthe horses and begged leave to kiss him." To which he consented. Thisparticular growth, unknown to Mrs. Gerard, is when the leaves ortendrils or shoots form a natural knot. Among the gypsies in Hungary,as may be elsewhere read, such knots in the willow are esteemed asof great magic efficacy in love. A knot is a symbol of true love inall countries.   "This knot I tie, this knot I knit,    For that true love whom I know not yet."On Easter Monday in Transylvania the lads run about the towns andvillages sprinkling with water all the girls or women whom theymeet. This is supposed to cause the flax to grow well. On the followingday the girls return the attention by watering the boys. "Thiscustom, which appears to be a very old one," says Mrs. Gerard, "isalso prevalent among various Slav races, such as Poles and Serbs. InPoland it used to be de rigeur that water be poured over a girl whowas still asleep, so in every house a victim was selected who hadto feign sleep and patiently receive the cold shower-bath, which wasto ensure the luck of the family during the year. The custom has nowbecome modified to suit a more delicate age, and instead of formidablehorse-buckets of water, dainty little perfume squirts have come tobe used in many places." As the custom not only of sprinkling water,but also of squirting or spraying perfumes is from ancient India (asit is indeed prevalent all over the East), it is probable that thegypsies who are always foremost in all festivals may have brought this"holi" custom to Eastern Europe. Of late it has extended to London,as appears by the following extract from The St. James's Gazette,April, 1889.   "The newest weapon of terror in the West End is the 'scent    revolver.' Its use is simple. You dine--not wisely but the other    thing--and then you stroll into the Park, with your nickel-plated    scent revolver in your pocket. Feeling disposed for a frolic,    you walk up to a woman, present your weapon, pull the trigger,    and in a moment she is drenched, not with gore but with scent,    which is nearly as unpleasant if not quite so deadly. Mr. Andrew    King, who amused himself in that way, has been fined 10s. at    Marlborough Street. Let us hope that the 'revolver' was confiscated    into the bargain."One way of interrogating fate in love affairs is to slice an apple intwo with a sharp knife; if this can be done without cutting a seedthe wish of the heart will be fulfilled. Of yore, in many lands theapple was ever sacred to love, wisdom, and divination. Once in Germanya well-formed child became, through bewitchment, sorely crooked andcramped; by the advice of a monk the mother cut an apple in threepieces and made the child eat them, whereupon it became as before. InIllzach, in Alsace, there is a custom called "Andresle." On SaintAndrew's Eve a girl must take from a widow, and without returningthanks for it, an apple. As in Hungary she cuts it in two and musteat one half of it before midnight, and the other half after it; thenin sleep she will see her future husband. And there is yet anotherlove-spell of the split apple given by Scheible ("Die gute alte Zeit,"Stuttgart, 1847, p. 297) which runs as follows:--   "On Friday early as may be,    Take the fairest apple from a tree,    Then in thy blood on paper white    Thy own name and thy true love's write,    That apple thou in two shalt cut,    And for its cure that paper put,    With two sharp pins of myrtle wood    Join the halves till it seem good,    In the oven let it dry,    And wrapped in leaves of myrtle lie,    Under the pillow of thy dear,    Yet let it be unknown to her;    And if it a secret be    She soon will show her love for thee."Similar apple sorceries were known to the Norsemen. Because the applewas so nearly connected with love and luxury--"Geschlechtsliebe undZeugungslust"--those who were initiated in the mysteries and vowed tochastity were forbidden to eat it. And for the same reason apples,hares, and Cupids, or "Amorets," were often depicted together. InGenesis, as in the Canticles of Solomon, apples, or at least the fruitfrom which the modern apple inherited its traditions are a symbol ofsexual love. In Florence women wishing for children go to a priest andget from him a blessed apple, over which they pronounce an incantationto Santa Anna--la San' Na--who was the Lucina of the Latins.CHAPTER IX.THE RENDEZVOUS OR MEETINGS OF WITCHES, SORCERERS, AND VILAS.--ACONTINUATION OF SOUTH SLAVONIAN GYPSY-LORE.In Eastern Europe witches and their kin, or kind, assemble onthe eve of Saint John and of Saint George, Christmas and Easter,at cross-roads on the broad pustas, or prairies, and there brewtheir magic potions. This, as Dr. Krauss observes, originated infeasts held at the same time in pre-Christian times. "So it wasthat a thousand years ago old and young assembled in woods or onplains to bring gifts to their gods, and celebrated with dances,games, and offerings the festival of spring, or of awaking andblooming Nature. These celebrations have taken Christian names, butinnumerable old heathen rites and customs are still to be found inthem." It may be here observed that mingled with these are many ofa purely gypsy-Oriental origin, which came from the same source andwhich it remains for careful ethnologists and critical Folk-loriststo disentangle and make clear. The priestesses of prehistoric timeson these occasions performed ceremonies, as was natural, to protectcattle or land from evil influences. To honour their deities the "wisewomen" bore certain kinds of boughs and adorned animals with flowersand wreaths. The new religion declared that this was all sorcery anddevil-work, but the belief in the efficacy of the rites continued. Thepriestesses became witches, or Vilas, the terms being often confused,but they were still feared and revered.In all the South Slavonian country the peasants on Saint George'sDay adorn the horns of cattle with garlands, in gypsy Indian style,to protect them from evil influences. I have observed that even inEgypt among Mahometans Saint George is regarded with great reverence,and I knew one who on this day always sacrificed a sheep. The cow or oxwhich is not thus decorated becomes a prey in some way to witches. Thegarlands are hung up at night over the stable door, where they remainall the ensuing year. If a peasant neglects to crown his cow, he notonly does not receive a certain fee from its owner, but is in dangerof being beaten. On the same day the shepherdess, or cow-herd, takesin one hand salt, in the other a potsherd containing live coals. Inthe coals roses are burned. By this means witches lose all power overthe animal. Near Karlstadt the mistress of the family merely strikesit with a cross to produce the same effect.Among the Transylvanian Hungarian gypsies there is a magicalceremony performed on Saint George's Day, traces of which may befound in England. Then the girls bake a peculiar kind of cake, inwhich certain herbs are mixed, and which Dr. von Wlislocki declareshas an agreeable taste. This is divided among friends and foes, and itis believed to have the property of reconciling the bitterest enemiesand of increasing the love of friends. But it is most efficient as alove-charm, especially when given by women to men. The following gypsysong commemorates a deed of this kind by a husband, who recurred toit with joy:--   "Kásáve romñi ná jidel,    Ke kásávo maro the del;    Sar m're gule lele pekel    Káná Sváto Gordye ável.   "Furmuntel bute luludya    Furmuntel yoy bute charma    Andre petrel but kámábe    Ko chal robo avla bake."   "No one bakes such bread as my wife, such as she baked me on    St. George's Day. Many flowers and dew were kneaded into the cake    with love. Whoever eats of it will be her slave."In England I was told by an old gypsy woman named Lizzie Buckland,that in the old time gypsy girls made a peculiar kind of cake, a Romanymorriclo, which they baked especially for their lovers, and used tothrow to them over the hedge by night. To make it more acceptable,and probably to facilitate the action of the charm, they would putmoney into the cake. It was observed of old among the Romans thatfascinatio began with flattery, compliments, and presents!On the night of Saint John the witch climbs to the top of the hurdlefence which surrounds the cow-yard, and sings the following spell:--   "K meni sir,    K meni maslo,    K meni puter,    K meni mleko    Avam pak kravsku kozu!"   "To me the cheese,    To me the tallow (or meat),    To me the butter,    To me the milk,    To you only the cowhide."Or, as it may be expressed in rhyme:--   "The cheese, meat, butter, and milk for me,    But only the cowhide left for thee."Then the cow will die, the carcass be buried, and the skin sold. Toprevent all this the owner goes early on St. John's Day to themeadow and gathers the morning dew in a cloak. This he carries home,and after binding the cow to a beam washes her with it. She is thenmilked, and it is believed that if all has gone right she will yieldfour bucketsful.In the chapter on "Conjurations and Exorcisms among the HungarianGypsies," I have mentioned the importance which they attach to thebeing born a seventh or twelfth child. This is the same throughoutSouth Slavonia, where the belief that such persons in a series ofbirths are exceptionally gifted is "shared by both gypsies, with whomit probably originated, and the peasants. What renders this almostcertain is that Dr. Krauss mentions that the oldest information as tothe subject among the Slavs dates only from 1854, while the faith isancient among the gypsies. He refers here to the so-called Kerstniki,who on the eve of St. John do battle with the witches. Krstnik isa Greek word, meaning, literally, one who has been baptized. But theKrstnik proper is the youngest of twelve brothers, all sons of the samefather. There appears to be some confusion and uncertainty among theSlavs as to whether all the twelve brothers or only the twelfth are"Krstnik"--according to the gypsy faith it would be the latter. These"twelvers" are the great protectors of the world from witchcraft. [17]But they are in great danger on Saint John's Eve, for then the witches,having most power, assail them with sticks and stakes, or stumps ofsaplings, for which reason it is usual in the autumn to carefullyremove everything of the kind from the ground.A krstnik is described by Miklosic as "Clovek kterega vileobljubiju"--"A man who has won the love of a Vila." The Vila ladies,or a certain class of them, are extremely desirous of contracting theclosest intimacy--in short, of becoming the mistresses, of superiormen. The reader may find numerous anecdotes of such amours in the"Curiosa" of Heinrich Kornmann, 1666, and in my "Egyptian Sketch Book"(Trübner & Co., London, 1874). In the heathen days, as at present amongall gypsies and Orientals, it was believed to be a wonderfully luckything for a man to get the love of one of these beautiful beings. Whatthe difficulties were which kept them from finding lovers is not veryclear, unless it were that the latter must be twelfth sons, or, whatis far more difficult to find, young men who would not gossip abouttheir supernatural sweethearts to other mortals, who would remaintrue to them, and who finally would implicitly obey all their commandsand follow their advice. There is a vast array of tales--Gypsy, Arab,Provençal, Norman, German, and Scandinavian, which show that on thesepoints the Vila, or forest-maiden, or spirit of earth or air, or fairy,was absolutely exacting and implacable, being herself probably allowedby occult laws to contract an intimacy only with men of a high order,or such as are--    "Few in a heap and very hard to find."On the other hand, the Vila yearns intensely for men and theirnear company, because there is about those who have been baptized acertain perfume or odour of sanctity, and as the unfortunate nymph isnot immortal herself, she likes to get even an association or sniffof it from those who are. According to the Rosicrucian Mythology,as set forth in the "Undine" of La Motte Fouqué, she may acquire asoul by marrying a man who will be faithful to her--which accountsfor the fact that so few Undines live for ever. However this may be,it appears that the Krstniki are specially favoured, and frequentlyinvited by the Vilas to step in--generally to a hollow tree--and makea call. The hollow tree proves to be a door to Fairyland, and thecall a residence of seven days, which on returning home the callerfinds were seven years, for--    "When we are pleasantly employed, time flies."These spirits have one point in common with their gypsy friends--theysteal children--with this difference, that the Vila only takes thosewhich have been baptized, while the gypsy--at present, at least--isprobably not particular in this respect. But I have very littledoubt that originally one motive, and perhaps the only one whichinduced these thefts, was the desire of the gypsies, as heathensand sorcerers, to have among them, "for luck," a child which hadreceived the initiation into that mysterious religion from whichthey were excluded, and which, as many of their charms and spellsprove, they really regarded as a higher magic. It is on this groundonly, or for this sole reason, that we can comprehend many of thechild-stealings effected by gypsies; for it is absolutely true that,very often when they have large families of their own, they will,for no apparent cause whatever, neither for the sake of plunder,profit, or revenge, adopt or steal some poor child and bring it up,kindly enough after their rough fashion; and in doing this they areinfluenced, as I firmly believe, far more by a superstitious feelingof bak, or luck, and the desire to have a Mascot in the tent, than anyother. That children have been robbed or stolen for revenge does notin the least disprove what I believe--that in most cases the motivefor the deed is simply superstition.On the eve of Saint George old women cut thistle-twigs and bring themto the door of the stall. This is only another form of the nettlewhich enters so largely into the Hungarian gypsy incantations, andthey also make crosses with cowdung on the doors. This is directlyof Indian origin, and points to gypsy tradition. Others drive largenails into the doors--also a curious relic of a widely-spread ancientcustom, of which a trace may be found in the Vienna Stock im Eisen,or trunk driven full of nails by wandering apprentices, which may beseen near the church of Saint Stephen. But the thistle-twigs are stillheld to be by far the most efficacious. In Vinica, or near it, thesetwigs are cut before sunset. They are laid separately in many places,but are especially placed in garlands on the necks of cattle. Ifa witch, in spite of these precautions, contrives to get into thestable, all will go wrong with the beasts during the coming year.Now there was once a man who would have none of this thistle work--nay,he mocked at those who believed in it. So it came to pass that allthrough the year witches came every night and milked his cows. Andhe reflected, "I must find out who does this!" So he hid himself inthe hay and kept sharp watch. All at once, about eleven o'clock,there came in a milk-pail, which moved of its own accord, and thecows began to let down their milk into it. The farmer sprang out andkicked it over. Then it changed into a tremendous toad which turnedto attack him, so that in terror he took refuge in his house. Thatproved to be a lucky thing for him. A week after came the day of SaintGeorge. Then he hung thistle-twigs on his stable door, and after thathis cows gave milk in plenty.Witches may be seen on Saint George's Day, and that unseen by them ifa man will do as follows: He must rise before the sun, turn all hisclothes inside out and then put them on. Then he must cut a greenturf and place it on his head. Thus he becomes invisible, for thewitches believe he is under the earth, being themselves apparentlybewitched by this.Very early on the day of Saint George, or before sunrise, the witchesclimb into the church belfry to get the grease from the axle on whichthe bell swings, and a piece of the bell-rope, for these things areessential to them. Dr. Krauss observes that in the MS. from whichhe took this, schmierfetet or axle-grease, is indicated by the wordsvierc, "in which one at once recognizes the German word schwartz,a black." It is remarkable that the Chippeway and other AlgonkinIndians attach particular value to the black dye made from the greaseof the axle of a grindstone.The extraordinary pains which they took to obtain this had attractedthe attention of a man in Minnesota, who told me of it. It requireda whole day to obtain a very little of it. The Indians, when asked bycurious white people what this was for, said it was for dyeing baskets,but, as my informant observed, the quantity obtained was utterlyinadequate to any such purpose, and even better black dyes (e.g.,hickory bark and alum) are known to, and can be very easily obtainedby, them. The real object was to use the grease in "medicine," i.e.,for sorcery. The eagerness of both witches in Europe and Indians inAmerica to obtain such a singular substance is very strange. However,the idea must be a recent one among the Indians, for there werecertainly no grindstones among them before the coming of the white men.   "For all that I can tell, said he,    Is that it is a mystery."Heathens though they be, many gypsies have a superstitious belief inthe efficacy of the sacramental bread and wine, and there are manyinstances of their stealing them for magical purposes. So in theMiddle Ages witches and sorcerers used these objects for the mostsingular purposes, Paulus Grillandus, in his "Tractatus de Hereticiset Sortilegiis," &c. (Lyons, 1547), assuring his readers that he hadknown a witch who had two holy wafers inscribed with magical characterswhich she used for debauching innocent girls and betraying them to men,and that it was a belief that if a woman had the sacred oil fresh onher lips no man could refrain from kissing her. This is the union oftwo kinds of magic; a view which never once occurred to theologicalwriters. And here I may appropriately mention that while the proofs ofthis work were passing through my hands accident threw into my way anextremely rare work, which illustrates to perfection the identity ofpopular and ecclesiastical sorcery. This is entitled "De EffectibusMagicis, ac de Nuce Maga Beneventana," "Six Books of Magic Effectsand of the Witch Walnut-tree of Benevento. A work necessary, joyous,and useful to Astrologists, Philosophers, Physicians, Exorcists,and Doctors, and Students of Holy Scriptures. By the Chief Physician,Peter Piperno." It appears to have been privately printed at Naplesin 1647, and came from a conventual library. It bore, written on afly-leaf, the word Proibito.In it every kind of disorder or disease is declared to be causedby devils and witches. The author believes with Delrio that diseaseentered into the world as a consequence of sin (referenda sit ad primænostræ matris peccatum)--a view held by John Milton; hence, of course,all disease is caused solely by the devil. In his volume of two hundredlarge and close pages, our Peter Piperno displays a vast erudition onthe origin of devils and diseases, is bitter on the rival school ofmagical practitioners who use cures and incantations unlike his own,and then gives us the name and nature of all diseases, according to thedifferent parts of the body, &c., the medical prescriptions proper forthem, and what is, in his opinion, most needful of all, the incantationor exorcism to be pronounced. Sometimes there are several of these,as one for making up a pill, another on taking it, &c. There are alsogeneral conjurations--I mean benedictions--for the medicines altogetheror in particular, such as the Benedictio Syruporum, "The Blessing ofthe Syrups," and there is a very affecting and appropriately moving onefor making or taking Castor Oil, and oils of all kinds, as follows:--   "Benedictio Olei.   "This begins with the In nomine Patris, &c., and Adjutorium    nostrum, &c., and then:   "I exorcise you all aromatics, herbs, roots, seeds, stones, gums,    and whatever is to be compounded with this oil, by God the Father,    God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, by the God triune yet one,    by the holy and single Trinity, that the impure Spirit depart from    you, and with it every incursion of Satan, every fraud of the    Enemy, every evil of the Devil, and that mixed with oil you may    free the subject from all infirmities, incantations, bindings,    witchcrafts, from all diabolical fraud, art, and power, by the    merits of our Lord Jesus Christ and the most beloved Virgin Mary,    and of all the saints. Amen."The curses for the devils of colds, fevers, rheumatisms, gouts,stomach-aches, &c., are awful, both in number, length, and quality;enough to frighten a cowboy or "exhort an impenitent mule" intodocility. There is the Exorcismus terribilis, or "Terrible Exorcism"of Saint Zeno, in which the disorder is addressed literally as "Adirty, false, heretical, drunken, lewd, proud, envious, deceitful,vile, swindling, stupid devil"--with some twenty more epithets which,if applied in these our days to the devil himself, would ground anaction for libel and bring heavy damages in any court. It is to beremarked that in many prescriptions the author adds to legitimateremedies, ingredients which are simply taken from popular necromancy,or witchcraft, as for instance, rue--fugæ dæmonum--verbena, andartemisia, all of which are still in use in Tuscany against sorceryand the evil eye.The really magical character of these exorcisms is shown by the vastarray of strange words used in them, many of which have a commonsource with those used by sorcerers of the Cabalistic or Agrippaschool, such as Agla, Tetragrammaton, Adonai, Fons, Origo, Serpens,Avis, Leo, Imago, Sol, Floy, Vitis, Mons, Lapis, Angularis, Ischyros,Pantheon, all of which are old heathen terms of incantation. Theseare called in the exorcism "words by virtue of which"--per virtutemistorum verborum--the devils are invited to depart. The whole is asmuch a work of sorcery as any ever inscribed in a catalogue of occulta,and it was as a specimen of occulta that I bought it.CHAPTER X.OF THE HAUNTS, HOMES, AND HABITS OF WITCHES IN THE SOUTH SLAVICLANDS.--BOGEYS AND HUMBUGS.The witches in Slavonian gipsy-lore have now and then parties whichmeet to spin, always by full moonlight on a cross-road. But it is notadvisable, says Krauss, to pass by on such occasions, as the least theydo to the heedless wayfarer is to bewitch and sink him into a deepsleep. But they are particularly fond of assembling socially in thetops of trees, especially of the ash, walnut, and linden or lime kinds,preferring those whose branches grow in the manner here depicted.It is but a few days ago, as I write, that I observed all along theroute from Padua to Florence thousands of trees supporting vines,which trees had been trained to take this form, the farmers being asmuch influenced by "luck" in so doing as utility; for it is not reallyessential that the tree shall so exactly receive this shape, to holda vine, as is proved by the fact that there are plantations here andthere where this method of training the trees is not observed. It isvery suggestive of the triçula or trident of Siva, which originatedthe trushul, or cross of the gypsies. As regards the properties ofthe ash tree Krauss remarks that "roots with magic power grew underash trees," and quotes a song of a maiden who, having learned thather lover is untrue, replies:--   "Ima trava u okolo Save,    I korenja okolo jasenja,"   "There are herbs by the Save,    And roots around ash trees,"--meaning that she can prepare a love-potion from these. There isin the Edda a passage in which we are also told that there are magicpowers in the roots of trees, the reference being probably to the ash,and possibly to the alraun, or images made of its roots, which aresometimes misnamed mandrakes.Other resorts of Slavonian gypsy witches are near or in deep woods andravines, also on dung-hills, or places where ashes, lye, or rubbishis thrown, or among dense bushes. Or as soon as the sun sets theyassemble in orchards of plum trees, or among ancient ruins, while onsummer nights they hold their revels in barns, old hollow trees, bydark hedges or in subterranean caverns. The peasants greatly dreaddung-hills after dark, for fear of cruel treatment by them. Whena wild wind is blowing the witches love dearly to dance. Then theywhirl about in eddying figures and capers, and when the sweat fallsfrom them woe to the man who treads upon it!--for he will become atonce dumb or lame, and may be called lucky should he escape with onlyan inflammation of the lungs. In fact, if a man even walks in a placewhere witches have been he will become bewildered or mad, and remainso till driven homeward by hunger. But such places may generally berecognized by their footprints in the sand; for witches have only fourtoes--the great toe being wanting. These mysterious four toe-tracks,which are indeed often seen, are supposed by unbelievers to be madeby wild geese, swans, or wild ducks, but in reply to this the peasantor gypsy declares that witches often take the form of such fowl. Andthere is, moreover, much Rabbinical tradition which proves that thedevil and his friends have feet like peacocks, which are notoriouslybirds of evil omen, as is set forth by a contributor to The St. James'sGazette, November 16, 1888:--   "Again, take peacocks. Nobody who has not gone exhaustively into    the subject can have any adequate idea of the amount of general    inconvenience diffused by a peacock. Broken hearts, broken limbs,    pecuniary reverses, and various forms of infectious disease have    all been traced to the presence of a peacock, or even a peacock    feather, on the premises."The evil reputation of the peacock is due to his having been the onlycreature who was induced to show Satan the way into Paradise. (For apoem on this subject, vide "Legends of the Birds," by C. G. Leland,Philadelphia, 1864).If any one should by chance pop in--like Tam O'Shanter--to an assemblyof witches, he must at once quickly cover his head, make the sign ofthe cross, take three steps backwards and a fourth forwards. Then thewitches cannot injure him. Should a gentleman in London or Brightonabruptly intrude into a five o'clock tea, while Peel or Primrosewitches are discussing some specially racy scandal, he should,however, make instantly so many steps backwards as will take him tohis overcoat or cane, and then, after a turn, so many down-stairs aswill bring him into the street.If any man should take in his hand from the garden fence anythingwhich a witch has laid there, he will in the same year fall sick,and if he has played with it he must die. There be land-witches andwater-witches--whoever goes to swim in a place where these latterare found will drown and his body never be recovered. Sometimes inthese places the water is very deep, but perfectly clear, in othersit is still and very muddy, to which no one can come within sevenpaces because of an abominable and stifling vapour. And, moreover,as a dead cat is generally seen swimming on the top of such pools,no one need be endangered by them.The fact that the gypsy and South Slavonian or Hungarian Folkloreis directly derived from classic or Oriental sources is evident fromthe fact that the Shemitic-Persian devil, who is the head and body ofall witchcraft in Western Europe, very seldom appears in that of theEastern parts. The witches there seem invariably to derive their artfrom one another; even in Venice they have no unusual fear of deathor of a future state. A witch who has received the gift or power ofsorcery cannot die till she transfers it to another, and this sheoften finds it difficult to do, as is illustrated by a story told mein Florence in 1886 by the same girl to whom I have already referred.   "There was a girl here in the city who became a witch against her    will. And how? She was ill in a hospital, and by her in a bed was    una vecchia, ammalata gravamente, e non poteva morire--an old    woman seriously ill, yet who could not die. And the old woman    groaned and cried continually, 'Oimé! muoio! A chi lasció? non    diceva che.' 'Alas! to whom shall I leave?'--but she did not say    what. Then the poor girl, thinking of course she meant property,    said: 'Lasciate à me--son tanto povera!' ('Leave it to me--I am    so poor.') At once the old woman died, and 'La povera giovana    se é trovato in eredita delta streghoneria'--the poor girl found    she had inherited witchcraft.   "Now the girl went home, where she lived with her brother and    mother. And having become a witch she began to go out often by    night, which the mother observing, said to her son, 'Qualche volta    tu troverai tua sorella colla pancia grossa.' ('Some day you will    find your sister with child.') 'Don't think such a thing, mamma,'    he replied. 'However, I will find out where it is she goes.'   "So he watched, and one night he saw his sister go out of the    door, sullo punto delta mezza notte--just at midnight. Then he    caught her by the hair, and twisted it round his arm. She began    to scream terribly, when--ecco! there came running a great number    of cats--e cominciarono a miolare, e fare un gran chiasso--they    began to mew and make a great row, and for an hour the sister    struggled to escape--but in vain, for her hair was fast--and    screamed while the cats screeched, till it struck one, when the    cats vanished and the sorella was insensible. But from that time    she had no witchcraft in her, and became a buona donna, or good    girl, as she had been before--'come era prima.'"It is very evident that in this story there is no diabolical agency,and that the witchcraft is simply a quality which is transferred like adisease, and which may be removed. Thus in Venice--where, as is evidentfrom the works of Bernoni, the witches are of Gypsy-Slavic-Greekorigin--a witch loses all her power if made to shed even one drop ofblood, or sometimes if she be defeated or found out to be a witch. Innone of these countries has she received the horrible character ofa mere instrument of a stupendous evil power, whose entire will andwork is to damn all mankind (already full of original sin) to eternaltorture. For this ne plus ultra of horror could only result fromthe Hebrew-Persian conception of perfect malignity, incarnate as ananti-god, and be developed by gloomy ascetics who begrudged mankindevery smile and every gleam of sunlight. In India and Eastern Europethe witch and demon are simply awful powers of nature, like thunderand pestilence, darkness and malaria, they nowhere appear as aiming atdestroying the soul. For such an idea as this it required a theologyand mythology emanating from the basis of an absolutely perfectmonotheos, which gave birth to an antithesis; infinite good, whenconcentrated, naturally suggesting a shadow counterpart of evil. InEastern Europe the witch is, indeed, still confused with the Vila,who was once, and often still is, a benevolent elementary spirit,who often punishes only the bad, and gladly favours the good. It isas curious as it is interesting to see how, under the influence ofthe Church, everything which was not directly connected with thecurrent theology was made to turn sour and bitter and poisonous,and how darkness and frost stole over flowery fields which once weregay in genial sunshine. It is a necessary result that in attaininghigher ideals the lesser must fade or change. Devilism, or the dreadof the child and savage of the powers of darkness and mysterious evil,ends by incarnating all that is painful or terrible in evil spirits,which suggest their opposites. From Devilism results Polytheism,with one leading and good spirit, who in time becomes supreme. Thenwe have Monotheism. But as evil still exists, it is supposed thatthere are innately evil powers or spirits who oppose the good. Byfollowing the same process the leader of these becomes an anti-type,Lucifer, or Satan, or arch-devil, the result being Dualism. In thiswe have a spirit endowed with incredible activity and power, whois only not omnipotent, and whose malignity far transcends anythingattributed to the gods or devils of Polytheism. His constant aim isto damn all mankind to all eternity, and his power is so great thatto save even a small portion of mankind from this fate, God himself,or His own Son, must undergo penance as a man--an idea found in theBuddhism of India. This is all the regular and logical sequence ofFetishism and Shamanism. Witchcraft, and the tales told of it, followin the path of the religion of the age. In the earliest time women wereapparently the only physicians--that is to say magicians--and as manwas in his lowest stage the magic was a vile witchcraft. Then came theShaman--a man who taught in Animism a more refined sorcery, which was,however, as yet the only religion. But the witch still existed, andso she continued to exist, pari passu, through all the developmentsof religion. And to this, day every form and phase of the magicianand witch exist somewhere, it sometimes happening that traces of theearliest and most barbarous sorcery are plain and palpable in themost advanced faith. There may be changes of name and of association,but in simple truth it is all "magic" and nothing else.Gypsy, Hungarian, Slavonian, Indian, and Italian witches, howeverthey may differ from those of Western Europe on theological grounds,agree with them in meeting for the purposes of riotous dancing anddebauchery. It has been observed that this kind of erotic dancingappears to have been cultivated in the East, and even in Europe,from the earliest times, by a class of women who, if not absolutelyproved to be gypsies, had at any rate many points of resemblance withthem. "The Syrian girl who haunts the taverns round," described byVirgil, suggests the Syrian and Egyptian dancer, who is evidently ofIndo-Persian--that is to say of Nuri, or gypsy--origin. The Spanishdancing girls of remote antiquity have been conjectured to havecome from this universal Hindoo Romany stock. I have seen many ofthe Almeh in Egypt--they all seemed to be gypsyish, and many wereabsolutely of the Helebi, Nauar, or Rhagarin stocks. This is indeednot proved--that all the deliberately cultivated profligate dancingof the world is of Indo-Persian, or gypsy origin, but there is agreat deal, a very great deal, which renders it probable. And itis remarkable that it occurred to Pierre Delancre that the Persianballerine had much in common with witches. Now the dancers of Indiaare said to have originated in ten thousand gypsies sent from Persia,and who were of such vagabond habits that they could not be persuadedto settle down anywhere. Of these Delancre says:--   "The Persian girls dance at their sacrifices like witches at    a Sabbat--that is naked--to the sound of an instrument. And    the witches in their accursed assemblies are either entirely    naked or en chemise, with a great cat clinging to their back,    as many have at divers times confessed. The dame called Volta    is the commonest and the most indecent. It is believed that the    devil taught three kinds of dances to the witches of Ginevra, and    these dances were very wild and rude, since in them they employed    switches and sticks, as do those who teach animals to dance.   "And there was in this country a girl to whom the devil had given    a rod of iron, which had the power to make any one dance who    was touched with it. She ridiculed the judges during her trial,    declaring they could not make her die, but they found a way to    blunt her petulance.   "The devils danced with the most beautiful witches, in the form of    a he-goat, or of any other animal, and coupled with them, so that    no married woman or maid ever came back from these dances chaste    as they had gone. They generally dance in a round, back to back,    rarely a solo, or in pairs.   "There are three kinds of witch-dances; the first is the trescone    alia Boema, or the Bohemian rigadoon" (perhaps the polka), "the    second is like that of some of our work-people in the country,    that is to say by always jumping" (this may be like the Tyrolese    dances), "the third with the back turned, as in the second    rigadoon, in which all are drawn up holding one another by the    hand, and in a certain cadence hustling or bumping one another,    deretano contro deretano. These dances are to the sound of a    tambourine, a flute, a violin, or of another instrument which    is struck with a stick. Such is the only music of the Sabbat,    and all witches assert that there are in the world no concerts    so well executed.""A tambourine, a violin, a flute," with perhaps a zimbel, whichis struck with a stick. Does not this describe to perfection gypsymusic, and is not the whole a picture of the wildest gypsy dancingwherever found? Or it would apply to the Hindoo debauches, as stillcelebrated in honour of Sakktya, "the female principle" in India. Inany case the suggestion is a very interesting one, since it leads tothe query as to whether the entire sisterhood of ancient strolling,licentious dancers, whether Syrian, Spanish, or Egyptian, were notpossibly of Indian-gypsy origin, and whether, in their character asfortune-tellers and sorceresses, they did not suggest the dances saidto be familiar to the witches.Mr. David Ritchie, the editor, with Mr. Francis Groome, of theJournal of the Gypsy-Lore Society, has mentioned (vol. i. No. 2)that Klingsohr, a reputed author of the "Nibelungen Lied," wasdescribed as a "Zingar wizard" by Dietrich the Thuringian. Like Odin,this Klingsohr rode upon a wolf--a kind of steed much affected bywitches and sorcerers. There is an old English rhyming romance inwhich a knight is represented as disguising himself as an Ethiopianminstrel. These and other stories--as, for instance, that of SirEstmere--not only indicate a connection between the characters ofminstrel and magician, but suggest that some kind of men from thefar East first suggested the identity between them. Of course therehave been wild dancers and witches, and minstrel-sorcerers, or vates,prophet-poets, in all countries, but it may also be borne in mindthat nowhere in history do we find the female erotic dancer andfortune-teller, or witch, combined in such vast numbers as in Indiaand Persia, and that these were, and are, what may be truly calledgypsies. Forming from prehistoric times a caste, or distinct class,it is very probable that they roamed from India to Spain, possibly hereand there all over Europe. The extraordinary diplomatic skill, energy,and geographic knowledge displayed by the first band of gypsies who,about 1417, succeeded in rapidly obtaining permits for their peopleto wander in every country in Europe except England, indicate greatunity of plan and purpose. That these gypsies, as supposed sorcerers,appearing in every country in Europe, should not have influencedand coloured in some way the conceptions of witchcraft seems to beincredible. If a superstitious man had never before in his life thoughtof witches dancing to the devil's music, it might occur to him whenlooking on at some of the performances of Spanish and Syrian gypsywomen, and if the man had previously been informed--as everybody was inthe fifteenth century or later--that these women were all witches andsorceresses, it could hardly fail to occur to him that it was afterthis fashion that the sisters danced at the Sabbat. Of which opinionall that can be said is, that if not proved it is extremely possible,and may be at least probed and looked into by those of the learnedwho are desirous of clearly establishing all the grounds and originsof ancient religious beliefs and superstitions, in which pies it maybe found that witches and gypsies have had fingers to a far greaterextent than grave historians have ever imagined.The English gypsies believe in witches, among their own people, andit is very remarkable that in such cases at least as I have heard of,they do not regard them as âmes damnées or special limbs of Satan,but rather as some kinds of exceptionally gifted sorceresses ormagicians. They are, however, feared from their supposed power to makemischief. Such a witch may be known by her hair, which is straightfor three or four inches and then begins to curl--like a waterfallwhich comes down smoothly and then rebounds roundly on the rocks. Itmay be here remarked that all this gypsy conception of the witch isdistinctly Hindoo and not in the least European or of Christians, withwhom she is simply a human devil utterly given over to the devil'sdesires. And it is very remarkable that even the English gypsies donot associate such erring sisters--or any other kind--with the devil,as is done by their more cultivated associates.The witch, in gypsy as in other lore, is a haunting terror of thenight. It has not, that I am aware, ever been conjectured that theword Humbug is derived from the Norse hum, meaning night, or shadows(tenebræ) (Jonæo, "Icelandic Latin glossary in Niall's Saga"), andbog, or bogey, termed in several old editions of the Bible a bug, or"bugges." And as bogey came to mean a mere scarecrow, so the hum-buggesor nightly terrors became synonymes for feigned frights. "A humbug,a false alarm, a bug-bear" ("Dean Milles MS." Halliwell). The factthat bug is specially applied to a nocturnal apparition, renders thereason for the addition of hum very evident.There is a great deal that is curious in this word Bogey. Bug-a-boois suggestive of the Slavonian Bog and Buh, both meaning God or aspirit. Boo or bo is a hobgoblin in Yorkshire, so called becauseit is said to be the first word which a ghost or one of his kindutters to a human being, to frighten him. Hence, "he cannot say boto a goose." Hence boggart, bogle, boggle, bo-guest, i.e., bar-geist,boll, boman, and, probably allied, bock (Devon), fear. Bull-beggar isprobably a form of bu and bogey or boge, allied to boll (Northern),an apparition.CHAPTER XI.GYPSY WITCHCRAFT.--THE MAGICAL POWER WHICH IS INNATE IN ALL MENAND WOMEN--HOW IT MAY BE CULTIVATED AND DEVELOPED--THE PRINCIPLESOF FORTUNE-TELLING.Women excel in the manifestation of certain qualities which areassociated with mystery and suggestive of occult influences orpower. Perhaps the reader will pardon me if I devote a few pages towhat I conceive to be, to a certain degree, an explanation of thismagic; though, indeed, it may be justly said that in so doing weonly pass the old boundary of "spiritual" sorcery to find ourselvesin the wider wonderland of Science.Whether it be the action of a faculty, a correlative action of physicalfunctions, or a separate soul in us, the fact is indisputable thatwhen our ordinary waking consciousness or will goes to sleep or rest,or even dozes, that instant an entirely different power takes commandof the myriad forces of memory, and proceeds to make them act, wheel,evolute, and perform dramatic tricks, such as the Common Sense ofour daily life would never admit. This power we call the Dream,but it is more than that. It can do more than make Us, or Me, or theWaking Will, believe that we are passing through fantastic scenes. Itcan remember or revive the memory of things forgotten by us; it can,when he is making no effort, solve for the geometrician problems whichare far beyond his waking capacity--it sometimes teaches the musicianairs such as he could not compose. That is to say, within ourselfthere dwells a more mysterious Me, in some respects a more giftedSelf. There is not the least reason, in the present state of Science,to assume that this is either a "spiritual" being or an action ofmaterial forces. It puzzled Wigan as the dual action of the brain;and a great light is thrown on it by the "Physiology" of Carpenterand the "Memory" of David Kay (one of the most remarkable works ofmodern times), as well as in the "Psycho Therapeutics" of Dr. Tuckey.This power, therefore, knows things hidden from Me, and can do whatI cannot. Let no one incautiously exclaim here that what this reallymeans is, that I possess higher accomplishments which I do not use. Thepower often actually acts against Me--it plays at fast and loose withme--it tries to deceive me, and when it finds that in dreams I havedetected a blunder in the plot of the play which it is spinning, itbrings the whole abruptly to an end with the convulsion of a nightmare,or by letting the curtain fall with a crash, and--scena est deserta--Iam awake! And then "how the phantoms flee--how the dreams depart!" asWestwood writes. With what wonderful speed all is washed away cleanfrom the blackboard! Our waking visions do not fly like this. But--beit noted, for it is positively true--the evanescence of our dreams is,in a vast majority of instances, exactly in proportion to their folly.I am coming to my witchcraft directly, but I pray you have patiencewith my proeme. I wish to narrate a dream which I had a few yearsago (September 5, 1887), which had an intensity of reality. Dreams,you know, reader, vary from rainbow mist to London fog, and so on toclouds, or mud. This one was hard as marble in comparison to most. Afew days previously I had written a letter to a friend, in which Ihad discussed this subject of the dual-Me, and it seemed as if theDream were called forth by it in answer.I thought I was in my bed--a German one, for I was in Homburg vor derHöhe--yet I did not know exactly where I was. I at once perceived theanomaly, and was in great distress to know whether I was awake or in adream. I seemed to be an invalid. I realized, or knew, that in anotherbed near mine was a nurse or attendant. I begged her to tell me if Iwere dreaming, and to awake me if I were. She tried to persuade me thatI was in my ordinary life, awake. I was not at all satisfied. I aroseand went into the street. There I met with two or three common men. Ifelt great hesitation in addressing them on such a singular subject,but told them that I was in distress because I feared that I was ina dream, and begged them to shake or squeeze my arm. I forget whetherthey complied, but I went on and met three gentlemen, to whom I madethe same request. One at once promptly declared that he rememberedme, saying that we had met before in Cincinnatti. He pressed my arm,but it had no effect. I began to believe that I was really awake. Ireturned to the room. I heard a child speaking or murmuring by thenurse. I asked her again to shake my hand. This she did so forciblythat I was now perfectly convinced that it was no dream. And theinstant it came home to me that it was a reality, there seized methe thrill or feeling as of a coming nightmare--and I awoke!Reviewing my dream when awake, I had the deepest feeling of havingbeen joué or played with by a master-mocker. I recalled that, whenI rose in my night-robe from the bed, I did not dress--and yet foundmyself fully dressed when in the street. Then I remembered that whenI returned to America, in 1879, I was in great apprehension lestI should have trouble and delay with our sixteen trunks, becausethere was under my charge a lady who was dying. To my great reliefand amazement, the officer whose duty it was to search claimed me asan old acquaintance, who had met me and T. Buchanan Read, the poet,in Cincinnatti in 1864. But what impressed me most of all, at once,was that the whole was caused by, and was a keen and subtle mockeryof my comments in my letter, of the other Ego, and of its sarcasticpower. For I had been led, step by step, through the extremest doubt,to a full conviction of being awake, and then dismissed, as it were,with a snap or sneer into wakefulness itself!Now this Dream Artist is, to judge by his works, a very differentkind of a person from Me. We are not sympathetic, and herein lies agreat and serious subject of study. "Dreams," says a writer, "are thenovels which we read when we are fast asleep," and, at the risk ofreceiving punishment, I declare that my writer belongs to a school ofnovelists with which I have no feelings in common. If, as everybodyassumes, it is always I who dream--only using other material--howis it that I always invariably disagree with, thwart, contradict,vex, and mock myself? I had rather be hanged and be done with it,before I would wrong my worst enemy with such pitiful, silly, degradingdreams and long-forgotten follies, as I am called on to endure. If thisalter-ego were a lunatic, he could not be a more thoroughly uncongenialinmate of my brain than he often is. Our characters are radicallydifferent. Why has he a mind so utterly unlike mine? His tastes,his thoughts, dispositions, and petty peculiarities are all unlikemine. If we belonged to the same club, I should never talk with him.Now we are coming to our Witchcraft. This alter-ego does not confinehimself to dreams. A lunatic is a man who dreams wide-awake. Hehas lost his will or the controlling power resulting from the justco-relation of brain forces. Then the stored-up images stray outand blend. I have dreamed of telling or seeing things and of actingthem at the same time. A fish and a watch and a man may seem to bethe same thing at once in a dream, as they often are to a wakinglunatic. A poet is a man who dreams wide-awake; but he can guidehis dreams or imaginings to symmetrical form, and to a logicalconclusion or coherence. With the painter and sculptor it is thesame. When the alter-ego works harmoniously with the waking will,we call it Imagination.But when the alter-ego draws decidedly on latent forces, or powersunknown to the waking Me, I am amazed. He does it often enough,that is certain. Then we have Mystery. And it is out of this thatmen have drawn the conclusion that they have two or three souls--anastral spirit, a power of prophecy, the art of leaving the body,and the entire machinery of occultism. Physiology is probably on thehigh road to explain it all, but as yet it is not explained.Meanwhile it steals into our waking life in many ways. It comesin emotions, presentiments, harp tones, mystical conceptions, andminglings of images or ideas, and incomprehensible deductions, whichare sometimes, of course, prophetic. It has nothing in common withcommon sense; therefore it is to some un-common sense, or to othersnon-sense. Sometimes it is one or the other. Agreeable sensations andtheir harmony become the Beautiful. These blend and produce a generalæsthetic sense. It becomes mystical, and is easily worked on by thealter-ego. The most inspired passages of every poet on the beauty ofNature betray clearly the influence and hidden power of the Dreamin waking life. Shelley, Wordsworth, Keats, Byron, were all wakingdreamers de la première force.He who has heard an Æolian harp play--and I have heard the sevenof Justinus Kerner in the old castle of Weibertreu when I was hisguest--if he be a "tone-artist," has often caught series of chordswhich were almost melodies. This music has the same relation todefinite composition which the dream has to waking common sense. Thereare two things which I do not understand. One is, why composers ofmusic make so little use of the suggestive Æolian harp; the secondis, why decorative designers never employ the folding mirror [18]to produce designs. The one is an exact counterpart of the other,and both are capable of revealing inexhaustible harmonies, for bothare deeply in accordance with the evolving processes of Nature.The poetic or artistic faculty is, we therefore assume, the actionon the myriad cells of memory by a strange--sometimes apparentlyinvoluntary--fantastic power, which is at the same time higher andlower than common sense or waking consciousness. Every image whichman has received from sensation lies stored away in a cell, and is,in fact, a memory by itself. There is a faculty of association orsympathy by which groups of these images are called up, and thereis perception which receives them, more or less vividly, like aphotographic plate. When awake, Will, or coherent Common Sense,regulates all this machinery. When asleep, the Images seem to stealout and blend and frisk about by themselves in quaint dances, guidedapparently by a kind of power whom I have conventionally called thealter-ego. This power throws open brain or memory-cells, which wakingCommon Sense has forgotten; in their chaotic or fantastic searchesand mingling they produce poetry; they may chance on prophecy, forif our waking self had at command the immense latent knowledge inwhich these elves revel, it would detect sequences and know to whatmany things would lead, now unto us all unknown.I once knew a nobleman who inherited in Italy a palace which he hadnever seen. There were in it three hundred rooms, and it had belongedto a family which had for six hundred years collected and handeddown to their descendants every kind of object, as if they had beenmagpies or ravens. The heir, as a grave, earnest man, only concernedhimself with the armoury and picture gallery and principal rooms. Buthis young daughter Bertha ranged all over the place and made hundredsof the most singular discoveries. One day she came to me very muchdelighted. She had found an obscure room or garret, in which therewere ranged about on shelves, "sitting up and all looking at her,"several hundred old dolls and marionettes. For two hundred years ormore the family had kept its old dolls. In this case the father wasthe waking reason, the rooms the brain cells, and Bertha the sprite whoranges over all and knows where to find forgotten images in store. Manyof those whom we meet in dreams are like the ghosts of dolls.This is the only true Night side of Nature, but its shadows and duskytwilight, and strangely-hued chiaroscuros and long pauses of gloom,come constantly into the sunlight of our waking life. Some liveshave too much of it, some too little. Some receive it in coarse andevil forms, as lunatics, and sufferers from mania à potu; some cannypeople--happy Scotchmen, for instance--succeed in banishing it fromlife as nearly as is possible for a human being to do. Now to speakclearly, and to recapitulate distinctly, I set forth the followingpropositions:--I. We have a conscious will which, whether it be an independentincomprehensible spirit, or simply the correlative result or action ofall our other brain powers, exists, and during our waking hours directsour thoughts and acts. While it is at work in the world with socialinfluences, its general tendency is towards average common sense.II. This conscious will sleeps when we sleep. But the collective imageswhich form memory, each being indeed a separate memory, as an aggregateof bees' cells form a comb, are always ready to come forth, just ashoney is always sweet, limpid, and fluid. There is between them allan associative faculty, or a strange and singular power, which beginsto act when the will sleeps. Whether it be also an independent Selfwhich plays capriciously while conscious will sleeps, or a result ofcorrelated forces, it is not as yet possible to determine. What we knowis, that it calls forth the images by association, and in a fantastic,capricious manner, imitates and combines what we have experienced,or read, or thought, during our waking hours.III. Our waking will can only realize or act on such images as ithas kept familiarly before it, or such as have been so often recalledthat they recur spontaneously. But all the treasures of memory seemto be available to the dream ruler, and with them a loose facilepower of grouping them into kaleidoscopic combinations. Thus, if onecould imagine a kaleidoscope which at every turn made varied groupsof human or other figures in different attitudes, with changingscenery; and then suppose this to be turned round by some simplevital or mechanical action, he would have an idea of the action ofdreams. It is probable that the radical function of the dream-poweris to prevent images from becoming utterly forgotten or rusty; and byexercising the faculty of facile or chance combination to keep awakein man originality and creativeness. For it is almost certain that,but for the intrusion of this faculty into our waking thoughts, manwould become a mere animal, without an idea beyond the joint commonappetites, instincts, and emotions of the lowest of his kind.IV. The dream-power intrudes more or less into all waking life. Then itacts, though irregularly, yet in harmony, with conscious will. When itis powerful and has great skill in forming associations of images--andby images I mean, with Kay, "ideas"--and can also submit these towaking wisdom, the result is poetry or art. In recalling strange,beautiful images, and in imagining scenes, we partly lapse intodreaming; in fact, we do dream, though conscious will sits by usall the time and even aids our work. And most poets and artists,and many inventors, will testify that, while imagining or inventing,they abstract the "mind" from the world and common-place events,seek calm and quiet, and try to get into a "brown study," which is awaking dream. That is to say, a condition which is in some respectsanalogous to sleep is necessary to stimulate the flow and combinationof images. This brown study is a state of mind in which images flowand blend and form new shapes far more easily than when Will and Reasonhave the upper hand. For they act only in a conventional beaten track,and deal only with the known and familiar.V. Magic is the production of that which is not measured by thecapacity of the conscious working will. The dream spirit, or thatwhich knows all our memories, and which combines, blends, separates,scatters, unites, confuses, intensifies, beautifies, or makes terribleall the persons, scenes, acts, events, tragedies, or comedies knownto us, can, if it pleases, by instantaneous reasoning or intuition,perceive what waking common sense does not. We visit a sick man, andthe dream spirit, out of the inexhaustible hoards of memory aided byassociation, which results in subtle, occult reasoning, perceives thatthe patient will die in a certain time, and this result is served upin a dramatic dream. The amount of miracles, mysteries, apparitions,omens, and theurgia which the action of these latent faculties cause,or seem to cause, is simply illimitable, for no man knows how much heknows. Few, indeed, are the ordinary well-educated Europeans of averageexperience of life, whose memories are not inexhaustible encyclopædias,and whose intellects are not infinite; if all that is really in themcould be wakened from slumber, "know thyself" would mean "know theuniverse." Now, there are people who, without being able to say why,are often inspired by this power which intuitively divines or guesseswithout revealing the process to common sense. They look into theeye of a person--something in glances and tones, gestures, mien, andaddress, suggests at once an assertion or a prediction which proves tobe true. Considering that the dream-power has millions of experiencesor images at its command, that it flits over them all like lightning,that it can combine, abstract, compare, and deduct, that it being,so to speak, more of a thaumaturgical artist than anything else,excels waking wisdom in subtle trickery, the wonder is, not that weso often hear of marvellous, magical, inexplicable wonders, but thatthey are not of daily or hourly occurrence. When we think of what wemight be if we could master ourselves, and call on the vast sea ofknowledge which is in the brain of every one who reads these lines,to give strict reckoning of its every wave and every drop of water,and every shell, pebble, wreck, weed, or grain of sand over which itrolls, and withal master the forces which make its tides and storms,then we may comprehend that all the wonder-working power attributedto all the sorcerers of olden time was nothing compared to what wereally have within us.It is awful, it is mysterious, it is terrible to learn this tremendoustruth that we are indeed within ourselves magicians gifted withinfinite intellectual power--which means the ability to know and doall things. In the past men surmised the existence of this infinitememory, this power of subtle research and combination, but betweenthem and the truth in every land and time interposed the idea ofobjective spiritual or supernatural existences whose aid or mediumwas necessary to attain to wisdom. Outside of us was always SomebodyElse to be invoked, conciliated, met in vision or trance, united toin spiritual unity or syncope. Sometimes they hit upon some form ofhypnotism or mesmerism, opiates or forced swoons and convulsions,and so extorted from the nerves and dream-power some of their secretswhich were all duly attributed to the "spirits." But in the wholerange of occult literature from Hermes Trismegistus down to MadameBlavatsky there is not a shade of a suspicion that all the absolutelyauthentic marvels of magic began and ended with man himself.Least of all did any speculator yet conjecture how to set forthon the path which leads us to this wonderland. For there is a wayto it, and a power to master the infinite stores of memory andrender the dream-power a willing servant, if we take the pains todo it. Firstly--as may be found asserted, and I think fairly proved,in my work on "Practical Education," and in the "Memory of David Kay"(London, 1888)--every child by a very easy gradual process, simply thatof learning by heart, and reviewing, can develope its memory to such adegree that all which that child reads, hears, or sees can be literallyretained for life. Secondly, quickness of perception, which is alliedto memory, can be taught so as to develope intuitive observationand intelligence to an equally incredible extent. Thirdly--and forthis I have had abundant personal experience--every child can learnDesign and the Minor Arts or develope the Constructive faculties,and by doing this alone a pupil becomes exceptionally clever in allstudies. The proof of this is that the 200 pupils who attended anindustrial or art school in Philadelphia took precedence in studiesamong 110,000 others in the public schools.If all the stores of our memory were distinctly cognized by our wakingwill when they first came into our possession, we should have the firstgreat element of power beyond all our present dreams of greatness. Thatthis can be done has been recognized by many of the most advancedthinkers of the day. If a child be trained to exercise quickness ofperception so that at last it observes and remembers everything--andexperiment has proved this also--it will make the Dream Power awaking power absolutely in harmony and accordance with waking wisdomor conscious will. For the reason why the capricious, wild, strangefitful faculty has always remained foreign to us, is because in allour culture we have never sought to subdue and train the powers alliedto it. Catch and tame one water-fairy, says the Red Indian legend,and you may get all her sisters. Waking quickness of perception isa wonderful ability. It can be trained to flit like lightning overillimitable fields of thought (supplied by a vast memory), and withthem it spontaneously developes comparison and deduction. Now all ofthis is marvellously akin to the habitual action of the dream powerplus that of reflection. And it is not possible to conceive that withwaking quickness of perception, or voluntary subtlety of thought,cultivated in infancy to the highest power, its twin which sports insleep should not feel its influence and act under it.The result of this culture would inevitably be that the marvels,mysteries, and magic as they seem to us of the dream, or intuitivepower, would be perfectly under our waking control, or to such anextent that we could secure all that is profitable in them. It is avery curious fact that while Reflection or Waking Wisdom slumbers,Quickness of Perception or Perception and Association seem tobe always awake--in dreams or waking. A very extended series ofobservations has convinced me that the acquisition of a very greatdegree of Observation itself, or of Attention, is as possible as tolearn French, and no harder; yet as a branch of study it literallydoes not exist. As a writer in the New York Tribune remarks: "In fact,observation is almost an atrophied faculty, and when a writer practisesit for the purposes of his art, we regard the matter as in some sensewonderful." Interest, as Maudsley has shown, is a natural result ofAttention, and the two generate Will. Whether we can actually controlthe Dream-power is not as yet proved by experiment. All that we cansay is that it is probable. But that this power manifests itself inwaking hours when it submits to Reflection, is an established fact. Itshows itself in all imagination, in all originality, brave art or"fantasy." Therefore it is no extravagant deduction to conclude thatall of its action which now seems so wonderful, and which has furnishedthe ground-work for what we call magic, is perfectly within our grasp,and may be secured by simple methods of training which require onlyperseverance to perfect them.The gypsy fortune-teller is accustomed for years to lookkeenly and earnestly into the eyes of those whom she dukkers or"fortune-tells." She is accustomed to make ignorant and credulousor imaginative girls feel that her mysterious insight penetrates"with a power and with a sign" to their very souls. As she looks intotheir palms, and still more keenly into their eyes, while conversingvolubly with perfect self-possession, ere long she observes that shehas made a hit--has chanced upon some true passage or relation to thegirl's life. This emboldens her. Unconsciously the Dream Spirit, or theAlter-Ego, is awakened. It calls forth from the hidden stores of Memorystrange facts and associations, and with it arises the latent and oftenunconscious quickness of Perception, and the gypsy actually apprehendsand utters things which are "wonderful." There is no clairvoyance,illumination or witchcraft in such cases. If such powers existedas they are generally understood to do, we should for one case ofcurious prediction hear of twenty thousand. But the Dream-power isat best fitful, irregular and fantastic in its action; it is at alltimes untrustworthy, for it has never been trained unless of yore byChaldæan priests and magi. In some wonderful way facts do, however,manifest themselves, evoked out of the unknown by "occult," thoughpurely material, mental faculties; and the result is that wonder at theinexplicable--which makes miracles--until we are accustomed to them.That gypsy women often do surmise or arrive at very curious andstartling truths I know by my own experience, and also know that Imyself when reading character in people's hands according to the lawslaid down in books on chiromancy, when I have felt deeply interested,or as one may say excited or inspired, and have gone a little beyondmere description into conjecture and deduction, have been amazed atmy own successes. It happened once that when in company with severalladies it was proposed after lunch to go to a gypsy camp on theThames, and have fortunes told. Among these ladies was one of a veryimaginative temperament, who had not only lived many years in the East,but had resided several winters as a guest in Arab families. As shewas very much disappointed at not finding the gypsies, I offered totell her fortune by onomancy, i.e., by taking the letters of her nameaccording to numbers, and deducing from them her past and future. ThisI did in a most reckless manner, freely setting down whatever came intomy mind. It seems to me now that a kind of inspiration suggested whatI wrote and predicted. What was my amazement to hear the lady declarethat all which had been written as to her past life was literally true,and I saw that she was simply awed at my supposed power of prediction,and had the fullest faith in what I had declared as regarded thefuture. What I had intended for a jest or mere entertainment turnedout to be serious enough. And reflecting on the evil consequencesof such belief on a person who naturally attributed it all to magic,I deeply regretted what I had done, and have not since attempted anyrenewal of such oracle-work. It had previously occurred that I wroteout such a prediction for another lady which I did not clearly explainto her, but in which there was a regular recurrence and repetitionof something unfortunate. This was shown in after years, and thetroubles all came to pass as I had written. Now the more I studiedthis case the more I was convinced that it was based on unconsciousobservation, comparison, and deduction. Fichte has said that no birdcan fly beyond itself, but the mind sometimes does actually precedeits own conscious reasoning and throw back facts to it.It may be urged by those who still cling to the old-fashioned fetishof a distinction between Spirit and Matter, that this explanation ofpredictions, oracles, and insight, is simply materialistic and utterlydestructive of all the poetry, grandeur, and beauty which is associatedwith mysterious divination. But for those who believe with Maudsley,et sui generis, that all such distinctions are not seriously worthconsidering, and to him who can rise to the great philosophy nowdawning on the world, there is perceptible in it something far morewonderful and poetical, beautiful and even awful, than ever was knownto any occultist of old--for it is scientific and true. It is also truethat man can now talk across the world and hear all sounds conveyedto him through the depths of ocean. He can catch these sounds andkeep them for centuries. How long will it be before sights, scents,and tastes will be thus transferred, and the man sitting in Londonwill see all things passing in Asia, or wherever it pleases him or anagent to turn a mirror on a view? It will be. [19] Or how long beforethe discovery of cheap and perfect aerial navigation will change allsociety and annihilate national distinctions? That, too, will be. Theseand a thousand stranger discoveries will during the ensuing centuryburst upon the world, changing it utterly. We go on as of old in ourlittle petty narrow grooves, declaring that this will be, and that willnever come to pass, and that this or that kind of hop-scotch lines,and tip-cat and marbles rules, are the eternal laws of humanity,and lo! all the while in his study some man whom you regard as adreamer or dolt is preparing that which will be felt forever.One of these great discoveries, and that not the least, will be thedevelopment and mastery of memory and perception, attention, interest,and will in children, with the constructive faculty which stimulatesthe whole by means of easy gradual series of instructions. Whenthis system shall be perfected, we shall advance to understanding,controlling, and disciplining the subtler and stranger powers of thebrain, which now puzzle us as dreams, intuitions, poetic inspiration,and prophecy. But this prophecy comes not from it, nor from any vagueguessing or hoping. It is based on facts and on years of carefulstudy of a thousand children's minds, and from a conviction derivedfrom calm observation, that the powers of the human mind are infiniteand capable of being developed by science. And they will be!There is very little knowledge among gypsies of real chiromancy, suchas is set forth in the literature of occult or semi-occult science. Twocenturies ago, when chiromancy was studied seriously and thoroughlyby learned and wise men, the latter compared thousands of hands,and naturally enough evolved certain truths, such as you, reader,would probably evolve for yourself if you would do the same. Firstlythey observed, as you may do, that the hand of a boor is not markedlike that of a gentleman, nor that of an ignoramus like the palm ofan artist or scholar. The line which indicates brain is on an averageshorter in women than in men; in almost every instance certain signsinfallibly indicate great sensuality, Others show a disposition todreaminess, sentimentalism, the occult. Now as Love, Wisdom, Strengthof Will, or Inertness, are associable with Venus, Apollo, Jupiter,or Saturn, and as astrology was then seriously believed in, it cameto pass that the signs of chiromancy were distributed to the sevenplanets, and supposed to be under their dominion. It was an error, butafter all it amounts to a mere classification. Properly considered,the names Jupiter, Saturn, Apollo, Mercury, Venus, and Mars are onlysynonymes of qualities, meaning masculine virtue and character,aptitude, art, cleverness, sexual passion, and combativeness. Hewho would, without a trace of superstition, analyze and describemany hands compared with the characters of their owners, would adopteffectively the same arrangement.When we remember the age in which they lived and the popular yearningfor wonders and marvels which then characterized even the wisest men,the old chiromancers were singularly free from superstition. Therewere many among them who would have regarded with supreme contempta Desbarolles, with his fortune-telling for twenty francs.To these truly honest men, the gypsies, with their pretendedchiromancy, were at first a great puzzle. The learned Prætorius, inhis vast work on Chiromancy and Physiognomy, devotes seventy-fivepages to this "foreign element in our midst," and comes to theconclusion that they are humbugs. They do not know the lines--theyknow nothing. The intrusion of the latent powers of the mind had noplace in the philosophy of Prætorius, therefore he did not perceivethe back door by which the Romany slipped into the oracle. Yetthere is abundant evidence even in his own valuable collection ofthe works of his predecessors, that many of them when tempted frommerely describing character to straying into prophecy, were guided bysomething more mysterious than the laws of the lines of life, of thehead, heart, the circle of Venus, the "hepatic," and viâ lactea. TheHungarian gypsies have a system of chiromancy of their own which thereader may find in the book "Vom Wandernden Zigeunervolke," by Dr. vonWlislocki, Hamburg, 1890. I had translated this and more of the kindfor this chapter, but omitted it, thinking, firstly, that its placeis supplied by more important matter; and, secondly, because it is,save as perhaps indicative of Indian origin, quite valueless, beingmerely of the prophetic kind.I have more than once known gypsies to tell me things of my past lifewhich were certainly remarkable, bewildering, or inexplicable. And forthe ordinary seeker of "voonders oopon voonders" it is all-sufficientthat a thing shall be beyond clear intelligence. "How do you explainthat?" is their crucial question, and their cry of triumph whenrelating some case of an authentic apparition, a spiritual featof thaumaturgy, or a dream fulfilled. In fact they would rathernot have it explained. I well remember how Professor Joseph Henry,when lecturing on natural science, narrated to us, his hearers, howwhen he told certain people how certain tricks of a common conjurorwere executed, they all protested that it could not be the way itwas done. They did not wish to be disillusioned. Raise a man fromthe dead, make him fly through the air, and it is for everybody amiracle. Give them the power to do the same, and in a month's timeit will be no longer miraculous, but something "in the due course ofnature." And what single fact is there in the due course of naturewhich is not as inexplicable if we seek for a full explanation ofit? Consider this thing every day till you are penetrated with it,bear it in mind constantly, and in due time all phenomena willbe miracles. We can apparently get a little nearer to the causesand give our discoveries names, but the primal causes as constantlyrecede and are continually buried in deeper mystery. But with mostpeople names pass for explanations."Can you tell me what a hypothesis is?" asked a young gentleman at adinner party of a friend who passed for being well-informed. "Hush,"was the reply. "Not now--ladies present.""Mon caporal," asked a French soldier, "can you tell me what ismeant by an equilateral?" "Certainly--mais d'abord--do you knowHebrew?" "No." "Ah, then it would be impossible to explain it to you.""What is it that makes people's heads ache?" inquired an old ladyof a youth who had just begun his medical studies. "Oh, it is onlythe convolution of the anomalies of the ellipsoid," replied thestudent. "Just see now what it is to git larnin!" commented thedame. "He knows it all in a straight line?"The one is satisfied that a hypothesis is something improper, theother that an equilateral is a matter which he might understand ifhe were as learned as his corporal, and the third is pleased to findthat the mystery has at least a name. And human beings are satisfiedin the same way as to the mysteries of Nature. Give them a name andassure them that the learned understand it, and they are satisfied.It is a fundamental principle of human folly to assume that anyalleged marvel is a "violation of the laws of Nature," or the work ofsupernatural influences, until it is proved not to be such. Naturecannot be violated. She is ever virgin. And "how do you account forthat?" is always assumed to be a test question. It cannot be deniedthat in almost every case, the narrator assumes the absolute truthof all which he states, when, as is well known, even in the mostcommonplace incidents of ordinary life, such truth can very rarely beobtained. Secondly, he assumes that all the persons who were cognizantof the miracle, or were concerned in it, were not only perfectlytruthful, but endowed with perfect perfections, and absolutely soundjudgments. If there is the least shadow of a possibility that oneof them could have erred in the least particular, the whole mustfall to the ground as a proof or test--for we must have irrefragibleand complete evidence before we adopt a faith on which all our lifemay depend. But, thirdly, by asking any one to account for a marvel,he assumes that the one thus called on knows everything short of thesupernatural or Infinite, which is simply silly.But there is a higher source of admiration and wonder than couldever be established by vulgar fetish, Animism, or supernaturalism,and this is to be found in the mysteries of Nature which man has neverpenetrated, and which, as soon as they are overcome, reveal others fargrander or deeper. Thus as Alps rise beyond Alps, and seas of starsand solar systems spread in proportions of compound multiplication,our powers of vision increase. And it often happens to him who looksdeeply into causes, that one of the myriad test cases of so-called"supernaturalism," when it has ignominiously broken down--as all dosooner or later--often reveals a deeper marvel or mystery than itwas intended to support. Thus some Red Indians in North America,on being told how certain juggling tricks which they had acceptedfor magic were performed, calmly replied that it did not make theleast difference--that a man must have been a magician (or divinelyinspired) to be able to find out such tricks. And I myself knew anIndian trader named Ross, who, being once among a wild tribe, put ona mask of papier maché, which caused tremendous excitement and awe,which was not in the least diminished when he took it off and put itinto their hands and explained its nature, for they maintained thatthe thing which could cause such terror indicated the existence ofsuperior mental power, or magic, in the maker. In which there is,as it seems to me, indications of a much higher wisdom or sagacitythan is to be found in the vulgar spiritualist who takes the event orthing itself for the miracle, and who, when found out in his tricks,ignominiously collapses.The conclusion from all this is, that I have seen and heard of muchin gypsy witchcraft and fortune-telling which, while it was directlyallied to humbug of the shallowest kind, also rested on, or wasinspired by, mental action or power which, in our present state ofknowledge, must be regarded as strangely mysterious and of the deepestinterest. And this is indeed weird, in the fullest and truest sense,since it is used for prophecy. I will now endeavour to illustrate this.It is but natural that there should be "something in" gypsyfortune-telling. If the reader were to tell ten fortunes a day fortwenty years it would be very remarkable indeed if in that time he hadnot learned some things which would seem wonderful to the world. Hewould detect at a glance the credulous, timid, bold, doubtful, refinedor vulgar nature, just as a lawyer learns to detect character bycross-examination. Many experiments of late years have gone very farto establish the existence of a power of divining or reading thought;how this is really done I know not; perhaps the experts in it are asignorant as I am, but it is very certain that certain minds, in some(as yet) marvellous way, betray their secrets to the master. Thatthere are really gypsies who have a very highly cultivated faculty ofreading the mind by the eye is certainly true. Sometimes they seem tobe themselves uncertain, and see as through a glass darkly, and willreveal remarkable facts doubtfully. I remember a curious illustrationof this. Once I was walking near Bath, and meeting a tinker asked himif there were any gypsies in the vicinity. He gave me the addressof a woman who lived in a cottage at no great distance. I found itwith some trouble, and was astonished on entering at the abominablymiserable, reckless, squalid appearance of everything. There was ahalf or quarter-bred gypsy woman, ragged, dirty, and drunk, a swarmof miserable children, and a few articles of furniture misplacedor upset as if the inmates had really no idea of how a room shouldbe lived in. I addressed the woman civilly, but she was too vulgarand degraded to be capable of sensible or civil conversation witha superior. Such people actually exist among the worst class ofvagabonds. But as I, disgusted, was about to leave, and gave her asmall gratuity, she offered to tell my fortune, which I declined,whereupon she cried, "You shall see that I know something;" andcertainly told me something which astonished me, of an event whichhad taken place two years before at a great distance. To test her Icoolly denied it all, at which she seemed astonished and bewildered,saying, "Can I have made a mistake? You are certainly the person." Allof this may be explained by causes which I shall set forth. But itcannot be too earnestly insisted on to people who habitually doubt,that because a thing can be explained in a certain way (i.e., byhumbug) that it necessarily follows that that is the only explanationof it. Yet this is at the present day actually and positively thepopular method, and it obtains very largely indeed with the smallcritics of the "safe school." Mrs. Million has diamonds; she may havestolen them--a great many people have stolen diamonds--therefore sheis probably a thief. The Icelandic sagas describe journies to America;but the writers of the sagas were often mythical, exaggerative, andinaccurate--therefore all they narrate as regards America must be,of course, untrue.    Jack Stripe    Eats tripe,    It is therefore credible    That tripe is edible;    And it follows perforce,    As a matter of course,    That the devil will gripe    All who do not eat tripe.But I do not insist that there is anything "miraculous" in gypsyfortune-telling. It may be merely the result of great practicalexperience and of a developed intuition, it may be mind or"thought-reading"--whatever that really is--or it may result fromfollowing certain regular rules. This latter method will be pronouncedpure humbug, but of that I will speak anon. These rules followed byanybody, even the feeblest dilettante who has only read Desbarollesfor drawing-room entertainment, will often astonish the dupe. They are,"in few," as follows:--    1. It is safe in most cases with middle-aged men to declare that    they have had a law-suit, or a great dispute as to property, which    has given them a great deal of trouble. This must be impressively    uttered. Emphasis and sinking the voice are of great assistance    in fortune-telling. If the subject betray the least emotion,    or admit it, promptly improve the occasion, express sympathy,    and "work it up."    2. Declare that a great fortune, or something greatly to the    advantage of the subject, or something which will gratify him,    will soon come in his way, but that he must be keen to watch his    opportunity and be bold and energetic.    3. He will have three great chances, or fortunes, in his life. If    you know that he has inherited or made a fortune, or had a good    appointment, you may say that he has already realized one of    them. This seldom fails.    4. A lady of great wealth and beauty, who is of singularly    sympathetic disposition, is in love with him, or ready to be,    and it will depend on himself to secure his happiness. Or he will    soon meet such a person when he shall least expect it.    5. "You had at one time great trouble with your relations (or    friends). They treated you very unkindly." Or, "They were prepared    to do so, but your resolute conduct daunted them."    6. "You have been three times in great danger of death." Pronounce    this very impressively. Everybody, though it be a schoolboy    believes, or likes to believe, that he has encountered perils. This    is infallible, or at least it takes in most people. If the subject    can be induced to relate his hairbreadth escapes, you may foretell    future perils.    7. "You have had an enemy who has caused you great trouble. But    he--or she--it is well not to specify which till you find out the    sex--will ere long go too far, and his or her effort to injure you    will recoil on him or her." Or, briefly, "It is written that some    one, by trying to wrong you, will incur terrible retribution." Or,    "You have had enemies, but they are all destined to come to    grief." Or, "You had an enemy but you outlived him."    8. "You got yourself once into great trouble by doing a good act."    9. "Your passions have thrice got you into great trouble. Once    your inconsiderate anger (or pursuit of pleasure) involved you in    great suffering which, in the end, was to your advantage." Or else,    "This will come to pass; therefore be on your guard."    10. "You will soon meet with a person who will have a great    influence on your future life if you cultivate his friendship. You    will ere long meet some one who will fall in love with you,    if encouraged."    11. "You will find something very valuable if you keep your eyes    open and watch closely. You have twice passed over a treasure    and missed it, but you will have a third opportunity."    12. "You have done a great deal of good, or made the fortune or    prosperity of persons who have been very ungrateful."    13. "You have been involved in several love affairs, but your    conduct in all was really perfectly blameless."    14. "You have great capacity for something, and before long    an occasion will present itself for you to exert it to your    advantage."By putting these points adroitly, and varying or combining them,startling cases of conviction may be made. Yet even into this deceptionwill glide intuition, or the inexplicable insight to character,and the deceiver himself be led to marvel, so true is it that he whoflies from Brama goes towards him, let him do what he will, for Truthis everywhere, and even lies lead to it.The reader has often seen in London Italian women who have small birds,generally parrakeets, or paraquitos, which will for a penny pick outfor her or for him slips of paper on which is printed a "fortune." Ifhe will invest his pence in these he will in most instances findthat they "fit his case" exactly, because they are framed on theseor other rules, which are of very general application. There was,in 1882, an Italian named Toricelli. Whether he was a descendant ofthe great natural philosopher of the same name who discovered the lawof the vacuum I do not know, but he certainly exhibited--generallyin Piccadilly--an ingenious application of it. He had a long glasscylinder, filled with water, in which there was a blown glass imageof an imp. By pressing his hand on the top of the cover of the tubethe folletto or diavoletto was made to rise or fall--from which theprediction was drawn. It will hardly be believed, but the unfortunateToricelli was actually arrested by the police and punished for"fortune-telling." [20] After this he took to trained canaries orparrakeets, which picked out printed fortunes, for a living. Whetherthe stern arm of British justice descended on him for this latterform of sorcery and crime I do not know.   "Forse fu dal demonio trasportato,    Fiancheggiandosi del' autorita    Di Origene o di San Girolamo."Now it may be admitted that to form such rules (and there are manymore far more ingenious and generally applicable) and to put them intopractice with tact, adapting them to intuitions of character, not onlyas seen in the face but as heard in the voice or betrayed by gesturesand dress and manner, must in the end develop a power. And, furtherstill, this power by frequent practice enables its possessor to performfeats which are really marvellous and perhaps inexplicable, as yet,to men of science. I have, I think, indicated the road by which theytravel to produce this result, but to what they arrived I do not know.Nor do they all get there. What genius is, physiology, with all thevast flood of light spread by Francis Galton on hereditary gifts,cannot as yet explain. It is an absolute thing of itself, and a"miracle." Sometimes this wonderful power of prediction and of readingthought and quickly finding and applying rules falls into the handsof a genius. Then all our explanations of "humbug" and "trickery"and juggling fall to the ground, because he or she works what areabsolutely as much miracles as if the artist had raised the dead. Suchgeniuses are the prophets of old; sometimes they are poets. Thereare as many clearly-defined and admirable predictions as to eventsin art and politics in the works of Heine, which were fulfilled,as can be found anywhere.By the constant application of such rules, promptly and aptly,or boldly, the fortune-teller acquires a very singular quickness ofperception. There are very few persons living who really know what thismeans and to what apparently marvellous results constant practice in itmay lead. Beginning with very simple and merely mechanical exercises("Practical Education," p. 151. London: Whittaker & Co.), perceptionmay be gradually developed until not only the eye and ear observea thousand things which escape ordinary observation, and also many"images" at once, but finally the mind notes innumerable traits ofcharacter which would have once escaped it, combines these, and in asecond draws conclusions which would amuse those who are ignorant--asindeed all men are as yet--of the extraordinary faculties latent inevery man.I beg the reader to pay special attention to this fact. There isnothing in all the annals of prophecy, divination, fortune-telling, orprediction, which is nearly so wonderful as what we may all do if wewould by practice and exercise bring out of ourselves our own innatepower of perception. This is not an assertion based on metaphysicaltheory; it is founded on fact, and is in strict accordance with thesoundest conclusions of modern physiology. By means of it, joinedto exercises in memorizing, all that there is in a child of ordinaryintellect may be unerringly drawn out; and when in due time knowledgeor information is gradually adduced, there is perhaps no limit towhat that intellect may become. The study, therefore, of quicknessof perception, as set forth or exercised in gypsy fortune-telling,is indeed curious; but to the far-reaching observer who is interestedin education it is infinitely more useful, for it furnishes proof ofthe ability latent in every mind to perform what appear to be more thanfeats of intelligence or miracles, yet which often are all mere triflescompared to what man could effect if he were properly trained to it.Sorcery! We are all sorcerers, and live in a wonderland of marveland beauty if we did but know it. For the seed sprouting from theground is as strange a truth as though we saw the hosts of heavensweeping onward in glory, or could commune with fairies, or raisefrom his grave the master magician of song who laid a curse on allwho should dig his dust. But like children who go to sleep in thegrand opera, and are wild with delight at Punch, we turn aside fromthe endless miracle of nature to be charmed and bewildered with thepetty thaumaturgy of guitars in the dark, cigarettes, and rope-tying,because it corresponds to and is miracle enough for us. And perhaps itis as well; for much thought on the Infinites made Jean Paul Richterand Thomas Carlyle half mad and almost unfit for common life. Seektruth in Science and we shall be well balanced in the little as wellas the great.CHAPTER XII.FORTUNE-TELLING (continued).--ROMANCE BASED ON CHANCE, OR HOPE, ASREGARDS THE FUTURE--FOLK- AND SORCERY-LORE--AUTHENTIC INSTANCES OFGYPSY PREDICTION.It would seem to all who now live that life would be reallyintolerably dry were it utterly deprived of mystery, marvel, orromance. This latter is the sentiment of hopeful chance allied tothe beautiful. Youth is willing or eager to run great risks if theroad to or through them passes by dark ravines, under castled rocks--          "o'er dewy grass    And waters wild and fleet"--and ever has been from the beginning. Now, it is a matter of seriousimportance to know whether this romance is so deeply inherent inman that it can never be removed. For, rightly viewed, it meanscurrent religion, poetry, and almost all art--as art at least wasonce understood--and it would seem as if we had come, or are coming,to a time when science threatens to deprive us of it all. Such isthe hidden fear of many a priest and poet--it may be worth while toconsider whether it is all to pass away into earnest prose or assumenew conditions. Has the world been hitherto a child, or a youth,were poetry and supernaturalism its toys, and has the time come whenit is to put away childish things?We can only argue from what we are, and what we clearly know orunderstand. And we know that there are in Nature, though measuredby the senses alone, phenomena which awake delightful or terrible,sublime or beautiful, grave or gay feelings, or emotions, which inspirecorresponding thoughts. There is for us "an elf-home glory-land,"far over setting suns, mysterious beauty in night and stars intheir eternal course, grandeur of God in the ocean, loveliness inwoman, chiaroscuro in vapoury valleys and the spray of waterfallsby moonlight, exciting emotions which are certainly not within thedomain of science--as yet--and which it is impossible for us, as weare at present constituted, to imagine as regarded entirely from thestandpoint of chemical and physical analysis. To see in all this--as weare--only hydro-carbons, oxygen, silex and aluminium, atoms, molecules,and "laws"--that is to say, always the parts and combinations and nosense as regards man that he is, with his emotional sense of beauty,anywhere in the game or of any account--is going far too far. Settingteleology and theology entirely aside, Man, as the highest organism,has a right to claim that, as the highest faculties which have beenas yet developed in him were caused by natural phenomena, thereforethere is in the phenomena a certain beauty which is far more likelyto lead to more advanced enjoyment of form, colour, or what we callthe æsthetic sense, than to shrink away and disappear. And it seemsto me that the most extended consideration of science leads to theresult or conclusion that under its influence we shall find that thechemical and physical analyses of which I have spoken are only thedry A B C of a marvellously grand literature, or of a Romance andPoetry and Beauty--perhaps even of a wondrous "occult" philosophy,of whose beginning even we have, as yet, no idea.But, great as it may be, those who will make it must derive theirsummary of facts or bases of observation from the past, and thereforeI urge the importance of every man who can write doing what he canto collect all that illustrates Humanity as it is and as it was inby-gone ages. It hath not entered into the heart of man to conceivewhat a Folk-lore or ethnological society in ancient Greece, Rome,or Egypt might not have collected and preserved for the delight ofevery civilized human being of the present d
