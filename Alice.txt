; or inasmuch as the balance of what isgiven is in equilibrium with what is returned: and it is this equality,this equilibrium which is called justice, equity;* that is to say thatequality and justice are but one and the same word, the same lawof nature, of which the social virtues are only applications andderivatives.     * Aequitas, aequilibrium, aequalitas, are all of the same     family.CHAPTER XII.DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIAL VIRTUES.Q. Explain how the social virtues are derived from the law of nature.How is charity or the love of one's neighbor a precept and applicationof it?A. By reason of equality and reciprocity; for when we injure another,we give him a right to injure us in return; thus, by attacking theexistence of our neighbor, we endanger our own, from the effect ofreciprocity; on the other hand, by doing good to others, we have roomand right to expect an equivalent exchange; and such is the character ofall social virtues, that they are useful to the man who practises them,by the right of reciprocity which they give him over those who arebenefited by them.Q. Charity is then nothing but justice?A. No: it is only justice; with this slight difference, that strictjustice confines itself to saying, "Do not to another the harm you wouldnot wish he should do to you;" and that charity, or the love of one'sneighbor, extends so far as to say, "Do to another the good which youwould wish to receive from him." Thus when the gospel said, that thisprecept contained the whole of the law and the prophets, it announcednothing more than the precept of the law of nature.Q. Does it enjoin forgiveness of injuries?A. Yes, when that forgiveness implies self-preservation.Q. Does it prescribe to us, after having received a blow on one cheek,to hold out the other?A. No; for it is, in the first place, contrary to the precept of lovingour neighbor as ourselves, since thereby we should love, more thanourselves, him who makes an attack on our preservation. Secondly, sucha precept in its literal sense, encourages the wicked to oppressionand injustice. The law of nature has been more wise in prescribing acalculated proportion of courage and moderation, which induces us toforget a first or unpremediated injury, but which punishes every acttending to oppression.Q. Does the law of nature prescribe to do good to others beyond thebounds of reason and measure?A. No; for it is a sure way of leading them to ingratitude. Such is theforce of sentiment and justice implanted in the heart of man, that heis not even grateful for benefits conferred without discretion. There isonly one measure with them, and that is to be just.Q. Is alms-giving a virtuous action?A. Yes, when it is practised according to the rule first mentioned;without which it degenerates into imprudence and vice, inasmuch as itencourages laziness, which is hurtful to the beggar and to society;no one has a right to partake of the property and fruits of another'slabor, without rendering an equivalent of his own industry.Q. Does the law of nature consider as virtues faith and hope, which areoften joined with charity?A. No; for they are ideas without reality; and if any effects resultfrom them, they turn rather to the profit of those who have not thoseideas, than of those who have them; so that faith and hope may be calledthe virtues of dupes for the benefit of knaves.Q. Does the law of nature prescribe probity?A. Yes, for probity is nothing more than respect for one's own rightsin those of another; a respect founded on a prudent and well combinedcalculation of our interests compared to those of others.Q. But does not this calculation, which embraces the complicatedinterests and rights of the social state, require an enlightenedunderstanding and knowledge, which make it a difficult science?A. Yes, and a science so much the more delicate as the honest manpronounces in his own cause.Q. Probity, then, shows an extension and justice in the mind?A. Yes, for an honest man almost always neglects a present interest, inorder not to destroy a future one; whereas the knave does the contrary,and loses a great future interest for a present smaller one.Q. Improbity, therefore, is a sign of false judgment and a narrow mind?A. Yes, and rogues may be defined ignorant and silly calculators; forthey do not understand their true interest, and they pretend to cunning:nevertheless, their cunning only ends in making known what they are--inlosing all confidence and esteem, and the good services resulting fromthem for their physical and social existence. They neither live inpeace with others, nor with themselves; and incessantly menaced by theirconscience and their enemies, they enjoy no other real happiness butthat of not being hanged.Q. Does the law of nature forbid robbery?A. Yes, for the man who robs another gives him a right to rob him; fromthat moment there is no security in his property, nor in his means ofpreservation: thus in injuring others, he, by a counterblow, injureshimself.Q. Does it interdict even an inclination to rob?A. Yes; for that inclination leads naturally to action, and it is forthis reason that envy is considered a sin?Q. How does it forbid murder?A. By the most powerful motives of self-preservation; for, first, theman who attacks exposes himself to the risk of being killed, by theright of defence; secondly, if he kills, he gives to the relations andfriends of the deceased, and to society at large, an equal right ofkilling him; so that his life is no longer in safety.Q. How can we, by the law of nature, repair the evil we have done?A. By rendering a proportionate good to those whom we have injured.Q. Does it allow us to repair it by prayers, vows, offerings to God,fasting and mortifications?A. No: for all those things are foreign to the action we wish to repair:they neither restore the ox to him from whom it has been stolen, honorto him whom we have deprived of it, nor life to him from whom it hasbeen taken away; consequently they miss the end of justice; they areonly perverse contracts by which a man sells to another goods which donot belong to him; they are a real depravation of morality, inasmuchas they embolden to commit crimes through the hope of expiating them;wherefore, they have been the real cause of all the evils by whichthe people among whom those expiatory practices were used, have beencontinually tormented.Q. Does the law of nature order sincerity?A. Yes; for lying, perfidy, and perjury create distrust, quarrels,hatred, revenge, and a crowd of evils among men, which tend to theircommon destruction; while sincerity and fidelity establish confidence,concord, and peace, besides the infinite good resulting from such astate of things to society.Q. Does it prescribe mildness and modesty?A. Yes; for harshness and obduracy, by alienating from us the hearts ofother men, give them an inclination to hurt us; ostentation and vanity,by wounding their self-love and jealousy, occasion us to miss the end ofa real utility.Q. Does it prescribe humility as a virtue?A. No; for it is a propensity in the human heart to despise secretlyeverything that presents to it the idea of weakness; and self-debasementencourages pride and oppression in others; the balance must be kept inequipoise.Q. You have reckoned simplicity of manners among the social virtues;what do you understand by that word?A. I mean the restricting our wants and desires to what is truly usefulto the existence of the citizen and his family; that is to say, the manof simple manners has but few wants, and lives content with a little.Q. How is this virtue prescribed to us?A. By the numerous advantages which the practice of it procures to theindividual and to society; for the man whose wants are few, is free atonce from a crowd of cares, perplexities, and labors; he avoids manyquarrels and contests arising from avidity and a desire of gain; hespares himself the anxiety of ambition, the inquietudes of possession,and the uneasiness of losses; finding superfluity everywhere, he is thereal rich man; always content with what he has, he is happy at littleexpense; and other men, not fearing any competition from him, leave himin quiet, and are disposed to render him the services he should standin need of. And if this virtue of simplicity extends to a whole people,they insure to themselves abundance; rich in everything they do notconsume, they acquire immense means of exchange and commerce; they work,fabricate, and sell at a lower price than others, and attain to allkinds of prosperity, both at home and abroad.Q. What is the vice contrary to this virtue?A. It is cupidity and luxury.Q. Is luxury a vice in the individual and in society?A. Yes, and to that degree, that it may be said to include all theothers; for the man who stands in need of many things, imposes therebyon himself all the anxiety, and submits to all the means just or unjustof acquiring them. Does he possess an enjoyment, he covets another; andin the bosom of superfluity, he is never rich; a commodious dwelling isnot sufficient for him, he must have a beautiful hotel; not content witha plenteous table, he must have rare and costly viands: he must havesplendid furniture, expensive clothes, a train of attendants, horses,carriages, women, theatrical representations and games. Now, to supplyso many expenses, much money must be had; and he looks on every methodof procuring it as good and even necessary; at first he borrows,afterwards he steals, robs, plunders, turns bankrupt, is at war withevery one, ruins and is ruined.Should a nation be involved in luxury, it occasions on a larger scalethe same devastations; by reason that it consumes its entire produce,it finds itself poor even with abundance; it has nothing to sell toforeigners; its manufactures are carried on at a great expense, andare sold too dear; it becomes tributary for everything it imports; itattacks externally its consideration, power, strength, and means ofdefence and preservation, while internally it undermines and fallsinto the dissolution of its members. All its citizens being covetousof enjoyments, are engaged in a perpetual struggle to obtain them; allinjure or are near injuring themselves; and hence arise those habitsand actions of usurpation, which constitute what is denominated moralcorruption, intestine war between citizen and citizen. From luxuryarises avidity, from avidity, invasion by violence and perfidy; fromluxury arises the iniquity of the judge, the venality of the witness,the improbity of the husband, the prostitution of the wife, the obduracyof parents, the ingratitude of children, the avarice of the master, thedishonesty of the servant, the dilapidation of the administrator, theperversity of the legislator, lying, perfidy, perjury, assassination,and all the disorders of the social state; so that it was with aprofound sense of truth, that ancient moralists have laid the basis ofthe social virtues on simplicity of manners, restriction of wants, andcontentment with a little; and a sure way of knowing the extent ofa man's virtues and vices is, to find out if his expenses areproportionate to his fortune, and calculate, from his want of money, hisprobity, his integrity in fulfilling his engagements, his devotion tothe public weal, and his sincere or pretended love of his country.Q. What do you mean by the word country?A. I mean the community of citizens who, united by fraternal sentiments,and reciprocal wants, make of their respective strength one commonforce, the reaction of which on each of them assumes the noble andbeneficent character of paternity. In society, citizens form a bank ofinterest; in our country we form a family of endearing attachments; itis charity, the love of one's neighbor extended to a whole nation. Nowas charity cannot be separated from justice, no member of the family canpretend to the enjoyment of its advantages, except in proportion to hislabor; if he consumes more than it produces, he necessarily encroacheson his fellow-citizens; and it is only by consuming less than whathe produces or possesses, that he can acquire the means of makingsacrifices and being generous.Q. What do you conclude from all this?A. I conclude from it that all the social virtues are only the habitudeof actions useful to society and to the individual who practices them;That they refer to the physical object of man's preservation; Thatnature having implanted in us the want of that preservation, has madea law to us of all its consequences, and a crime of everything thatdeviates from it; That we carry in us the seed of every virtue, and ofevery perfection; That it only requires to be developed; That we areonly happy inasmuch as we observe the rules established by nature forthe end of our preservation; And that all wisdom, all perfection, alllaw, all virtue, all philosophy, consist in the practice of these axiomsfounded on our own organization:Preserve thyself; Instruct thyself; Moderate thyself; Live for thyfellow citizens, that they may live for thee.VOLNEY'S ANSWER TO DR. PRIESTLY.*     * In 1797, Dr. Priestly published a pamphlet, entitled,     "Observation on the increase of infidelity, with     animadversions upon the writings of several modern     unbelievers, and especially the Ruins of Mr. Volney." The     motto to this tract was:"Minds of little penetration rest naturally on the surface of things.They do not like to pierce deep into them, for fear of labor andtrouble; sometimes still more for fear of truth."This Letter is an answer from Volney, taken from the Anti-Jacobin Reviewof March and April, 1799.SIR.--I received in due time your pamphlet on the increase ofinfidelity, together with the note without date which accompanied it.*My answer has been delayed by the incidents of business, and even byill health, which you will surely excuse: this delay has, besides, noinconvenience in it. The question between us is not of a very urgentnature: the world would not go on less well with or without my answeras with or without your book. I might, indeed, have dispensed withreturning you any answer at all; and I should have been warranted inso doing, by the manner in which you have stated the debate, and by theopinion pretty generally received that, on certain occasions, and withcertain persons, the most noble reply is silence. You seem to have beenaware of this yourself, considering the extreme precautions you havetaken to deprive me of this resource; but as according to our Frenchcustoms, any answer is an act of civility, I am not willing to concedethe advantage of politeness--besides, although silence is sometimesvery significant, its eloquence is not understood by every one, andthe public which has not leisure to analyze disputes (often of littleinterest) has a reasonable right to require at least some preliminaryexplanations; reserving to itself, should the discussion degenerate intothe recriminative clamors of an irritated self-love, to allow the rightof silence to him in whom it becomes the virtue of moderation.     * Dr. Priestly sent his pamphlet to Volney, desiring his     answer to the strictures on his opinions in his Ruins of     Empires.I have read, therefore, your animadversions on my Ruins, which you arepleased to class among the writings of modern unbelievers, and since youabsolutely insist on my expressing my opinion before the public, I shallnow fulfill this rather disagreeable task with all possible brevity,for the sake of economizing the time of our readers. In the first place,sir, it appears evidently, from your pamphlet, that your design is lessto attack my book than my personal and moral character; and in orderthat the public may pronounce with accuracy on this point, I submitseveral passages fitted to throw light on the subject.You say, in the preface of your discourses, p. 12, "There are, however,unbelievers more ignorant than Mr. Paine, Mr. Volney, Lequino, andothers in France say," &c.Also in the preface of your present observations, p. 20. "I cantruly say that in the writings of Hume, Mr. Gibbon, Voltaire, Mr.Volney--there is nothing of solid argument: all abound in gross mistakesand misrepresentations." Idem, p. 38--"Whereas had he (Mr. Volney)given attention to the history of the times in which Christianity waspromulgated . . . he could have no more doubt . . . &c., it is as muchin vain to argue with such a person as this, as with a Chinese or even aHottentot."Idem, p. 119--"Mr. Volney, if we may judge from his numerous quotationsof ancient writers in all the learned languages, oriental as well asoccidental, must be acquainted with all; for he makes no mention of anytranslation, and yet if we judge from this specimen of his knowledge ofthem, he cannot have the smallest tincture of that of the Hebrew or evenof the Greek."And, at last, after having published and posted me in your very titlepage, as an unbeliever and an infidel; after having pointed me out inyour motto as one of those superficial spirits who know not how to findout, and are unwilling to encounter, truth; you add, p. 124,immediately after an article in which you speak of me under all thesedenominations--"The progress of infidelity, in the present age, is attended with acircumstance which did not so frequently accompany it in any formerperiod, at least, in England, which is, that unbelievers in revelationgenerally proceed to the disbelief of the being and providence of Godso as to become properly Atheists." So that, according to you, I am aChinese, a Hottentot, an unbeliever, an Atheist, an ignoramus, a man ofno sincerity; whose writings are full of nothing but gross mistakes andmisrepresentations. Now I ask you, sir, What has all this to do with themain question? What has my book in common with my person? And how canyou hold any converse with a man of such bad connexions? In the secondplace, your invitation, or rather, your summons to me, to point outthe mistakes which I think you have made with respect to my opinions,suggest to me several observations.First. You suppose that the public attaches a high importance to yourmistakes and to my opinions: but I cannot act upon a supposition. Am Inot an unbeliever?Secondly. You say, p. 18, that the public will expect it from me: Whereare the powers by which you make the public speak and act? Is this alsoa revelation?Thirdly. You require me to point out your mistakes. I do not know that Iam under any such obligation: I have not reproached you with them; itis not, indeed, very correct to ascribe to me, by selection orindiscriminately, as you have done, all the opinions scattered throughmy book, since, having introduced many different persons, I was underthe necessity of making them deliver different sentiments, according totheir different characters. The part which belongs to me is that of atraveler, resting upon the ruins and meditating on the causes of themisfortunes of the human race. To be consistent with yourself you oughtto have assigned to me that of the Hottentot or Samoyde savage, whoargues with the Doctors, chap. xxiii, and I should have accepted it; youhave preferred that of the erudite historian, chap. xxii, nor do I lookupon this as a mistake; I discover on the contrary, an insidious designto engage me in a duel of self-love before the public, wherein you wouldexcite the exclusive interest of the spectators by supporting the causewhich they approve; while the task which you would impose on me,would only, in the event of success, be attended with sentiments ofdisapprobation. Such is your artful purpose, that, in attacking meas doubting the existence of Jesus, you might secure to yourself,by surprise, the favor of every Christian sect, although your ownincredulity in his divine nature is not less subversive of Christianitythan the profane opinion, which does not find in history the proofrequired by the English law to establish a fact: to say nothing ofthe extraordinary kind of pride assumed in the silent, but palpable,comparison of yourself to Paul and to Christ, by likening your labors totheirs as tending to the same object, p. 10, preface. Nevertheless, asthe first impression of an attack always confers an advantage, youhave some ground for expecting you may obtain the apostolic crown;unfortunately for your purpose I entertain no disposition to that ofmartrydom: and however glorious it might be to me to fall under the armof him who has overcome Hume, Gibbon, Voltaire and even Frederick II., Ifind myself under the necessity of declining your theological challenge,for a number of substantial reasons.1. Because, to religious quarrels there is no end, since the prejudicesof infancy and education almost unavoidably exclude impartial reasoning,and besides, the vanity of the champions becomes committed by the verypublicity of the contest, never to give up a first assertion, whenceresult a spirit of sectarism and faction.2. Because no one has a right to ask of me an account of my religiousopinions. Every inquisition of this kind is a pretension to sovereignty,a first step towards persecution; and the tolerant spirit of thiscountry, which you invoke, has much less in view to engage men to speak,than to invite them to be silent.3. Because, supposing I do hold the opinions you attribute to me, I wishnot to engage my vanity so as never to retract, nor to deprive myselfof the resource of a conversion on some future day after more ampleinformation.4. And because, reverend sir, if, in the support of your own thesis, youshould happen to be discomfited before the Christian audience, it wouldbe a dreadful scandal; and I will not be a cause for scandal, even forthe sake of good.5. Because in this metaphysical contest our arms are too unequal; youspeaking in your mother tongue, which I scarcely lisp, might bring forthhuge volumes, while I could hardly oppose pages; and the public, whowould read neither production, might take the weight of the books forthat of reasoning.6. And because, being endowed with the gift of faith in a prettysufficient quantity, you might swallow in a quarter of an hour morearticles than my logic would digest in a week.7. Because again, if you were to oblige me to attend your sermons, asyou have compelled me to read your pamphlet, the congregation wouldnever believe that a man powdered and adorned like any worldling, couldbe in the right against a man dressed out in a large hat, with straighthair,* and a mortified countenance, although the gospel, speaking of thepharisees of other times, who were unpowdered, says that when one fastshe must anoint his head and wash his face.**     * Dr. Priestly has discarded his wig since he went to     America, and wears his own hair.  Editor A. J. Reveiw.     ** St. Matthew, Chapter VI. verses 16 and 17.8. Because, finally, a dispute to one having nothing else to do would bea gratification, while to me, who can employ my time better, it would bean absolute loss.I shall not then, reverend sir, make you my confessor in matters ofreligion, but I will disclose to you my opinion, as a man of letters, onthe composition of your book. Having in former days, read many works oftheology, I was curious to learn whether by any chemical process you haddiscovered real beings in that world of invisibles. Unfortunately, I amobliged to declare to the public, which, according to your expression,p. 19, "hopes to be instructed, to be led into truth, and not into errorby me," that I have not found in your book a single new argument,but the mere repetition of what is told over and over in thousands ofvolumes, the whole fruit of which has been to procure for their authorsa cursory mention in the dictionary of heresies. You everywhere lay downthat as proved which remains to be proved; with this peculiarity,that, as Gibbon says, firing away your double battery against those whobelieve too much, and those who believe too little, you hold out yourown peculiar sensations, as to the precise criterion of truth; so thatwe must all be just of your size in order to pass the gate of thatNew Jerusalem which you are building. After this, your reputation asa divine might have become problematical with me; but recollecting theprinciple of the association of ideas so well developed by Locke, whomyou hold in estimation, and whom, for that reason I am happy to cite toyou, although to him I owe that pernicious use of my understanding whichmakes me disbelieve what I do not comprehend--I perceive why the publichaving originally attached the idea of talents to the name of Mr.Priestly, doctor in chemistry, continued by habit to associate it withthe name of Mr. Priestly, doctor in divinity; which, however, is not thesame thing: an association of ideas the more vicious as it is liableto be moved inversely.* Happily you have yourself raised a bar ofseparation between your admirers, by advising us in the first pageof your preface, that your present book is especially destined forbelievers. To cooperate, however, with you, sir, in this judiciousdesign, I must observe that it is necessary to retrench two passages,seeing they afford the greatest support to the arguments of unbelievers.     * Mr. Blair, doctor of divinity, and Mr. Black, doctor in     chemistry, met at the coffee house in Edinburg: a new     theological pamphlet written by doctor Priestly was thrown     upon the table, "Really," said Dr. Blair, "this man had     better confine himself to chemistry, for he is absolutely     ignorant in theology:"--"I beg your pardon," answered Dr.     Black, "he is in the right, he is a minister of the gospel,     he ought to adhere to his profession, for in truth he knows     nothing of chemistry."You say, p. 15, "What is manifestly contrary to natural reason cannot bereceived by it;"--and p. 62, "With respect to intellect, men and bruteanimals are born in the same state, having the same external senses,which are the only inlets to all ideas, and consequently the source ofall the knowledge and of all the mental habits they ever acquire."Now if you admit, with Locke, and with us infidels, that every one hasthe right of rejecting whatever is contrary to his natural reason, andthat all our ideas and all our knowledge are acquired only by the inletsof our external senses; What becomes of the system of revelation, and ofthat order of things in times past, which is so contradictory to thatof the time present? unless we consider it as a dream of the human brainduring the state of superstitious ignorance.With these two single phrases, I could overturn the whole edifice ofyour faith. Dread not, however, sir, in me such overflowing zeal. Forthe same reason that I have not the frenzy of martyrdom, I have not thatof making proselytes. It becomes those ardent, or rather acrimonioustempers, who mistake the violence of their sentiments for the enthusiasmof truth; the ambition of noise and rumor, for the love of glory; andfor the love of their neighbor, the detestation of his opinions, and thesecret desire of dominion.As for me, who have not received from nature the turbulent qualities ofan apostle, and never sustained in Europe the character of a dissenter,I am come to America neither to agitate the conscience of men, nor toform a sect, nor to establish a colony, in which, under the pretext ofreligion, I might erect a little empire to myself. I have never beenseen evangelizing my ideas, either in temples or in public meetings. Ihave never likewise practiced that quackery of beneficence, by whicha certain divine, imposing a tax upon the generosity of the public,procures for himself the honors of a more numerous audience, and themerit of distributing at his pleasure a bounty which costs him nothing,and for which he receives grateful thanks dexterously stolen from theoriginal donors.Either in the capacity of a stranger, or in that of a citizen, a sincerefriend to peace, I carry into society neither the spirit of dissension,nor the desire of commotion; and because I respect in every one whatI wish him to respect in me, the name of liberty is in my mind nothingelse but the synonyma of justice.As a man, whether from moderation or indolence, a spectator of the worldrather than an actor in it, I am every day less tempted to take on methe management of the minds or bodies of men: it is sufficient for anindividual to govern his own passions and caprices.If by one of these caprices, I am induced to think it may be useful,sometimes, to publish my reflections, I do it without obstinacy orpretension to that implicit faith, the ridicule of which you desireto impart to me, p. 123. My whole book of the Ruins which you treat soungratefully, since you thought it amusing, p. 122, evidently bears thischaracter. By means of the contrasted opinions I have scattered throughit, it breathes that spirit of doubt and uncertainty which appears to methe best suited to the weakness of the human mind, and the most adaptedto its improvement, inasmuch as it always leaves a door open to newtruths; while the spirit of dogmatism and immovable belief, limiting ourprogress to a first received opinion, binds us at hazard, and withoutresource, to the yoke of error or falsehood, and occasions the mostserious mischiefs to society; since by combining with the passions, itengenders fanaticism, which, sometimes misled and sometimes misleading,though always intolerant and despotic, attacks whatever is not ofits own nature; drawing upon itself persecution when it is weak, andpractising persecution when it is powerful; establishing a religion ofterror, which annihilates the faculties, and vitiates the conscience:so that, whether under a political or a religious aspect, the spiritof doubt is friendly to all ideas of liberty, truth, or genius, while aspirit of confidence is connected with the ideas of tyranny, servility,and ignorance.If, as is the fact, our own experience and that of others daily teachesus that what at one time appeared true, afterwards appeared demonstrablyfalse, how can we connect with our judgments that blind and presumptuousconfidence which pursues those of others with so much hatred?No doubt it is reasonable, and even honest, to act according to ourpresent feelings and conviction: but if these feelings and their causesdo vary by the very nature of things, how dare we impose upon ourselvesor others an invariable conviction? How, above all, dare we require thisconviction in cases where there is really no sensation, as happensin purely speculative questions, in which no palpable fact can bepresented?Therefore, when opening the book of nature, (a more authentic one andmore easy to be read than leaves of paper blackened over with Greek orHebrew,) and when I reflected that the slightest change in the materialworld has not been in times past, nor is at present effected by thedifference of so many religions and sects which have appeared and stillexist on the globe, and that the course of the seasons, the path of thesun, the return of rain and drought, are the same for the inhabitantsof each country, whether Christians, Mussulmans, Idolaters, Catholics,Protestants, etc., I am induced to believe that the universe is governedby laws of wisdom and justice, very different from those which humanignorance and intolerance would enact.And as in living with men of very opposite religious persuasions, Ihave had occasion to remark that their manners were, nevertheless, veryanalogous; that is to say, among the different Christian sects, amongthe Mahometans, and even among those people who were of no sect, I havefound men who practise all the virtues, public and private, and that toowithout affectation; while others, who were incessantly declaiming ofGod and religion, abandoned themselves to every vicious habit whichtheir belief condemned, I thereby became convinced that Ethics,the doctrines of morality, are the only essential, as they are onlydemonstrable, part of religion. And as, by your own avowal, the only endof religion is to render men better, in order to add to their happiness,p. 62, I have concluded that there are but two great systems of religionin the world, that of good sense and beneficence, and that of malice andhypocrisy.In closing this letter, I find myself embarrassed by the nature of thesentiment which I ought to express to you, for in declaring as youhave done, p. 123, that you do not care for the contempt of such as me*(ignorant as you were of my opinion), you tell me plainly that you donot care for their esteem. I leave, therefore, to your discernment andtaste to determine the sentiment most congenial to my situation and yourdesert.     * "And what does it do for me here, except, perhaps, expose     me to the contempt of such men as Mr. Volney, which,     however, I feel myself pretty well able to bear?" p. 124.     This language is the more surprising, as Dr. Priestly never     received anything from me but civilities.  In the year 1791     I sent him a dissertation of mine on the Chronology of the     Ancients, in consequence of some charts which he had himself     published.  His only answer was to abuse me in a pamphlet in     1792.  After this first abuse, on meeting me here last     winter, he procured me an invitation to dine with his friend     Mr. Russell, at whose house he lodged; after having shown me     polite attention at that dinner, he abuses me in his new     pamphlet.  After this second abuse he meets me in Spruce     Street, and takes me by the hand as a friend, and speaks of     me in a large company under that denomination.  Now I ask     the public, what kind of a man is Dr. Priestly?C. F. VOLNEY.Philadelphia, March 10, 1797.P. S. I do not accompany this public letter with a private note to Dr.Priestly, because communications of that nature carry an appearance ofbravado, which, even in exercising the right of a necessary defence,appear to me imcompatible with decency and politeness.THE ZODIACAL SIGNS AND CONSTELLATIONS.(Compiled by the publisher from recognized authorities.)The Zodiac is an imaginary girdle or belt in the celestial sphere, whichextends about eight degrees on each side of the Ecliptic. It is dividedinto twelve portions, called the signs of the Zodiac, within which allthe planets make their revolutions. The Zodiac is so called from theanimals represented upon it, and is supposed to have originatedin remote ages and in latitudes where the camel and elephant werecomparatively unknown. This pictorial representation of the zodiac wasprobably the origin, as M. Dupuis suggests, of the Arabian and Egyptianadoration of animals and birds, and has led in the natural progress ofevents to the adoration of images by both Christians and pagans."The Signs of the Zodiac, (says Godfrey Higgins in The Anacalypsis) withthe exception of the Scorpion, which was exchanged by Dan for theEagle, were carried by the different tribes of the Israelites on theirstandards; and Taurus, Leo, Aquarius, and Scorpio or the Eagle--thefour signs of Reuben, Judah, Ephriam, and Dan--were placed at the fourcorners, (the four cardinal points), of their encampment, evidentlyin allusion to the cardinal points of the sphere, the equinoxes andsolstices, when the equinox was in Taurus. (See Parkhurst's Lexicon.)These coincidences prove that this religious system had its originbefore the bull ceased to be an equinoctial sign, and prove also, thatthe religion of Moses was originally the same in its secret mysteries asthat of the Heathen, or, if my reader likes it better, that the Heathensecret mysteries were the same as those of Moses."The Ecliptic, a great circle of the sphere, (shown on the preceding mapby two parallel lines), is supposed to be drawn through the middle ofthe Zodiac, cutting the Equator at two points, (called the Equinoctialpoints), at an angle with the equinoctial of 23 degrees 28 minutes, (thesun's greatest declination), and is the path which the earth is supposedto describe amidst the fixed stars in performing its annual circuitaround the sun. It is called the Ecliptic because the eclipses of thesun and moon always occur under it.The Signs are each the twelfth part of the Ecliptic or Zodiac, (30degrees,) and are reckoned from the point of intersection of theecliptic and equator at the vernal equinox. They are named respectivelyAries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius,Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces. These names are borrowed fromthe constellations of the zodiac of the same denomination, whichcorresponded when these divisions were originally made; but inconsequence of the precession, recession, or retrocession of theequinoxes, (about 50 1/10" yearly, at the rate of about 72 years to adegree, displacing an entire sign in about 2152 years, and makingan entire revolution of the equinoctial in about 25,868 years), thepositions of these constellations in the heavens no longer correspondwith the divisions of the ecliptic of the same name, but are in advanceof them. Thus, the constellation Aries is now in that part of theecliptic called Taurus, and the stars of Taurus are in Gemini, those ofGemini in Cancer, and so on throughout the ecliptic.The relative positions of the signs and constellations in the zodiac andecliptic seem thus to have gradually changed with the revolving years;and the worship of the three constellations, Taurus, Aries, and Pisces,with which Christianity is so intimately connected, seems to havechanged in a corresponding degree. The worship of the bull of Egypt--thecelestial Taurus--has given place to that of the lamb of Palestine--thecelestial Aries; and under the astronomical emblem Pisces--the twelfthsign of the zodiac--the dominant faith of to-day was appropriatelytaught by the twelve apostolic fishermen.It is from one of these chosen fishermen, St. Peter, that the Pope ofRome claims to have derived his arbitrary power for binding and loosingon earth those who are to be bound and loosed in heaven. (Matt. xvi,19.) The grave responsibility of wielding with justice and equity thistremendous power over the future destiny of mankind, seems never to havedisconcerted any of the successors of St. Peter. They have all provedto be equally arrogant and intolerant, zealous for both temporal andspiritual domination, and merciless to those who have opposed theirpretensions. The present incumbent of the papal chair, who modestlyclaims the attribute of infallibility, seems proud of his inheritedtitle, The Great Fisherman! and hopes in the progress of time, with theassistance of his monks, bishops, and cardinals, to entangle all nationsin his net of faith, and to dictate with unquestioned authority thereligious worship of the entire human race.As the precession of the equinoxes still continues as of yore, and asthe masses still continue credulous and devout, they may in succeedingages be again called upon to worship the god Apis, when the sign ofTaurus shall again coincide in the zodiac and the ecliptic; and Aries,"the lamb of God," may again be offered in the "fullness of time" as asacrifice for mankind, again be crucified, and again shed his redeemingblood to wash away the sins of a believing world.M. Dupuis has satisfactorily shown in The History of all Religions thatthe twelve labors of the god and saviour Hercules were astronomicalallegories--the history of the passage of the sun through the twelvesigns of the zodiac--and these labors are so similar to the sufferingsof Jesus, that the Rev. Mr. Parkhurst has been obliged, much againsthis inclination, to acknowledge that they "were types of what thereal Saviour was to do and suffer." (Parkhurst, p.47.) An intimateconnection, if not identity, is thus shown between ancient and modernbelief--between the paganism of the past and the orthodoxy of thepresent.THE ZODIACAL SIGNS.ARIES, the Ram: (marked [symbol for ARIES])--A northern constellation,usually named as the first sign in the zodiac, into which, when the sunenters at the vernal equinox in March, the days and nights are of equallength. Aries has been regarded by the devout during many ages as thecelestial representative, visible in the heavens, of "the Lamb of Godthat taketh away the sins of the world."TAURUS, the Bull:(marked thus, [symbol for TAURUS])--The second sign inthe zodiac, which by the Arabians is called Ataur. This constellationwas worshipped for ages by the idolatrous Egyptians as the heavenlyrepresentative of their god Osiris; and derives its name, according toGrecian fable, from the bull into which Jupiter transformed himselfin order to carry Europa over into Crete; but the constellation wasprobably so named by the Egyptians to designate that period of the year,(April), in which cows mostly bring forth their young."The Rev. Mr. Maurice in his work on the antiquities of India, has shownthat the May-day festival and the May-pole of Great Britain with itsgarlands, etc., are the remains of an ancient festival of Egypt andIndia, and probably of Phoenicia, when these nations, in countriesvery distant, and from times very remote, have all, with one consent,celebrated the entrance of the sun into the sign of Taurus at the vernalequinox."GEMINI, the Twins: (marked thus, [symbol for GEMINI])--A zodiacalconstellation, visible in May, containing the two bright stars Castorand Pollux, the fabled sons of Leda and Jupiter, who during their liveshad cleared the Hellespont and neighboring seas of pirates, and weretherefore deemed the protectors of navigators and sailors.CANCER, the Crab: (marked thus, [symbol for CANCER])--Is the fourthsign of the zodiac, which the sun enters on the 21st day of June, and isthence called the summer solstice. According to Grecian fable, the crabwas transported to heaven at the request of Juno, after it had beenslain by Hercules during his battle with the serpent Python, but theevident design of the name is to represent the apparent backward motionof the sun in June, which is said to resemble the motions of a crab.LEO, the Lion: ([symbol for LEO]).--Is the fifth sign in the zodiac,and contains one star of the first magnitude, called Regulus, or CorLeonis--the Lion's Heart. The fervid heat of July, when the sun hasattained its greatest power, is now symbolized in our almanacs bythe figure of an enraged lion; and the feasts or sacrifices formerlycelebrated among the ancients during this month, in honor of the sun,(which they also represented under the form of a lion,) were calledLeonitica. The priests who performed the sacred rites were calledLeones. This feast was sometimes called Mithriaca, because Mithra wasthe name of the sun among the Persians. The sacred writings abound withreferences to the "king of beasts;" among the most interesting of whichis the story of the battle between the lion and Samson, the JewishHerculus; while the most wonderful example of animal evolution on recordis found in the sixty-fifth chapter of Isaiah, where we are gravelyinformed that "the lion shall eat straw like the bullock."VIRGO, Virgin Mother, Venus, Eve, Isis, &c.--([symbol for VIRGO]).--Isthe sixth sign of the zodiac, which the sun enters about the 21st ofAugust. The myths and fables regarding the virgin which abound among allnations and all religions, are both various and voluminous, and we mayadd somewhat improbable. They all agree, however, in this, that thefemale, shown on the preceding diagram, holding in her right hand abranch of ripened fruit,--the apples of Paradise,--was intendedto represent the reproductive powers of nature,--the abundance,satisfaction and contentment which mortals enjoy during the happy periodof harvest.LIBRA, the Balance.--The seventh sign of the zodiac, directly oppositeto Aries, from which it is distant 180 degrees. It is marked thus[symbol for LIBRA], after the manner of a pair of scales; to denote,probably, that when the sun arrives at this part of the ecliptic, thedays and nights are equal, as if weighed in a balance. Hence theperiod when the sun enters Libra, (about September 21st,) is called theAutumnal equinox. On the 25th of September was born John the Baptist,the forerunner of his cousin Jesus, who came to his exaltation of gloryon the 25th of March, the Vernal equinox. "The equinoxes and solstices,"says Higgins, "equally marked the births and deaths of John and Jesus."The one preceded and prepared the way for the other, who receded.One advanced, the other declined. Jesus ascended, John descended.Astrologically speaking, "He must increase, but I must decrease." (Johniii, 30.)SCORPIO, the Scorpion.--The eighth sign of the zodiac, which the sunenters on the 23d of October, is marked thus [symbol for SCORPIO].Scorpio is fabled to have killed the great hunter Orion, and for thatexploit to have been placed among the constellations. For this reason itis also said that when Scorpio rises Orion sets.SAGITTARIUS, the Archer: (marked thus, [symbol for SAGITTARIUS]) is theninth zodiacal sign, and corresponds with the month of November. Thissign is represented like a centaur and was fabled to be Crotus, the sonof Eupheme, the nurse of the Muses.CAPRICORNUS, the Goat.([symbol for CAPRICORNUS])--The tenth sign of thezodiac, which the sun enters the 21st of December, (the longest night inthe year,) called the winter solstice. This sign is drawn to representthe horns of a goat, and is fabled to have been Pan, who in the war ofthe giants was taken to heaven in the shape of a goat. Others claimthat it was the goat of Amalthaea, which fed Jupiter with her milk.Macrobius, who calls Cancer and Capricorn the gates of the sun, makesthe latter sign to represent his motion, after the manner of a goatclimbing the mountains.AQUARIUS, the Water Bearer.--A constellation in the heavens so called,because during its rising there is usually an abundance of rain. Itis the eleventh sign in the zodiac, reckoned from Aries, and is markedthus, [symbol for AQUARIUS]. It rises in January and sets in February,and is supposed by the poets to be Ganymede.PISCES, the Fishes, [symbol for PISCES].--The twelfth sign of thezodiac, rises in February and is represented by two fishes tied togetherby the tails. These fishes are fabled by the Greeks to be those intowhich Venus and Cupid were changed to escape from the giant Typhon. Thisfable may not be true, but that wonderful miracles were once performedwith two small fishes is stated in the ninth chapter of the Gospel ofSt. Luke, where it is said that 5000 hungry mortals were cheaply, ifnot sumptuously regaled with two small fishes and five loaves of bread;while a large surplus of this piscatory diet, larger indeed than theoriginal stock, still remained intact.In the vestibule or approaches to catholic churches is usually found avase filled with water, (called Piscina,) and this water is consideredholy. The Fish-days are observed as holy days, or fast days, in whichFish may be eaten and meat is forbidden; and learned writers haveasserted that in the worship of Pisces may be found the true secret ofthe origin of the rite of baptism. The Fish-god Oannes, is said to havecome out of the Erythraean Sea and taught the Babylonians all kinds ofuseful knowledge. Ionnes or Jonas went headlong into the sea and intoa fish, and has kindly recorded for our instruction his remarkableadventures. The miraculous draughts of fishes in the apostolic age stillexcite the emulation of modern fishermen, who cannot even hope to rivalthe wonders that have been recorded. St. Peter is said to have securedready money from the mouth of a fish that he caught with a hook andline in the sea of Galilee. (Matthew xvii, 27.) His success was justlyrewarded, and to him was delegated the power of ruling the infantchurch. Pisces thus displaced Aries. The fisherman succeeded theshepherd. The precession of the equinoxes produced a new avatar; a newsign arose in the heavens; and a new saviour was born to save mankind.THE CONSTELLATIONS.SIRIUS, the Dog Star.--A bright star of the first magnitude in themouth of the constellation Canis Major. This is the brightest star thatappears in our firmament, and is supposed by some to be the nearest.LEPUS.--One of the southern constellations, placed near Orion, accordingto Grecian fable, because it was one of the animals which he hunted.ERIDANUS.--A winding southern constellation, near the Cetus, containingthe bright star Achemar.CETUS, the Whale.--A southern constellation, and one of the forty-eightold asterisms.

The Hydra is fabled to have been placed inthe heavens by Apollo, to frighten the Raven from drinking.ORION, the hunter.--A constellation of the southern hemisphere withrespect to the ecliptic, but half southern and half northern withrespect to the equinoctial. It is placed near the feet of the bull, andis composed of seventeen stars in the form of a sword, which has givenoccasion to the poets to speak of Orion's sword. He was described bythe Greeks as a "mighty hunter," who for his exploits was placed in theheavens by Jupiter, between the Canis and the Lepus. He is believed bymany to have been the "mighty hunter" spoken of in the bible, under thename of Nimrod. (See Gen. x: 8, 9; 1 Chron. i: 10; Micha v: 6, Job ix,9; Amos v, 8.)PERSEUS.--This constellation is named from Perseus, the son of Jupiterby Danae, who was translated into the heavens by the assistance ofMinerva, for having released Andromeda from her confinement on therock to which she was chained. He is represented in the precedingillustration holding a drawn sword in his right hand and in his left thehead of Medusa, the Gorgon, whose terrifying appearance changed all whobeheld her into stone, and whom he had destroyed with the assistance ofthe wings he had borrowed from Mercury, the helmet from Pluto, the swordfrom Vulcan, and the shield from Minerva.JOSEPH'S STABLE; AURIGA, the Wagoner:--A northern constellation betweenPerseus and Gemini, represented by the figure of an old man supportinga goat.

Northern Crown.--One of the old northernconstellations, between Hercules and Bootes.CORONA AUSTRALIS--Southern Crown.--One of the old constellations in thesouthern hemisphere, between Sagittarius and Scorpio. The Coronawere fabled to be Menippe and Metioche, two daughters of Orion, whosacrificed themselves at the suggestion of an oracle, to protectBoeotia, their native country, from the ravages of a pestilence: itbeing the belief of idolatrous nations that an angry god could bepropitiated by human sacrifices, and that the death of the innocentmight atone for the sins of the guilty. The deities of Hades wereastonished, it is said, at the patriotism and devotion of these Grecianmaidens, who had so generously and uselessly sacrificed their lives.After their death two stars were seen to issue from the altars thatstill smoked with their blood, and these stars were placed in theheavens in the form of a crown or coronet.CEPHEUS AND CASSIOPIA.--One of the old asterism in the northernhemisphere, near the pole. According to Grecian fables, Cassiopiaand her husband Cepheus, king of Etheopia, were placed among theconstellations to witness the punishment inflicted on their daughter,Andromeda.TRIANGULARIUM.--A name for both one of the old and new constellations inthe northern hemisphere, between Andromeda and Aries.SERPENTARIUS, called Ophiucus, is a constellation in the northernhemisphere, between Scorpio and Hercules.HERCULES, one of the old northern constellations. In Grecian mythologyit was taught and believed that Hercules, the Theban, was born of ahuman mother and an immortal father, like other so-called saviours ofmankind. His mother, the fair Alcmena, wife of Amphitryon, having foundfavor in the eyes of the god Jupiter, soon fell an unwilling victimto his celestial wiles. The life of the infant Hercules, born of thisunnatural union, was threatened by the jealous Juno, the same as thelife of the infant Jesus was threatened by the tyrant Herod. Like Jesus,Hercules devoted his life to the benefit of the human race, and likeJesus he was also worshipped after his death as a God in heaven. He isshown in the astrological chart, enveloped in the skin of the lion hehas slain, with his club upraised, and his foot placed threateninglyabove the head of the Dragon, as if about to fulfill the scripturalprophecy, that "the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."End of Project Gutenberg's The Ruins, by C.

LECKY,I DEDICATE ALL IN THIS BOOKTHAT IS WORTHY OF THE FRIENDSHIPWITH WHICH HE HONOURED ME,AND OF THE COUNSEL WHICH HE GAVE MEFOR MY GUIDANCE IN IRISH PUBLIC LIFE.PREFACEThose who have known Ireland for the last dozen years cannot have failedto notice the advent of a wholly new spirit, clearly based uponconstructive thought, and expressing itself in a wide range of freshpractical activities. The movement for the organisation of agricultureand rural credit on co-operative lines, efforts of various kinds torevive old or initiate new industries, and, lastly, the creation of adepartment of Government to foster all that was healthy in the voluntaryeffort of the people to build up the economic side of their life, areeach interesting in themselves. When taken together, and in conjunctionwith the literary and artistic movements, and viewed in their relationto history, politics, religion, education, and the other past andpresent influences operating upon the Irish mind and character, thesemovements appear to me to be worthy of the most thoughtful considerationby all who are responsible for, or desire the well-being of the Irishpeople.I should not, however, in days when my whole time and energies belong tothe public service, have undertaken the task of writing a book on asubject so complex and apparently so inseparable from heatedcontroversy, were I not convinced that the expression of certainthoughts which have come to me from practical contact with Irishproblems, was the best contribution I could make to the work on which Iwas engaged. I wished, if I could, to bring into clearer light theessential unity of the various progressive movements in Ireland, and todo something towards promoting a greater definiteness of aim and method,and a better understanding of each other's work, among those who are invarious ways striving for the upbuilding of a worthy national life inIreland.So far the task, if difficult, was congenial and free fromembarrassment. Unhappily, it had been borne in upon me, in the course ofa long study of Irish life, that our failure to rise to ouropportunities and to give practical evidence of the intellectualqualities with which the race is admittedly gifted, was due to certaindefects of character, not ethically grave, but economically paralysing.I need hardly say I refer to the lack of moral courage, initiative,independence and self-reliance--defects which, however they may beaccounted for, it is the first duty of modern Ireland to recognise andovercome. I believe in the new movements in Ireland, principally becausethey seem to me to exert a stimulating influence upon our moral fibre.Holding such an opinion, I had to decide between preserving a discreetsilence and speaking my full mind. The former course would, it appearedto me, be a poor example of the moral courage which I hold to beIreland's sorest need. Moreover, while I am full of hope for the futureof my country, its present condition does not, in my view, admit of anydelay in arriving at the truth as to the essential principles whichshould guide all who wish to take a part, however humble, in the work ofnational regeneration.I desire to state definitely that I have not written in anyrepresentative capacity except where I say so explicitly. I write on myown responsibility, with the full knowledge that there is much in thebook with which many of those with whom I work do not agree._December_, 1903.CONTENTSPART I._THEORETICAL._CHAPTER ITHE ENGLISH MISUNDERSTANDING.

"It is hard to say where history ends, and where religion and     politics begin; for history, religion and politics grow on one stem     in Ireland, an eternal trefoil."--_Lady Gregory_.CHAPTER I.THE ENGLISH MISUNDERSTANDING.Whatever may be the ultimate verdict of history upon the long struggleof the majority of the Irish people for self-government, the picture ofa small country with large aspirations giving of its best unstintinglyto the world, while gaining for itself little beyond sympathy, willappeal to the imagination of future ages long after the Irish Question,as we know it, has been buried. It may then, perhaps, be seen that theaspirations came to nought because they were opposed to the manifestdestiny of the race, and that it should never have been expected ordesired that the Dark Rosaleen should 'reign and reign alone.'Nevertheless, the fidelity and fortitude with which the national idealhad been pursued would command admiration, even if the ideal itself wereto be altogether abandoned, or if it were to be ultimately realised in amanner which showed that the methods by which its attainment had beensought were the cause of its long postponement. Whatever the future mayhave in store for the remnant of the Irish people at home, the continuedpursuit of a separate national existence by a nation which is rapidlydisappearing from the land of all its hopes, and the cherishing ofthese hopes, not only by those who stay but also by those who go, willstand as a monument to human constancy.The picture will be all the more remarkable when emphasised by acontrast which the historian will not fail to draw. Across a narrowstreak of sea another people, during the same period, increased andmultiplied and prospered mightily, spread their laws and institutions,and achieved in every portion of the globe material success which theycan call their own. Yet, although Irishmen have done much to win thatsuccess for the English people to enjoy, and are to-day foremost inmaintaining the great empire which their brain and muscle were everready to augment, Ireland makes no claim for herself in respect of theachievement. It is to her but a proof of what her sons will do for herin the coming time; it does not bring her nearer to her heart's desire.Although the nineteenth century, with all its marvellous contributionsto human progress, left Ireland with her hopes unfulfilled; although itssun went down upon the British people with their greatest failure stillstaring them in the face, its last decade witnessed at first a change inthe attitude of England towards Ireland, and afterwards a profoundrevolution in the thoughts of Ireland about herself. The strangest andmost interesting feature of these developments was that in practicalEngland the Irish Question became the great political issue, while insentimental Ireland there set in a reaction from politics and aninclination to the practical. The twentieth century has already broughtto birth the new Ireland upon whose problems I shall write. If the humaninterest of these problems is to be realized, if their significance isnot to be as wholly misunderstood as that of every other Irish movementwhich has perplexed the statesmen who have managed our affairs, theymust be studied in their relation to the English and Irish events of theperiod in which the new Ireland was conceived.In 1885 Gladstone, appealing to an electorate with a large accession ofnewly enfranchised voters, transferred the struggle over the IrishQuestion from Ireland to Great Britain. The position taken up by theaverage English Home Ruler was, it will be remembered, simple andintelligible. The Irish had stated in the proper constitutional way whatthey wanted, and that, in the first flush of a victorious democracy,when counting heads irrespective of contents was the popular method ofarriving at political truth, was assumed to be precisely what they oughtto have. A long but inconclusive contest ensued. At times it looked asif the Liberal-Irish alliance might snatch a victory for their policy.But when Gladstone was forced to break with the Irish Leader, andParnellism without Parnell became obviously impossible, the Englishrealised that the working of representative institutions in Ireland hadproduced not a democracy but a dictatorship, and they began to attach alesser significance to the verdict of the Irish polls. Their faith indemocracy was unimpaired, but, in their opinion, the Irish had not yetrisen to its dignity. So most English Radicals came round to a viewwhich they had always reprobated when advanced by the EnglishConservatives, and political inferiority was added to the other moraland intellectual defects which made the Irish an inferior race!The anti-climax to the Gladstone crusade was reached when Lord Roseberyin 1894 took over the premiership from the greatest English advocate ofthe Irish cause. The position of the new leader was very simple. Ineffect, he told the Irish Nationalists that the English party he wasabout to lead had done its best for them. They must now regardthemselves as partners in the United Kingdom, with the British as thepredominant partner. Until the predominant partner could be brought totake the Irish view of the partnership, the relations between them mustremain substantially as they were. And not only must the concession ofHome Rule await the conversion of the British electorate, but before thedemand could be effectively preferred, another leader must rise up amongthe Irish; and he, for all Lord Rosebery knew, was at the moment beingwheeled in a perambulator. This apparently cynical avowal of the newpremier's own attitude towards Home Rule accurately stated the facts ofthe situation, and fairly reflected the mind of the British electorate,after Irish obstruction had given them an opportunity of studying thebearing of the Irish Question on English politics.If the logic of events was thus making for the removal of Home Rule fromthe region of practical politics in England, an even more momentouschange was taking place in Ireland. Whilst the Home Rule controversy wasat its height in the 'eighties and early 'nineties, some Irishgrievances were incidentally dealt with--not always under the bestimpulses or in the best way. The concentration of all the availablethought and energy of Irish public men upon an appeal to the passionsand prejudices of English parties had led to the further postponement ofall Irish endeavour to deal rationally and practically with her ownproblems at home. But during the welter of contention which prevailedafter the fall of Parnell, there grew up in Ireland a wholly new spirit,born of the bitter lesson which was at last being learned. The Irishstill clung undaunted to their political ideal, but its pursuit to theexclusion of all other national aims had received a wholesome check.Thought upon the problems of national progress broadened and deepened,in a manner little understood by those who knew Ireland from without,and, indeed, by many of those accounted wise among the observers fromwithin. Was the realisation of a distinctive national existence, manybegan to ask themselves, to be for ever dependent upon the fortunes of apolitical campaign? In any scheme of a reconstructed national life towhich the Irish would give of their best, there must bedistinctiveness--that much every man who is in touch with Irish life isfully aware of--but the question of existence must not be altogetherignored. At the rate the people were leaving the sinking ship, the IrishQuestion would be settled in the not distant future by the disappearanceof the Irish. Had we not better look around and see how other countrieswith more or less analogous conditions fared? Could we not--Unionistsand Nationalists alike--do something towards material progress withoutabandoning our ideals? Could we not learn something from a study of whatour people were doing abroad? One seemed to hear the voice of BishopBerkeley, the biting pertinence of whose _Queries_ is ever fresh, askingfrom the grave in which he had been laid to rest nearly a century and ahalf ago 'whether it would not be more reasonable to mend our state thancomplain of it; and how far this may be in our own power?'These questionings, though not generally heard on the platform or evenin the street, were none the less working in the depths of the Irishmind, and found expression not so much in words as in deeds. Yet thoughthe downfall of Parnell released many minds from the obsession ofpolitics, the influence of that event was of a negative character, andit took time to produce a beneficial effect. That fruitful last decadeof the nineteenth century saw the foundation of what will some day berecognised as a new philosophy of Irish progress. Certain new principleswere then promulgated in Ireland, and gradually found acceptance; andupon those principles a new movement was built. It is partly, indeed, toexpound and justify some, at any rate, of the principles and to give anintelligible account of the practical achievement and futurepossibilities of this movement that I write these pages.For English readers, to whom this introductory chapter is chieflyaddressed, I may here reiterate the opinion, which I have always heldand often expressed, that there is no real conflict of interest betweenthe two peoples and the two countries, and that the mutualmisunderstanding which we may now hope to see removed is due to a widedifference of temperament and mental outlook. The English mind has neverunderstood the Irish mind--least of all during the period of the 'Unionof Hearts.' It is equally true that the Irish have largely misunderstoodboth the English character and their own responsibility. The result hasbeen that their leaders, despite the brilliant capacity they have shownin presenting the unhappy case of their country to the rest of theworld, have rarely presented it in the right way to the English people.There have been many occasions during the last quarter of a century whena calm, well-reasoned statement of the economic disadvantages underwhich Ireland labours would, I am convinced, have successfully appealedto British public opinion. It could have been shown that the developmentof Ireland--the development not only of the resources of her soil but ofthe far greater wealth which lies in the latent capacities of herpeople--was demanded quite as much in the interest of one country as inthat of the other.Here, indeed, is an untilled field for those to whom the Irish Questionis yet a living one. If I could think that each country fully realisedits own responsibility in the matter, if I could think that thelong-continued misunderstanding was at an end, nothing would induce meto trouble the waters at this auspicious hour, when a better feelingtowards Ireland prevails in Great Britain, and when the Irish people arefully appreciative of the obviously sincere desire of England to begenerous to Ireland. But an examination of the events upon which theprevailing optimism is based will show that, unhappily,misunderstanding, though of another sort, still exists, and that Irelandis as much as ever a riddle to the English mind.Now this new optimism in the English view of Ireland seems to be based,not upon a recognition of the development of what I have ventured todignify with the title of a new philosophy of Irish progress, but upon abelief that the spirit of moderation and conciliation displayed by somany Irishmen in connection with the Land Act is due to the fact that myincomprehensible countrymen have, under a sudden emotion, put awaychildish things and learned to behave like grown-up Englishmen.Throughout the press comments upon the Dunraven Conference and in publicspeeches both inside and outside Parliament there has run a sense that asort of portent, a transformation scene, a sudden and magicalalteration in the whole spirit and outlook of the Irish people, has cometo pass.I feel some hesitation in asking the reader to believe that a great andlasting revolution in Irish thought has been brought about in such amoment in the life of a people as twelve short years. But a lessernumber of months seemed to the English mind adequate for theaccomplishment of the change. And what a change it was that theyconceived! To them, less than a year ago, the Irish Question was notmerely unsolved, but in its essential features appeared unaltered. Afterseven centuries of experimental statecraft--so varied that the Englishcould not believe any expedient had yet to be tried--the vast majorityof the Irish people regarded the Government as alien, disputed thevalidity of its laws, and felt no responsibility for administration, norespect for the legislature, or for those who executed its decrees. Andthis in a country forming an integral part of the United Kingdom, wherethe fundamental basis of government is assumed to be the consent of thegoverned! Nor were any hopes entertained that the cloud would quicklypass. During the Boer war the prophets of evil, in predicting thecalamity which was to fall upon the British Empire, took as their textthe failure of English government in Ireland. When they wanted to paintin the darkest colours the coming heritage of woe, they wrote upon thewall, 'Another Ireland in South Africa'; and if any exception was takento the appropriateness of the phrase, it was certainly not on theground that Ireland had ceased to be a warning to British statesmen.I believe, quite as strongly as the most optimistic Englishman, thatthere has been a great change from this state of things in Irishsentiment, and my explanation of that change, if less dramatic than thetransformation theory, affords more solid ground for optimism. Thischange in the sentiment of Irishmen towards England is due, not to asudden emotion of the incomprehensible Celt, but really to theopinion--rapidly growing for the last dozen years--that great as is theresponsibility of England for the state of Ireland, still greater is theresponsibility of Irishmen. The conviction has been more and more bornein upon the Irish mind that the most important part of the work ofregenerating Ireland must necessarily be done by Irishmen in Ireland.The result has been that many Irishmen, both Unionists and Nationalists,without in any way abandoning their opposition to, or support of, theattempt to solve the political problem from without, have beentrying--not without success--to solve some part of the Irish Questionfrom within. The Report of the Recess Committee, on which I shall dwelllater, was the first great fruit of this movement, and the DunravenTreaty, which paved the way for Mr. Wyndham's Land Act, was a furtherfruit, and not the result of an inexplicable transformation scene.The reason why I dwell on the true nature of the undoubted change inthe Irish situation is not in order to exaggerate the importance of thepart played by the new movement in bringing it about, nor to detractfrom the importance of Parliamentary action, but because a mistaken viewof the change would inevitably postpone the firm establishment of animproved mutual understanding between the two countries, which I regardas an essential of Irish progress. I confess that my apprehension of anew misunderstanding was aroused by the debates on the Land Bill in theHouse of Commons. As regards the spirit of conciliation and moderationdisplayed by the Irish, and the sincere desire exhibited by the Britishto heal the chief Irish economic sore, the speeches were, if notepoch-making, at any rate epoch-marking; but they showed little sense ofperspective or proportion in viewing the Irish Question, and littlegrasp or appreciation of the large social and economic problems whichthe Land Act will bring to the front. Temporary phenomena andlegislative machinery have been endowed with an importance they do notpossess, and miracles, it is supposed, are about to be worked in Irelandby processes which, whatever rich good may be in them, have never workedmiracles, though they have not seldom excited very similar enthusiasmsin the economic history of other European lands.I agree, then, with most Englishmen in thinking, though for a differentreason, that the passing of the Land Act marked a new era in Ireland.They regard it as productive of, or co-incident in time with, the dawnof the practical in Ireland. I antedate that event by some dozen years,and regard the Land Act rather as marking a new era, because it removesthe great obstacle which obscured the dawn of the practical for so many,and hindered it for all.Whatever may have been the expectations upon which this great measurewas based, I, in common with most Irish observers, watched its progresswith unfeigned delight. The vast majority regarded the hundred millionsof credit and the twelve millions of 'bonus' as a generous concession toIreland; and I sympathised with those who deprecated the mischievoussuggestion, not infrequently heard in English political circles, thatthis munificence was the 'price of peace.' On one point all were agreed:the Bill could never have become law had not Mr. Wyndham handled theParliamentary situation with masterly tact, temper, and ability. To himis chiefly due the credit for the fact that the Land Question, in itsold form at any rate, no longer blocks the way, and that the largeproblems which remain to be solved, and, above all, the spirit in whichthey will have to be approached by those who wish the existing peace tobe the forerunner of material and social progress, can be freely andfrankly discussed.It is true, as I have said, that Ireland is becoming more and morepractical, and that England is becoming more anxious than ever to do hersubstantial justice. But still the manner of the doing will continue tobe as important as the thing which is done. Of the Irish qualities noneis stronger than the craving to be understood. If the English had onlyknown this secret we should have been the most easily governed people inthe world. For it is characteristic of the conduct of our most importantaffairs that we care too little about the substance and too much aboutthe shadow. It is for this reason that I have discussed the real natureof one phase of Irish sentiment which has been largely misunderstood,and it is for the same reason that I propose to preface my examinationof the Irish Question with some reference to the cause and nature of theanti-English sentiment, for the long continuance of which I can find noother explanation than the failure of the English to see into the Irishmind.I am well acquainted with this sentiment because, in my practical workin Ireland, it has ever been the main current of the stream againstwhich I have had to swim. Years spent in the United States had made mefamiliar with its full and true significance, for there it can bestudied in an atmosphere not dominated by any present Irishcontroversies or struggles. I have found this sentiment of hatred deeplyrooted in the minds of Irishmen who had themselves never known Ireland,who had no connection, other than a sentimental one, with that country,who were living quiet business lives in the United States, but who wereever ready to testify with their dollars, and genuinely believed thatthey only lacked opportunity to demonstrate in a more enterprising way,their "undying hatred of the English name."[1]With such men I have reasoned, and sometimes not in vain, upon theinjustice and unreason of their attitude. I have not attempted tocontrovert the main facts of Ireland's grievances, which they frequentlytold me they had gleaned from Froude and Lecky. I used to deprecate theunqualified application of modern standards to the policies of otherdays, and to protest against the injustice of punishing one set ofpersons for the misdoings of another set of persons, who have long sincepassed beyond the reach of any earthly tribunal. I have given them myreasons for believing that, even if such a course were morallyadmissible, the wit of man could not devise any means of inflicting ablow upon England which would not react injuriously with tenfold forceupon Ireland. I have gone on to show that the sentiment itself, largelythe accident of untoward circumstances, is alien to the character andtemperament of the Irish people. In short, I have urged that the policyof revenge is un-Christian and unintelligent, and, that, as the Irishpeople are neither irreligious nor stupid, it is un-Irish. I wellremember taking up this position in conversation with some very advancedIrish-Americans in the Far West and the reply which one of them made."Wal," said my half-persuaded friend, "mebbe you're right. I have twosons, whom I have raised in the expectation that they will one daystrike a blow for old Ireland. Mebbe they won't. I'm too old to change."I have chosen this incident from a long series of similar reminiscencesof my study of Irish life, to illustrate an attitude of mind, thehistorical explanation of which would seem to the practical Englishmanas academic as a psychological exposition of the effect of a red ragupon a bull. The English are not much to be blamed for resenting thesurvival of the feeling, but it appears to me to argue a singular lackof political imagination that they should still fail to appreciate thereality, the significance, and the abiding force of a sentiment whichhas so far successfully resisted the influence of those governingqualities which have played a foremost part in the civilisation of themodern world. The _Spectator_ some time ago came out bluntly with atruth which an Irishman may, I presume, quote without offence from sohigh an English authority:--"The one blunder of average Englishmen inconsidering foreign questions is that with white men they make toolittle allowance for sentiment, and with coloured men they make none atall."[2] I am afraid it must be added that 'average Englishmen' makeexactly the same blunder in under-estimating the force of sentiment whenconsidering Irish questions, with the not unnatural consequence thatthe Irish regard them as foreigners, and that, as those foreignershappen to govern them, the sentiment of nationality becomes politicaland anti-English.There is one reason why this sentiment is not allowed to die whichshould always be remembered by those who wish to grasp the innerworkings of the Irish mind. Briefly stated, the view prevails in Irelandthat in dealing with questions affecting our material well-being, thegovernment of our country by the English was, in the past, characterisedby an unenlightened self-interest. Thoughtful Englishmen admit thischarge, but they say that the past referred to is beyond living memoryand should now be buried. The Irish mind replies that the life of anation is not to be measured by the life of individuals, and that awrong inflicted by a Government upon a community entitles those whoinherit the consequences of the injury to claim reparation at the handsof those who inherit the government. With this attitude on the part ofthe Irish mind I am not only most heartily in sympathy, but I find everyEnglishman who understands the situation equally so. In the laterportions of this book it will be shown that practical recognition, in nosmall measure, has been given by England to the righteousness of thispart of the Irish case, and that if the effect thus produced has notfound as full an outward expression as might have been expected, theIrish people have at any rate responded to the new treatment in a mannerwhich must, in no distant future, bring about a better understanding.The only historical causes of our present discontents to which I neednow particularly refer, are the commercial restrictions and the landsystem of the past, which stand out from the long list of Irishgrievances as those for which their victims were the least responsible.No one can be more anxious than I am that we should cease to be for everseeking in the past excuses for our present failures. But it isessential to a correct estimation of Irish agricultural and industrialpossibilities that we should notice the true bearings of thesehistorical grievances upon existing conditions.In this connection there arises a question which is very pertinent tothe present inquiry and which must therefore be considered. I have seenit argued by English economists that the industrial revolution whichtook place at the end of the eighteenth and commencement of thenineteenth century would in any case have destroyed, by force of opencompetition, industries which, it is admitted, were previouslylegislated away. They point out that the change from the order of smallscattered home industries to the factory system would have suitedneither the temperament nor the industrial habits of the Irish. Theytell us that with the industrial revolution the juxtaposition of coaland iron became an all-important factor in the problem, and they recallhow the north and west of England captured the industrial supremacy fromthe south and east. Incidentally they point out that the people of theEnglish counties which suffered by these economic causes bracedthemselves to meet the changes, and it is suggested that if the peopleof Ireland had shown the same resourcefulness, they, too, might haveweathered the storm. And, finally, we are reminded that England, by herstupid Irish policy, punished her own supporters, and even herself,quite as much as the 'mere Irish.'Much of this may be true, but this line of argument only shows thatthese English economists do not thoroughly understand the real grievancewhich the Irish people still harbour against the English for pastmisgovernment. The commercial restraints sapped the industrial instinctof the people--an evil which was intensified in the case of theCatholics by the working of the penal laws. When these legislativerestrictions upon industry had been removed, the Irish, not beingtrained in industrial habits, were unable to adapt themselves to thealtered conditions produced by the Industrial Revolution, as did thepeople in England. And as for commerce, the restrictions, which had aslittle moral sanction as the penal laws, and which invested smugglingwith a halo of patriotism, had prevented the development of commercialmorality, without which there can be no commercial success. It is not,therefore, the destruction of specific industries, or even the sweepingof our commerce from the seas, about which most complaint is now made.The real grievance lies in the fact that something had been taken fromour industrial character which could not be remedied by the mere removalof the restrictions. Not only had the tree been stripped, but the rootshad been destroyed. If ever there was a case where President Kruger's'moral and intellectual damages' might fairly be claimed by an injurednation, it is to be found in the industrial and commercial history ofIreland during the period of the building up of England's commercialsupremacy.The English mind quite failed, until the very end of the nineteenthcentury, to grasp the real needs of the situation which had thus beencreated in Ireland The industrial revolution, as I have indicated, foundthe Irish people fettered by an industrial past for which theythemselves were not chiefly responsible. They needed exceptionaltreatment of a kind which was not conceded. They were, instead, stillfurther handicapped, towards the middle of the century, by the adoptionof Free Trade, which was imposed upon them when they were not onlyunable to take advantage of its benefits, but were so situated as tosuffer to the utmost from its inconveniences.I am convinced that the long-continued misunderstanding of theconditions and needs of this country, the withholding, for so long, ofnecessary concessions, was due not to heartlessness or contempt so muchas to a lack of imagination, a defect for which the English cannot beblamed. They had, to use a modern term, 'standardised' their qualities,and it was impossible to get out of their minds the belief that adivergence, in another race, from their standard of character wassynonymous with inferiority. This attitude is not yet a thing of thepast, but it is fast disappearing; and thoughtful Englishmen nowrecognise the righteousness of the claim for reparation, and are willingliberally to apply any stimulus to our industrial life which may placeus, so far as this is possible, on the level we might have occupied hadwe been left to work out our own economic salvation. Unfortunately, allEnglishmen are not thoughtful, and hence I emphasise the fact thatEngland is largely responsible for our industrial defects, and must nothesitate to face the financial results of that responsibility.When we pass from the domain of commerce, where we have seen thatcircumstances reduced to the minimum Ireland's participation in theindustrial supremacy of England, and come to examine the historicaldevelopment of Irish agrarian life, we find a situation closely relatedto, and indeed, largely created by, that which we have been discussing.'Debarred from every other trade and industry,' wrote the late LordDufferin, 'the entire nation flung itself back upon the land, with asfatal an impulse as when a river, whose current is suddenly impeded,rolls back and drowns the valley which it once fertilised.' Theenergies, the hopes, nay, the very existence of the race, became thusintimately bound up with agriculture. This industry, their last resortand sole dependence, had to be conducted by a people who in every otheravocation had been unfitted for material success. And this industry,too, was crippled from without, for a system of land tenure had beenimposed upon Ireland that was probably the most effective that couldhave been devised for the purpose of perpetuating and accentuating everydisability to which other causes had given rise.The Irish land system suffered from the same ills as we all know thepolitical institutions to have suffered from--a partial and intermittentconquest. Land holding in Ireland remained largely based on the tribalsystem of open fields and common tillage for nearly eight hundred yearsafter collective ownership had begun to pass away in England. The suddenimposition upon the Irish, early in the seventeenth century, of a landsystem which was no part of the natural development of the country,ignored, though it could not destroy, the old feeling of communisticownership, and, when this vanished, it did not vanish as it did incountries where more normal conditions prevailed. It did not perish likea piece of outworn tissue pushed off by a new growth from within: on thecontrary, it was arbitrarily cut away while yet fresh and vital, withthe result that where a bud should have been there was a scar.This sudden change in the system of land-holding was followed by acentury of reprisals and confiscations, and what war began the lawcontinued. The Celtic race, for the most part impoverished in mind andestate by the penal laws, became rooted to the soil, for, as we haveseen, they had, on account of the repression of industries, noalternative occupation, and so became, in fact, if not in law,_adscripti glebae_. Upon the productiveness of their labour thelandlord depended for his revenues, but he did little to develop thatproductiveness, and the system which was introduced did everything tolessen it.[3] The wound produced by the original confiscation of theland was kept from healing by the way in which the tenants' improvementswere somewhat similarly treated. I do not mean that they weresystematically confiscated--the Devon and Bessborough Commissions, aswell as Gladstone, bore witness to the contrary--but the right and theoccasional exercise of the right to confiscate operated in the same way.In the Irish tenant's mind dispossession was nine-tenths of the law.An enlightened system of land tenure might have made prosperity andcontentment the lot of the native race, and, perhaps, have renderedpossible such a solution of the Irish problem as was effected betweenEngland and Scotland two centuries ago. What was chiefly required foragrarian peace was a recognition of that sense of partnership in theland--a relic of the tribal days--to which the Irish mind tenaciouslyadhered. But, like most English concessions, it was not granted untiltoo late, and then granted in the wrong way. The natural result wasthat, when at last the recognition of partnership was enacted, it becamea lever for a demand for complete ownership. But this was the aftermath,for in the meantime, from the seed sown by English blundering,Ireland--native population and English garrison alike--had reaped theawful harvest of the Irish famine, which was followed by a long darkwinter of discontent. Upon the England that sowed the wind there wasvisited a whirlwind of hostility from the Irish race scatteredthroughout the globe.It would be altogether outside the scope or purpose of this chapter topresent a complete history of the remedial legislation applied to Irishland tenure. That history, however, illustrates so vividly the Englishmisunderstanding, that a short survey of one phase of it may help topoint the moral. The English intellect at long last began to grasp theagrarian, though not the industrial side of the wrong that had been doneto Ireland, and the English conscience was moved; there came the era ofconcessions to which I have alluded, and for over a quarter of a centuryattempts, often generous, if not very discriminating, were made to dealwith the situation. In 1870, dispossession was made very costly to thelandlord. In 1881, it became impossible, except on the tenant's default,and the partnership was fully recognised, the tenant's share being madehis own to sell, and being preserved for his profitable use by a rightto have the rent payable to his sleeping partner, the landlord, fixed bya judicial tribunal. These rights were the famous three F's--fixity oftenure, free sale, and fair rent--of the Magna Charta of the Irishpeasant. If these concessions had only been made in time, they wouldprobably have led to a strengthening of the economic position andcharacter of the Irish tenantry, which would have enabled them to takefull advantage of their new status, and meet any condition which mightarise; and it is just possible that the system might have worked well,even at the eleventh hour, had it been launched on a rising market.Unhappily, it fell upon evil days. The prosperous times of Irishagriculture, which culminated a few years before the passing of the'Tenants' Charter,' were followed by a serious reaction, the result ofcauses which, though long operative, were only then beginning to makethemselves felt, and some of which, though the fact was not thengenerally recognised, were destined to be of no temporary character. Theagricultural depression which has continued ever since was due, as isnow well known, to foreign competition, or, in other words, to theopening up of vast areas in the Far West to the plough and herd, and thebringing of the products of distant countries into the home markets inever-increasing quantity, in ever fresher condition, and at anever-decreasing cost of transportation. Great changes were taking placein the market which the Irish farmer supplied, and no two men couldagree as to the relative influence of the new factors of the problem, oras to their probable duration.Whatever may be said in disparagement of the great experiment commencedin 1881, there can be no doubt that it enormously improved the legalposition of the Irish tenantry, and I, for one, regard it as anecessary contribution to the events whose logic was finally to bringabout the abolition of dual ownership. But what a curious instance ofthe irony of fate is afforded by this genuine attempt to heal an Irishsore, what a commentary it is upon the English misunderstanding of theIrish mind! Mr. Gladstone found the land system intolerable to oneparty; he made it intolerable to the other also. For half a century_laissez-faire_ was pedantically applied to Irish agriculture, thensuddenly the other extreme was adopted; nothing was left alone, andpolitical economy was sent on its famous planetary excursion.When Mr. Gladstone was attempting to settle the land question on thebasis of dual ownership, the seed of a new kind of singleownership--peasant proprietorship--was sown through the influence ofJohn Bright. The operations of the land purchase clauses in the ChurchDisestablishment Act of 1869, and the Land Acts of 1870 and 1881, wereenormously extended by the Land Purchase Acts introduced by theConservative Party in 1885 and in 1891, and the success which attendedthese Acts accentuated the defects and sealed the fate of dualownership, which all parties recently united to destroy. In other words,Parliament has been undoing a generation's legislative work upon theIrish land question.This is all I need say about that stage of the Irish agrarian situationat which we have now arrived. What I wish my readers to bear in mind isthat the effect of a bad system of land tenure upon the other aspects ofthe Irish Question reaches much further back than the struggles,agitations, and reforms in connection with Irish land which thisgeneration has witnessed. The same may be said with regard to the othereconomic grievances. No one can be more anxious than I am to fasten themind of my countrymen upon the practical things of to-day, and to weantheir sad souls from idle regrets over the sorrows of the past. If Irevive these dead issues, it is because I have learned that no man canmove the Irish mind to action unless he can see its point of view, whichis largely retrospective. I cannot ignore the fact that the attitude ofmind which causes the Irish people to put too much faith in legislativecures for economic ills is mainly due to the belief that their ancestorswere the victims of a long series of laws by which every industry thatmight have made the country prosperous was jealously repressed orruthlessly destroyed. Those who are not too much appalled by thequantity to examine into the quality of popular oratory in Ireland arefamiliar with the subordination of present economic issues to the drearyreiteration of this old tale of woe. Personally I have always held thatto foster resentment in respect of these old wrongs is as stupid as wasthe policy which gave them birth; and, even if it were possible todistribute the blame among our ancestors, I am sure we should doourselves much harm, and no living soul any good, in the reckoning. Inmy view, Anglo-Irish history is for Englishmen to remember, for Irishmento forget.I may now conclude my appeal to outside observers for a broader and morephilosophic view of my country and my countrymen with a suggestion bornof my own early mistakes, and with a word of warning which is called forby my later observation of the mistakes of others. The difficulty of theoutside observer in understanding the Irish Question is, no doubt,largely due to the fact that those in intimate touch with the actualconditions are so dominated by vehement and passionate conviction thatreason is not only at a discount but is fatal to the acquisition ofpopular influence. Of course the power of knowledge and thought, thoughkept in the background, is not really eliminated. But it is in thecircumstances not unnatural that most of us should fall into the errorof attributing to the influence of prominent individuals ororganisations the events and conditions which the superficial observerregards as the creation of the hour, but which are in reality theoutcome of a slow and continuous process of evolution. I remember as aboy being captivated by that charming corrective to this view ofhistorical development, Buckle's _History of Civilization_, which inrecent years has often recurred to my mind, despite the fact that manyof his theories are now somewhat discredited. Buckle, if I rememberright, almost eliminates the personal factor in the life of nations.According to his theory, it would not have made much difference tomodern civilisation if Napoleon had happened, as was so near being thecase, to be born a British instead of a French subject. It would alsohave followed that if O'Connell had limited his activities to hisprofessional work, or if Parnell had chanced to hate Ireland as bitterlyas he hated England, we should have been, politically, very much wherewe are to-day. The student of Irish affairs should, of course, avoid theextreme views of historical causation; but in the search for the truthhe will, I think, be well advised to attach less significance to theinfluence of prominent personality than is the practice of the ordinaryobserver in Ireland.The warning I have to offer, I think, will be justified by a reflectionupon the history of the panaceas which we have been offered, and uponour present state. To those of my British readers who honestly desire tounderstand the Irish Question, I would say, let them eschew the sweepinggeneralisations by which Irish intelligence is commonly outraged. I maypass by the explanation which rests upon the cheap attribution of racialinferiority with the simple reply that our inferior race has much of thesuperior blood in its veins; yet the Irish problem is just as acute indistricts where the English blood predominates as where the people are'mere Irish.' If this view be disputed, the matter is not worth arguingabout, because we cannot be born again. But there are three other commonexplanations of the Irish difficulty, any one of which taken by itselfonly leads away from the truth. I refer, I need hardly say, to thefamiliar assertions that the origin of the evil is political, that it isreligious, or that it is neither one nor the other, but economic. InIrish history, no doubt, we may find, under any of these heads, causeenough for much of our present wrong-goings. But I am profoundlyconvinced that each of the simple explanations to which I have justalluded--the racial, the political, the religious, the economic--isbased upon reasoning from imperfect knowledge of the facts of Irishlife. The cause and cure of Irish ills are not chiefly political,broaden or narrow our conception of politics as we will; they are notchiefly religious, whatever be the effect of Roman Catholic influenceupon the practical side of the people's life; they are not chieflyeconomic, be the actual poverty of the people and the potential wealthof the country what they may. The Irish Question is a broad and deeplyinteresting human problem which has baffled generation after generationof a great and virile race, who complacently attribute their incapacityto master it to Irish perversity, and pass on, leaving it unsolved byAnglo-Saxons, and therefore insoluble!FOOTNOTES:[1] My own experience confirms Mr. Lecky's view of the chief cause ofthis extraordinary feeling. "It is probable," he writes, "that the truesource of the savage hatred of England that animates great bodies ofIrishmen on either side of the Atlantic has very little real connectionwith the penal laws, or the rebellion, or the Union. It is far more dueto the great clearances and the vast unaided emigrations that followedthe famine."--_Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland_, Vol. II., p, 177.[2] _Spectator_, 6th September, 1902.[3] The title to the greater part of Irish land is based onconfiscation. This is true of many other countries, but what wasexceptional in the Irish confiscations was that the grantees for themost part did not settle on the lands themselves, drive away thedispossessed, or come to any rational working agreement with them.CHAPTER II.THE IRISH QUESTION IN IRELAND.Whilst attributing the long continued failure of English rule in Irelandlargely to a misunderstanding of the Irish mind, I have givenEngland--at least modern England--credit for good intentions towards us.I now come to the case of the misunderstood, and shall from henceforthbe concerned with the immeasurably greater responsibility of the Irishpeople themselves for their own welfare. The most characteristic, and byfar the most hopeful feature of the change in the Anglo-Irish situationwhich took place in the last decade of the nineteenth century, and uponthe meaning of which I dwelt in the preceding chapter, is the growingsense amongst us that the English misunderstanding of Ireland is of farless importance, and perhaps less inexcusable, than our ownmisunderstanding of ourselves.When I first came into practical touch with the extraordinarily complexproblems of Irish life, nothing impressed me so much as the universalbelief among my countrymen that Providence had endowed them withcapacities of a high order, and their country with resources ofunbounded richness, but that both the capacities and the resourcesremained undeveloped owing to the stupidity--or worse--of British rule.It was asserted, and generally taken for granted, that the exiles ofErin sprang to the front in every walk of life throughout the world, inevery country but their own--though I notice that in quite recent timesendeavours have been made to cool the emigration fever by painting thefortunes of the Irish in America in the darkest colours. To suggest thatthere was any use in trying at home to make the best of things as theywere was indicative of a leaning towards British rule; and to attempt togive practical effect to such a heresy was to draw a red herring acrossthe path of true Nationalism.It is not easy to account for the long continuance of this attitude ofthe Irish mind towards Irish problems, which seems unworthy of thenative intelligence of the people. The truth probably is that while wehave not allowed our intellectual gifts to decay, they have been oflittle use to us because we have neglected the second part of the oldScholastic rule of life, and have failed to develop the moral qualitiesin which we are deficient. Hence we have developed our criticalfaculties, not, unhappily, along constructive lines. We have beenthroughout alive to the muddling of our affairs by the English, and haveaccurately gauged the incapacity of our governors to appreciate ourneeds and possibilities. But we recognised their incapacity more readilythan our own deficiencies, and we estimated the failure of the Englishfar more justly than we apportioned the responsibility between ourrulers and ourselves. The sense of the duty and dignity of labour hasbeen lost in the contemplation of circumstances over which it wasassumed that we have no control.It is a peculiarity of destructive criticism that, unlike charity, itgenerally begins and ends abroad; and those who cultivate the gentle artare seldom given to morbid introspection. Our prodigious ignorance aboutourselves has not been blissful. Mistaking self-assertion forself-knowledge, we have presented the pathetic spectacle of a peoplecasting the blame for their shortcomings on another people, yet bearingthe consequences themselves. The national habit of living in the pastseems to give us a present without achievement, a future without hope.The conclusion was long ago forced upon me that whatever may have beentrue of the past, the chief responsibility for the remoulding of ournational life rests now with ourselves, and that in the last analysisthe problem of Irish ineffectiveness at home is in the main a problem ofcharacter--and of Irish character.I am quite aware that such a diagnosis of our mind disease--from whichIreland is, in my belief, slowly but surely recovering--will not passunchallenged, but I would ask any reader who dissents from this view totake a glance at the picture of our national life as it might unfolditself to an unprejudiced but sympathetic outsider who came to Irelandnot on a political tour but with a sincere desire to get at the truth ofthe Irish Question, and to inquire into the conditions about which allthe controversy continues to rage.This hypothetical traveller would discover that our resources are buthalf developed, and yet hundreds of thousands of our workers have gone,and are still going, to produce wealth where it is less urgently needed.The remnant of the race who still cling to the old country are not onlynumerically weak, but in many other ways they show the physical andmoral effects of the drain which emigration has made on the youth,strength, and energy of the community. Our four and a quarter millionsof people, mainly agricultural, have, speaking generally, a very lowstandard of comfort, which they like to attribute to some five or sixmillions sterling paid as agricultural rent, and three millions ofalleged over-taxation. They face the situation bravely--and,incidentally, swell the over-taxation--with the help of the thirteen orfourteen millions worth of alcoholic stimulants which they annuallyconsume. The still larger consumption in Great Britain may seem to lendat least a respectability to this apparent over-indulgence, but it looksodd. The people are endowed with intellectual capacities of a highorder. They have literary gifts and an artistic sense. Yet, with a fewbrilliant exceptions, they contribute nothing to invention and createnothing in literature or in art. One would say that there must besomething wrong with the education of the country; and most peopledeclare that it is too literary, though the Census returns show thatthere are still large numbers who escape the tyranny of books. Thepeople have an extraordinary belief in political remedies for economicills; and their political leaders, who are not as a rule themselvesactively engaged in business life, tell the people, pointing to ruinedmills and unused water power, that the country once had diversifiedindustries, and that if they were allowed to apply their panacea,Ireland would quickly rebuild her industrial life. If our hypotheticaltraveller were to ask whether there are no other leaders in the countrybesides the eloquent gentlemen who proclaim her helplessness, he wouldbe told that among the professional classes, the landlords, and thecaptains of industry, are to be found as competent popular advisers asare possessed by any other country of similar economic standing. Butthese men take only a dilettante part in politics, and no value is seton industrial, commercial or professional success in the choice ofpublic men. Can it be that to the Irish mind politics are, what BulwerLytton declared love to be, "the business of the idle, and the idlenessof the busy"?These, though only a few of the strange ironies of Irish life, are soparadoxical and so anomalous that they are not unnaturally attributed tothe intrusion of an alien and unfriendly power; and this furnishes thereason why everything which goes wrong is used to nourish theanti-English sentiment. At the same time they give emphasis to thegrowing doubt as to the wisdom of those to whom the Irish Questionpresents itself only as a single and simple issue--namely, whether thelaws which are to put all these things right shall be made at St.Stephen's by the collective wisdom of the United Kingdom, aided by thevoice of Ireland--which is adequately represented--or whether these lawsshall be made by Irishmen alone in a Parliament in College Green.It is obviously necessary that, in presenting a comprehensive scheme fordealing with the conditions I have roughly indicated. I should make somereference to the attitude towards Home Rule of both the Nationalists andthe Unionists who have joined in work which, whatever be itsirregularity from the standpoint of party discipline as enforced inIreland, has succeeded in some degree in directing the energies of ourcountrymen to the development of the resources of our country. Many ofmy fellow-workers were Nationalists who, while stoutly adhering to theprime necessity for constitutional changes, took the broad view, whichwas unpopular among the Irish Party, that much could be done, even underpresent conditions, to build up our national life on its social,intellectual, and economic sides. The well-known constitutional changeswhich were advocated in the political party to which they belonged wouldthen, they believed, be more effectively demanded by Ireland, and morereadily conceded by England. Unionists who worked with me were similarlyaffected by the changing mental outlook of the country. They, too, hadto break loose from the traditions of an Irish party, for they felt thatthe exclusively political opposition to Home Rule was not lessdemoralising than the exclusively political pursuit of Home Rule. Justas the Nationalists who joined the movement believed that all progressmust make for self-government, so my Unionist fellow-workers believedit would ultimately strengthen the Union. Each view was thoroughly soundfrom the standpoint of those who held it, and could be regarded withrespect by those who did not. We were all convinced that the way toachieve what is best for Ireland was to develop what is best inIrishmen. And it was the conviction that this can be done by Irishmen inIreland that brought together those whose thought and work supplieswhatever there may be of interest in this book.If I have fairly stated the attitude towards each other of the workersto whose coming together must be attributed as much of the change in theIrish situation as is due to Irish initiation, it will be seen that whathad so long kept them apart in public affairs, outside politics, was adifference of opinion, not so much as to the conditions to be dealtwith, nor, indeed, as to the end to be sought, but rather as to themeans most effective for the attainment of that end. I naturally regardthe view which I am putting forward as being broader than that which hashitherto prevailed. Some Nationalists may, however, contend that it isessential to progress that the thoughts and energies of the nationshould be focussed upon a single movement, and not dissipated in thepursuit of a multiplicity of ideals. I quite admit the importance ofconcentration. But I strongly hold that any movement which is closelyrelated to the main currents of the people's life and subservient totheir urgent economic necessities, and which gives free play to theintellectual qualities, while strengthening the moral or industrialcharacter, cannot be held to conflict with any national programme ofwork, without raising a strong presumption that there is something wrongwith the programme. The exclusively political remedy I shall discuss inthe next chapter, but here I propose to consider some of the problemswhich the new movement seeks to solve without waiting for the politicalmillenium.It is a commonplace that there are two Irelands, differing in race, increed, in political aspiration, and in what I regard as a more potentfactor than all the others put together--economic interest andindustrial pursuit. In the mutual misunderstanding of these twoIrelands, still more than in the misunderstanding of Ireland by England,is to be found the chief cause of the still unsettled state of the IrishQuestion. I shall not seek to apportion the blame between the twosections of the population; but as the mists clear away and we can beginto construct a united and contented Ireland, it is not only legitimate,but helpful in the extreme, to assign to the two sections of ourwealth-producers their respective parts in repairing the fortunes oftheir country. In such a discussion of future developments chiefprominence must necessarily be given to the problems affecting the lifeof the majority of the people, who depend directly on the land, andconduct the industry which produces by far the greater portion of thewealth of the country. It is, of course, essential to the prosperity ofthe whole community that the North should pursue and further developits own industrial and commercial life. That section of the communityhas also, no doubt, economic and educational problems to face, but theseare much the same problems as those of industrial communities in otherparts of the United Kingdom[4]; and if they do not receive, vitallyimportant as is their solution to the welfare of Ireland, any largeshare of attention in this book, it is because they are no part of whatis ordinarily understood by the Irish Question.Nevertheless, the interest of the manufacturing population of Ulster inthe welfare of the Roman Catholic agricultural majority is not merelythat of an onlooker, nor even that of the other parts of the UnitedKingdom, but something more. It is obvious that the internal trade ofthe country depends mainly upon the demand of the rural population forthe output of the manufacturing towns, and that this demand must dependon the volume of agricultural production. I think the importance ofdeveloping the home market has not been sufficiently appreciated, evenby Belfast. The best contribution the Ulster Protestant population canmake to the solution of this question is to do what they can to bringabout cordial co-operation between the two great sections of thewealth-producers of Ireland. They should, I would suggest, learn to takea broader and more patriotic view of the problems of the Roman Catholicand agricultural majority, upon the true nature of which I hope to beable to throw some new light. My purpose will be doubly served if Ihave, to some extent, brought home to the minds of my Northern friendsthat there is in Ireland an unsettled question in which they are largelyconcerned, a rightly unsatisfied people by helping whom they can besthelp themselves.The Irish Question is, then, in that aspect which must be to Irishmen ofparamount importance, the problem of a national existence, chiefly anagricultural existence, in Ireland. To outside observers it is thequestion of rural life, a question which is assuming a social andeconomic importance and interest of the most intense character, not onlyfor Ireland North and South, but for almost the whole civilised world.It is becoming increasingly difficult in many parts of the world to keepthe people on the land, owing to the enormously improved industrialopportunities and enhanced social and intellectual advantages of urbanlife. The problem can be better examined in Ireland than elsewhere, forwith us it can, to a large extent, be isolated, since we have littlehighly developed town life. Our rural exodus takes our people, for themost part, not into Irish or even into British towns, but into those ofthe United States. What is migration in other countries is emigrationwith us, and the mind of the country, brooding over the drearystatistics of this perennial drain, naturally and longingly turns toschemes for the rehabilitation of rural life--the only life it knows.We cannot exercise much direct influence upon the desire to emigratebeyond spreading knowledge as to the real conditions of life in America,for which home life in Ireland is often ignorantly bartered.[5] Wecannot isolate the phenomenon of emigration and find a cure for it apartfrom the rest of the Irish Question. We must recognise that emigrationis but the chief symptom of a low national vitality, and that the firstresult of our efforts to stay the tide may increase the outflow. Wecannot fit the people to stay without fitting them to go. Before we cankeep the people at home we have got to construct a national life with,in the first place, a secure basis of physical comfort and decency. Thislife must have a character, a dignity, an outlook of its own. Acomfortable Boeotia will never develop into a real Hibernia Pacata. Thestandard of living may in some ways be lower than the English standard:in some ways it may be higher. But even if statesmanship and all theforces of philanthropy and patriotism combined can construct a contentedrural Ireland for the people, it can only be maintained by the people.It will have to accord with the national sentiment and be distinctivelyIrish. It is this national aspiration, and the remarkable promise of themovements making for its fruition, which give to the work of Irishsocial and economic reform the fascination which those who do not knowthe Ireland of to-day cannot understand. This work of reform must, ofcourse, be primarily economic, but economic remedies cannot be appliedto Irish ills without the spiritual aids which are required to move toaction the latent forces of Irish reason and emotion.       *       *       *       *       *The task which we have to face is, then, a two-sided one, but itseconomic and its purely practical aspects first demand consideration.Many even of the agrarian aspects of the question have, so far, beensomewhat neglected in Ireland owing to a cause which is not far to seek.It has often been asserted that the Irish Question is, at bottom, theLand Question. There is a great deal of truth in this view, but almostall those who hold it have fallen into the grave error of tacitlyidentifying the land question with the tenure question--an error whichvitiates a great deal of current theorising about Ireland. It was,indeed, inevitable that Irish agriculturists, with such an economichistory behind them as I have outlined in the previous chapter, shouldhave concentrated their attention during the latter half of thenineteenth century upon obtaining a legislative cure for the illsproduced by legislation, to the comparative neglect of those equallydifficult, if less obvious economic questions, which have been broughtinto special prominence by the agricultural depression of the lastquarter of a century. Now, however, that the Land Act of 1903 has beenpassed and the solution of the tenure question is in sight, we inIreland are more free to direct our attention to what is at present themost important aspect of the agrarian situation--the necessity fordetermining the social and economic conditions essential to thewell-being of the peasant proprietary, which, though it is to be startedwith as bright an outlook as the law can give, must stand or fall by itsown inherent merits or defects. Not only are we now free to giveadequate consideration to this question, but it is also imperative thatwe should do so, for whilst I am hopeful that the Land Act will settlethe question of tenure, it will obviously not merely leave the otherproblems of agricultural existence--problems some of which are notunknown in other parts of the United Kingdom--still unsolved, but willalso increase the necessity for their solution, and will, moreover,bring in its train complex difficulties of its own.The main features of the depressing outlook of rural life in the UnitedKingdom are well known. The land steadily passes from under the ploughand is given over to stock raising. As the kine increase the men decay.In Ireland the rural exodus takes, as I have already said, the shape,mainly, not of migration to Irish urban centres, but rather the uglierform of an emigration which not only depletes our population but drainsit of the very elements which can least be spared.The reason generally given for the widespread resort to the lotus-eatingoccupation of opening and shutting gates, in preference to tilling thesoil, is that in the existing state of agricultural organisation, andwhile urban life is ever drawing away labour from the fields, thesubstitution of pasturage for tillage is the readiest way to meet theruinous competition of Eastern Europe, the Western Hemisphere, andAustralasia. Yet upon the economic merits of this process I have heardthe most diverse opinions stated with equal conviction by men thoroughlywell informed as to the conditions. One of the largest graziers inIreland recently gave me a picture of what he considered to be an idealeconomic state for the country. If two more Belfasts could beestablished on the east coast, and the rest of the country divided intofive hundred acre farms, grazing being adopted wherever permanent grasswould grow, the limits of Irish productivity would be reached. On theother hand, Dr. O'Donnell, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Raphoe, who maybe taken as an authoritative exponent of the trend of popular thought inthe country, not long ago advocated ploughing the grazing lands ofLeinster right up to the slopes of Tara.[6] Moreover, many theories havebeen advanced to show that the decline of tillage, whatever be itscause, involves an enormous waste of national resources. But ofpractical suggestion, making for a remedy, there is very littleforthcoming.The solution of all such problems largely depends upon certaindevelopments which, for many reasons, I regard as absolutely essentialto the success of the new agrarian order. One of these developments isthe spread of agricultural co-operation through voluntary associations.Without this agency of social and economic progress, small landholdersin Ireland will be but a body of isolated units, having all thedrawbacks of individualism, and none of its virtues, unorganised andsingularly ill-equipped for that great international struggle of ourtime, which we know as agricultural competition. Moreover, there isanother equally important, if less obvious, consideration which rendersurgent the organisation of our rural communities. From Russia, with itshalf-communistic Mir to France with its modern village commune, there isno country in Europe except the United Kingdom where the peasantland-holders have not some form of corporate existence. In Ireland thetransition from landlordism to a peasant proprietary not only does notcreate any corporate existence among the occupying peasantry but ratherdeprives them of the slight social coherence which they formerlypossessed as tenants of the same landlord. The estate office has itsuses as well as its disadvantages, and the landlord or agent is by nomeans without his value as a business adviser to those from whom hecollects the rent.The organisation of the peasantry by an extension of voluntaryassociations, which is a condition precedent of social and economicprogress, will not, however, suffice to enable them to face and solvethe problems with which they are confronted, and whose solution has nowbecome a matter of very serious concern to the British taxpayer. Thecondition of our agrarian life clearly indicates the necessity forsupplementing voluntary effort with a sound system of State aid toagriculture and industry--a necessity fully recognised by thegovernments of every progressive continental country and of our owncolonies. An altogether hopeful beginning of combined self-help andState assistance has been already made. Those who have been studyingthese problems, and practically preparing the way for the proper care ofa peasant proprietary, have overcome the chief obstacles which lay intheir path. They have gained popular acceptance for the principle thatState aid should not be resorted to until organised voluntary effort hasfirst been set in motion, and that any departure from this principlewould be an unwarrantable interference with the business of the people,a fatal blow to private enterprise.[7]The task before the people, and before the State, of placing the newagrarian order upon a permanent basis of decency and comfort is no lightone. Indeed, I doubt whether Parliament realises one-tenth of theproblems which the latest land legislation--by far the best we have yethad--leaves unsolved. This becomes only too clear the moment we considerseriously the fundamental question of the relation of population to areain rural Ireland, or, in other words, when we inquire how many peoplethe agricultural land will support under existing circumstances, orunder any attainable improvement of the conditions in our rural life.Roughly speaking, the surface area of the island is 20,000,000 acres, ofwhich 5,000,000 are described in the official returns as 'barrenmountain, bog and waste.' This leaves us with some 15,000,000 acresavailable for agriculture and grazing, which area is now divided intosome 500,000 holdings. Thus we have an average of thirty acres in extentfor the Irish agricultural holding. But, unhappily, the returns showthat some 200,000 of these holdings are from one to fifteen acres inextent. Nor do the mere figures show the case at its worst. For ithappens that the small holdings in Ireland, unlike those on theContinent, are generally on the poorest land, and the majority of themcannot come within any of the definitions of an 'economic holding.'These 200,000 holdings, the homes of nearly a million persons, threatento prove the greatest danger to the future of agricultural Ireland. Asthe majority of them, as at present constituted, do not provide thephysical basis of a decent standard of living, the question arises, howare they to be improved? Putting aside emigration, which at one periodwas necessary and ought to have been aided and controlled by the State,but which is now no longer a statesman's remedy, there is obviously nosolution except by the migration of a portion of the occupiers, and theutilisation of the vacated holdings in order to enable the peasants whoremain to prosper--much as a forest is thinned to promote the growth oftrees. In typical congested districts this operation will have to becarried out on a much larger scale than is generally realised, for aconsiderable majority of families will have to be removed, in order toallow a sufficient margin for the provision of adequate holdings forthose who remain. In some cases, there are large grazing tracts in closeproximity to the congested area which might be utilised for there-settlement, but where this is not so and the occupiers of the vacatedholdings have to migrate a considerable distance, the problem becomesfar more difficult. I need not dwell upon the administrativedifficulties of the operation, which are not light. I may assume, also,that there will be no difficulty in obtaining suitable land somewhere. Ido not myself attach much weight to the unwillingness of the people toleave their old holdings for better ones, or to the alleged objection ofthe clergy to allow their parishioners to go to another parish. Moreserious is the possible opposition of those who live in the vicinity ofthe unoccupied land about to be distributed, and who feel that they havethe first claim upon the State in any scheme for its redistribution withthe help of public credit. Mr. Parnell promoted a company with the soleobject of practically demonstrating how this problem could be solved. Alarge capital was raised, and a large estate purchased; but the companydid not effect the migration of a single family. Still these are minorconsiderations compared with the larger one, to which I must brieflyrefer.Under the Land Act of 1903 much has been done to facilitate the transferof peasants to new farms, but it is obvious that land cannot be handedover as a gift from the State to the families which migrate. They willbecome debtors for the value of the land itself, less perhaps a smallsum which may be credited to them in respect of the tenant's interest inthe holdings they have abandoned. This deduction will, however, be lostin the expenditure required upon houses, buildings, fences, and otherimprovements which would have to be effected before the land could beprofitably occupied. Speaking generally they will have no money oragricultural implements, and their live stock will in many cases bemortgaged to the local shopkeeper who has always financed them. It willbe necessary for the future welfare of the country to give them landwhich admits of cultivation upon the ordinary principles of modernagriculture; but without working capital, and bringing with them neitherthe skill nor the habits necessary for the successful conduct of theirindustry under the new conditions, it will be no easy task to place themin a position to discharge their obligations to the State. It is allvery easy to talk about the obvious necessity of giving more land tocultivators who have not enough to live upon; and there is, no doubt, apoetic justice in the Utopian agrarianism which dangles before the eyesof the Connaught peasantry the alternative of Heaven or Leinster. Butwhen we come down to practical economics, and face the task of giving toa certain number of human beings, in an extremely backward industrialcondition, the opportunity of placing themselves and their families on abasis of permanent well-being, it will be evident that, so far, at anyrate, as this particular community is concerned, the mere provision ofan economic holding is after all but a part of an economic existence.I have touched upon this question of migration from uneconomic toeconomic holdings because it signally illustrates the importance of thehuman, in contradistinction to the merely material considerationsinvolved in the solution of the many-sided Irish Question. I must nowreturn to the wider question of the relation of population to area inrural Ireland, as it affects the general scheme of agricultural andindustrial development.It is obvious that there must be a limit to the number of individualsthat the land can support. Allowing an average of five members for eachfamily, and allowing for a considerable number of landless labourers, itseems that the land at present directly supports about 2,500,000persons--a view which, I may add, is fully borne out by the figures ofthe recent census; and it is hard to see how a population living byagriculture can be much increased beyond this number. Even if all theland in Ireland were available for re-distribution in equal shares, thehigher standard of comfort to which it is essential that the conditionof our people should be raised would forbid the existence of much morethan half a million peasant proprietors.[8] Hence the evergreen query,'What shall we do with our boys?' remains to be answered; for while theabolition of dual ownership will enable the present generation to bringup their children according to a higher standard of living, the changewill not of itself provide a career for the children when they have beenbrought up. The next generation will have to face this problem:--theaverage farm can support only one of the children and his family, whatis to become of the others? The law forbids sub-division for twogenerations, and after that, _ex hypothesi_, the then prevailingconditions of life will also prevent such partition. A few of the nextgeneration may become agricultural labourers, but this involvesdescending to the lowest standard of living of to-day, and in any casethe demand for agricultural labourers is not capable of much extensionin a country of small peasant proprietors.Against this view I know it is pointed out that in the earlier part ofthe nineteenth century the agricultural population of Ireland was aslarge as is the total population of to-day; but we know the sequel.Instances are also cited of peasant proprietaries in foreign countrieswhich maintain a high standard of living upon small, sometimesdiminutive, and highly-rented holdings. We must remember, however, thatin these foreign countries State intervention has undoubtedly done muchto render possible a prosperous peasant proprietary by, for example, thedissemination of useful information, admirable systems of technicaleducation in agriculture, cheap and expeditious transport, and evenState attention to the distribution of agricultural produce in distantmarkets. Again, in many of these countries rural life is balanced by ahighly industrial town life, as, for instance, in the case of Belgium;or is itself highly industrialised by the existence of rural industries,as in the case of Switzerland; while in one notable instance--that ofWuerttemberg--both these conditions prevail.The true lesson to be drawn from these foreign analogies is that not byagriculture alone is Ireland to be saved. The solution of the ruralproblem embraces many spheres of national activity. It involves, as Ihave already said, the further development of manufactures in Irishtowns. One of the best ways to stimulate our industries is to developthe home market by means of an increased agricultural production, and ahigher standard of comfort among the peasant producers. We shall thusbe, so to speak, operating on consumption as well as on production, andso increasing the home demand for Irish manufactures. Perhaps moreurgent than the creation or extension of manufactures on a larger scaleis the development of industries subsidiary to agriculture in thecountry. This is generally admitted, and most people have a fairknowledge of the wide and varied range of peasant industries in allEuropean countries where a prosperous peasantry exists. Nor is theremuch difficulty in agreeing upon the main conditions to be satisfied inthe selection of the industries to meet the requirements of our case.The men and boys require employment in the winter months, or they willnot stay, and the rural industries promoted should, as far as possible,be those which allow of intermittent attention. The female members ofthe family must have profitable and congenial employment. Thehandicrafts to be promoted must be those which will give scope to thenative genius and aesthetic sense. But unless we can thus supply thedemand of the peasant-industry market with products of merit ordistinctiveness, we shall fail in competition with the hereditary skilland old established trade of peasant proprietors which have solved thispart of the problem generations ago. This involves the vigorousapplication of a class of instruction of which something will be saidin the proper place.So far the rural industry problem, and the direction in which itssolution is to be found, are fairly clear. But there is one disadvantagewith which we have to reckon, and which for many other reasons besidesthe one I am now immediately concerned with, we must seek to remove. Acommunity does not naturally or easily produce for export that for whichit has itself no use, taste, or desire. Whatever latent capacity forartistic handicrafts the Irish peasant may possess, it is very rarelythat one finds any spontaneous attempt to give outward expression to theinward aesthetic sense. And this brings me to a strange aspect of Irishlife to which I have often wished, on the proper occasion, to drawpublic attention. The matter arises now in the form of a peculiardifficulty which lies in the path of those who endeavour to solve theproblem of rural life in Ireland, and which, in my belief, hasprofoundly affected the fortunes of the race both at home and abroad.To a sympathetic insight there is a singular and significant void in theIrish conception of a home--I mean the lack of appreciation for thecomforts of a home, which might never have been apparent to me had itnot obtruded itself in the form of a hindrance to social and economicprogress.[9] In the Irish love of home, as in the larger nationalaspirations, the ideal has but a meagre material basis, its appeal beingessentially to the social and intellectual instincts. It is not thephysical environment and comfort of an orderly home that enchain andattract minds still dominated, more or less unconsciously, by theassociations and common interests of the primitive clan, but rather thesense of human neighbourhood and kinship which the individual finds inthe community. Indeed the Irish peasant scarcely seems to have a home inthe sense in which an Englishman understands the word. If he love theplace of his habitation he does not endeavour to improve or to adorn it,or indeed to make it in any sense a reflection of his own mind andtaste. He treats life as if he were a mere sojourner upon earth whosetrue home is somewhere else, a fact often attributed to his intensefaith in the unseen, but which I regard as not merely due to this cause,but also, and in a large measure, as the natural outcome of historicalconditions, to which I shall presently refer.What the Irishman is really attached to in Ireland is not a home but asocial order. The pleasant amenities, the courtesies, the leisureliness,the associations of religion, and the familiar faces of the neighbours,whose ways and minds are like his and very unlike those of any otherpeople; these are the things to which he clings in Ireland and which heremembers in exile. And the rawness and eagerness of America, the lustof the eye and the pride of life that meet him, though with no welcomingaspect, at every turn, the sense of being harshly appraised by newstandards of the nature of which he has but the dimmest conception, hishelplessness in the fierce current of industrial life in which he isplunged, the climatic extremes of heat and cold, the early hours and fewholidays: all these experiences act as a rude shock upon theill-balanced refinement of the Irish immigrant. Not seldom, he or sheloses heart and hope and returns to Ireland mentally and physically awreck, a sad disillusionment to those who had been comforted in theagony of the leave-taking by the assurance that to emigrate was tosucceed.The peculiar Irish conception of a home has probably a good deal to dowith the history of the Irish in the United States. It is well knownthat whatever measure of success the Irish emigrant has there achievedis pre-eminently in the American city, and not where, according to allthe usual commonplaces about the Irish race, they ought to havesucceeded, in American rural life. There they were afforded, and therethey missed, the greatest opportunity which ever fell to the lot of apeople agriculturally inclined. During the days of the great emigrationsfrom Ireland, a veritable Promised Land, rich beyond the dreams ofagricultural avarice, was gradually opened up between the Alleghaniesand the Rocky Mountains, which the Irish had only to occupy in order topossess. Making all allowances for the depressing influences which hadbeen brought to bear upon the spirit of enterprise, and for theirimpoverished condition, I am convinced that a prime cause of the failureof almost every effort to settle them upon the land was the fact thatthe tenement house, with all its domestic abominations, provided thesocial order which they brought with them from Ireland, and the lack ofwhich on the western prairie no immediate or prospective physicalcomfort could make good.Recently a daughter of a small farmer in County Galway with a family too'long' for the means of subsistence available, was offered a comfortablehome on a farm owned by some better-off relatives, only thirty milesaway, though probably twenty miles beyond the limits of her utmostperegrinations. She elected in preference to go to New York, and beingasked her reason by a friend of mine, replied in so many words, 'becauseit is nearer.' She felt she would be less of a stranger in a New Yorktenement house, among her relatives and friends who had alreadyemigrated, than in another part of County Galway. Educational science inIreland has always ignored the life history of the subject with which itdealt. In no respect has this neglect been so unconsciously cruel as inits failure to implant in the Irish mind that appreciation of thematerial aspects of the home which the people so badly need both inIreland and in America If the Irishman abroad became 'a rootlesscolonist of alien earth,' the lot of the Irishman in Ireland has beennot less melancholy. Sadness there is, indeed, in the story of 'thesea-divided Gael,' but, to me, it is incomparably less pathetic thantheir homelessness at home.There are, as I have said, historic reasons for the Celtic view of hometo which my personal observation and experience has induced me to devoteso much space. The Irish people have never had the opportunity ofdeveloping that strong and salutary individualism which, amongst otherthings, imperiously demands, as a condition of its growth, a home thatshall be a man's castle as well as his abiding place. In this, as in somuch else, a healthy evolution was constantly thwarted by the clash oftwo peoples and two civilisations. The Irish had hardly emerged from thenomad pastoral stage, when the first of that series of invasions, whichhad all the ferocity, without the finality of conquest, made settledlife impossible over the greater part of the island. An old chroniclethrows some vivid light upon the way in which the idea of home lifepresented itself to the mind of the clan chiefs as late as the days ofthe Tudors. "Con O'Neal," we are told, "was so right Irish that hecursed all his posterity in case they either learnt English, sowed wheator built them houses; lest the first should breed conversation, thesecond commerce, and with the last they should speed as the crow thatbuildeth her nest to be beaten out by the hawk."[10] The penal laws,again, acted as a disintegrant of the home and the family; and,finally, the paralysing effect of the abuses of a system of land tenure,under which evidences of thrift and comfort might at any time becomedetermining factors in the calculation of rent, completed a series ofcauses which, in unison or isolation, were calculated to destroy at itssource the growth of a wholesome domesticity. These causes happily, nolonger exist, and powerful forces are arising to overcome the defectsand disadvantages which they have bequeathed to us; and I have littledoubt that it will be possible to deal successfully with this obstaclewhich adds so peculiar a feature to the problem of rural life inIreland.If I have dwelt at what may appear to be a disproportionate length uponthe Irishman's peculiar conception of a home, it is because thisdifficulty, which Irish social and economic reformers still encounter,and with which they must deal sympathetically if they are to succeed inthe work of national regeneration, strikingly illustrates the two-sidedcharacter of the Irish Question and the never-to-be-forgotteninter-dependence of the sentimental and the practical in Ireland. Iadmit that this condition which adds to the interest of the problem, andperhaps makes it more amenable to rapid solution, is an indication of aweakness of moral fibre to which must be largely attributed our failureto be master of our circumstances. Indeed, as I come into closer touchwith the efforts which are now being made to raise the materialcondition of the people, the more convinced I become, much as mypractical training has made me resist the conviction, that the IrishQuestion is, in its most difficult and most important aspects, theproblem of the Irish mind, and that the solution of this problem is tobe found in the strengthening of Irish character.With this enunciation of the main proposition of my book, I may nowindicate the order in which I shall endeavour to establish its truth. Ihave said enough to show that I do not ignore the historical causes ofour present state; but with so many facts with which we can dealconfronting us, I propose to review the chief living influences to whichthe Irish mind and character are still subjected. These influences fallnaturally into three distinct categories and will be treated in thethree succeeding chapters. The first will show the effect upon the Irishmind of its obsession by politics. The next will deal with the influenceof religious systems upon the secular life of the people. I shall thenshow how education, which should not only have been the most potent ofall the three influences in bringing our national life into line withthe progress of the age, but should also have modified the operation ofthe other two causes, has aggravated rather than cured the malady.Whatever impression I may succeed in making upon others, I may herestate that, as the result of observation and reflection, the conclusionhas been forced upon me that the Irish mind is suffering fromconsiderable functional derangement, but not, so far as I can discern,from any organic disease. This is the basis of my optimism. I shallsubmit in another chapter, which will conclude the first, the criticalpart of my book, certain new principles of treatment which are indicatedby the diagnosis; and I would ask the reader, before he rejects theopinions which are there expressed, to persevere through the narrativecontained in the second part of the book. There he will find in processof solution some of the problems which I have indicated, and theprinciples for which a theoretical approval has been asked, in practicaloperation, and already passing out of the experimental stage. The storyof the Self-help Movement will strike the note of Ireland's economichopes. The action of the Recess Committee will be explained, and theconcession of their demand by the establishment of a 'Department ofAgriculture and other rural industries and for Technical Instruction forIreland,' will be described. This will complete the story of a quiet,unostentatious movement which will some day be seen to have made thelast decade of the nineteenth century a fit prelude to a futurecommensurate with the potentialities of the Irish people.FOOTNOTES:[4] I speak from personal knowledge when I say that the leaders of Irishindustry and commerce are fully alive to the practical considerationwhich they have now to devote to the new conditions by which they aresurrounded. They recognise that the intensified foreign competitionwhich harasses them is due chiefly to German education and Americanenterprise. They are deep in the consideration of the form whichtechnical education should take to meet their peculiar needs; and I amconfident that Ulster will make a sound and useful contribution to thesolution of the commercial and industrial problems which confront themanufacturers of the United Kingdom.[5] That such a knowledge is still required, though the need is becomingless urgent, is shown by an incident which illustrates the pathos of theIrish exodus. A poor woman once asked me to help her son to emigrate toAmerica, and I agreed to pay his passage. Early in the negotiations,finding that she was somewhat vague as to her boy's prospects, I askedher whether he wanted to go to North or South America. This detail sheseemed to consider immaterial. "Ach, glory be to God, I lave that to yerhonner. Why wouldn't I?" Had I shipped him to Peru she would have beenquite satisfied. Why wouldn't she?[6] Yet another view which seems to uproot most agrarian ideas inIreland has been put forward by Dr. O'Gara in _The Green Republic_(Fisher Unwin, 1902). His main conclusion is that the present disastrousstate of our rural economy is due to our treating land as an object ofproperty and not of industry. He advocates the cultivation of the landby syndicates holding farms of 20,000 acres and tilling them by thelavish application of modern machinery as the only way to meet Americancompetition. His book is able and suggestive, but it is perhaps, a workof supererogation to discuss a theory the whole moral of which is theexpediency of absolutely divorcing the functions of the proprietor andthe manager of land at a time when the consensus of opinion in Irelandis in favour of uniting them, and in view of the fact that under the newLand Act the future of the country seems inevitably to lie for a longtime in the hands of a peasant proprietary.[7] The reader may wonder why I touch so lightly upon a fact of suchprofound significance as the Irishman's acceptance of self-help as acondition precedent of State aid in the development of agriculture andindustry. But such a cursory treatment, in the early chapters, of thisand of other equally important aspects of the Irish situation isnecessitated by the plan I have adopted. I am attempting to give in thefirst part of the book a philosophic insight into the chief Irishproblems, and then, in the second part of the book, to present the factswhich appear to me to illustrate these problems in process of solution.[8] The best expert agricultural opinion tells me that under presentconditions a family cannot live in any decent standard of comfort--suchas I hope to see prevail in Ireland--on less than 30 acres of Irishland, taking the bad land with the good.[9] It is, of course, unnecessary for me to dwell upon the part playedby the home in the standard of living, especially amongst a ruralcommunity. But it may not be irrelevant to note that M. Desmolins, who,in his remarkable book, _A quoi tient la superiorite des Anglo-saxons_?hands over the future of civilisation to the Anglo-Saxons, ascribes tothe English rural home much of the success of the race.[10] Speed's Chronicle, quoted in _Calendar of State Papers, Ireland,_1611-14, p. xix.CHAPTER III.THE INFLUENCE OF POLITICS UPON THE IRISH MIND.Among the humours of the Home Rule struggle, the story was current inEngland that a peasant in Connemara ceased planting his potatoes whenthe news of the introduction of the Home Rule Bill in 1886 seemed tobring the millenium into the region of practical politics. Those whoused the story were not slow to suggest that, had the Bill become law,the failure of spontaneous generation in the Connemara potato patchmight have been typical of much analogous disillusionment elsewhere.Even to those who are familiar with our history, the faith of the Irishpeople in the potentialities of government, which this little taleillustrates by caricature, will give cause for reflection of another andmore serious kind. The moral to be drawn by Irish politicians is that wein Ireland have yet to free ourselves from one of the worst legacies ofpast misgovernment, the belief that any legislation or any legislaturecan provide an escape from the physical and mental toil imposed throughour first parents upon all nations for all time.'The more business in politics, and the less politics in business, thebetter for both,' is a maxim which I brought home from the Far West andventured to advocate publicly some years ago. Being still of the samemind, I regret that I am compelled to introduce a whole chapter ofpolitics into this book, which is a study of Irish affairs mainly from asocial and economic point of view. But to ignore, either in thediagnosis or in the treatment of the 'mind diseased,' the politicalobsession of our national life would be about as wise as to discuss andplan a Polar expedition without taking account of the climaticconditions to be encountered.In such an examination of Irish politics as thus becomes necessary Ishall have to devote the greater part of my criticism to the influenceof the Nationalist party upon the Irish mind. But it will be seen thatthis course is not taken with a view to making party capital for my ownside. As I read Irish history, neither party need expect very muchcredit for more than good intentions. Whichever proves to be right inits main contention, each will have to bear its share of theresponsibility for the long continuance of the barren controversy. Eachhas neglected to concern itself with the settlement of vitally importantquestions the consideration of which need not have been postponedbecause the constitutional question still remained in dispute.Therefore, though I seem to throw upon the Nationalist party the chiefblame for our present political backwardness, and, so far as politicsaffect other spheres of national activity, for our industrialdepression, candour compels me to admit that Irish Unionism has failedto recognise its obligation--an obligation recognised by the Unionistparty in Great Britain--to supplement opposition to Home Rule with apositive and progressive policy which could have been expected tocommend itself to the majority of the Irish people--the Irish of theIrish Question.To my own party in Ireland then, I would first direct the reader'sattention. I have already referred to the deplorable effects producedupon national life by the exclusion of representatives of the landlordand the industrial classes from positions of leadership and trust overfour-fifths of the country. I cannot conceive of a prosperous Ireland inwhich the influence of these leaders is restricted within its presentbounds. It has been so restricted because the Irish Unionist party hasfailed to produce a policy which could attract, at any rate, moderatemen from the other side, and we have, therefore, to consider why we haveso failed. Until this is done, we shall continue to share the blame forthe miserable state of our political life which, at the end of thenineteenth century, appeared to have made but little advance from thetime when Bishop Berkeley asked 'Whether our parties are not a burlesqueupon politics.'The Irish Unionist party is supposed to unite all who, like the author,are opposed to the plunge into what is called Home Rule. But itspropagandist activities in Ireland are confined to preaching thedoctrine of the _status quo_, and preaching it only to its own side.From the beginning the party has been intimately connected with thelandlord class; yet even upon the land question it has thrown but fewgleams of the constructive thought which that question so urgentlydemanded, and which it might have been expected to apply to it. Now andagain an individual tries to broaden the basis of Irish Unionism and tobring himself into touch with the life of the people. But the nearer hegets to the people the farther he gets from the Irish Unionist leaders.The lot of such an individual is not a happy one: he is regarded as amere intruder who does not know the rules of the game, and he is treatedby the leading players on both sides like a dog in a tennis court.Two main causes appear to me to account for the failure of the IrishUnionist party to make itself an effective force in Irish national life.The great misunderstanding to which I have attributed the unhappy stateof Anglo-Irish relations kept the country in a condition of turmoilwhich enabled the Unionist party to declare itself the party of law andorder. Adopting Lord Salisbury's famous prescription, 'twenty years ofresolute government,' they made it what its author would have been thelast man to consider it, a sufficient justification for a purelynegative and repressive policy. Such an attitude was open to somewhatobvious objections. No one will dispute the proposition that thegovernment of Ireland, or of any other country, should be resolute, buttwenty years of resolute government, in the narrow sense in which itcame to be interpreted, needed for its success, what cannot be had underparty government, twenty years of consistency. It may be better to befeared than to be loved, but Machiavelli would have been the first toadmit that his principle did not apply where the Government which soughtto establish fear had to reckon with an Opposition which was makingcapital out of love. Moreover, the suggestion that the Irish Question isnot a matter of policy but of police, while by no means withoutinfluential adherents, is altogether vicious. You cannot physicallyintimidate Irishmen, and the last thing you want to do is morally tointimidate a people whose greatest need at the moment is moral courage.The second cause which determined the character of Irish Unionism wasthe linking of the agrarian with the political question; the one being,in effect, a practical, the other a sentimental issue. The same thinghappened in the Nationalist party; but on their side it was intentionaland led to an immense accession of strength, while on the Unionist sideit made for weakness. If the influence of Irish Unionists was to be evenmaintained, it was of vital importance that the interest of a classshould not be allowed to dominate the policy of the party. But theorganisation which ought to have rallied every force that Ireland couldcontribute to the cause of imperial unity came to be too closelyidentified with the landlord class. That class is admittedly essentialto the construction of any real national life. But there is anotherelement equally essential, to which the political leaders of IrishUnionism have not given the prominence which is its due. The IrishQuestion has been so successfully narrowed down to two simple policies,one positive but vague, the other negative but definite, that to suggestthat there are three distinct forces--three distinct interests--to betaken into account seems like confusing the issue. It is a fact,nevertheless, that a very important element on the Unionist side, theindustrial element, has been practically left out of the calculation byboth sides. Yet the only expression of real political thought which Ihave observed in Ireland, since I have been in touch with Irish life,has emanated from the Ulster Liberal-Unionist Association, whose weightypronouncements, published from time to time, are worthy of deepconsideration by all interested in the welfare of Ireland.It will be remembered that when the Home Rule controversy was at itsheight, the chief strength of the Irish opposition to Mr. Gladstone'spolicy, and the consideration which most weighed with the Britishelectorate, lay in the business objection of the industrial populationof Ulster; though on the platform religious and political arguments weremore often heard. The intensely practical nature of the objection whichcame from the commercial and industrial classes of the North who opposedHome Rule was never properly recognised in Ireland. It was, and is stillunanswered. Briefly stated, the position taken up by their spokesmen wasas follows:--'We have come,' they said in effect, 'into Ireland, and notthe richest portion of the island, and have gradually built up anindustry and commerce with which we are able to hold our own incompetition with the most progressive nations in the world. Our successhas been achieved under a system and a polity in which we believe. Itsnon-interference with the business of the people gave play to thatself-reliance with which we strove to emulate the industrial qualitiesof the people of Great Britain. It is now proposed to place themanufactures and commerce of the country at the mercy of a majoritywhich will have no real concern in the interests vitally affected, andwho have no knowledge of the science of government. The mere shadow ofthese changes has so depressed the stocks which represent theaccumulations of our past enterprise and labour that we are alreadycommercially poorer than we were.'[11]My sole criticism of those leaders of commerce and industry in Belfast,who, whenever they turn their attention from their variouspre-occupations, import into Irish politics the valuable qualities whichthey display in the conduct of their private affairs, is that they donot go further and take the necessary steps to give practical effect totheir views outside the ranks of their immediate associates andfollowers. Had the industrial section made its voice heard in thecouncils of the Irish Unionist party, the Government which that partysupports might have had less advice and assistance in the maintenance oflaw and order, but it would have had invaluable aid in its constructivepolicy. For the lack of the wise guidance which our captains of industryshould have provided, Irish Unionism has, by too close adherence to thetraditions of the landlord section, been the creed of a social casterather than a policy in Ireland. The result has been injurious alike forthe landlords, the leaders of industry, and the people. The policy ofthe Unionist party in Ireland has been to uphold the Union by forcerather than by a reconciliation of the people to it. It has held alooffrom the masses, who, bereft of the guidance of their natural leaders,have clung the more closely to the chiefs of the Nationalist party; andthese in their turn have not, as I shall show presently, risen to theirresponsibility, but have retarded rather than advanced the march ofdemocracy in Ireland. If there is to be any future for Unionism inIreland, there must be a combination of the best thought of the countryaristocracy and that of the captains of industry. Then, and not tillthen, shall we Unionists as a party exercise a healthful and stimulatinginfluence on the thought and action of the people.I cannot, therefore, escape from the conclusion that whilst the Irishsection of the party to which I belong is, in my opinion, right on themain political question, its influence is now for the most partnegative. Hence I direct attention mainly to the Home Rule party, as themore forceful element in Irish political life; and if it receives themore criticism it is because it is more closely in touch with thepeople, and because any reform in its principles or methods would moregenerally and more rapidly prove beneficial to the country than wouldany change in Unionist policy.In examining the policy of the Nationalist party my chief concern willbe to arrive at a correct estimate of the effect which is produced uponthe thought and action of the Irish people by the methods employed forthe attainment of Home Rule. I propose to show that these methods havebeen in the past, and must, so long as they are employed, continue to beinjurious to the political and industrial character of the people, andconsequently a barrier to progress. I know that most of the Nationalistleaders justify the employment of these methods on the ground that, intheir opinion, the constitutional reforms they advocate are a conditionprecedent to industrial progress. I believe, on the contrary, and Ishall give my reasons for believing, that their tactics have been notonly a hindrance to industrial progress, but destructive even to theulterior purpose they were intended to fulfil.It is commonly believed--a belief very naturally fostered by theirleaders--that, if there is one thing the Irish do understand, it ispolitics. Politics is a term obviously capable of wide interpretation,and I fear that those who say that my countrymen are pre-eminentlypoliticians use the term in a sense more applicable to the conceptionsof Mr. Richard Croker than of Aristotle. In intellectual capacity fordiscrimination upon political issues the average Irish elector is, Ibelieve, far superior to the average English elector. But there is asyet something wanting in the character of our people which seems toprohibit the exercise by them of any independent political thought and,consequently, of any effective or permanent political influence.The assumption that Irishmen are singularly good politicians seems tostand seriously in the way of their becoming so; and yet it is a matterof the greatest importance that they should become good politicians in areal sense, for in no country would sound political thought exercise amore beneficial influence upon the life of the people than in Ireland.Indeed I would go further and give it as my strong conviction that,properly developed and freed from the narrowing influences of the partysquabbles by which it has been warped and sterilised, the politicalthought of the Irish people would contribute a factor of vitalimportance to the life of the British empire. But at the moment I amdealing only with the influence of politics on Irish social and economiclife.I am aware that any political deficiencies which the Irish may displayat home, are commonly attributed to the political system which has beenimposed upon Ireland from without. If you want to see Irish genius inits highest political manifestation, it must be studied, we are told, inthe United States, the widest and freest arena which has ever beenoffered to the race. This view is not in accordance with the facts as Ihave observed them. These facts are somewhat obscured by the natural,but misleading habit of reckoning to the account of Ireland at largeachievements really due to the Scotch-Irish, who helped to colonisePennsylvania, and who undoubtedly played a dominant part in developingthe characteristic features of the American political system. TheScotch-Irish, however, do not belong to the Ireland of the IrishQuestion Descended, largely, as their names so often testify, from theearly Irish colonists of western Scotland, they came back as a distinctrace, dissociating themselves from the Irish Celts by refusing to adopttheir national traditions, or intermarry with them, and both here and inAmerica disclaiming the appellation of Irish.[12]Leaving, then, out of consideration the political achievements of theScotch-Irish, it appears to me that the part played in politics by theIrish in America does not testify to any high political genius. Theyhave shown there an extraordinary aptitude for political organisation,which, if it had been guided by anything approaching to politicalthought, would have placed them in a far higher position in Americanpublic life than that which they now occupy. But the fact is that itwould be much easier to find evidence of high political capacity andsuccess in the history of the Irish in British colonies; and the reasonfor this fact is not only very germane to the purpose of this book, buthas a strong practical interest for Americans as well. Irishmen whenthey go to America find themselves united by a bond which does not andcould not exist in the Colonies--though it does exist in Ireland--thebond of anti-English feeling, and by the hope of giving practical effectto this feeling through the policy of their adopted country. Imbued withthis common sentiment, and influenced by their inherited clannishness,the Irish in America readily lend themselves to the system of politicalgroups, a system which the 'boss' for his own ends seeks to perpetuate.The result is a sort of political paradox--it has made the Irish inAmerica both stronger and weaker than they ought to be. They sufferpolitically from the defects of their political qualities: they arestrong as a voting machine, but the secret of their collective strengthis also the secret of their individual weakness. This organisation intogroups is much commoner among the Irish than among other Americanimmigrants, for the anti-English feeling with which so many of the Irishland in America is carefully kept alive by the 'boss,' whose sedulousfostering of the instinctive clannishness and inherited leader-followinghabits of the Irish saps their independence of thought and prevents themfrom ceasing to be mere political agents and developing a citizenshipwhich would furnish its due quota of statesmen to the service of theRepublic. They lack in the United States just what they lack at home,the capacity, or at any rate the inclination, to use their undoubtedabilities in a large and foreseeing manner, and so are becoming less andless powerful as a force in American politics.The fallacious views about the nature and sphere of politics, which theIrish bring with them from Ireland, and which are perpetuated inAmerica, have the effect not only of debarring the Irish from realpolitical progress, but also, as at home, from gaining success inindustrial pursuits which their talents would otherwise win for them.They succeed as journalists owing to their quick intelligence andversatility, and as contractors mainly owing to their capacity fororganising gangs of workmen--a faculty which seems to be the only goodthing resulting from their political education. They are as brilliantsoldiers in the service of the United States as they are in that ofBritain--more it would be impossible to say--and they have producedtypes of daring, endurance, and shrewdness like the 'Silver Kings' ofNevada which testify to the exceptional powers always developed by theIrish in exceptional circumstances. But in the humdrum business ofeveryday life in the United States they suffer from defects which arethe outcome of their devotion to mistaken political ideals and of theirsubordination of industry to politics, which are not always purelyAmerican, but are often influenced by considerations of the country oftheir birth. On the whole, a quarter of a century of not unsympatheticobservation of the Irish in the United States has convinced me that theposition they occupy there is not one which either they or the Americanpeople can look on with entire satisfaction. The Irish immigrants arefelt to belong to a kind of _imperium in imperio_, and to carry intoAmerican politics ideas which are not American, and which might easilybecome an embarrassment if not a danger to America. Hence the powerfulinterest which America shares with England, though of course in a lessdegree, in understanding and helping to settle the complex difficultycalled the Irish Question. The Irish remember Ireland long after theyhave left it. They are not in the same position as the German or Englishimmigrants who have no cause at home which they wish to forward. Everyecho in the States of political or social disturbance in Ireland rousesthe immigrant and he becomes an Irishman once more, and not a citizen ofthe country of his adoption. His views and votes on internationalquestions, in so far as they affect these Islands, are thus oftendictated more by a passionate sympathy for and remembrance of the landhe no longer lives in, than by any right understanding of the interestsof the new country in which he and his children must live.The only reason why I have examined the assumption that Irishmen displaymarked political capacity in the United States is to make it clear thatthe political deficiencies they manifest at home are to be attributedmainly to defects of character, and to a conception of politics forwhich modern English government is very slightly responsible. I admitthat English government in the past had no small share in producing theresults we deplore to-day, but the motives and manner of its actionhave, it seems to me, been very imperfectly understood.The fact is that the difficulties of English government in Ireland,until a complete military conquest had been effected, were of apeculiarly complex character. Before the English could impose uponIreland their own political organisation--and the idea that any othersystem could work better among the Irish never entered the Englishmind--it was obviously necessary that the very antithesis of thatorganisation, the clan system, should be abolished. But there weremilitary and financial objections to carrying out this policy. Irishcampaigns were very costly, and England was in those days by no meanswealthy. English armies in Ireland, after a short period spent indesultory warfare with light armed kernes in the fever-stricken Munsterforests, began to melt away. For many generations, therefore, England,adopting a policy of _divide et impera_, set clan against clan. Lateron, statecraft may be said to have supervened upon military tactics. Itconsisted of attempts made by alternate threats and bribes to induce thechiefs to transform the clan organisation by the acceptance of Englishinstitutions. But any systematic endeavours to complete thetransformation were soon rendered abortive by being coupled with hugeconfiscations of land. The policy of converting the members of the clansinto freeholders was subordinated to the policy of planting Britishcolonists. After this there was no question of fusion of races orinstitutions. Plantations on a large scale, self-supporting,self-protecting, became the policy alike of the soldier and thestatesman.The inevitable result of these methods was that it was not until acomparatively late date that a political conception of an Irish nationfirst began to emerge out of the congeries of clans. In the State Papersof the sixteenth century the clans are frequently spoken of as'nations.' Even as late as the eighteenth century a Gaelic poet, in atypical lament, thus identifies his country with the fortunes of hergreat families:--    The O'Doherty is not holding sway, nor his noble race;    The O'Moores are not strong, that once were brave--    O'Flaherty is not in power, nor his kinsfolk;    And sooth to say, the O'Briens have long since become English.    Of O'Rourke there is no mention--my sharp wounding!    Nor yet of O'Donnell in Erin;    The Geraldines they are without vigour--without a nod,    And the Burkes, the Barrys, the Walshes of the slender ships.[13]The modern political idea of Irish nationality at length asserted itselfas the result of three main causes. The bond of a common grievanceagainst the English foe was created by the gradual abandonment of thepolicy of setting clan against clan in favour of impartial confiscationof land from friendly as well as from hostile chiefs. Secondly, when theEnglish had destroyed the natural leaders, the clan chiefs, andattempted to proselytise their adherents, the political leadershiplargely passed to the Roman Catholic Church, which very naturallydefended the religion common to the members of all the clans, by tryingto unite them against the English enemy. Nationality, in this sense, ofcourse applied only to Celtic Roman Catholic Ireland. The first realidea of a United Ireland arose out of the third cause, the religiousgrievances of the Protestant dissenters and the commercial grievances ofthe Protestant manufacturers and artisans in the eighteenth century, whosuffered under a common disability with the Roman Catholics, and many ofwhom came in the end to make common cause with them. But even long afterthis conception had become firmly established, the local representativeinstitutions corresponding to those which formed the political trainingof the English in law and administration either did not exist in Irelandor were altogether in the hands of a small aristocracy, mostly ofnon-Irish origin, and wholly non-Catholic. O'Connell's great work infreeing Roman Catholic Ireland from the domination of the Protestantoligarchy showed the people the power of combination, but his methodscan hardly be said to have fostered political thought. The efforts inthis direction of men like Gavan Duffy, Davis, and Lucas wereneutralised by the Famine, the after effects of which also did much tothwart Butt's attempts to develop serious public opinion amongst apeople whose political education had been so long delayed. The prospectof any early fruition of such efforts vanished with the revolutionaryagrarian propaganda, and independent thinking--so necessary in themodern democratic state--never replaced the old leader-following habitwhich continued until the climax was reached under Parnell.The political backwardness of the Irish people revealed itselfcharacteristically when, in 1884, the English and Irish democracies weresimultaneously endowed with a greatly extended franchise. In theory thisconcession should have developed political thought in the people andshould have enhanced their sense of political responsibility. In Englandno doubt this theory was proved by the event to be based on fact; but inIreland it was otherwise. Parnell was at the zenith of his power. TheIrish had the man, what mattered the principles? The new suffragessimply became the figures upon the cheques handed over to the Chief byeach constituency, with the request that he would fill in the name ofthe payee. On one or two occasions a constituency did protest againstthe payee, but all that was required to settle the matter was a personalvisit from the Chief. Generally speaking, the electorate were quitedocile, and instances were not wanting of men discovering that they hadfound favour with electors to whom their faces and even their names werepreviously unknown.No doubt, the one-man system had a tactical value, of which the Englishthemselves were ever ready to make use. "If all Ireland cannot rule thisman, then let this man rule all Ireland," said Henry VII. of the Earl ofKildare; and the echo of these words was heard when the KilmainhamTreaty was negotiated with the last man who wore the mantle of thechief. But whatever may be said for the one-man system as a means ofpolitical organisation, it lacked every element of political education.It left the people weaker, if possible, and less capable than it foundthem; and assuredly it was no fit training for Home Rule. WhileParnell's genius was in the ascendant, all was well--outwardly. When atragic and painful disclosure brought about a crisis in his fate, itwill hardly be contended by the most devoted admirer of the Irish peoplethat the situation was met with even moderate ability and foresight. Butthe logic of events began to take effect. The decade of dissension whichfollowed the fall of Parnell will, perhaps, some day be recognised as amost fruitful epoch in modern Irish history. The reaction from theone-man system set in as soon as the one man had passed away. Theindependence which Parnell's former lieutenants began to assert when thelaurels faded upon the brow of the uncrowned King communicated itself tosome extent to the rank and file. The mere weighing of the merits ofseveral possible successors led to some wholesome questioning as to themerits of the policies, such as they were, which they respectivelyrepresented The critical spirit which was now called forth, did not, atfirst, go very far; but it was at least constructive and marked adistinct advance towards real political thought. I believe the day willcome, and come soon, when Nationalist leaders themselves will recognisethat while bemoaning faction and dissension and preaching the cause of'unity' they often mistook the wheat for the tares. They will, I feelsure, come to realise that the passing of the dictatorship, which tooutward appearances left the people as "sheep without a shepherd, whenthe snow shuts out the sky," in fact turned the thoughts of Ireland insome measure away from England into her own bosom, and gave birth thereto the idea of a national life to which the Irish people of all classes,creeds, and politics could contribute of their best.I sometimes wonder whether the leaders of the Nationalist party reallyunderstand the full effect of their tactics upon the political characterof the Irish people, and whether their vision is not as much obscured bya too near, as is the vision of the Unionist leaders by a too distant,view of the people's life. Everyone who seeks to provide practicalopportunities for Irish intellect to express-itself worthily in activelife--and this, I take it, is part of what the Nationalist leaders wishto achieve--meets with the same difficulty. The lack of initiative andshrinking from responsibility, the moral timidity in glaring contrastwith the physical courage--which has its worst manifestation in theintense dread of public opinion, especially when the unknown terrors ofeditorial power lurk behind an unfavourable mention 'on the paper,'are, no doubt, qualities inherited from a primitive social state inwhich the individual was nothing and the community everything. Thesedefects were intensified in past generations by British statecraft,which seemed unable to appreciate or use the higher instincts of therace; they remain to-day a prominent factor in the great human problemknown as the Irish Question--a factor to which, in my belief, may beattributed the greatest of its difficulties.It is quite clear that education should have been the remedy for thedefects of character upon which I am forced to dwell so much; and Icannot absolve any body of Irishmen, possessed of actual or potentialinfluence, of failure to recognise this truth. But here I am dealingonly with the political leaders, and trying to bring home to them theresponsibility which their power imposes upon them, not only for thepolitical development but also for the industrial progress of theirfollowers. They ought to have known that the weakness of character whichrenders the task of political leadership in Ireland comparatively easyis in reality the quicksand of Irish life, and that neitherself-government nor any other institution can be enduringly built uponit.The leaders of the Nationalist party are, of course, entitled to holdthat, in existing political conditions, any non-political movementtowards national advancement, which in its nature cannot be linked, asthe land question was linked, to the Home Rule movement constitutes anunwarrantable sacrifice of ends to means. And so holding, they arefurther entitled to subject any proposal to elevate popular thought, orto direct popular activities, to a strict censorship as to its remote aswell as to its immediate effect upon the electorate. I know, too, thatit is held by some thinking Nationalists who take no active part inpolitics that the politicians are justified on tactical grounds in thisexclusive pursuit of their political aims, and in the methods by whichthey pursue them. They consider the present system of government tooradically wrong to mend, and they can undoubtedly point to agrarianlegislation as evidence of the effectiveness of the means they employ togain their end.This view of things has sunk very deep into the Irish mind. The policyof 'giving trouble' to the Government is looked upon as the one road toreform and is believed in so fervently that, except for religion, whichsometimes conflicts with it, there is scarcely any capacity left forbelief in anything else. I am far from denying that the past offers muchjustification for the belief that nothing can be gained by Ireland fromEngland except through violent agitation. Until recently, I admit,Ireland's opportunity had to wait for England's difficulty. But, aspractised in the present day, I believe this doctrine to be mischievousand false. For one thing, there is a new England to deal with. TheEngland which, certainly not in deference to violent agitation,established the Congested Districts Board, gave Local Government toIreland, and accepted the recommendations of the Recess Committee forfar-reaching administrative changes, as well as those of the LandConference which involved great financial concessions, is not theEngland of fifty years ago, still less the England of the eighteenthcentury. Moreover, in riveting the mind of the country on what is to beobtained from England, this doctrine of 'giving trouble,' the wholegospel of the agitator, has blinded the Irish people to the many thingswhich Ireland can do for herself. Whatever may be said of what is called'agitation' in Ireland as an engine for extorting legislation from theImperial Parliament, it is unquestionably bad for the much greater endof building up Irish character and developing Irish industry andcommerce. 'Agitation,' as Thomas Davis said, 'is one means of redress,but it leads to much disorganisation, great unhappiness, wounds upon thesoul of a country which sometimes are worse than the thinning of apeople by war.'[14] If Irish politicians had at all realised this truth,it is difficult to believe that the popular movement of the last quarterof a century would not have been conducted in a manner far lessinjurious to the soul of Ireland and equally or more effective forlegislative reform as well as all other material interests.Now, modern Nationalism in Ireland is open to damaging criticism notonly from my Unionist point of view, which was also, in many respects,the view of so strong a Nationalist as Thomas Davis; it is also open tograve objection from the point of view of the effectiveness of thetactics employed for the attainment of its end--the winning of HomeRule.Before examining the effect of these tactics I may point out that thisconception of Nationalist policy, even if justifiable from a practicalpoint of view, does not relieve the leaders from the obligation ofgiving some assurance that they are ready with a consistent scheme ofre-construction, and are prepared to build when the ground has beencleared. In this connection I might make a good deal of Unionistcapital, and some points in support of my condemnation of the politicalabsorption of the Irish mind, out of the total failure of theNationalist party to solve certain all-important constitutional andfinancial problems which months of Parliamentary debate in 1893 tendedrather to obscure than to elucidate. I am, however, willing forargument's sake to postpone all such questions, vital as they are, tothe time when they can be practically dealt with. I am ready to assumethat the wit of man can devise a settlement of many points which seemedinsoluble in Mr. Gladstone's day. But even granting all this, I think itcan easily be shown that the means which the political thoughtavailable on the Nationalist side has evolved for the attainment oftheir end, and which _ex hypothesi_ are only to be justified on tacticalgrounds, are the least likely to succeed; and that, consequently, theyshould be abandoned in favour of a constructive policy which, to say theleast, would not be less effective towards advancing the Home Rulecause, if that cause be sound, and which would at the same time help theadvancement of Ireland in other than political directions.Tactics form but a part of generalship, and half the success ofgeneralship lies in making a correct estimate of the opposing forces.This is as true of political as it is of military operations. Now, ofwhat do the forces opposed to Home Rule consist? The Unionists, it maybe admitted, are numerically but a small minority of the population ofIreland--probably not more than one-fourth. But what do they represent?First, there are the landed gentry. Let us again make a concession forthe sake of argument and accept the view that this class so wantonlykept itself aloof from the life of the majority of the people that theNationalists could not be expected to count them among the elements of aHome Rule Ireland. I note, in passing, with extreme gratification thatat the recent Land Conference it was declared by the tenants'representatives that it was desirable, in the interests of Ireland, thatthe present owners of land should not be expatriated, and thatinducements should be afforded to selling owners to continue to residein the country.But I may ignore this as I wish here to recall attention to that otherelement, which was, as I have already said, the real force which turnedthe British democracy against Home Rule--I mean the commercial andindustrial community in Belfast and other hives of industry in thenorth-east corner of the country, and in scattered localities elsewhere.I have already admitted that the political importance of the industrialelement was not appreciated in Irish Unionist circles. No lessremarkable is the way in which it has been ignored by the Nationalists.The question which the Nationalists had to answer in 1886 and 1893, andwhich they have to answer to-day, is this:--In the Ireland of theirconception is the Unionist part of Ulster to be coerced or persuaded tocome under the new regime? To those who adopt the former alternative myreply is simply that, if England is to do the coercion, the idea ispolitically absurd. If we were left to fight it out among ourselves, itis physically absurd. The task of the Empire in South Africa was lightcompared with that which the Nationalists would have on hands. I amaware that, at the time when we were all talking at concert pitch on theIrish Question, a good deal was said about dying in the last ditch bymen who at the threat of any real trouble would be found more discreetlyperched upon the first fence. But those who know the temper and fightingqualities of the working-men opponents of Home Rule in the North areunder no illusion as to the account they would give of themselves ifcalled upon to defend the cause of Protestantism, liberty, and imperialunity as they understand it. Let us, however, dismiss this alternativeand give Nationalists credit for the desire to persuade the industrialNorth to come in by showing it that it will be to its advantage to joincordially in the building up of a united Ireland under a separatelegislature.The difficulties in the way of producing this conviction are veryobvious. The North has prospered under the Act of Union--why should itbe ready to enter upon a new 'variety of untried being'? What that stateof being will be like, it naturally gauges from the forces which areworking for Home Rule at present. Looking at these simply from theindustrial standpoint and leaving out of account all the powerfulelements of religious and race prejudice, the man of the North sees twosalient facts which have dominated all the political activity of theNationalist campaign. One is a voluble and aggressive disloyalty, notmerely to 'England' and to the present system of government, but to theCrown which represents the unity of the three kingdoms, and the other isthe introduction of politics into business in the very virulent anddestructive form known as boycotting.Now, hostility to the Crown, if it means anything, means a struggle forseparation as soon as Home Rule has given to the Irish people the powerto organise and arm. And (still keeping to the sternly practical pointof view) that would, for the time being at least, spell absolute ruin tothe industrial North. The practice of boycotting, again, is the veryantithesis of industry--it creates an atmosphere in which industry andenterprise simply cannot live. The North has seen this practice condonedas a desperate remedy for a desperate ill, but it has seen it continuedlong after the ill had passed away, used as a weapon by one Nationalistsection against another, and revived when anything like a reallyoppressive or arbitrary eviction had become impossible. There seems tohave been in Nationalist circles, since the time of O'Connell, butlittle appreciation of the deadly character of this social curse; andthe prospect of a Government which would tolerate it naturally fills themind of the Northern commercial man with alarm and aversion.Again, the democratisation of local government which gave theNationalist leaders a unique opportunity of showing the value, has butserved to demonstrate the ineffectiveness, of their political tactics.North of Ireland opinion was deeply interested in this reform, andappreciated its far-reaching importance. Elsewhere, I think it will besafe to say, people generally were indifferent to it until it came, andthe leaders seemed to see in it only a weapon to be used for politicalpurposes. To the great vista of useful and patriotic work opened out bythe Act of 1898, to the impression that a proper use of that Act mightmake on Northern opinion, they were blind. It is true that the Councilswhen left to themselves did admirably, and fully justified the trustreposed in them. But at the inauguration of local government it wasnaturally not the work of the Councils but the attitude of the partyleaders which appeared to stamp the reception of the Act by the Irishpeople.It is true, of course, that many thoughtful men among the Nationalistparty repudiate the idea that the methods of to-day would be continuedin a self-governed Ireland. I fail to see any reason why they shouldnot. Under any system of limited Home Rule questions would arise whichwould afford much the same sort of justification for the employment ofsuch methods, and they could hardly be worse for the welfare of thecountry then than they are now. There is abundant need and abundant workin the present day for thoughtful and far-seeing men in a partyconstitutionally so strong as that of the Irish Nationalists. If thoseamong them who possess, or at any rate can make effective use ofqualities of constructive statesmanship are as few as the history ofrecent years would lead us to suppose, what assurance can UlsterUnionists feel that such men would spring up spontaneously in an Irelandunder Home Rule? I admit, indeed, that a considerable measure of suchassurance might be derived from the attitude of the leaders of the partyat and since the Land Conference. But this adoption of statesmanlikemethods which cannot be too widely understood or too warmly commended isa matter of very recent history; and though we may hope that the successattending it will help materially in the political education of theIrish people, that will not, by itself, undo the effect of a quarter ofa century of political agitation governed by ideas the very reverse ofthose which are now happily beginning to find favour.I have thought it necessary to examine at some length the defence on theground of tactics which is often made for Nationalist politics, becauseit is the only defence ever made by those apologists who admit thedisturbing influence upon our economic and social life of Nationalistmethods. A broader and saner view of political tactics than prevailedten years ago is now possible, for circumstances are becoming friendlyand helpful to the development of political thought. Though the UnitedIrish League apparently restored 'unity' to the ranks of theNationalists, the country is, I believe, getting restless under thepolitical bondage, and is seething with a wholesome discontent. In thisvery matter of political education, the stir of corporate life, thesense of corporate responsibility which in every parish of Ireland arenow being fostered by the reformed system of local government, must maketheir influence felt in wider spheres. Even now I believe that the fieldis ready for the work of those who would bid the old leader-followinghabit, the product partly of the dead clan system, partly of dyingnational animosities, depart as a thing that has had its day, and whowould endeavour to train up a race of free, self-reliant, andindependent citizens in a free state.In this work the very men whose mistaken conception of a united IrelandI have criticised will, I doubt not, take a leading part. In manyrespects, and these not the least important, no one could desire abetter instrument for the achievement of great reforms than the Irishparty. They are far beyond any similar group of English members inrhetorical skill and quickness of intelligence and decision, qualitieswhich no doubt belong to the mechanism rather than the soul of politics,but which the practical worker in public life will not despise. But evenwhen tried by a higher standard the Irish members need not fear thejudgment of history. They have often, in my opinion, misconceived thetrue interests of their country, but they have been faithful to thoseinterests as they understood them, and have proved themselves notablysuperior to sordid personal aims. These gifts and virtues are notcommon, but still rarer is it to see such gifts and virtues cursed withthe doom of futility. The influence of the Irish political leaders hasneither advanced the nation's march through the wilderness nor taughtthe people how they are to dispense with manna from above when theyreach the Promised Land. With all their brilliancy, they have thrown butlittle helpful light on any Irish problem. In this want of political andeconomic foresight Irish Nationalist politicians, with some exceptionswhom it would be invidious to name, have fallen lamentably short of whatmight be expected of Irish intellect. For the eight years during which Irepresented an Irish constituency I always felt that an Irish night inthe House of Commons was one of the strangest and most pathetic ofspectacles. There were the veterans of the Irish party hardened by ahundred fights, ranging from Venezuela to the Soudan in search ofbattlefields, making allies of every kind of foreign potentate, fromPresident Cleveland to the Mahdi, from Mr. Kruger to the Akhoom of Swat,but looking with suspicion on every symptom of an independent nationalmovement in Ireland; masters of the language of hate and scorn, yetmocked by inevitable and eternal failure; winners of victories that turnto dust and ashes; devoted to their country, yet, from ignorance of thereal source of its malady, ever widening the gaping wound through whichits life-blood flows. While I recall these scenes, there rises before mymind the picture vividly drawn by Miss Lawless of their prototypes, the'Wild Geese,' who carried their swords into foreign service after thefinal defeat of the Stuarts:--    War-battered dogs are we,    Fighters in every clime,    Fillers of trench and of grave,    Mockers, bemocked by Time;    War-dogs, hungry and grey,    Gnawing a naked bone,    Fighting in every clime    Every cause but our own.[15]Irishmen have been long in realising that the days of the 'Wild Geese'are over, and that there are battles for Ireland to be fought and won inIreland--battles in which England is not the enemy she was in the daysof Fontenoy, but a friend and helper. But there will be little gain inreplacing the traditional conception of England as the inexorable foe bythe more modern conception, which threatened to become traditional inits turn, of England as the source of all prosperity and her favour asthe condition of all progress in Ireland. In the recent Land ConferenceI recognise something more valuable even than the financial andlegislative results which flowed from it, for it showed that theconception of reliance upon Irishmen in Ireland, not under some futureand problematical conditions, but here and now, for the solution ofIrish questions, is gaining ground among us. If this conception oncetakes firm hold, as I think it is beginning to do, of the Nationalistparty in Ireland, much of the criticism of this chapter will lose itsmeaning. The mere substitution of a positive Irish policy for a negativeanti-English policy will elevate the whole range of Nationalistpolitical activity in and out of Ireland. And I am certain that if theultimate goal of Nationalist politics be desirable, and continue to bedesired, it will not be rendered more difficult, but on the contraryvery much easier of attainment if those who seek it take possession ofthe great field of work which, without waiting for any concessions fromWestminster, is offered by the Ireland of to-day.FOOTNOTES:[11] This view of the case was powerfully stated by the deputation fromthe Belfast Chamber of Commerce which waited on Mr. Gladstone in thespring of 1893. They pointed out _inter alia_ that the members of thedeputation were poorer by thousands of pounds owing to the fall in Irishstocks consequent upon the introduction of the Home Rule Bill in thatyear.[12] The term 'Scotch-Irish' does not mean an amalgam of Scotch andIrish, but a race of Scottish immigrants who settled in north-eastIreland. I may point out that in these criticisms of Irish-Americanpolitics I refer, of course, mainly to the Irish-born immigrants and notto the Irish, Scotch-Irish or other, who are American-born. Nobody canhave a higher appreciation than I of the great part played by theAmerican-Irish once they have assimilated the full spirit of Americaninstitutions.[13] _Poems of Egan O'Rahilly._ Edited, with translation, by the Rev.P.S.

I come now tothe second great influence upon the thought and action of the Irishpeople, the influence of religion, especially the power exercised by thepriests and by the unrivalled organisation of the Roman Catholic Church.I do not share the pessimism which sees in this potent influence nothingbut the shackles of mediaevalism restraining its adherents from fallinginto line with the progress of the age. I shall, indeed, have to admitmuch of what is charged against the clerical leaders of popular thoughtin Ireland, but I shall be able to show, I hope, that these leaders arelargely the product of a situation which they themselves did not create,and that not only are they as susceptible as are the political leadersto the influences of progressive movements, but that they can be morereadily induced to take part in their promotion. In no other country inthe world, probably, is religion so dominant an element in the dailylife of the people as in Ireland, and certainly nowhere else has theminister of religion so wide and undisputed an authority. It is obvious,therefore, that, however foreign such a theme may _prima facie_ appearto the scope and aim of the present volume, I have no choice but toanalyse frankly and as fully as my personal experience justifies, what Iconceive to be the true nature, the salutary limits, and the actualscope of clerical influence in this country.But before I can discuss what I may call the religious situation, thereis one fundamental question--a question which will appear somewhatstrange to anyone not in touch with Irish life--which I must, with aview to a general agreement on essentials, submit to some of myco-religionists. In all seriousness I would ask, whether in theiropinion the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland is to be tolerated. If theanswer be in the negative, I can only reply that any efforts to stampout the Roman Catholic faith would fail as they did in the past; and thepractical minds among those I am now addressing must admit that intoleration alone is to be found the solution of that part of the Irishdifficulty which is due to sectarian animosities.This brings us face to face with the question, What is religioustoleration--I do not mean as a pious sentiment which we are allconscious of ourselves possessing in a truer sense than that in which itis possessed by others, but rather toleration as an essential of theliberty which we Protestants enjoy under the British Constitution, andboast that all other creeds equally enjoy? Perhaps I had better statesimply how I answer this question in my own mind. Toleration by theIrish minority, in regard to the religious faith and ecclesiasticalsystem of the Irish majority, implies that we admit the right of Rome tosay what Roman Catholics shall believe and what outward forms they shallobserve, and that they shall not suffer before the State for thesebeliefs and observances. I do not think exception can be taken to thestatement that toleration in this narrow sense cannot be refusedconsistently with the fundamental principles of British government.Now, however, comes a less obvious, but, as I think, no less essentialcondition of toleration in the sense above indicated. The Roman CatholicHierarchy claim the right to exercise such supervision and control overthe education of their flock as will enable them to safe-guard faith andmorals as preached and practised by their Church. I concede this secondclaim as a necessary corollary of the first. Having lived most of mylife among Roman Catholics--two branches of my own family belonging tothat religion--I am aware that this control is an essential part of thewhole fabric of Roman Catholicism. Whether the basis of authority uponwhich that system is founded be in its origin divine or human is besidethe point. If we profess to tolerate the faith and religious system ofthe majority of our countrymen we must at least concede the conditionsessential to the maintenance of both the one and the other, unless ourtolerance is to be a sham.So far all liberal-minded Protestants, who know what Roman Catholicismis, will be with me; and for the main purposes of the argument containedin this chapter it is not necessary to interpret toleration in any widersense than that which I have indicated. Many Protestants, among whom Iam one, do, it is true, make a further concession to the claim of ourRoman Catholic fellow-countrymen. We would give them in Irelandfacilities for higher education which we would not give them in England,and we would advocate liberal endowment by the State to this end. Butthis attitude is, I admit, based upon something more than tolerance, andthose who would withhold this concession need not be accused of bigotryor intolerance for so doing. They may be, and often are, actuated by themost liberal motives, by a perfectly legitimate conception ofeducational principles, or by other considerations which are neither ofa narrow nor sectarian character.I need hardly say that in criticising religious systems and theirministers I have not the faintest intention of entering on thediscussion of doctrinal issues. I am, of course, here concerned withonly those aspects of the religious situation which bear directly onsecular life. I am endeavouring, it must be remembered, to arrive at acomprehensive and accurate appreciation of the chief influences whichmould the character, guide the thought, and, therefore, direct theaction of the Irish people as citizens of this world and of their owncountry. From this standpoint let us try to make a dispassionate surveyof Protestantism and Roman Catholicism in Ireland, and see whereintheir votaries fulfil, or fail to fulfil, their mission in advancing ourcommon civilisation. Let us examine, in a word, not merely the directinfluence which the creed of each of the two sections of Irishmenproduces on the industrial character of its adherents, but also itsindirect effects upon the mutual relations and regard for each other ofProtestants and Roman Catholics.Protestantism has its stronghold in the great industrial centres of theNorth and among the Presbyterian farmers of five or six Ulster counties.These communities, it is significant to note, have developed theessentially strenuous qualities which, no doubt, they brought fromEngland and Scotland. In city life their thrift, industry, andenterprise, unsurpassed in the United Kingdom, have built up aworld-wide commerce. In rural life they have drawn the largest yieldfrom relatively infertile soil. Such, in brief, is the achievement ofUlster Protestantism in the realm of industry. It is a story of which,when a united Ireland becomes more than a dream, all Irishmen will beproud.But there is, unhappily, another side to the picture. This industriallife, otherwise so worthily cultivated, is disturbed by manifestationsof religious bigotry which sadly tarnish the glory of the really heroicdeeds they are intended to commemorate. It is impossible for any closeobserver of these deplorable exhibitions to avoid the conclusion thatthe embers of the old fires are too often fanned by men who areactuated by motives, which, when not other than religious, are certainlybased upon an unworthy conception of religion. I am quite aware that itis only a small and decreasing minority of my co-religionists who areopen to the charge of intolerance, and that the geographical limits ofthe July orgy are now strictly circumscribed. But this bigotry is sonotorious, as for instance in the exclusion of Roman Catholics from manyresponsible positions, that it unquestionably reacts most unfavourablyupon the general relations between the two creeds throughout the wholeof Ireland. The existence of such a spirit of suspicion and hatred, fromwhatever motive it emanates, is bound to retard our progress as a peopletowards the development of a healthy and balanced national life.Many causes have recently contributed to the unhappy continuance ofsectarian animosities in Ireland. The Ritualistic movement and thestruggle over the Education Bill in England, the renewed controversy onthe University Question in Ireland, instances of bigotry towardsProtestants displayed by County, District, and Urban Councils in thethree southern provinces of Ireland, the formation of the CatholicAssociation, the question of the form of the King's oath, and, moreremotely, the protest against clericalism in such Roman Catholiccountries as France and Austria, have one and all helped to keep alivethe flame of anti-Roman feeling among Irish Protestants.[16]There are, happily, other influences now at work in a contrarydirection. Among the industrial leaders a better spirit prevails. Awell-known Ulster manufacturer told me recently that only a few yearsago, when an applicant for employment appeared at certain Northernfactories, which my friend named, the first question always put was,'Are you a Protestant or Roman Catholic?' Now, he said, it is not what aman believes, but what he can do, which is considered when engagingworkers. And outside the cities there are most gratifying signs ofbetter relations between the two creeds. We are on the eve of thecreation of a peasant proprietary, involving the rehabilitation of rurallife, and one essential condition of the successful inauguration of thenew agrarian order is the elimination of anything approaching tosectarian bitterness in communities which will require every advantagederivable from joint deliberation and common effort to enable them tohold their own against foreign competition. I recall a trivial butsignificant incident in the course of my Irish work which left a deepimpression on my mind. After attending a meeting of farmers in a verybackward district in the extreme west of Mayo, I arrived one winter'sevening at the Roman Catholic priest's house. Before the meeting I hadbeen promised a cup of tea, which, after a long, cold drive, was morethan acceptable. When I presented myself at the priest's house, what wasmy astonishment at finding the Protestant clergyman presiding over asteaming urn and a plate of home-made cakes, having been requested to dothe honours by his fellow-minister, who had been called away to a sickbed. A cycle of homilies on the virtue of tolerance could add nothing tothe simple lesson which these two clergymen gave to the adherents ofboth their creeds. I felt as I went on my way that night that I had hada glimpse into the kind of future for Ireland towards which myfellow-workers are striving.It is, however, with the religion of the majority of the Irish peopleand with its influence upon the industrial character of its adherentsthat I am chiefly concerned. Roman Catholicism strikes an outsider asbeing in some of its tendencies non-economic, if not actuallyanti-economic. These tendencies have, of course, much fuller play whenthey act on a people whose education has (through no fault of their own)been retarded or stunted. The fact is not in dispute, but the difficultyarises when we come to apportion the blame between ignorance on the partof the people and a somewhat one-sided religious zeal on the part oflarge numbers of their clergy. I do not seek to do so with any precisionhere. I am simply adverting to what has appeared to me, in the course ofmy experience in Ireland, to be a defect in the industrial character ofRoman Catholics which, however caused, seems to me to have beenintensified by their religion. The reliance of that religion onauthority, its repression of individuality, and its complete shifting ofwhat I may call the moral centre of gravity to a future existence--tomention no other characteristics--appear to me calculated, unlesssupplemented by other influences, to check the growth of the qualitiesof initiative and self-reliance, especially amongst a people whose lackof education unfits them for resisting the influence of what may presentitself to such minds as a kind of fatalism with resignation as itsparamount virtue.It is true that one cannot expect of any church or religion, as acondition of its acceptance, that it will furnish an economic theory;and it is also true that Roman Catholicism has, at different periods ofhistory, advantageously affected economic conditions, even if it did notact from distinctively economic motives--for example, by its directinfluence in the suppression of slavery[17] and its creation of themediaeval craft guilds. It may, too, be admitted that during the MiddleAges, when Roman Catholicism was freer than now to manifest itsinfluence in many directions, owing to its practically unchallengedsupremacy, it favoured, when it did not originate, many forms of soundeconomic activity, and was, to say the least, abreast of the time in itsconception of the working of economic causes. But from the time whenthe Reformation, by its demand for what we Protestants conceive to be asimpler Christianity, drove Roman Catholicism back, if I may use theexpression, on its first line of defence, and constrained it to look toits distinctively spiritual heritage, down to the present day, it hasseemed to stand strangely aloof from any contact with industrial andeconomic issues. When we consider that in this period Adam Smith livedand died, the industrial revolution was effected, and the world-marketopened, it is not surprising that we do not find Roman Catholiccountries in the van of economic progress, or even the Roman Catholicelement in Protestant countries, as a rule, abreast of theirfellow-countrymen. It would, however, be an error to ignore some notableexceptions to this generalisation. In Belgium, in France, in parts ofGermany and Austria, and in the north of Italy economic thought ismaking headway amongst Roman Catholics, and the solution of socialproblems is being advanced by Roman Catholic laymen and clergymen. Evenin these countries, however, much remains to be done. The revolution inthe industrial order, and its consequences, such as the concentration ofimmense populations within restricted areas, have brought with themsocial and moral evils that must be met with new weapons. In theinterests of religion itself, principles first expounded to a Syriancommunity with the most elementary physical needs and the simplest ofavocations, have to be taught in their application to the conditions ofthe most complex social organisation and economic life. Taking peopleas we find them, it may be said with truth that their lives must bewholesome before they can be holy, and while a voluntary asceticism mayhave its justification, it behoves a Church to see that its members,while fully acknowledging the claims of another life, should develop thequalities which make for well-being in this life. In fact, I believethat the influence of Christianity upon social progress will be bestmaintained by co-ordinating these spiritual and economic ideals in aphilosophy of life broader and truer than any to which the nations haveyet attained.What I have just been saying with regard to Roman Catholicism generally,in relation to economic doctrines and industrial progress, applies, ofcourse, with a hundred fold pertinence to the case of Ireland. Betweenthe enactment of the first Penal Laws and the date of Roman CatholicEmancipation, Irish Roman Catholics were, to put it mildly, affordedscant opportunity, in their own country, of developing economic virtuesor achieving industrial success. Ruthlessly deprived of education, arethey to be blamed if they did not use the newly acquired facilities tothe best advantage? With their religion looked on as the badge of legaland social inferiority, was it any wonder that priests and people alike,while clinging with unexampled fidelity to their creed, remainedaltogether cut off from the current of material prosperity? Excluded, asthey were, not merely from social and political privileges, but from themost ordinary civil rights, denied altogether the right of ownership ofreal property, and restricted in the possession of personalty, is itany wonder that they are not to-day in the van of industrial andcommercial progress? Nay, more, was it to have been expected that thecharacter of a people so persecuted and ostracised should have come outof the ordeal of centuries with its adaptability and elasticityunimpaired? That would have been impossible. Those who are intimate withthe Roman Catholic people of Ireland, and at the same time familiar withtheir history, will recognise in their character and mental outlook manyan inheritance of that epoch of serfdom. I speak, of course, of themass, for I am not unmindful of many exceptions to this generalisation.But I must now pass on to a more definite consideration of the presentaction and attitude of the Irish Roman Catholic clergy towards theeconomic, educational, and other issues discussed in this book. Thereasons which render such a consideration necessary are obvious. Even ifwe include Ulster, three quarters of the Irish people are RomanCatholics, while, excluding the Northern province, quite nine-tenths ofthe population belong to that religion. Again, the three thousandclergymen of that denomination exercise an influence over their flocksnot merely in regard to religious matters, but in almost every phase oftheir lives and conduct, which is, in its extent and character, quiteunique, even, I should say, amongst Roman Catholic communities. To aProtestant, this authority seems to be carried very far beyond what thelegitimate influence of any clergy over the lay members of theircongregation should be. We are, however, dealing with a national lifeexplicable only by reference to a very exceptional and gloomy history ofreligious persecution. What I may call the secular shortcomings of theRoman Catholics in Ireland cannot be fairly judged except as the resultsof a series of enactments by which they were successively denied almostall means of succeeding as citizens of this world.From such study as I have been able to give to the history of theirChurch, I have come to the conclusion that the immense power of theIrish Roman Catholic clergy has been singularly little abused. I thinkit must be admitted that they have not exhibited in any marked degreebigotry towards Protestants. They have not put obstacles in the way ofthe Roman Catholic majority choosing Protestants for political leaders,and it is significant that refugees, such as the Palatines, fromCatholic persecutions in Europe, found at different times a home amongstthe Roman Catholic people of Ireland. My own experience, too, if I mayagain refer to that, distinctly proves that it is no disadvantage to aman to be a Protestant in Irish political life, and that whereopposition is shown to him by Roman Catholics it is almost invariably onpolitical, social, or agrarian, but not on religious grounds.A charge of another kind has of late been often brought against theRoman Catholic clergy, which has a direct bearing upon the economicaspect of this question. Although, as I read Irish history, the RomanCatholic priesthood have, in the main, used their authority withpersonal disinterestedness, if not always with prudence or discretion,their undoubted zeal for religion has, on occasion, assumed forms whichenlightened Roman Catholics, including high dignitaries of that Church,think unjustifiable on economic grounds, and discourage even from areligious standpoint. Excessive and extravagant church-building in theheart and at the expense of poor communities is a recent and notoriousexample of this misdirected zeal. It has been, I believe, too oftenforgotten that the best monument of any clergyman's influence andearnestness must always be found in the moral character and thespiritual fibre of his flock, and not in the marbles and mosaics of agaudy edifice. And without doubt a good many motives which have but aremote connection with religion are, unfortunately, at work in thechurch-building movement. It may, however, to some extent, be regardedas an extreme re-action from the penal times, when the hunted _soggarth_had to celebrate the Mass in cabins and caves on the mountain side--are-action the converse of which was witnessed in Protestant England whenPuritanism rose up against Anglicanism in the seventeenth century. Thisexpenditure, however, has been incurred; and, no one, I take it, wouldadvocate the demolition of existing religious edifices on the groundthat their erection had been unduly costly! The moral is for the presentand the future, and applies not merely to economy in new buildings, butalso in the decoration of existing churches.[18]But it is not alone extravagant church building which in a country sobackward as Ireland, shocks the economic sense. The multiplication--ininverse ratio to a declining population--of costly and elaboratemonastic and conventual institutions, involving what in the aggregatemust be an enormous annual expenditure for maintenance, is difficult toreconcile with the known conditions of the country. Most of theseinstitutions, it is true, carry on educational work, often, as in thecase of the Christian Brothers and some colleges and convents, of anexcellent kind. Many of them render great services to the poor, andespecially to the sick poor. But, none the less, it seems to me, theirgrowth in number and size is anomalous. I cannot believe that so largean addition to the 'unproductive' classes is economically sound, and Ihave no doubt at all that the competition with lay teachers of celibates'living in community' is excessive and educationally injurious. Stronglyas I hold the importance of religion in education, I personally do notthink that teachers who have renounced the world and withdrawn fromcontact with its stress and strain are the best moulders of thecharacters of youths who will have to come into direct conflict with thetrials and temptations of life. But here again we must accept thesituation and work with the instruments ready to hand. The practical andstatesmanlike action for all those concerned is to endeavour to renderthese institutions as efficient educational agencies as may be possible.They owe their existence largely to the gaps in the educational systemof this country which religious and political strife have produced andmaintained, and they deserve the utmost credit for endeavouring tosupply missing steps in our educational ladder.[19] If they now fullyrespond to the spirit of the new movements and meet the demand fortechnical education by the employment of the most approved methods andequipment, and by the thorough training on sound lines of their staffs,it is impossible that their influence on the young generation should notbe as salutary as it will be wide-reaching.But, after all, these criticisms are, for the purposes of my argument,of minor relevance and importance. The real matter in which the directand personal responsibility of the Roman Catholic clergy seems to me tobe involved, is the character and _morale_ of the people of thiscountry. No reader of this book will accuse me of attaching too littleweight to the influence of historical causes on the present state,social, economic and political, of Ireland, but even when I have givenfull consideration to all such influences I still think that, with theirunquestioned authority in religion, and their almost equally undisputedinfluence in education, the Roman Catholic clergy cannot be exoneratedfrom some responsibility in regard to Irish character as we find itto-day. Are they, I would ask, satisfied with that character? I cannotthink so. The impartial observer will, I fear, find amongst a majorityof our people a striking absence of self-reliance and moral courage; anentire lack of serious thought on public questions; a listlessness andapathy in regard to economic improvement which amount to a form offatalism; and, in backward districts, a survival of superstition, whichsaps all strength of will and purpose--and all this, too, amongst apeople singularly gifted by nature with good qualities of mind andheart.Nor can the Roman Catholic clergy altogether console themselves with thethought that religious faith, even when free from superstition, isstrong in the breasts of the people. So long, no doubt, as Irish RomanCatholics remain at home, in a country of sharply defined religiousclasses, and with a social environment and a public opinion sopreponderatingly stamped with their creed, open defections from RomanCatholicism are rare. But we have only to look at the extent of the'leakage' from Roman Catholicism amongst the Irish emigrants in theUnited States and in Great Britain, to realise how largely emotional andformal must be the religion of those who lapse so quickly in anon-Catholic atmosphere.[20]It is not, of course, to the causes of the defections from a creed towhich I do not subscribe that my criticism is directed. I refer to thematter only in order to emphasise the large share of responsibilitywhich belongs to the Roman Catholic clergy for what I strongly believeto be the chief part in the work of national regeneration, the partcompared with which all legislative, administrative, educational orindustrial achievements are of minor importance. Holding, as I do, thatthe building of character is the condition precedent to material, socialand intellectual advancement, indeed to all national progress, I may,perhaps, as a lay citizen, more properly criticise, from this point ofview, what I conceive to be the great defect in the methods of clericalinfluence. For this purpose no better illustration could be affordedthan a brief analysis of the results of the efforts made by the RomanCatholic clergy to inculcate temperance.Among temperance advocates--the most earnest of all reformers--the RomanCatholic clergy have an honourable record. An Irish priest was thegreatest, and, for a brief spell, the most successful temperance apostleof the last century, and statistics, it is only fair to say, show thatwe Irish drink rather less than people in other parts of the UnitedKingdom. But the real question is whether we more often drink tointoxication, and police statistics as well as common experience seem todisclose that we do. Many a temperate man drinks more in his life thanmany a village drunkard. Again, the test of the average consumption ofman, woman and child is somewhat misleading, especially in Irelandwhere, owing to the excessive emigration of adults, there is adisproportionately large number of very young and old. Moreover, weIrish drink more in proportion to our means than the English, Scotch,and Welsh, whose consumption is absolutely larger. Anyone who attemptsto deal practically with the problems of industrial development inIreland realises what a terribly depressing influence the drink evilexercises upon the industrial capacity of the people. 'Ireland sober isIreland free,' is nearer the truth, than much that is thought and mostof what is said about liberty in this country.Now, the drink habit in Ireland differs from that of the other parts ofthe United Kingdom. The Irishman is, in my belief, physiologically lesssubject to the craving for alcohol than the Englishman, a fact which ispartially attributable, I should say, to the less animal dietary towhich he is accustomed. By far the greater proportion of the drinkingwhich retards our progress is of a festive character. It takes place atfairs and markets, sometimes, even yet, at 'wakes,' those ghastlyparodies on the blessed consolation of religion in bereavement. It isintensified by the almost universal sale of liquor in the country shops'for consumption on the premises,' an evil the demoralising effects ofwhich are an hundredfold greater than those of the 'grocer's licences'which temperance reformers so strenuously denounce. It is an evil indefence of which nothing can be said, but it has somehow escaped theeffective censure of the Church.The indiscriminate granting of licences in Ireland, which has resultedin the provision of liquor shops in a proportion to the populationlarger than is found in any other country, is in itself due mainly tothe moral cowardice of magistrates, who do not care to incur localunpopularity by refusing licences for which there is no pretence of anyneed beyond that of the applicant and his relatives. Not long ago themagistrates of Ireland met in Dublin in order to inaugurate commonaction in dealing with this scandal. Appropriate resolutions werepassed, and much good has already resulted from the meeting, but had theunvarnished truth been admissible, the first and indeed the onlynecessary resolution should have run, "Resolved that in future we becollectively as brave as we have been individually timid, and that wetake heart of grace and carry away from this meeting sufficient strengthto do, in the exercise of our functions as the licensing authority, whatwe have always known to be our plain duty to our country and our God."No such resolution was proposed, for though patriotism is becoming realin Ireland, it is not yet very robust.I do not think it unfair to insist upon the large responsibility of theclergy for the state of public opinion in this matter, to which the fewfacts I have cited bear testimony. But I attribute their failure to dealwith a moral evil of which they are fully cognisant to the fact thatthey do not recognise the chief defect in the character of the people,and to a misunderstanding of the means by which that character can bestrengthened. There are, however, exceptions to this general statement.It is of happy augury for the future of Ireland that many of the clergyare now leading a temperance movement which shows a real knowledge ofthe _causa causans_ of Irish intemperance. The Anti-Treating League, asit is called, administers a novel pledge which must have been conceivedin a very understanding mind. Those enlisted undertake neither to treatnor to be treated. They may drink, so far as the pledge is concerned, asmuch as they like; but they must drink at their own expense; and othersmust not drink at their expense. The good nature and sociability ofIrishmen, too often the mere result of inability to say 'no,' need notbe sacrificed. But even if they were, the loss of these social graceswould be far more than compensated by a self-respect and seriousness oflife out of which something permanent might be built. Still, even thisLeague makes no direct appeal to character, and so acts rather as a curefor than as a preventive of our moral weakness.The methods by which clerical influence is wielded in the inculcation ofchastity may be criticised from exactly the same standpoint as that fromwhich I have found it necessary to deal with the question of temperance.Here the success of the Irish priesthood is, considering the conditionsof peasant life, and the fire of the Celtic temperament, absolutelyunique. No one can deny that almost the entire credit of this moralachievement belongs to the Roman Catholic clergy. It may be said thatthe practice of a virtue, even if the motive be of an emotional kind,becomes a habit, and that habit proverbially develops into a secondnature. With this view of moral evolution I am in entire accord; but Iwould ask whether the evolution has not reached a stage where a gradualrelaxation of the disciplinary measures by which chastity is insuredmight be safely allowed without any danger of lowering the high standardof continence which is general in Ireland and which of course it is ofsupreme importance to maintain.There are, however, many parishes where in this matter the strictestdiscipline is rigorously enforced Amusements, not necessarily or evenoften vicious, are objected to as being fraught with dangers which wouldnever occur to any but the rigidly ascetic or the puritanical mind. Inmany parishes the Sunday cyclist will observe the strange phenomenon ofa normally light-hearted peasantry marshalled in male and female groupsalong the road, eyeing one another in dull wonderment across theforbidden space through the long summer day. This kind of discipline,unless when really necessary, is open to the objection that iteliminates from the education of life, especially during the formativeyears, an essential of culture--the mutual understanding of the sexes.The evil of grafting upon secular life a quasi-monasticism which, notbeing voluntary, has no real effect upon the character, may perhapsinvolve moral consequences little dreamed of by the spiritual guardiansof the people. A study of the pathology of the emotions might throwdoubt upon the safety of enforced asceticism when unaccompanied by thetraining which the Church wisely prescribes for those who take the vowof celibacy. But of my own knowledge I can speak only of another aspectof the effect upon our national life of the restrictions to which Irefer. No Irishmen are more sincerely desirous of staying the tide ofemigration than the Roman Catholic clergy, and while, wisely as I think,they do not dream of a wealthy Ireland, they earnestly work for thephysical and material as well as the spiritual well-being of theirflocks. And yet no man can get into the confidence of the emigratingclasses without being told by them that the exodus is largely due to afeeling that the clergy are, no doubt from an excellent motive, takingjoy--innocent joy--from the social side of the home life.To go more fully into these subjects might carry me beyond the properlimits of lay criticism. But, clearly, large questions of clericaltraining must suggest themselves to those to whom their discussionproperly belongs--whether, for example, there is not in the instanceswhich I have cited evidence of a failure to understand that mereauthority in the regions of moral conduct cannot have any abidingeffect, except in the rarest combination of circumstances, and with avery primitive people. Do not many of these clergy ignore the vastdifference between the ephemeral nature of moral compulsion and theenduring force of a real moral training?I have dealt with the exercise of clerical influence in these matters asbeing, at any rate in relation to the subject matter of this book, farmore important than the evil commonly described as "The Priest inPolitics." That evil is, in my opinion, greatly misrepresented. Thecases of priests who take an improper part in politics are cited withoutreference to the vastly greater number who take no part at all, exceptwhen genuinely assured that a definite moral issue is at stake. I alsohave in my mind the question of how we should have fared if the controlof the different Irish agitations had been confined to laymen, and ifthe clergy had not consistently condemned secret associations. Butwhatever may be said in defence of the priest in politics in the past,there are the strongest grounds for deprecating a continuance of theirpolitical activity in the future. As I gauge the several forces nowoperating in Ireland, I am convinced that if an anti-clerical movementsimilar to that which other Roman Catholic countries have witnessed,were to succeed in discrediting the priesthood and lowering them inpublic estimation, it would be followed by a moral, social, andpolitical degradation which would blight, or at least postpone, ourhopes of a national regeneration. From this point of view I hold thatthose clergymen who are predominantly politicians endanger the moralinfluence which it is their solemn duty to uphold. I believe however,that the over-active part hitherto taken in politics by the priests islargely the outcome of the way in which Roman Catholics were treated inthe past, and that this undesirable feature in Irish life will yield,and is already yielding to the removal of the evils to which it owed itsorigin and in some measure its justification.[21]One has only to turn to the spirit and temper of such representativeRoman Catholics as Archbishop Healy and Dr. Kelly, Bishop of Ross--totheir words and to their deeds--in order to catch the inspiration of anew movement amongst our Roman Catholic fellow-countrymen at oncereligious and patriotic. And if my optimism ever wavers, I have but tothink of the noble work that many priests are to my own knowledgedoing, often in remote and obscure parishes, in the teeth of innumerableobstacles. I call to mind at such times, as pioneers in a greatawakening, men like the eminent Jesuit, Father Thomas Finlay, FatherHegarty of Erris, Father O'Donovan of Loughrea, and many others--menwith whom I have worked and taken counsel, and who represent, I believe,an ever increasing number of their fellow priests.[22]My position, then, towards the influence of the Roman Catholicclergy--and this influence is a matter of vital importance to theunderstanding of Irish problems--- may now be clearly defined. Whilerecognising to the full that large numbers of the Irish Roman Catholicclergy have in the past exercised undue influence in purely politicalquestions, and, in many other matters, social, educational, andeconomic, have not, as I see things, been on the side of progress, Ihold that their influence is now, more than ever before, essential forimproving the condition of the most backward section of the population.Therefore I feel it to be both the duty and the strong interest of myProtestant fellow-countrymen to think much less of the religiousdifferences which divide them from Roman Catholics, and much more oftheir common citizenship and their common cause. I also hold with equalstrength and sincerity to the belief, which I have already expressed,that the shortcomings of the Roman Catholic clergy are largely to beaccounted for, not by any innate tendency on their part towardsobscurantism, but by the sad history of Ireland in the past. I wouldappeal to those of my co-religionists who think otherwise to suspendtheir judgment for a time. That Roman Catholicism is firmly establishedin Ireland is a fact of the situation which they must admit, and as thisinvolves the continued powerful influence of the priesthood upon thecharacter of the people, it is surely good policy by liberality and fairdealing, especially in the matter of education, to turn this influencetowards the upbuilding of our national life.To sum up the influence of religion and religious controversy inIreland, as it presents itself from the only standpoint from which Ihave approached the matter in this chapter, namely, that of material,social, and intellectual progress, I find that while the Protestantshave given, and continue to give, a fine example of thrift and industryto the rest of the nation, the attitude of a section of them towards themajority of their fellow-countrymen has been a bigoted and unintelligentone. On the other hand, I have learned from practical experience amongstthe Roman Catholic people of Ireland that, while more free from bigotry,in the sense in which that word is usually applied, they are apathetic,thriftless, and almost non-industrial, and that they especially requirethe exercise of strengthening influences on their moral fibre. I havedealt with their shortcomings at much greater length than with those ofProtestants, because they have much more bearing on the subject matterof this book. North and South have each virtues which the other lacks;each has much to learn from the other; but the home of the strictlycivic virtues and efficiencies is in Protestant Ireland. The work of thefuture in Ireland will be to break down in social intercourse thebarriers of creed as well as those of race, politics, and class, andthus to promote the fruitful contact of North and South, and theconcentration of both on the welfare of their common country. In thecase of those of us, of whatever religious belief, who look to a futurefor our country commensurate with the promise of her undevelopedresources both of intellect and soil, it is of the essence of our hopethat the qualities which are in great measure accountable for the actualeconomic and educational backwardness of so many of ourfellow-countrymen, and for the intolerance of too many who are notbackward in either respect, are not purely racial or sectarian, but arethe transitory growth of days and deeds which we must all try to forgetif our work for Ireland is to endure.FOOTNOTES:[16] The reproach which is brought upon Irish Christianity mainly by theextravagances of a section of my co-religionists, to which I have beenobliged to refer, came home to me not long ago in a very forcible way. Ihappened to remark to a friend that it was a disgrace to Christianitythat Mussulman soldiery were employed at the Holy Sepulchre to keep thepeace between the Latin and Greek Christians. He reminded me that theprosperous and progressive municipality of Belfast, with a populationeminently industrious, and predominantly Protestant, has to be policedby an Imperial force in order to restrain two sections of IrishChristians from assaulting each other in the name of religion.[17] '_Pro salute animae meae_' was, I am reminded, the considerationusually expressed in the old charters of manumission.[18] One of the unfortunate effects of this passion for building costlychurches is the importation of quantities of foreign art-work in theshape of woodcarvings, stained glass, mosaics, and metal work. To goodforeign art, indeed, one could not, within certain limits, object. Itmight prove a valuable example and stimulus. But the articles which haveactually been imported, in the impulse to get everything finished assoon as possible, generally consist of the stock pieces produced in aspirit of mere commercialism in the workshops of Continental firms whichmake it their business to cater for a public who do not know thedifference between good art and bad. Much of the decoration ofecclesiastical buildings, whether Roman Catholic or Protestant, mightfittingly be postponed until religion in Ireland has got into closerrelation with the native artistic sense and industrial spirit nowbeginning to seek creative expression.[19] The following extract from a statement of the Most Rev. Dr. O'Dea,the newly elected Bishop of Clonfert, is pertinent:--'There is anothercause also--i.e. in addition to the absence of university education forRoman Catholic laymen--which has hindered the employment of the laity inthe past. Till very recently, the secondary Catholic schools received noassistance whatever from the State, and their endowment from privatesources was utterly inadequate to supply suitable remuneration for layteachers. It is evident that a celibate clergy _can_ live on a lowerwage than the laity, and they are now charged with having monopolizedthe schools, because they chose to work for a minimum allowance ratherthan suffer the country to remain without any secondary educationwhatever. Two causes, then, operated in the past, and in a large measurestill operate, to exclude the laity from the secondary schools,--first,these schools were so poverty-stricken that they could not afford to paylay teachers at such a rate as would attract them to the teachingprofession, and, next, the Catholic laity as a body were uneducated,and, therefore, unfit to teach in the schools.'--_Maynooth and theUniversity Question_, p. 109 (footnote).[20] See, _inter alia_, an article "Ireland and America," by Rev. Mr.Shinnors, O.M., in the _Irish Ecclesiastical Record_, February, 1902.'Has the Church,' asks Father Shinnors, 'increased her membership in theratio that the population of the United States has increased? No. Thereare many converts, but there are many more apostates. Large numberslapse into indifferentism and irreligion. There should be in Americaabout 20,000,000 Catholics; there are scarcely 10,000,000. There arereasons to fear that the great majority of the apostates are of Irishextraction, and not a few of them of Irish birth.'[21] This view seems to be taken by the most influential spokesmen ofthe Roman Catholic Hierarchy. See Evidence, _Royal Commission onUniversity Education in Ireland_, vol. iii., p. 238, Questions 8702-6.[22] I may mention that of the co-operative societies organised by theIrish Agricultural Organisation Society there are no fewer than 331societies of which the local priests are the Chairmen, while to my ownknowledge during the summer and autumn of 1902, as many as 50,000persons from all parts of Ireland were personally conducted over theexhibit of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction atthe Cork Exhibition by their local clergy. The educational purpose ofthese visits is explained in Chap. x. Again, in a great number of casesthe village libraries which have been recently started in Ireland withthe assistance of the Department (the books consisting largely ofindustrial, economic, and technical works on agriculture), have beenorganised and assisted by the Roman Catholic clergy.CHAPTER V.A PRACTICAL VIEW OF IRISH EDUCATION.A little learning, we are told, is a dangerous thing; and in theirdealings with Irish education the English should have discovered thatthis danger is accentuated when the little learning is combined withmuch native wit. In the days when religious persecution wasuniversal--only, be it remembered, a few generations ago--it was thepolicy of England to avert this danger by prohibiting, as far aspossible, the acquisition by Irish Roman Catholics of any learning atall. After the Union, Englishmen began to feel their responsibility forthe state of Ireland, a state of poverty and distress which culminatedin the Famine. Knowledge was then no longer withheld: indeed the Englishsincerely desired to dispel our darkness and enable us to share in thewisdom, and so in the prosperity, of the predominant partner. In theirattempts to educate us they dealt with what they saw on the surface, andmoulded their educational principles upon what they knew; but they didnot know Ireland. Even if we excuse them for paying scant attention towhat they were told by Irishmen, they should have given more heed to thereports of their own Royal Commissions.We have so far seen that the Irish mind has been in regard toeconomics, politics, and even some phases of religious influence, a mindwarped and diseased, deprived of good nutrition and fed on fancies orfictions, out of which no genuine growth, industrial or other, waspossible. The one thing that might have strengthened and saved a peoplewith such a political, social, and religious history, and such racialcharacteristics, was an educational system which would have had specialregard to that history, and which would have been a just expression ofthe better mind of the people whom it was intended to serve.Now this is exactly what was denied to Ireland. Not merely has alleducational legislation come from England, in the sense of being basedon English models and thought out by Englishmen largely out of touch andsympathy with the peculiar needs of Ireland, but whenever there has beengenuine native thought on Irish educational problems, it has been eitherignored altogether or distorted till its value and significance werelost. And in this matter we can claim for Ireland that there was in thecountry during the first half of the nineteenth century, when Englandwas trying her best to provide us with a sound English education, acomparatively advanced stage of home-grown Irish thought upon theeducational needs of the people. Take, for example, the Society forPromoting Elementary Education among the Irish Poor, know as the KildareStreet Society, which was founded as early as the year 1811. The firstresolution passed by this body, which was composed of prominent Dublincitizens of all religious beliefs, was set out as follows:--     (1.) Resolved--That promoting the education of the poor of Ireland     is a grand object which every Irishman anxious for the welfare and     prosperity of his country ought to have in view as the basis upon     which the morals and true happiness of the country can be best     secured.This Society, it is true, did not see or foresee that any system ofmixed religious education was doomed to failure in Ireland, but theytook a wide view of the place of education in a nation's development,and the character of the education which their schools actuallydispensed was admirable. This hopeful and enterprising educationalmovement is described by Mr. Lecky in a passage from which I take a fewextracts:--     The "Kildare Street Society" which received an endowment from     Government, and directed National education from 1812 to 1831, was     not proselytising, and it was for some time largely patronized by     Roman Catholics. It is certainly by no means deserving of the     contempt which some writers have bestowed on it, and if measured by     the spirit of the time in which it was founded it will appear both     liberal and useful.... The object of the schools was stated to be     united education, "taking common Christian ground for the     foundation, and excluding all sectarian distinctions from every     part of the arrangement;" "drawing the attention of both     denominations to the many leading truths of Christianity in which     they agree." To carry out this principle it was a fundamental rule     that the Bible must be read without note or comment in all the     schools. It might be read either in the Authorized or in the Douay     version.... In 1825 there were 1,490 schools connected with the     Society, containing about 100,000 pupils. The improvements     introduced into education by Bell, Lancaster, and Pestalozzi were     largely adopted. Great attention was paid to needlework.... A great     number of useful publications were printed by the Society, and we     have the high authority of Dr. Doyle for stating that he never     found anything objectionable [to Catholics] in them.[23]Take, again, as an evidence of the progressive spirit of the Irishthinkers on education, the remarkable scheme of national educationwhich, after the passing of the Catholic Emancipation Act, wasformulated by Mr. Thomas Wyse, of Waterford. In addition to elementaryschools, Mr. Wyse proposed to establish in every county, 'an academy forthe education of the middle class of society in those departments ofknowledge most necessary to those classes, and over those a College ineach of the four provinces, managed by a Committee representative of theinterests of the several counties of the provinces.' 'It is a matter ofimportance,' wrote Mr. Wyse, 'for the simple and efficient working ofthe whole system of national education, that each part should as much aspossible be brought into co-operation and accord with the others.' Heforesaw, too, that one of the needs of the Irish temperament was atraining in science which would cultivate the habits of 'education,observation, and reasoning,' and he pointed out that the peculiarmanufactures, trades, and occupations of the several localities woulddetermine the course of studies. Mr. Wyse's memorandum on education led,as is well known, to the creation of the Board of National Education,but, to quote Dr. Starkie,[24] the present Resident Commissioner of theBoard, 'the more important part of the scheme, dealing with a universityand secondary education, was shelved, in spite of Mr. Wyse's warningsthat it was imprudent, dangerous, and pernicious to the social conditionof the country, and to its future tranquillity, that so muchencouragement should be given to the education of the lower classes,without at the same time due provision being made for the education ofthe middle and upper classes.'As still another evidence of the sound thought on educational problemswhich came from Irishmen who knew the actual conditions of their owncountry and people, the case of the agricultural instructionadministered by the National Board is pertinent. The late Sir PatrickKeenan has told us that landlords and others who on political andreligious grounds distrusted the National system, turned to this featureof the operations of the National Board with the greatest fervour. Ascheme of itinerant instruction in agriculture, which had a curiousresemblance to that which the Department of Agriculture is noworganising, was developed, and was likely to have worked with thegreatest advantage to the country at large. Sir Patrick Keenan, whoknew Ireland and the Irish people well, speaks of this part of thescheme as 'the most fruitful experiment in the material interests of thecountry that was ever attempted. It was,' he adds, 'through the agencyof this corps of practical instructors that green cropping as asystematic feature in farming was introduced into the South and West,and even into the central parts of Ireland.' But all the hopes thusraised went down, not before any intrinsic difficulties in the schemeitself, or before any adverse opinion to it in Ireland, but before theopposition of the Liverpool Financial Reform Association, who had theirown views as to the limits of State interference with agriculture. Theseexamples, drawn from different stages of Irish educational history,might easily be multiplied, but they will serve as typical instances ofthat want of recognition by English statesmen of Irish thought on Irishproblems, and that ignoring of Irish sentiment--as distinguished fromIrish sentimentality--which I insist is the basal element in themisunderstandings of Irish problems.I now come to a brief consideration of some facts of the presenteducational situation, and I shall indicate, for those readers who arenot familiar with current events in Ireland, the significant evolution,or revolution, through which Irish education is passing. Within the lasteight years we have had in Ireland three very remarkable reports--inthemselves symptoms of a widespread unrest and dissatisfaction--on theeducational systems of the country. I allude to the reports of twoViceregal Commissions, one on Manual and Practical Instruction in ourPrimary Schools, and the other on our Intermediate Education; and to therecent report by a Royal Commission on University Education. Thesereports cover the three grades of our educational system, and each ofthem contains a strong denunciation and a scathing criticism of theexisting provision and methods of instruction in elementary, secondary,and university education (outside Dublin University), respectively. Oneand all showed that the education to be had in our primary and secondaryschools, as well as in the examining body known as the Royal University,had little regard to the industrial or economic conditions of thecountry. We find, for example, agriculture taught out of a text book inthe primary schools, with the result that the _gamins_ of the Belfaststreets secured the highest marks in the subject. In the Intermediatesystem are to be found anomalies of a similar kind, which could not longhave survived if there had been a living opinion on educational mattersin Ireland. No careful reader of the evidence given before theCommissions can fail to see that under our educational system theschools were practically bribed to fall in with a stereotyped course ofstudies which left scant room for elasticity and adaptation to localneeds; that the teacher was, to all intents and purposes, deprived ofhealthy initiative; and that the Irish parents must as a body have beenin the dark as to the bearing of their children's studies on theirprobable careers in life. A deep and wholesome impression was made inIreland by the exposure of the intrinsic evils of a system calculated inmy opinion to turn our youth into a generation of second-rate clerks,with a distinct distaste for any industrial or productive occupation inwhich such qualities as initiative, self-reliance, or judgment werecalled for.I am told by competent authorities that there is not a singleeducational principle laid down in either the report on ManualInstruction or on Intermediate Education, which was not known andapplied at least half a century ago in continental countries. In fact,in the Recess Committee investigations, as any reader of the report ofthat body can see for himself, the Committee, guided by foreignexperience, foreshadowed practically every reform now being put intooperation. It is better, of course, that we should reform late thannever, but it is well to bear in mind also, so far as the problems ofthis book are concerned, how far the education of the country has fallenshort of any sound standard, and how little could have been expectedfrom the working of our system. The curve of Irish illiteracy has indeedfallen continuously with each succeeding census, but true education asopposed to mere instruction has languished sadly.Together with my friends and fellow-workers in the self-help movement, Ibelieve that the problem of Irish education, like all other Irishproblems, must be reconsidered from the standpoint of its relation tothe practical affairs and everyday life of the people of Ireland. Theneeds and opportunities of the industrial struggle must, in fact, mouldinto shape our educational policy and programmes. We are convinced thatthere is little hope of any real solution of the more general problem ofnational education, unless and until those in direct contact with thespecific industries of the country succeed in bringing to the notice ofthose engaged in the framing of our educational system the kind anddegree of the defects in the industrial character of our people whichdebar them from successful competition with other countries. Educationin Ireland has been too long a thing apart from the economic realitiesof the country--with what result we know. In the work of the Departmentof Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, an attempt isbeing made to establish a vital relation between industrial educationand industrial life. It is desired to try, at this critical stage of ourdevelopment, the experiment--I call it an experiment only because itdoes not seem to have been tried before in Ireland--of directing ourinstruction with a conscious and careful regard to the probable futurecareers of those we are educating.This attempt touches, of course, only one department of the wholeeducational problem, much of which it would be quite outside my presentpurpose to discuss. But I must guard against the supposition that in ourinsistence upon the importance of the practical side of education weare under any doubt as to the great importance of the literary side. Myfriends and I have been deeply impressed by the educational experienceof Denmark, where the people, who are as much dependent on agricultureas are the Irish, have brought it by means of organisation to a moregenuine success than it has attained anywhere else in Europe. Yet aninquirer will at once discover that it is to the "High Schools" foundedby Bishop Grundtvig, and not to the agricultural schools, which are alsoexcellent, that the extraordinary national progress is mainly due. Afriend of mine who was studying the Danish system of State aid toagriculture, found this to be the opinion of the Danes of all classes,and was astounded at the achievements of the associations of farmers,not only in the manufacture of butter, but in a far more difficultundertaking, the manufacture of bacon in large factories equipped withall the most modern machinery and appliances which science had devisedfor the production of the finished article. He at first concluded thatthis success in a highly technical industry by bodies of farmersindicated a very perfect system of technical education. But he soonfound another cause. As one of the leading educators and agriculturistsof the country put it to him: 'It's not technical instruction, it's thehumanities.' I would like to add that it is also, if I may coin a term,the 'nationalities,' for nothing is more evident to the student ofDanish education or, I might add, of the excellent system of theChristian Brothers in Ireland, than that one of the secrets of theirsuccess is to be found in their national basis and their foundationupon the history and literature of the country.To sum up the educational situation in Ireland, it is not too much tosay that all our forms of education, technical and general, hang loose.We lack a body of trained teachers; we have no alert and informed publicopinion on education and its function in regard to life; and there is noproper provision for research work in all branches, a deficiency, which,I am told by those who have given deep thought and long study to theseproblems, inevitably reacts most disastrously on the general educationalsystem of the country. This state of things appears not unnatural whenwe remember that the Penal Laws were not repealed till almost the closeof the eighteenth century, and that a large majority of the Irish peoplehad not full and free access to even primary and secondary educationuntil the passing of the Emancipation Act in 1829. At the present day,the absence of any provision for higher education of which RomanCatholics will avail themselves is not merely an enormous loss initself, but it reacts most adversely upon the whole educationalmachinery, and consequently upon the whole public life and thought ofthat section of the nation.One of the very first things I had to learn when I came into directtouch with educational problems, was that the education of a countrycannot be divided into water-tight compartments, and each partlegislated for or discussed solely on its merits and without referenceto the other parts. I see now very clearly that the educational systemof a country is an organic whole, the working of any part of whichnecessarily has an influence on the working of the rest. I had alwayslooked upon the lower, secondary, and higher grades as the first,second, and third storeys of the educational house, and I am not quitesure that I attached sufficient importance to the staircase. My view hasnow changed, and I find myself regarding the University as a foundationand support of the primary and secondary school.It was not on purely pedagogic grounds that I added to my otherpolitical irregularities the earnest advocacy of such a provision forhigher education as Roman Catholics will avail themselves of. This greatneed was revealed to me in my study of the Irish mind and of thedirection in which it could look for its higher development. My beliefis based on practical experience; my point of view is that of theeconomist. When the new economic mission in Ireland began now fourteenyears ago, we had to undertake, in addition to our practical programme,a kind of University extension work with the important omission of theUniversity. We had to bring home to adult farmers whose generaleducation was singularly poor, though their native intelligence was keenand receptive, a large number of general ideas bearing on the productiveand distributive side of their industry. Our chief obstacles arose fromthe lack of trained economic thought among all classes, and especiallyamong those to whom the majority looked for guidance. The air was thickwith economic fallacies or half-truths. We were, it is true, successfulbeyond our expectations in planting in apparently uncongenial soil soundeconomic principles. But our success was mainly due, as I shall showlater, to our having used the associative instincts of the Irish peasantto help out the working of our theories; and we became convinced that ifa tithe of our priests, public men, national school teachers, andmembers of our local bodies had received a university education, weshould have made much more rapid progress.I hardly know how to describe the mental atmosphere in which we wereworking. It would be no libel upon the public opinion upon which wesought to make an impression to say that it really allowed no questionto be discussed on its merits. Public opinion on social and economicquestions is changing now, but I cannot associate the change with anyinfluence emanating from institutions of higher education. In othercountries, so far as my investigations have extended, the universitiesdo guide economic thought and have a distinct though wholly unofficialfunction as a court of appeal upon questions relating to the materialprogress of the communities amongst which they are situated. Of suchinstitutions there are in Ireland only two which could be expected todirect in any large way the thought of the country upon economic andother important national questions--Maynooth, and Trinity College,Dublin. Whether in their widely different spheres of influence these twoinstitutions could, under conditions other than those prevailing, haveso met the requirements of the country as to have obviated what is atpresent an urgent necessity for a complete reorganisation of highereducation need not be discussed; but it is essential to my argument thatI should set forth clearly the results of my own observation upon theirinfluence, or rather lack of influence, upon the people among whom Ihave worked.The influence of Maynooth, actual and potential, can hardly beexaggerated, but it is exercised indirectly upon the secular thought ofthe country. It is not its function to make a direct impression. It isin fact only a professional--I had almost said a technical--school. Ittrains its students, most admirably I am told, in theology, philosophy,and the studies subsidiary to these sciences, but always, for the vastmajority of its students, with a distinctly practical and definitemissionary end in view. There is, I believe, an arts course of modestscope, designed rather to meet the deficiencies of students whosegeneral education has been neglected than to serve as anything in thenature of a university arts course. I am quite aware of the value of asound training in mental science if given in connection with a fulluniversity course, but I am equally convinced that the Maynootheducation, on the whole, is no substitute for a university course, andthat while its chief end of turning out a large number of trainedpriests has been fulfilled, it has not given, and could not be expectedto have given, that broader and more humane culture which only auniversity, as distinguished from a professional school, can adequatelyprovide.Moreover, under the Maynooth system young clerics are constantly calledupon to take a part in the life of a lay community, towards which, whenthey entered college, they were in no position of responsibility, andupon which, so far as secular matters are concerned, when they emergefrom their theological training, they are no better adapted to exercisea helpful influence. In my experience of priests I have met with many inwhom I recognised a sincere desire to attend to the material and socialwell-being of their flocks, but who certainly had not that breadth ofview and understanding of human nature which perhaps contact with thelaity during the years in which they were passing from discipline toauthority might have given to them. However this may be, it is clear andit is admitted that education as opposed to professional training of ahigh order is still, generally speaking, a want among the priests ofIreland, and I look forward to no greater boon from a University orUniversity College for Roman Catholics than its influence, direct andindirect, on a body of men whose prestige and authority are necessarilyso unique.It is, therefore, to Trinity College, or the University of Dublin, thatone would naturally turn as to a great centre of thought in Ireland forhelp in the theoretic aspects, at least, of the practical problems uponwhose successful solution our national well-being depends. Judged bythe not unimportant test of the men it has supplied to the service ofthe State and country during its three centuries of educationalactivity, by the part it took in one of the brightest epochs of thesethree centuries--the days when it gave Grattan to Grattan's Parliament,by the work and reputation of the _alumni_ it could muster to-day withinand without its walls, our venerable seat of learning need not fearcomparison with any similar institutions in Great Britain. It may also,of course, be said that many men who have passed through Trinity Collegehave impressed the thought of Ireland, and, indeed, of the world, in oneway or another--such men as, to take two very different examples, Burkeand Thomas Davis--but on some of the very best spirits amongst these menTrinity College and its atmosphere have exerted influence rather byrepulsion than by attraction; and certainly their characteristics oftemper or thought have not been of a kind which those best acquaintedwith the atmosphere of Trinity College associate with that institution.Still nothing can detract from the credit of having educated such men.But these tests and standards are, for my present purpose, irrelevant. Iam not writing a book on Irish educational history, or even a record ofpresent-day Irish educational achievement. I am rather trying, from thestandpoint of a practical worker for national progress, to measure thereality and strength of the educational and other influences which areactually and actively operating on the character and intellect of themajority of the Irish people, moulding their thought and directingtheir action towards the upbuilding of our national life.From this point of view I am bound to say that Trinity College, so faras I have seen, has had but little influence upon the minds or the livesof the people. Nor can I find that at any period of the extraordinarilyinteresting economic and social revolution, which has been in progressin Ireland since the great catastrophe of the Famine period, DublinUniversity has departed from its academic isolation and its aloofnessfrom the great national problems that were being worked out. The moreone thinks of it, indeed, and the more one realises the opportunities ofan institution like Trinity College in a country like Ireland, the moreone must recognise how small, in recent times, has been its positiveinfluence on the mind of the country, and how little it has contributedtowards the solution of any of those problems, educational, economic, orsocial, that were clamant for solution, and which in any other countrywould have naturally secured the attention of men who ought to have beenleaders of thought.Whatever the causes, and many may be assigned, this unfortunate lack ofinfluence on the part of Trinity College, has always seemed to me astrong supplementary argument for the creation of another University orUniversity College on a more popular basis, to which the Roman Catholicpeople of Ireland would have recourse. From the fact that Maynooth byits constitution could never have developed into a great nationalUniversity,[25] and that Trinity College has never, as a matter of fact,done so, and has thus, in my opinion, missed a unique opportunity, ithas come about that Ireland has been without any great centre of thoughtwhose influence would have tended to leaven the mass of mentalinactivity or random-thinking so prevalent in Ireland, and would havecreated a body of educated public opinion sufficiently informed andpotent to secure the study and discussion on their merits of questionsof vital interest to the country. The demoralising atmosphere ofpartisanship which hangs over Ireland would, I am convinced, graduallygive way before an organised system of education with a thoroughlydemocratic University at its head, which would diffuse amongst thepeople at large a sense of the value of a balanced judgment on, and atrue appreciation of, the real forces with which Ireland has to deal inbuilding up her fortunes.To discuss the merits of the different solutions which have beenproposed for the vexed problem of higher education in Ireland would bebeyond the scope of this book. The question will have to be faced, andall I need do here is to state the conditions which the solution willhave to fulfil if it is to deal with the aspects of the Irish Questionwith which the new movement is practically concerned. What is mostneeded is a University that will reach down to the rural population,much in the same way as the Scottish Universities do, and a lower scaleof fees will be required than Trinity College, with its diminishedrevenues, could establish. Already I can see that the work of the newDepartment, acting in conjunction with local bodies, urban and rural,throughout the country, will provide a considerable number ofscholarships, bursaries, and exhibitions for young men who are beingprepared to take part in the very real, but rather hazily understood,industrial revival which is imminent. Leaving sectarian controversiesout of the question, the type of institution which is required in orderto provide adequately for the classes now left outside the influence ofhigher education is an institution pre-eminently national in its aims,and one intimately associated with the new movements making for thedevelopment of our national resources.Unfortunately, however, in Ireland, and indeed in England too, there isa tendency to regard educational institutions almost solely as they willaffect religion. At least it is difficult to arouse any serious interestin them except from this point of view. I welcome, therefore, thestriking answers given to the queries of Lord Robertson, Chairman of theUniversity Commission, by Dr. O'Dwyer, the Roman Catholic Bishop ofLimerick, who boldly and wisely placed the question before the countryin the light in which cleric and layman should alike regard it:--     _The Chairman_.--(413): "I suppose you believe a Catholic     University, such as you propose, will strengthen Roman Catholicism     in Ireland?"--"It is not easy to answer that; not so easy as it     looks." (414):--"But it won't weaken it, or you would not be     here?"--"It would educate Catholics in Ireland very largely, and,     of course, a religious denomination composed of a body of educated     men is stronger than a religious denomination composed of ignorant     men. In that sense it would strengthen Roman Catholicism."     (415):--"Is there any sense in which it won't?"--"As far as     religion is concerned, I do not know how a University would work     out. If you ask me now whether I think that that University in a     certain number of years would become a centre of thought,     strengthening the Catholic faith in Ireland, I cannot tell you. It     is a leap in the dark." (416):--"But it is in the hope that it will     strengthen your own Church that you propose it?"--"No, it is not,     by any means. We are Bishops, but we are Irishmen, also, and we     want to serve our country."[26]Equally significant were the statements of Dr. O'Dea, the officialspokesman of Maynooth, when he said,     I regard the interest of the laity in the settlement of the     University Question as supreme. The clergy are but a small, however     important, part of the nation, and the laity have never had an     institution of higher education comparable to Maynooth in magnitude     or resources. I recognise, therefore, that the educational     grievances of the laity are much more pressing than those of the     clergy ... It is generally admitted that Irish priests hold a     position of exceptional influence, due to historical causes, the     intensely religious character of the people, and the want of     Catholic laymen qualified by education and position for social and     political leadership. What Bishop Berkeley said of them in 1749, in     his letter, _A Word to the Wise_, still holds true, 'That no set of     men on earth have it in their power to do good on easier terms,     with more advantage to others, and less pains or loss to     themselves.' It would be folly to expect that in a mixed community     the State should do anything to strengthen or perpetuate this     power; but this result will certainly not follow from the more     liberal education of the clergy, provided equal advantages are     extended to the laity. On the contrary, I am convinced that if the     void in the lay leadership of the country be filled up by higher     education of the better classes among the Catholic laity, the power     of the priests, so far as it is abnormal or unnecessary will pass     away; and, further, if I believed, with many who are opposed to the     better education of the priesthood, that their power is based on     falsehood or superstition, I would unhesitatingly advocate the     spread of higher education among the laity and clergy alike, as the     best means of effectually sapping and disintegrating it.[27]I had for long indulged a hope that a university of the type whichIreland requires would have been the outcome of a great nationaleducational movement emanating from Trinity College, which might, atthis auspicious hour, have surpassed all the proud achievements of itsthree hundred years. That hope was dispelled when the cry of 'Hands offTrinity' was applied to the profane hands of the Royal Commission.Perhaps that attitude may be reconsidered yet. There is one hopefulsentiment which is often heard coming from that institution. An opinionhas been strongly expressed that nothing ought to be done to separate insecular life two sections of Irishmen who happen to belong to differentcreeds. Whatever may be the logical outcome of the position taken uptowards the University problem by those who give expression to thispious opinion, I do not for a moment doubt their sincerity. But I oftenthink that too much importance is attached to the danger of building newwalls, and that there is too little appreciation of the wide and deepfoundation of the already existing walls between the two sections ofIrishmen who are so unhappily kept apart. In dealing with this, as withall large Irish problems, it had better be frankly recognised that thereare in the country two races, two creeds, and, what is too littleconsidered, two separate spheres of economic interest and pursuit.Socially two separate classes have naturally, nay inevitably, arisen outof these distinctions. One class has superior advantages in many ways ofgreat importance. The other class is far more numerous, produces far thegreater proportion of the nation's wealth, and is, therefore, from thenational point of view, of greater importance. But both are necessary.Both must be adequately provided for in the supreme matter of highereducation. Above all, the two classes must be educated to regardthemselves as united by the bond of a common country--a sentiment which,if genuine, would treat differences arising from whatever cause, not asa difficulty in the way of national progress, but rather as affording avariety of opportunities for national expansion.I do not concern myself as to the exact form which the new institutionor institutions which are to give us the absolutely essential advantageof higher education should take. If in view of the difference in therequirements to which I have alluded, and the complicated pedagogic andadministrative considerations which have to be taken into account,schemes of co-education of Protestants and Roman Catholics are difficultof immediate accomplishment, let that ideal be postponed. The two creedscan meet in the playground now: they can meet everywhere in after life.Ireland will bring them together soon enough if Ireland is given achance, and when the time is ripe for their coming together in highereducation they will come together. If the time is not now ripe for thisideal there is no justification for postponing educational reform untilthe relations between the two creeds have been elevated to a planewhich, in my opinion, they will never reach except through the aid ofthat culture which a widely diffused higher education alone can afford.       *       *       *       *       *When I was beginning to write this chapter I chanced to pick up the_Chesterfield Letters_. I opened the book at the two hundredth epistle,and, curiously enough, almost the first sentence which caught my eyeran: 'Education more than nature is the cause of that difference you seein the character of men.' I felt myself at first in strong disagreementwith this aphorism. But when I came to reflect how much the nature ofone generation must be the outcome of the education of those which wentbefore it, I gradually came to see the truth in Lord Chesterfield'swords. I must leave it to experts to define the exact steps which oughtto be taken to make the general education of this country capable ofcultivating the judgment, strengthening the will, and so of building upthe character. But every day, every thought, I give to the problems ofIrish progress convinces me more firmly that this is the real task ofeducational reform, a task that must be accomplished before we can proveto those who brand us with racial inferiority that, in Ireland, it wasnot nature that has been unkind in causing the difference we find in thecharacter of men.FOOTNOTES:[23] _Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland_, II., 122-4.[24] _Recent Reforms in Irish Education_, p. 7.[25] It was not authorised to give degrees to lay students; and even theadmission of lay students to an Arts course was prohibited byGovernment, lest Catholic students should be drawn away from TrinityCollege. See Cornwallis Correspondence, III., 366-8.[26] Appendix to First Report, p. 37.[27] Appendix to Third Report, pp. 283, 296.CHAPTER VI.THROUGH THOUGHT TO ACTION.I have now completed my survey of the main conditions which, in myopinion, must be taken into account by anyone who would understand theIrish mind, and still more by those who seek to work with it inrebuilding the fortunes of the country. The task has been one of greatdifficulty, as it was necessary to tell, not only the truth--for thateven an official person may be excused--but also the whole truth, which,unless made compulsory by the kissing of the book, is regarded as agratuitous kissing of the rod. From the frying pan of political dispute,I have passed into the fire of sectarian controversy. I have nothesitated to poach on the preserves of historians and economists, andhave even bearded the pedagogues in their dens. Before my stock ofmetaphors is exhausted, let me say that I have one hope of escape fromthe cross-fire of denunciation which independent speaking about Irelandis apt to provoke. I once witnessed a football match between twovillages, one of which favoured a political party called by the name ofa leader, with an 'ism' added to indicate a policy, the other adoptingthe same name, still further elongated by the prefix 'anti.' When Iarrived on the scene the game had begun in deadly earnest, but I noticedthe ball lying unmolested in another quarter of the field. In Irishpublic life I have often had reason to envy that ball, and perhaps nowits lot may be mine, while the game goes on and the critics payattention to each other.To my friendly critics a word of explanation is due. The opinions towhich I have given expression are based upon personal observation andexperience extending over a quarter of a century during which I havebeen in close touch with Irish life at home, and not unfamiliar with itabroad. I have referred to history only when I could not otherwiseaccount for social and economic conditions with which I came intocontact, or with which I desired practically to deal. Whether lookingback over the dreary wastes of Anglo-Irish history, or studying the menand things of to-day, I came to conclusions which differed widely fromwhat I had been taught to believe by those whose theories of Irishdevelopment had not been subjected to any practical test. Deeply as Ihave felt for the past sufferings of the Irish people and their heritageof disability and distress, I could not bring myself to believe that,where misgovernment had continued so long, and in such an immensevariety of circumstances and conditions, the governors could have beenalone to blame. I envied those leaders of popular thought whoseconfidence in themselves and in their followers was shaken by no suchreflections. But the more I listened to them the more the conviction wasborne in upon me that they were seeking to build an impossible futureupon an imaginary past.Those who know Ireland from within are aware that Irish thought uponIrish problems has been undergoing a silent, and therefore too lightlyregarded revolution. The surface of Irish life, often so inexplicablyruffled, and sometimes so inexplicably calm, has just now become smoothto a degree which has led to hasty conclusions as to the real cause andthe inward significance of the change. To chime in with the thoughtlessoptimism of the hour will do no good; but a real understanding of theforces which have created the existing situation will reveal anunprecedented opportunity for those who would give to the Irish mindthat full and free development which has been so long and, as I havetried to show, so unnaturally delayed.Among these new forces in Irish life there is one which has been greatlymisunderstood; and yet to its influence during the last few years muchof the 'transformation scene' in the drama of the Irish Question isreally due. It deserves more than a passing notice here, because, whileits aims as formulated appear somewhat restricted, it unquestionablytends in practice towards that national object of paramount importance,the strengthening of character. I refer to the movement known as theGaelic Revival. Of this movement I am myself but an outside observer,having been forced to devote nearly all my time and energies to avariety of attempts which aim at the doing in the industrial sphere ofvery much the same work as that which the Gaelic movement attempts inthe intellectual sphere--the rehabilitation of Ireland from within. Butin the course of my work of agricultural and industrial development Inaturally came across this new intellectual force and found that when itbegan to take effect, so far from diverting the minds of the peasantryfrom the practical affairs of life, it made them distinctly moreamenable to the teaching of the dry economic doctrine of which I was anapostle. The reason for this is plain enough to me now, though, like allmy theories about Ireland, the truth came to me from observation andpractical experience rather than as the result of philosophicspeculation. For the co-operative movement depended for its success upona two-fold achievement. In order to get it started at all, itsprinciples and working details had to be grasped by the Irish peasantmind and commended to his intelligence. Its further development and itshopes of permanence depend upon the strengthening of character, which, Imust repeat, is the foundation of all Irish progress.The Irish Agricultural Organisation Society[28] exerts its influence--anow established and rapidly-growing influence--mainly through the mediumof associations. The Gaelic movement, on the other hand, acts moredirectly upon the individual, and the two forces are therefore in asense complementary to each other. Both will be seen to be playing animportant part--I should say a necessary part--in the reconstruction ofour national life. At any rate, I feel that it is necessary to myargument that I should explain to those who are as ill-informed aboutthe Gaelic revival as I was myself until its practical usefulness wasdemonstrated to me, what exactly seems to be the most important outcomeof the work of that movement.The Gaelic League, which defines its objects as 'The preservation ofIrish as the national language of Ireland and the extension of its useas a spoken tongue; the study and publication of existing Irishliterature and the cultivation of a modern literature in Irish,' wasformed in 1893. Like the Agricultural Organisation Society, the GaelicLeague is declared by its constitution to be 'strictly non-political andnon-sectarian,' and, like it, has been the object of much suspicion,because severance from politics in Ireland has always seemed to thepolitician the most active form of enmity. Its constitution, too, issomewhat similar, being democratically guided in its policy by theelected representatives of its affiliated branches. It is interesting tonote that the funds with which it carries on an extensive propaganda aremainly supplied from the small contributions of the poor. It publishestwo periodicals, one weekly and another monthly. It administers anincome of some L6,000 a year, not reckoning what is spent by localbranches, and has a paid staff of eleven officers, a secretary,treasurer, and nine organisers, together with a large number ofvoluntary workers. It resembled the agricultural movement also in thefact that it made very little headway during the first few years of itsexistence. But it had a nucleus of workers with new ideas for theintellectual regeneration of Ireland. In face of much apathy theypersisted with their propaganda, and they have at last succeeded inmaking their ideas understood. So much is evident from therapidly-increasing number of affiliated branches of the League, which inMarch, 1903, amounted to 600, almost treble the number registered twoyears before. But even this does not convey any idea of the influencewhich the movement exerts. Within the past year the teaching of theIrish language has been introduced into no less than 1,300 NationalSchools. In 1900 the number of schools in which Irish was taught wasonly about 140. The statement that our people do not read books isgenerally accepted as true, yet the sale of the League publicationsduring one year reached nearly a quarter of a million copies. Theseresults cannot be left unconsidered by anybody who wishes to understandthe psychology of the Irish mind. The movement can truly claim to haveeffected the conversion of a large amount of intellectual apathy intogenuine intellectual activity.The declared objects of the League--- the popularising of the nationallanguage and literature--do not convey, perhaps, an adequate conceptionof its actual work, or of the causes of its popularity. It seeks todevelop the intellectual, moral, and social life of the Irish peoplefrom within, and it is doing excellent work in the cause of temperance.Its president, Dr. Douglas Hyde, in his evidence given before theUniversity Commission,[29] pointed out that the success of the Leaguewas due to its meeting the people half way; that it educated them bygiving them something which they could appreciate and assimilate; andthat it afforded a proof that people who would not respond to alieneducational systems, will respond with eagerness to something they cancall their own. The national factor in Ireland has been studiouslyeliminated from national education, and Ireland is perhaps the onlycountry in Europe where it was part of the settled policy of those, whohad the guidance of education to ignore the literature, history, arts,and traditions of the people. It was a fatal policy, for it obviouslytended to stamp their native country in the eyes of Irishmen with thebadge of inferiority and to extinguish the sense of healthy self-respectwhich comes from the consciousness of high national ancestry andtraditions. This policy, rigidly adhered to for many years, almostextinguished native culture among Irishmen, but it did not succeed inmaking another form of culture acceptable to them. It dulled theintelligence of the people, impaired their interest in their ownsurroundings, stimulated emigration by teaching them to look on othercountries as more agreeable places to live in, and made Ireland almost asocial desert. Men and women without culture or knowledge of literatureor of music have succeeded a former generation who were passionatelyinterested in these things, an interest which extended down even to thewayside cabin. The loss of these elevating influences in Irish societyprobably accounts for much of the arid nature of Irish controversies,while the reaction against their suppression has given rise to thosedisplays of rhetorical patriotism for which the Irish language has foundthe expressive term _raimeis_, and which (thanks largely to the Gaelicmovement) most people now listen to with a painful and half-ashamedsense of their unreality.The Gaelic movement has brought to the surface sentiments and thoughtswhich had been developed in Gaelic Ireland through hundreds of years,and which no repression had been able to obliterate altogether, butwhich still remained as a latent spiritual inheritance in the mind. Andnow this stream, which has long run underground, has again emerged evenstronger than before, because an element of national self-consciousnesshas been added at its re-emergence. A passionate conviction is gainingground that if Irish traditions, literature, language, art, music, andculture are allowed to disappear, it will mean the disappearance of therace; and that the education of the country must be nationalised if oursocial, intellectual, or even our economic position is to be permanentlyimproved.With this view of the Gaelic movement my own thoughts are in completeaccord. It is undeniable that the pride in country justly felt byEnglishmen, a pride developed by education and a knowledge of theirhistory, has had much to do with the industrial pre-eminence of England;for the pioneers of its commerce have been often actuated as much bypatriotic motives as by the desire for gain. The education of the Irishpeople has ignored the need for any such historical basis for pride orlove of country, and, for my part, I feel sure that the Gaelic League isacting wisely in seeking to arouse such a sentiment, and to found itmainly upon the ages of Ireland's story when Ireland was most Irish.It is this expansion of the sentiment of nationality outside the domainof party politics--the distinction, so to speak, between nationality andnationalism--which is the chief characteristic of the Gaelic movement.Nationality had come to have no meaning other than a political one, anybroader national sentiment having had little or nothing to feed upon.During the last century the spirit of nationality has found no unworthyexpression in literature, in the writings of Ferguson, Standish O'Gradyand Yeats, which, however, have not been even remotely comparable inpopularity with the political journalism in prose and rhyme in which theage has been so fruitful. It has never expressed itself in the arts, andnot only has Ireland no representative names in the higher regions ofart, but the national deficiency has been felt in every department ofindustry into which design enters, and where nationalart-characteristics have a commercial value. The national customs,culture, and recreations which made the country a pleasant place to livein, have almost disappeared, and with them one of the strongest tieswhich bind people to the country of their birth. The Gaelic revival, asI understand it, is an attempt to supply these deficiencies, to give toIrish people a culture of their own; and I believe that by awakening thefeelings of pride, self-respect, and love of country, based onknowledge, every department of Irish life will be invigorated.Thus it is that the elevating influence upon the individual is exerted.Politics have never awakened initiative among the mass of the people,because there was no programme of action for the individual. Perhaps itis as well for Ireland that such should have been the case, for, as ithas been shown, we have had little of the political thought which shouldbe at the back of political action. Political action under presentconditions must necessarily be deputed to a few representatives, andafter the vote is given or the cheering at a meeting has ceased, theindividual can do nothing but wait, and his lethargy tends to becomestill deeper. In the Gaelic revival there is a programme of work for theindividual; his mind is engaged, thought begets energy, and this energyvitalises every part of his nature. This makes for the strengthening ofcharacter, and so far from any harm being done to the practicalmovement, to which I have so often referred, the testimony of myfellow-workers, as well as my own observation, is unanimous in affirmingthat the influence of the branches of the Gaelic League is distinctlyuseful whenever it is sought to move the people to industrial orcommercial activity.Many of my political friends cannot believe--and I am afraid thatnothing that I can say will make them believe--that the movement is notnecessarily, in the political sense, separatist in its sentiment. Thisimpression is, in my opinion, founded on a complete misunderstanding ofAnglo-Irish history. Those who look askance at the rise of the Gaelicmovement ignore the important fact that there has never been anyessential opposition between the English connection and Irishnationality. The Elizabethan chiefs of the sixteenth and the Gaelicpoets of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the relationsbetween the two countries were far worse than they are to-day, knewnothing of this opposition. The true sentiment of nationality is apriceless heritage of every small nation which has done great things,and had it not largely perished in Ireland, separatist sentiment, theoffspring, not of Irish nationality, but of Irish political nationalism,could hardly have survived until to-day.But undoubtedly we strike here on a danger to the Gaelic movement, sofar at least as that movement is bound up with the future of the GaelicLeague; a danger which cannot be left out of account in any estimate ofthis new force in Irish life. The continuance of the League as abeneficent force, or indeed a force at all, seems to me, as in the caseof the co-operative organisation to which I have compared it, to bevitally dependent on a scrupulous observance of that part of itsconstitution which keeps the door open to Irishmen of every creed orpolitical party. Only thus can the League remain a truly national body,and attract from all classes Irishmen who are capable of forwarding itstrue policy. I do not think there is much danger of a spirit ofsectarian exclusiveness developing itself in a body mainly composed ofRoman Catholics whose President is a Protestant. But it cannot be deniedthat there has been an occasional tendency to interpret the 'nopolitics' clause of the constitution in a manner which seems hardly fairto Unionists or even to constitutional Home Rulers who may have joinedthe organisation on the strength of its declaration of politicalneutrality. If this is not a mere transitory phenomenon its effect willbe serious. As a political body the League would immediately sink intoinsignificance and probably disappear amid a crowd of contendingfactions. It would certainly cease to fulfil its great function ofcreating a nationality of the thought and spirit, in which all Irishmenwho wish to be anything else than English colonists might aspire toshare. Its early successes in bringing together men of differentpolitical views were remarkable. At the very outset of its career itenlisted the support of so militant a politician as the late Rev. R.R.Kane, who declared that though a Unionist and an Orangeman he had nodesire to forget that he was an O'Cahan. On this basis it is difficultto set a limit to the fruitfulness of the work which this organisationmight do for Ireland, and I cannot regard any who would depart from theletter and spirit of its constitution as sincere, or if sincere as wise,friends of the movement with which they are associated.Of minor importance are certain extravagances in the conduct of themovement which time and practical experience can hardly fail to correct.I have borne witness to the value of the cultivation of the languageeven from my own practical standpoint, but I cannot think that to signcheques in Irish, and get angry when those who cannot understand willnot honour them, is a good way of demonstrating that value. I should,speaking generally, regard it as a mistake, supposing it werepracticable, to substitute Irish for English in the conduct of business.If any large development of the trade in pampooties, turf and potheenbetween the Aran Islands and the mainland were in contemplation, thisattempt might be justified. But on behalf of those Philistines whoattach paramount importance to the development of Irish industry, tradeand commerce on a large and comprehensive scale, I should regret acourse which, from a business point of view, would be about as wise asthe advocacy of distinctive Irish currency, weights and measures. And Iprotest more strongly against the reasons which have been given to mefor this policy. I have been told that, in order to generate sufficiententhusiasm, a young movement of the kind must adopt a rigorousdiscipline and an aggressive policy. Not only are we thus confrontedwith a false issue, but by giving countenance to the outward acceptanceof what the better sense rejects, these over-zealous leaguers areadministering to the Irish character the very poison which all Irishmovements should combine to eliminate from the national life.The position which I have given to the Gaelic Revival among the newinfluences at work and making for progress in Ireland will hardly beunderstood by those who have never embraced the idea of combining allsuch forces in a constructive and comprehensive scheme of nationaladvancement. One instance of the potential utility of the Gaelic Leaguewill appeal to those of my readers who attach as much importance as I doto the improvement of the peasant home. Concerted action to this end isbeing planned while I write. It is proposed to take a few districtswhere the peasants are members of one of the new co-operative societies,and where the clergy have taken a keen interest in the economic andsocial advancement of the members of the Society, but where the cottagesare in the normal condition. The new Department will lend the servicesof its domestic economy teachers. The Organisation Society, the clergy,and the Department thus working together will, I hope, be able to getthe people of the selected districts to effect an improvement in theirdomestic surroundings which will act as an invaluable example for otherdistricts to follow. But in order that this much needed contribution tothe well-being of the peasant proprietary, upon which all our thoughtsare just now concentrated, may be assisted with the enthusiasm whichbelongs in Ireland to a consciously national effort, it is hoped thatcommon action with the Gaelic League may be possible, so that this forcealso may be enlisted in the solution of this part of our centralproblem, the rehabilitation of rural life in Ireland.It is, however, on more general grounds that I have, albeit as anoutside observer, watched with some anxiety and much gratification theprogress of the Gaelic Revival. In the historical evolution of the Irishmind we find certain qualities atrophied, so to speak, by disuse; and tothis cause I attribute the past failures of the race in practical lifeat home. I have shown how politics, religion, and our systems ofeducation have all, in their respective influences upon the people,missed to a large extent, the effect upon character which they shouldhave made it their paramount duty to produce. Nevertheless, whenever theintellect of the people is appealed to by those who know its past, arecuperative power is manifested which shows that its vitality has notbeen irredeemably impaired. It is because I believe that, on the whole,a right appeal has been made by the Gaelic League that I have bornetestimony to its patriotic endeavours.The question of the Gaelic Revival seems to be really a form of theeternal question of the interdependence of the practical and the idealin Ireland. Their true relation to each other is one of the hardestlessons the student of our problems has to learn. I recall an incidentin the course of my own studies which I will here recount, as it appearsto me to furnish an admirable illustration of this difficulty as itpresented itself to a very interesting mind. During the years coveringthe rise and fall of Parnell, when interest in the Irish Question was atits zenith, the newspapers of the United States kept in London a corpsof very able correspondents, who watched and reported to theirtransatlantic readers every move in the Home Rule campaign. An Americanpublic, by no means limited to the American-Irish, devoured every morselof this intelligence with an avidity which could not have been surpassedif the United States had been engaged in a war with Great Britain. Amongthese correspondents perhaps the most brilliant was the late HaroldFrederic. Not many months before he died I received a letter from him,in which he said that, although we were unknown to each other, hethought, from some public utterances of mine, that we must have manyviews in common. He had often intended to get an introduction to me, andnow suggested that we should 'waive things and meet.' We met and spentan evening together, which left some deep impressions on my mind. Hetold me that the Irish Question possessed for him a fascination forwhich he could give no rational explanation. He had absolutely no tie ofblood or material interest with Ireland, and his friendship for it hadbrought him the only quarrels in which he had ever been engaged.What chiefly interested me in Harold Frederic's philosophy of the IrishQuestion was that he had arrived at a diagnosis of the Irish mind notsubstantially different from my own. Since that evening I have comeacross a passage in one of his novels, which clothes in delightfullanguage his view of the chaotic psychology of the Celt:     There, in Ireland, you get a strange mixture of elementary early     peoples, walled off from the outer world by the four seas, and     free to work out their own racial amalgam on their own lines. They     brought with them at the outset a great inheritance of Eastern     mysticism. Others lost it, but the Irish, all alone on their     island, kept it alive and brooded on it, and rooted their whole     spiritual side in it. Their religion is full of it; their blood is     full of it.... The Ireland of two thousand years ago is incarnated     in her. They are the merriest people and the saddest, the most     turbulent and the most docile, the most talented and the most     unproductive, the most practical and the most visionary, the most     devout and the most pagan. These impossible contradictions war     ceaselessly in their blood.[30]In our conversation what struck me most was the influence which politicshad exercised even on his philosophic mind, notwithstanding a lowestimate of our political leaders. In one of a series of three notablearticles upon the Irish Question, which appeared anonymously in the_Fortnightly Review_[31] in the winter of 1893-4, and of which he toldme he was the writer, he had given a character sketch of what he called'The Rhetoricians.' Their performances since the Union were summarisedin the phrase 'a century of unremitting gabble,' and he regarded it as asad commentary on Irish life that such brilliant talents so largely ranto waste in destructive criticism.I naturally turned the conversation on to my own line of thought, anddiscussed the practical conclusions to which his studies had led him. Itried to elicit from him exactly what he had in his mind when, in one ofthe articles to which I have referred, he advocated 'a reconstruction ofIreland on distinctive national lines.' I hoped to find that hispsychological study of my countrymen would enable him to throw somelight upon the means by which play could be given at home to the latentcapacities of the race. I found that he was in entire accord with myview, that the chief difficulty in the way of constructive statesmanshipwas the defect in the Irish character about which I have said so much. Iwas prepared for that conclusion, for I had already seen the lack ofinitiative admirably appreciated in the following illuminating sentenceof his:--'The Celt will help someone else to do the thing that other hasin mind, and will help him with great zeal and devotion; but he will notstart to do the thing he himself has thought of.'[32] But I wasdisappointed when he bade me his first and last good-bye that I had notconvinced him that there was any way out of the Irish difficulty otherthan political changes, for which, at the same time, he appeared tothink the people singularly unfitted.The fact is we had arrived at the point where the student of Irish lifeusually finds himself in a _cul de sac_. If he has accurately observedthe conditions, he is face to face with a problem which appears to be inits nature insoluble. For at every turn he finds things being done wrongwhich might so easily be done right, only that nobody is concerned thatthey should be done right. And what is worse, when he has learned, inthe course of his investigations, to discount the picturesqueexplanation of our unsuccess in practical life which in Ireland veilsthe unpleasant truth, he will find that the people are quite aware oftheir defects, although they attribute them to causes beyond their powerto remove. Then, too, the sympathetic inquirer is shocked by the lack ofseriousness in it all. With all their past griefs and their highaspirations, the Irish people seem to be play-acting before the world.The inquirer does not, perhaps, reflect that, if play-acting beinconsistent with the deepest emotions, and with the pursuit of highideals, then he condemns a little over one half of the human race.[33]He probably comes to the main conclusion adopted in these pages, andrealises that the Irish Question is a problem of character. And as Irishcharacter is the product of Irish history, which cannot be re-enacted,he leaves the problem there. Harold Frederic left it there, and there ithas been taken up by those whose endeavour forms the story which I haveto tell.I now come to the principles which, it appears to me, must underlie thesolution of this problem. The narrative contained in the second part ofthis book is a record of the efforts made during the last decade of thenineteenth and the first two years of the twentieth century by a small,but now rapidly augmenting group of Irishmen, to pluck the brand ofIrish intellect from the burning of the Irish Question. The problembefore us was, my readers will now understand, how to make headway inview of the weakness of character to which I have had to attribute theparalysis of our activities in the past. We were quite aware that ourprogress would at first be slow. But as we were satisfied that thedefects of character which stood in the way of economic advancement weredue to causes which need no longer be operative, and that the intellectof the people was unimpaired, we faced the problem with confidence.The practical form which our work took was the launching upon Irish lifeof a movement of organised self-help, and the subsequent grafting uponthis movement of a system of State-aid to the agriculture and industriesof the country. I need not here further elaborate this programme, forthe steps by which it has been and is being adopted will be presentlydescribed in detail. But there is one aspect of the new movement inIreland which must be understood by those who would grasp the truesignificance and the human interest of an evolution in our nationallife, the only recent parallel for which, as far as I am aware, is to befound in Japan: though to my mind the conscious attempt of the Irishpeople to develop a civilisation of their own is far more interestingthan the recent efforts of the Japanese to westernise theirinstitutions.The problem of mind and character with which we had to deal in Irelandpresented this central and somewhat discouraging fact. In practical lifethe Irish had failed where the English had succeeded, and this wasattributed to the lack of certain English qualities which have beenundoubtedly essential to success in commerce and in industry from thedays of the industrial revolution until a comparatively recent date. Itwas the individualism of the English economic system during this periodwhich made these qualities indispensable. The lack of these qualities inIrishmen to-day may be admitted, and the cause of the deficiency hasbeen adequately explained. But those who regard the Irish situation asindustrially hopeless probably ignore the fact that there are otherqualities, of great and growing importance under modern economicconditions, which can be developed in Irishmen and may form the basis ofan industrial system. I refer to the range of qualities which come intoplay rather in association than in the individual, and to which the term'associative' is applied.[34] So that although much disparagingcriticism of Irish character is based upon the survival in the Celt ofthe tribal instincts, it is gratifying to be able to show that even fromthe practical English point of view, our preference for thinking andworking in groups may not be altogether a _damnosa hereditas_. If, owingto our deficiency in the individualistic qualities of the English, wecannot at this stage hope to produce many types of the 'economic man' ofthe economists, we think we see our way to provide, as a substitute, theeconomic association. If the association succeeds, and by virtue of itsfinancial success becomes permanent, a great change will, in ouropinion, be produced on the character of its members. The reflex actionupon the individual mind of the habit of doing, in association withothers, things which were formerly left undone, or badly done, may berelied upon to have a tonic effect upon the character of the individual.This is, I suppose, the secret of discipline, which, though apparentlyeliminating volition, seems in weak characters to strengthen the will.There is, too, as we have learned, in the association a strangeinfluence which develops qualities and capacities that one would notexpect on a mere consideration of the character of its members. Thispsychological phenomenon has been admirably and most entertaininglydiscussed by the French psychologist, Le Bon,[35] who, in the attractivepursuit of paradox, almost goes to the length of the proposition thatthe association inherently possesses qualities the opposite of thosepossessed by its members. My own experience--and I have hadopportunities of observing hundreds of associations formed by my friendsupon the principles above laid down--does not carry me quite so far.But, unquestionably, the association in Ireland does often become anentity as distinct from the individualities of which it is composed, asis a new chemical compound from its constituent elements.Associations of the kind we had in our minds, which were to be primarilyfor purely business purposes, were bound to have many collateraleffects. They would open up outside of politics and religion, but not inconflict with either, a sphere of action where an independence new tothe country would have to be exercised. In Ireland public opinion isunder an obsession which, whether political, religious, historical, orall three combined, is probably unique among civilised peoples. Untilthe last few years, for example, it was our habit--one which immenselyweakened the influence of Ireland in the Imperial Parliament--to formextravagant estimates of men, exalting and abasing them with irrationalcaprice, not according to their qualities so much as by their attitudetowards the passion of the hour. The ups and downs of the reputations ofLord Spencer and Mr. Arthur Balfour in Ireland are a sufficientillustration of our disregard of the old Latin proverb which tells usthat no man ever became suddenly altogether bad. Even now public opinionis too prone to attach excessive value to projects of vague andvisionary development, and to underrate the importance of seriousthought and quiet work, which can be the only solid foundation of ournational progress. In these new associations--humble indeed in theirorigin, but destined to play a large part in the people'slives--projects, professing to be fraught with economic benefit, have tobe judged by the cruel precision of audited balance sheets, and theworth of men is measured by the solid contribution they have made to thewelfare of the community.       *       *       *       *       *I have now accomplished one long stage of my journey towards theconclusion of this discussion of the needs of modern Ireland. Were I tostop here, probably most of those who had been induced to open yetanother book upon the Irish Question would accuse me, and not withoutjustice, of being responsible for a barren graft upon a barrencontroversy. I fear no such criticism, whatever other shortcomings maybe detected, from those who have the patience to read on. For when Ipass from my own reflections to record the work to which many thousandsof my countrymen have addressed themselves in building up the Ireland ofthe twentieth century, I shall have a story to tell which must inspirehope in all who can be persuaded that Ireland in the past has not oftenbeen treated fairly and has never been understood. I have shown--and itwas necessary to show, if a repetition of misunderstanding was to beavoided--that the Irish people themselves are gravely responsible forthe ills of their country, and that the forces which have mainlygoverned their action hitherto are rapidly bringing about theirdisappearance as a distinct nationality. But I shall now have to tell ofthe widespread and growing adoption of certain new principles of actionwhich I believe to be consonant with the genius and traditions of therace, and the acceptance of which seems to me vitally necessary if theIrish people are to play a worthy part in the future history of theworld. That part is a far greater one than they could ever hope to playas an independent and separate State, yet their success in playing itmust closely depend upon their remaining a distinct nationality, in thesense so clearly and wisely indicated by his Majesty when, in his replyto the address of the Belfast Corporation, he spoke of the 'nationalcharacteristics and ideals' which he desired his kingdoms to cherish inthe midst of their imperial unity.[36] The great experiment which I amabout to relate is, in its own province, one of the many applicationswhich we see around us of the conception here put forward. And I believethat a few more years of quiet work by those who are taking part in thismovement, with its appeal to Irish intellect, and its reliance uponIrish patriotism, is all that is needed to prove that by developing theindustrial qualities of the Celt on associative lines we can in politicsas well as in economics, add strength to the Irish character withoutmaking it less Irish or less attractive than of old.FOOTNOTES:[28] This body is fully described in the next chapter.[29] See Appendix to Third Report, p. 311.[30] _The Damnation of Theron Ware_. This was the title of the book Iread in the United States. I am told he published it in England underthe title of _Illuminations_--a nice discrimination![31] They appeared under the signature of 'X.' in Nov. and Dec., 1893,and Jan., 1894.[32] _Fortnightly Review_, Jan. 1894, pp. 11, 12.[33] The difficulties of the writer who is not a writer are great. Isent this chapter to two literary friends, one of whom, with the help ofa globe, disputed my accuracy in a learned ethnological disquisitionwith which he favoured me. The other warned me to be even more obscureand sent me the following verses, addressed by 'Cynicus' (J.K. Stephen)to Shakespeare,"You wrote a line too much, my sage, Of seers the first, the first ofsayers; For only half the world's a stage, And only all the womenplayers."[34] These qualities, as will be explained later, happen to have aspecial economic value in the farming industry, and so are available forthe elevation of rural life, with whose problems we are now so deeplyconcerned in Ireland. Their applicability to urban life need not bediscussed here. But my study of the co-operative movement in England hasconvinced me that, if the English had the associative instincts of theIrish, that movement would play a part in English life more commensuratewith its numerical strength and the volume of its commercialtransactions, than can be claimed for it so far.[35] _La Psychologie de la Foule_.[36] July 27th, 1903,--His Majesty thus confirmed the striking utteranceof imperial policy contained in Lord Dudley's speech to the IncorporatedLaw Society, on the 20th of November, 1902.

I shall eagerly await the fulfilment ofthis hope. Its realisation will, under Divine Providence, depend largelyupon the steady development of self-reliance and co-operation, uponbetter and more practical education, upon the growth of industrial andcommercial enterprise, and upon that increase of mutual toleration andrespect which the responsibility my Irish people now enjoy in the publicadministration of their local affairs is well-fitted toteach."--_Message of the King to the Irish People_, 1st August, 1903.CHAPTER VII.THE NEW MOVEMENT: ITS FOUNDATION ON SELF-HELP.The movement for the reorganisation of Irish agricultural and industriallife, to which I have already frequently referred, must now be describedin practical operation. Before I do this, however, there are two linesof criticism which the very mention of a new movement may suggest, andwhich I must anticipate. Every year has its tale of new movements,launched by estimable persons whose philanthropic zeal is not balancedby the judgment required to discriminate between schemes which possessthe elements of permanence, and those which depend upon the enthusiasmor financial support of their promoters, and are in their natureephemeral. There is, consequently, a widespread and well justifiedmistrust of novel schemes for the industrial regeneration of Ireland. Iconfess to having had my ingenuity severely taxed on some occasions tofind a sympathetic circumlocution wherewith to show cause for decliningto join a new movement, my real reason being an inward conviction thatnothing except resolutions would be moved. In the complex problem ofbuilding up the economic and social life of a people with such ahistory as ours, we must resist the temptation to multiply schemeswhich, however well intended, are but devices for enabling individualsto devolve their responsibilities upon the community or upon theGovernment, and which owe their bubble reputation and brief popularityto this unconscious humouring of our chief national defect. On thecontrary, we must seek to instil into the mind of each individual thetoo little recognised importance of his own contribution to the sum ofnational achievement. The building of character must be our paramountobject, as it is the condition precedent of all social and economicreform in Ireland. To explain the principles by the observance of whichthe agency of the association may be utilised as an economic force,while at the same time the industrial character of the individual may bedeveloped, was one of the chief aims I had in view in the foregoinganalysis of the Irish mind and character, as they have emerged fromhistory and are stunted in their growth by present influences. The factsabout to be recited will, I hope, suffice to prove that the reformer inIreland, if he has a true insight into the great human problem withwhich he is dealing, may find in the association not only a healthystimulus to national activities, but also a means whereby the assistanceof the State may be so invoked and applied that it will concentrate, andnot dissipate, the energies of the people.The other criticism which I think it necessary to anticipate would, ifignored, leave room for a wrong impression as to much of the work whichis being done both on the self-help and on the State-aid sides of thenew movement. Education, it will be said, is the only real solvent tothe range of problems discussed in this book, most other agencies ofsocial and economic reform being of doubtful efficacy and, if they tendto postpone educational effort, positively harmful. There is much truthin this view. But it must be remembered that the backward condition ofour economic life is due mainly to the fact that our educational systemshave had little regard to our history or economic circumstances. Wemust, therefore, at this stage in our national development give toeducation a much wider interpretation than that which is usually appliedto the term. We cannot wait for a generation to grow up which has beengiven an education calculated to fit it for the modern economicstruggle, even if there were any probability that the necessary reformswould soon be carried against the prejudices which are aroused by anyproposal to train the minds, or even the hands and eyes, of the risinggeneration. In the meantime much of the work, both voluntary andState-aided, now initiated in Ireland, must consist of educating adultsto introduce into their business concerns the more advanced economic andscientific methods which the superior education of our rivals inagriculture and industry abroad has enabled them to adopt, and which myexperience of Irish work convinces me our people would have adopted longago if they had had similar educational advantages. And I would furtherpoint out that there is no better way of promoting the reform ofeducation in the ordinary, the pedagogic, sense, than by bringing tobear upon the minds of parents those educational influences which arecalculated to convince them of the advantage of improved practicaleducation for their children. So to the economist and to theeducationist alike I would submit that the new work of economic andsocial reform should be judged as a whole, and not prejudged by thathypercriticism of details which ignores the fact that the conditionswith which it is attempted to deal are wholly unprecedented. I am quitecontent that the movement which I am about to describe should beultimately known and judged by its fruits. Meanwhile, I think that tothe intelligent critic it will sufficiently justify its existence if itcontinues to exist.       *       *       *       *       *The story of the new movement, which must now be told, begins in theyear 1889, when a few Irishmen, the writer of these pages among them,set themselves the task of bringing home to the rural population ofIreland the fact that their prosperity was in their own hands much morethan they were generally led to believe. I have already pointed out thatin order to direct the Irish mind towards practical affairs and in ordereffectively to arouse and apply the latent capacities of the Irishpeople to their chief industry, agriculture, we must rely uponassociative, as distinct from individual effort; or, in other words, wemust get the people to do their business together rather thanseparately as the English do. Fortunately for us, it happened that thiscourse, which was clearly indicated by the character and temperament ofthe people, was equally prescribed by economic considerations. Thepopulation and wealth of Ireland are, I need hardly say, sopredominantly agricultural that the welfare of the country must dependupon the welfare of the farming classes. It is notorious that theindustry by which these classes live has for the last quarter of acentury become less and less profitable. It is also recognised that theprime cause of agricultural depression, foreign competition, is notlikely to be removed, while that from the colonies is likely toincrease. The extraordinary development of rapid and cheap transit,together with recently invented processes of preservation, have enabledthe more favoured producers in the newly developed countries of bothhemispheres successfully to enter into competition in the Britishmarkets with the farmers of these islands. The agricultural producers inother European countries, although to some extent protected by tariffs,have had to face similar conditions; but in most of these countries,though not in the United Kingdom, the farmers have so changed theirmethods, to meet the altered circumstances, that they seem to havegained by improvement at home as much as they have lost by competitionfrom abroad Thus our farmers find themselves harassed first by thecheaper production from vast tracts of virgin soil in the uttermostparts of the earth, and secondly by a nearer and keener competitionfrom the better organised and better educated producers of theContinent.While the opening up of what the economists call the 'world market,' hasnecessitated, as a condition of successful competition, improved methodsof production for, and carriage to, the market, a third and less obviousforce has effected an important change in the method of distribution inthe market. The swarming populations, which the factory system hasbrought together in industrial centres, have to be supplied with food bya system of distribution which must above all things be expeditious.This requirement can only be met by the regular consignment of food inlarge quantities, of such uniform quality that the sample can be reliedupon to be truly indicative of the quality of the bulk. Thus the rapiddistribution of produce in the markets becomes as important a factor inagricultural economy as improved methods of production or cheap andexpeditious carriage.Now this new market condition is being met in two ways. In the UnitedStates, and, in a less marked degree, at home, an army of middlemenbetween the producer and the consumer attends to this business for ashare of the profits accruing from it, whilst in many parts of theContinent the farmers themselves attend, partially at any rate, to thebusiness side of their industry instead of paying others to do it allfor them. I say all, for middlemen are necessary at the distributiveend: but it is absolutely essential, in a country like Ireland, that atthe producing end the farmers should be so organised that theythemselves can manage the first stages of distribution, and exercisesome control over the middlemen who do the rest. The foreignagricultural producers have long been alive to this necessity, for theirsuperior education enabled them to grasp the economic situation and evento realise that the matter is not one of acute political controversy.Here, then, was a definite practical problem to the solution of whichthe promoters of the new movement could apply their principle ofco-operative effort. The more we studied the question the more apparentit became that the enormous advantage which the Continental farmers hadover the Irish farmers, both in production and in distribution, was dueto superior organisation combined with better education. State-aid hadno doubt done a great deal abroad, but in every case it was manifestthat it had been preceded, or at least accompanied, by the organisedvoluntary effort without which the interference of the Government withthe business of the people is simply demoralising.Generally speaking, the task before us in Ireland was the adaptation tothe special circumstances of our country of methods successfully pursuedby communities similarly situated in foreign countries. We had to urgeupon farmers that combination was just as necessary to their economicsalvation as it was recognised to be by their own class, and by thoseengaged in other industries, elsewhere. They must combine, so we urgedon them, for example, to buy their agricultural requirements at thecheapest rate and of the best quality in order to produce moreefficiently and more economically; they must combine to avail themselvesof improved appliances beyond the reach of individual producers, whetherit be by the erection of creameries, for which there was urgent need, orof cheese factories and jam factories which might come later; or inordinary farm operations, to secure the use of the latest agriculturalmachinery and the most suitable pure-bred stock; they must combine--notto abolish middle profits in distribution, whether those of the carryingcompanies or those of the dealers in agricultural produce--but to keepthose profits within reasonable limits, and to collect in bulk andregularise consignments so that they could be carried and marketed at amoderate cost; they must combine, as we afterwards learned, for thepurpose of creating, by mutual support, the credit required to bring inthe fresh working capital which each new development of their industrywould demand and justify. In short, whenever and wherever theindividuals in a farming community could be brought to see that theymight advantageously substitute associated for isolated production ordistribution, they must be taught to form themselves into associationsin order to reap the anticipated advantages.This brief statement of our general aims will furnish a rough idea ofthe economic propaganda which we initiated, and if I give a fewillustrations of the practical application of the new principle to thefarming industry, I shall have done all that will be required to leaveon the reader's mind a true though perhaps an incomplete impression ofthe character and scope of the self-help side of the new movement. Ishall first give a sketch of the unrecorded struggles of its pioneers,because these struggles prove to those engaged in social and economicwork in Ireland that, in the wholly abnormal condition of our nationallife, no project which is theoretically sound need be rejected becauseeverybody says it is impracticable. The work of the morrow will largelyconsist of the impossible of to-day. If this adds to the difficulty, italso adds to the fun.When we arrived at the conclusion that the introduction of the principleof agricultural co-operation was a vital necessity, the first practicalquestion which had to be decided was how the industrial army, which wasto do battle for Ireland's position in the world market, should beorganised and disciplined for the task. It is evident that before a bodyof men who have never worked together can form a successful commercialcombination, they must be provided with a constitution and set of rulesand regulations for the conduct of their business. These must be soskilfully contrived that they will harmonise all the interests involved.And when an arrangement has been come to which is, not only in fact butalso obviously, equitable, it remains as part of the process oforganisation to teach the participants in the new project the meaning,and to imbue them with the spirit, of the joint enterprise into whichthey have been persuaded to enter with perhaps no very clearunderstanding of all that is involved. There were in Ireland noprecedents to guide us and no examples to follow, but the co-operativemovement in England appeared to furnish most of the principles involvedand a perfect machinery for their application.[37] So Lord Monteagle andMr. R.A. Anderson, my first two associates in the New Movement, joinedme as regular attendants at the annual Co-operative congresses. We wereassiduous seekers after information at the head-quarters of theCo-operative Union in Manchester. We had the good fortune to fall inwith Vansittart Neale, and Tom Hughes, both of whom have passed away,and with Mr. Holyoake, who, with the exception of Mr. Ludlow, is now thesole survivor of that noble group of practical philanthropists, theChristian Socialists. Mr. J.C. Gray, who succeeded Mr. Vansittart Nealeas the General Secretary of the Co-operative Union, gave us invaluablehelp and continues to do so to this day. The leaders of the Englishmovement sympathised with our efforts. The Union paid us the complimentof constituting our first converts its Irish Section. Liberal supportwas given out of the central English funds towards the cost of themissionary work which was to spread co-operative light in the sisterisle. We can never forget the generosity of the workingmen in England ingiving their aid to the Irish farmers, especially when it is rememberedthat they had no sanguine anticipations for the success of our effortsand no prospect of advantages to themselves if we did succeed.It must be admitted that the outlook was not altogether rosy.Agricultural co-operation had never succeeded in England, where itseemed to be accepted as one of the disappointing limitations of theco-operative movement that it did not apply to rural communities inthese islands. There were also in Ireland the peculiar difficultiesarising from ceaseless political and agrarian agitation. It wasnaturally asked--did Irish farmers possess the qualities out of whichco-operators are made? Had they commercial experience or businesseducation? Had they business capacity? Would they display thatconfidence in each other which is essential to successful association,or indeed that confidence in themselves without which there can be nobusiness enterprise? Could they ever be induced to form themselves intosocieties, and to adopt, and loyally adhere to those rules andregulations by which alone equitable distribution of the responsibilityand profit among the participants in the joint undertaking can beassured, and harmony and successful working be rendered possible? Then,our best-informed Irish critics assured us that voluntary associationfor humdrum business purposes, devoid of some religious or politicalincentive, was alien to the Celtic temperament and that we should wearourselves out crying in the wilderness. We were told that Irishmen canconspire but cannot combine. Economists assured us that even if wesucceeded in getting farmers to embark on the projected enterprises,financial disaster would be the inevitable result of our attempts tosubstitute in industrial undertakings, ever becoming more technical andrequiring more and more commercial knowledge and experience, democraticmanagement for one-man control.On the other hand there were some favouring conditions, the importanceof which our studies of the human problems already discussed will havemade my readers realise. Isolated, the Irish farmer is conservative,sceptical of innovations, a believer in routine and tradition. In unionwith his fellows, he is progressive, open to ideas, and wonderfully keenat grasping the essential features of any new proposal for hisadvancement. He was, then, himself eminently a subject for co-operativetreatment, and his circumstances were equally so. The smallness of hisholding, the lack of capital, and the backwardness of his methods madehim helpless in competition with his rivals abroad. The process oforganisation was also, to some extent, facilitated by the insight thepeople had been given by the Land League into the power of combination,and by the education they had received in the conduct of meetings. Itwas a great advantage that there was a machinery ready at hand forgetting people together, and a procedure fully understood for givingexpression to the sense of the meeting. On the other hand, thedomination of a powerful central body, which was held to be essential tothe success of the political and agrarian movement, had exercised aninfluence which added enormously to the difficulty of getting the peopleto act on their own initiative.Though the economic conditions of the Irish farmer clearly indicated aneed for the application of co-operative effort to all branches of hisindustry, it was necessary at the beginning to embrace a more limitedaim. It happened at the time we commenced our Irish work that one branchof farming, the dairying industry, presented features admirably adaptedto our methods. This industry was, so to speak, ripe for its industrialdevelopment, for its change from a home to a factory industry. Newmachinery, costly but highly efficient, had enabled the factory product,notably that of Denmark and Sweden, to compete successfully with thehome-made article, both in quality and cost of production. Here, it willbe observed, was an opportunity for an experiment in co-operativeproduction, under modern industrial conditions, which would put theassociative qualities of the Irish farmer to a test which the Britishartisan had not stood quite as well as the founders of the co-operativemovement had anticipated. To add to the interest of the situation,capitalists had seized upon the material advantages which the abundantsupply of Irish milk afforded, and the green pastures of the "GoldenVein" were studded with snow white creameries which proclaimed thetransfer of this great Irish industry from the tiller of the soil to theman of commerce. The new-comers secured the milk of the district bygiving the farmer much more for his milk than it was worth to him, solong as he pursued the old methods of home manufacture. This inducedfarmers to go out of the butter-making business. After a while the pricewas reduced, and the proprietor, finding it necessary to give thesuppliers only what they could make out of their milk without his modernequipment, realised profits altogether out of proportion to his share ofthe capital embarked or the labour involved in the production of thebutter.The economic position was ideal for our purpose, and we had nodifficulty in explaining it to the farmers themselves. The socialproblem was the real difficulty. To all suggestions of co-operativeaction they at first opposed a hopeless _non possumus_. Their objectionsmay be summed up thus:--They had never combined for any businesspurpose. How could they trust the Committee they were asked to electfrom amongst themselves to expend their money and conduct theirbusiness? It was all very well for the proprietor with his amplecapital, free hand, and business experience, to work with complicatedmachinery and to consign his butter out of the reach of the local butterbuyer, and to save the waste and delay of the local butter market. Butthey knew nothing of the business and would only make fools ofthemselves. The promoters--they were not putting anything into thescheme--how much did they intend to take out?[38]There was nothing in this attitude of mind which we had not fullyanticipated. We were confident that, as we were on sound economicground, no matter what difficulties might confront us it was only aquestion of time for the attainment of our ends. All that was requiredwas that we should keep pegging away. My own experience was notencouraging at first. I was, and am, a poor speaker, and in Ireland aman who cannot express his thoughts with facility, whether he has gotthem or not, accentuates the difficulties under which a prophet laboursin his own country. I made up for my deficiencies in the first essentialof Irish public life by engaging a very eloquent political speaker, thelate Mr. Mulhallen Marum, M.P., to stump the country. He gave to thepropaganda a relish which my prosaic economics altogether lacked. Thenationalist band sometimes came out to meet him. We all know theefficiency of the drum in politics and religion, but it seemed to me alittle out of place in economics. However, he created an excellentimpression, but unhappily he died of heart disease before he hadattended more than three or four meetings. This was a severe blow to us,and we toiled away under some temporary discouragement. My own diaryrecords attendance at fifty meetings before a single society hadresulted therefrom. It was weary work for a long time. These gatheringswere miserable affairs compared with those which greeted our politicalspeakers. On one occasion the agricultural community was represented bythe Dispensary Doctor, the Schoolmaster, and the Sergeant of Police.Sometimes, in spite of copious advertising of the meeting, the prosaicnature of the objects had got abroad, and nobody met.Mr. Anderson, who sometimes accompanied me and sometimes went his roundsalone, had similar experiences. I may quote a passage from some of hisreminiscences, recently published in the _Irish Homestead_, the organ ofthe co-operative movement in Ireland.     It was hard and thankless work. There was the apathy of the people     and the active opposition of the Press and the politicians. It     would be hard to say now whether the abuse of the Conservative     _Cork Constitution_ or that of the Nationalist _Eagle_, of     Skibbereen, was the louder. We were "killing the calves," we were     "forcing the young women to emigrate," we were "destroying the     industry." Mr. Plunkett was described as a "monster in human     shape," and was adjured to "cease his hellish work." I was     described as his "Man Friday" and as "Rough-rider Anderson." Once,     when I thought I had planted a Creamery within the precincts of the     town of Rathkeale, my co-operative apple-cart was upset by a local     solicitor who, having elicited the fact that our movement     recognised neither political nor religious differences--that the     Unionist-Protestant cow was as dear to us as her     Nationalist-Catholic sister--gravely informed me that our programme     would not suit Rathkeale. "Rathkeale," said he, pompously, "is a     Nationalist town--Nationalist to the backbone--and every pound of     butter made in this Creamery must be made on Nationalist     principles, or it shan't be made at all." This sentiment was     applauded loudly, and the proceedings terminated.On another occasion a similar project was abandoned because the flow ofwater to the disused mill which it was proposed to convert into acreamery, passed through a conduit lined with cement originallypurchased from a man who now occupied a farm from which another had beenevicted. To some minds these little complications would have spelledfailure. To my associates they but accentuated the need for the movementwhich they had so laboriously thought out, and the very nature of thedifficulties confirmed them in their belief that the economic doctrinethey were preaching was adapted to meet the requirements of the case.And so the event proved.In the year 1894 the movement had gathered volume to such anextent--although the societies then numbered but one for every twentythat are in existence to-day--that it became beyond the power of a fewindividuals to direct its further progress. In April of that year ameeting was held in Dublin to inaugurate the Irish AgriculturalOrganisation Society, Ltd. (now commonly known as the I.A.O.S.), whichwas to be the analogue of the Co-operative Union in England. In thefirst instance it was to consist of philanthropic persons, but itsconstitution provided for the inclusion in its membership of thesocieties which had already been created and those which it would itselfcreate as time went on. It had, and has to-day, a thoroughlyrepresentative Committee. I was elected the first President, a positionwhich I held until I entered official life, when Lord Monteagle, apractical philanthropist if ever there was one, became my successor.Father Finlay, who joined the movement in 1892, and who has devoted theextraordinary influence which he possesses over the rural population ofIreland to the dissemination of our economic principles, becameVice-President. Both he and Lord Monteagle have been annually re-electedever since.The growth of the movement in the last nine years under the fosteringcare of the I.A.O.S. is highly satisfactory. By the autumn of this year(1903) considerably over eight hundred societies had been established,and the number is ever growing; of these 360 were dairy, and 140agricultural societies, nearly 200 agricultural banks, 50 homeindustries societies, 40 poultry societies, while there were 40 otherswith miscellaneous objects. The membership may be estimated--I amwriting towards the end of the Society's statistical year--at about80,000, representing some 400,000 persons. The combined trade turnoverof these societies during the present year will reach approximatelyL2,000,000, a figure the meaning of which can only be appreciated whenit is remembered that the great majority of the associated farmers arein so small a way of business that in England they would hardly beclassed as farmers at all.These societies consist, as has been explained, of groups of farmers whohave been taught by organisers that certain branches of their businesscan be more profitably conducted in association than by individualsacting separately. The principle of agricultural co-operation with itseconomic advantages will, as time goes on, be further extended by thecombined action of societies. With this end in view federations areconstantly being formed with a constitution similar to that of thesocieties, the only difference being that the members of the federationare not individuals but societies, the government of the central bodybeing carried on by delegates from its constituent associations. The twolargest of these federations, one for the sale of butter, and anotherfor the combined purchase by societies of their agriculturalrequirements, have been working successfully for several years.Federations, too, are being formed, as societies find that theirbusiness can be conducted more economically, for example, in dairying bycentralising the manufacture of butter, or in the egg export trade bythe alliance of many districts to enable large contracts to beundertaken. In the near future a further development of federation willbe required to complete a scheme now under consideration for the mutualinsurance of live stock. Such a scheme involves the existence of twoprime conditions, a local organisation for the purpose of effectivesupervision, and the spreading of the risk over a large area.In all such enterprises and economic changes the Organisation Society iseither the initiator, or is called in for advice, and its continuedexistence in a purely advisory capacity as a link between the societieswhere concerted action is required, will be necessary even when theorganisation of farmers into societies is completed. The economic lifeof rural communities is in continual need of adjustment. Now it is aninvention like a steam separator which revolutionises an industry. Atanother time the crisis created by a change in the tariff of a foreigncountry forces the producer either to find a new outlet for his wares,or to abandon a hitherto profitable employment. A striking instance ofthe value of organisation and connection with a central advisory bodyoccurred in 1887, when swine fever broke out in Denmark, and the exportsof live swine fell from 230,000 in one year to 16,000 in the next. Theorganisation of the farmers, however, enabled them easily to consulttogether how best to meet the emergency, and their decision to startco-operative bacon-curing factories was the foundation of their presentgreat export trade in manufactured bacon.I must not overburden with details a narrative intended for readers towhom I merely wish to give a deeper and wider understanding of Irishlife than most of them probably possess. But there is just one form ofagricultural co-operation to which I can usefully devote a fewparagraphs, because it throws much light upon the associative qualitiesof the people and also upon the educational and social value of themovement. I refer to the Agricultural Banks, more properly called CreditAssociations, which have been organised upon the Raiffeisen system.Before the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society was formed we hadread of these institutions, and of the marvellously beneficial effectthey had produced upon the most depressed rural communities abroad. Butonly in the last few years have we fully realised that they are evenmore required and are likely to do more good in Ireland than in anyother country; for on the psychological side of our work we formerly butdimly saw things which we now see clearly.The exact purpose of these organisations is to create credit as a meansof introducing capital into the agricultural industry. They perform theapparent miracle of giving solvency to a community composed almostentirely of insolvent individuals. The constitution of these bodies,which can, of course, be described only in broad outline here, issomewhat startling. They have no subscribed capital, but every member isliable for the entire debts of the association. Consequently theassociation takes good care to admit men of approved character andcapacity only. It starts by borrowing a sum of money on the joint andseveral security of its members. A member wishing to borrow from theassociation is not required to give tangible security, but must bringtwo sureties. He fills up an application form which states, among otherthings, what he wants the money for. The rules provide--and this is thesalient feature of the system--that a loan shall be made for aproductive purpose only, that is, a purpose which, in the judgment ofthe other members of the association as represented by a committeedemocratically elected from among themselves, will enable the borrowerto repay the loan out of the results of the use made of the money lent.Raiffeisen held, and our experience in Ireland has fully confirmed hisopinion, that in the poorest communities there is a perfectly safe basisof security in the honesty and industry of its members. This security isnot valuable to the ordinary commercial lender, such as the local jointstock bank. Even if such lenders had the intimate knowledge possessed bythe committee of one of these associations as to the character andcapacity of the borrower, they would not be able to satisfy themselvesthat the loan was required for a really productive purpose, nor wouldthey be able to see that it was properly applied to the stipulatedobject. One of the rules of the co-operative banks provides for theexpulsion of a member who does not apply the money to the agreedproductive purpose. But although these "Banks" are almost invariablysituated in very poor districts, there has been no necessity to put thisrule in force in a single instance. Social influences seem to be quitesufficient to secure obedience to the association's laws.Another advantage conferred by the association is that the term forwhich money is advanced is a matter of agreement between the borrowerand the bank. The hard and fast term of three months which prevails inIreland for small loans is unsuited to the requirements of theagricultural industry--as for instance, when a man borrows money to sowa crop, and has to repay it before harvest. The society borrows at fouror five per cent, and lends at five or six per cent. In some cases theCongested Districts Board or the Department of Agriculture have madeloans to these banks at three per cent. This enables the societies tolend at the popular rate of one penny for the use of one pound for amonth. The expenses of administration are very small. As the credit ofthese associations develops, they will become a depository for thesavings of the community, to the great advantage of both lender andborrower. The latter generally makes an enormous profit out of theseloans, which have accordingly gained the name of 'the lucky money,' andwe find, in practice, that he always repays the association and almostinvariably with punctuality.The sketch I have given of the agricultural banks will, perhaps, besufficient to show what an immense educational and economic benefit theyare likely to confer when they are widely extended throughout Ireland,as I hope they will be in the near future. Under this system, which, toquote the report of the Indian Famine Commission, 1901, 'separates theworking bees from the drones,' the industrious men of the community whohad no clear idea before of the meaning or functions of capital orcredit, and who were generally unable to get capital into their industryexcept at exorbitant rates of interest and upon unsuitable terms, arenow able to get, not always, indeed, all the money they want, but allthe money they can well employ for the improvement of their industry.There is no fear of rash investment of capital in enterprises believedto be, but not in reality productive--the committee take good care ofthat. The whole community is taught the difference between borrowing tospend and borrowing to make. You have the collective wisdom of the bestmen in the association helping the borrower to decide whether he oughtto borrow or not, and then assisting him, if only from motives ofself-interest, to make the loan fulfil the purpose for which it wasmade. I was delighted to find when I was making an enquiry into theworking of the system that, whereas the debt-laden peasants had formerlyconcealed their indebtedness, of which they were ashamed, those who werein debt to the new banks were proud of the fact, as it was the besttestimonial to their character for honesty and industry.[39]One other sphere of activity worked by the co-operative associationsneeds a passing notice. The desire that, together with materialamelioration, there should be a corresponding intellectual advancementand a greater beauty in life has prompted many of the farmers' societiesto use their organisation for higher ends. A considerable number of themhave started Village Libraries, and by an admirable selection of bookshave brought to their members, not only the means of educatingthemselves in the more difficult technical problems of their industry,but also a means of access to that enchanted world of Irish thoughtwhich inspires the Gaelic Revival to which I have already referred.Social gatherings of every kind, dances, lectures, concerts, and suchlike entertainments, which have the two-fold effect of brightening rurallife and increasing the attachment of the members to their society, arebecoming a common feature in the movement, and this more human aspecthas attracted to it the attention of many who do not understand itseconomic side. We have gratifying evidence from many of the clergy thatthe movement thus developed has kept at home young people who wouldotherwise have fled from the continued hardship and intellectualemptiness of rural life at home.These results are in no small measure due to the zeal and devotion ofthe governing body and staff of the I.A.O.S. The general policy of thesociety is guided by a committee of twenty-four members, one-half ofwhom are elected by the individual subscribers and the other half by theaffiliated societies. It is representative in the best sense andinfluential accordingly. The success of the Committee is no doubt mainlydue to the wisdom which they have displayed in the selection of thestaff. In the most important post, that of Secretary, they have kept onmy chief fellow-worker in the early struggle, Mr. R.A. Anderson, who hasdevoted himself to the cause with all the energy of a nature at onceenthusiastic, unselfish, and practical, and who has succeeded ininspiring his staff of organisers and experts with his own spirit. Amongthese, two deserve special mention, Mr. George W. Russell, one of theAssistant Secretaries, who has, under the _nom de plume_ "A.E.,"attained fame for a poetry of rare distinction of thought and diction,and Mr. P.J. Hannon, the other Assistant Secretary, who has provedhimself a splendid propagandist. Each of these gentlemen has brought tothe movement a zeal and ability which could only come of a devotion tohigh ideals of patriotism, curiously combined with a shrewd practicalinstinct for carrying on varied and responsible business undertakings.With the growing work the staff has been repeatedly augmented to enablethe central society to keep pace with the demand made by groups offarmers to be initiated into the principles of co-operativeorganisation and the details of its application to the particularbranches of farming carried on in their several districts. At the sametime the societies which have been established need, during theirearlier years, and with each extension of their operations, constantadvice and supervision. Hence skilled organisers have to be kept to formco-operative dairy societies, inspect creameries, and give technicaladvice upon the manufacture and sale of butter, the care of machinery,the adequacy of the water supply, the drainage system, and many similartechnical questions. Others are employed to start poultry societies,which when organised have still to be instructed by a Danish expert inthe proper method of packing, selecting, and grading the eggs forexport. In tillage districts there is a constant demand for organisersof purely agricultural societies, which aim at the joint purchase ofseeds and manures, of implements and other farm requisites, and at thebetter disposal of produce; while the growing importance of an improvedsystem of agricultural credit keeps four organisers of agriculturalbanks constantly at work Home industries, bee-keeping, and horticulture,may be added to the objects for which societies have been formed andwhich require separate expert organisers. And in addition to all thiswork, the central association has found it necessary to keep a staff ofaccountants, versed in the principles of co-operative organisation, toinstruct these miscellaneous societies in simple and efficient systemsof bookkeeping, and in the general principles of conducting business.To complete the description of the propagandist activities of thecentral body, there is a ceaseless flow of leaflets and circularscontaining advice and direction to bodies of farmers who, for the firsttime in their lives, have combined for business purposes; while a littleweekly paper, the _Irish Homestead_, acts as the organ of the movement,promotes the exchange of ideas between societies scattered throughoutthe country, furnishes useful information upon all matters connectedwith their business operations, and keeps constantly before theassociated farmers the economic principles which must be observed, and,above all, the spirit in which the work must be approached, if themovement is to fulfil its mission.[40]One of the difficulties incidental to a movement of this kind, which,for the reasons already set forth, had to be rapidly and widelyextended, was the enormous cost to its supporters. It is needless to saythat such a staff as I have described could not be kept continuouslytravelling by rail and road for so many years without the provision of alarge fund. These officers must obviously be men with exceptionalqualifications, if they are not only to impress the thought of theiragricultural audiences, but also to move them to action, and to sustainthe newly organised societies through the initial difficulties of theirunfamiliar enterprise. Such men are not to be found idle, and if theypreach this gospel, they are entitled to live by it. They are not by anymeans overpaid, but their salaries in the aggregate amount to a largeannual sum. Before the creation of the Department of Agriculture andTechnical Instruction in 1900 large sums were spent by the I.A.O.S. notonly in its proper work of organisation, but also in giving technicalinstruction, which was found to be essential to commercial success. Whenthe Society was relieved of this educational work many of its supporterswithdrew their subscriptions under the impression that there was now nolonger any need for its continued existence. But so far from theSociety's usefulness having ceased, it has now become more importantthan ever that the doctrine of organised self-help, which must be thefoundation of any sound Irish economic policy, should be insisted uponand put into practical operation as widely as possible. All those whoare devoting their lives to the firm establishment of this self-helpmovement among the chief wealth-producers of the country are agreed thatno better educational work can be done at the moment than that which isbringing about so salutary a change in the economic attitude of theIrish mind.It is not to be wondered at that the greater part of the necessary fundsshould have been drawn from a very limited circle of public-spirited mencapable of grasping the significance of a movement the practical effectof which would appear to be permanent only to those who had a deepinsight into Irish problems.[41] The difficulty of a successful appealto a wider public has been the impossibility of giving in brief form anadequate explanation, such as that which it is hoped these pages willafford, of the part the movement was to play in Irish life. We wereasked whether our scheme was business or philanthropy. If philanthropy,it would probably do more harm than good. If business, why was it notself-supporting? I remember hearing the movement ridiculed in the Houseof Commons by a prominent Irish member on the ground that the accountsof the I.A.O.S. showed that L20,000 (L40,000 would be nearer the marknow) had been put into the 'business,' and that this large capital hadbeen entirely lost! When we proved that agricultural co-operationbrought a large profit to the members of the societies we formed, it wassuggested that a small part of this profit would give us all we requiredfor our organising work. So it will in time, but if instead of merelyrefusing financial assistance to our converts, we were, on the otherhand, to demand it from them, we certainly should not lessen thedifficulty of launching our movement among the farmers of Ireland. Someof our critics denounced the expenditure of so much money for which, intheir opinion, there was nothing to show, and said that the time hadcome to stop this 'spoon-feeding.' When those for whose exclusivebenefit the costly work had been undertaken learned that all we had tooffer was the cold advice that they should help themselves, they notinfrequently raised a wholly different objection to our economicdoctrine. Spoonfeeding they might have tolerated, but there was nothingin the spoon! The movement has survived all these criticisms. The lackof moral and of financial support which retarded its progress in theearly years, has been so far surmounted The movement may now, I think,appeal for further help as one that has justified its existence. Theopinion that it has done so is not held only by those who are engaged inpromoting it, nor by Irish observers alone. The efforts of the Irishfarmers so to reorganise their industry that they may hopefully approachthe solution of the problems of rural life are being watched byeconomists and administrators abroad. Enquirers have come to Irelandduring the last two years from Germany, France, Canada, the UnitedStates, India, South Africa, Cyprus and the West Indies, having beendrawn here by the desire to understand the combination of economic andhuman reform. It was not alone the economic advantages of the movementwhich interested them, but the way in which the organisation at the sametime acted upon the character and awoke those forces of self-help andcomradeship in which lies the surety of any enduring nationalprosperity. A native governor from a famine district in the MadrasPresidency, who, perhaps, better than any one realised the importanceof these human factors, because the lethargy of his own people hadforced it on his notice, said, when he was referred to the Department ofAgriculture and Technical Instruction for information, "Oh, don't speakto me about Government Departments. They are the same all over theworld. I come here to learn what the Irish people are doing to helpthemselves and how you awaken the will and the initiative." I hope toshow later that State assistance properly applied is not necessarilydemoralising but very much the reverse. It is consoling, too, to ournational pride, long wounded by contemptuous references to ourindustrial incapacity as compared with our neighbours, to find that ourlatest efforts are regarded by them as worthy of imitation. From theother side of the Channel no less than five County Councils have sentdeputations of farmers to Ireland to study the progress of the movement,and already an English Organisation Society, expressly modelled upon itsIrish namesake, has been established and is endeavouring to carry outthe same work.It is not surprising that the facts which I have cited should beinteresting to the honest inquirer. A summary of actual achievement willshow that this movement has spread all over Ireland, that its principleof organised self-help has been universally accepted, and that nothingbut time and the necessary funds are required by its promoters to giveit, within the range of its applicability, general effect. It is noexaggeration to say that there has been set in motion and carriedbeyond the experimental stage a revolution in agricultural methods whichwill enable our farmers to compete with their rivals abroad, both inproduction and in distribution, under far more favourable conditionsthan before. Alike in its material and in its moral achievements thismovement has provided an effective means whereby the peasant proprietaryabout to be created will be able to face and solve the vital problemsbefore it, problems for which no improvement in land tenure, no rentreductions actual or prospective, could otherwise provide an adequatesolution. Furthermore, nothing could be more evident to any closeobserver of Irish life than the fact that had it not been for the newspirit which the workers in this movement, mostly humble unknown men,had generated, the attitude of the Irish democracy towards England'slatest concession to Ireland would have been very different from what itis. In the last dozen years hundreds and thousands of meetings have beenheld to discuss matters of business importance to our rural communities.At these meetings landlord and tenant-farmer have often met each otherfor the first time on a footing of friendly equality, as fellow-membersof co-operative societies. It is significant that all through thenegotiations which culminated in the Dunraven Treaty, landlords who hadcome into the life of the people in connection with the co-operativemovement took a prominent part in favour of conciliation.I would further give it as my opinion, whatever it may be worth, thatthe movement has exercised a profound influence in those departments ofour national life where, as I have shown in previous chapters, newforces must be not only recognised but accepted as essential to nationalwell-being, if we are to cherish what is good and free ourselves fromwhat is bad in the historical evolution of our national life. In thedomain of politics it is hard to estimate even the political value ofthe exclusion of politics from deliberations and activities where theyhave no proper place. In our religious life, where intolerance hasperpetuated anti-industrial tendencies, the new movement is seen to bebringing together for business purposes men who had previously nodealings with each other, but who have now learned that the doctrine ofself-help by mutual help involves no danger to faith and no sacrifice ofhope, while it engenders a genuinely Christian interpretation ofcharity.[42]I cannot conclude the story of this movement without paying a brieftribute of respect and gratitude to those true patriots who have bornethe daily burden of the work. I hope the picture I have given of theiraims and achievements will lead to a just appreciation of their servicesto their country. By these men and women applause or even recognitionwas not expected or desired: they knew that it was to those who had theadvantages of leisure, and what the world calls position, that thecredit for their work would be given. But it is of national importancethat altruistic service should be understood and given freedom ofexpansion. I have, therefore, presented as faithfully as I could theorigin and development of one of the least understood, but in myopinion, most fruitful movements which has ever been undertaken by abody of social and economic reformers. As Irish leaders they havepreferred to remain obscure, conscious that the most damaging criticismwhich could be applied to their work would be that it depended on theirown personal qualities or acts for its permanent utility. But mostassuredly the real conquerors of the world are those who found uponhuman character their hopes of human progress.FOOTNOTES:[37] The story of the conversion of some of the tenants on the Vandeleurestate into a co-operative community in 1831 by Mr. E.T. Craig, aScotchman who took up the agency of the property, told in the _Historyof Ralahine_ (London, Truebner & Co., 1893) is worth reading. Theexperiment, most hopeful as far as it went, was only two years inexistence when the landlord gambled away his property at cards in aDublin club and the Utopia was sold up. But in the co-operative worldMr. Craig, who died as recently as 1894, is revered as the author of themost advanced experiment in the realisation of co-operative ideals. Theeconomic significance of the narrative is obviously not important, and Idoubt whether joint ownership of land, except for the purpose of commongrazing, is a practical ideal. The ready response, however, of the Irishpeasants to Mr. Craig's enthusiasm and the way in which they took up theidea form an interesting study of the Irish character.[38] The late Canon Bagot had done good service in explaining the valueof the new machinery; but unhappily the vital importance of co-operativeorganisation was not then understood. He formed some joint stockcompanies with the result that, having no co-operative spirit to offsettheir commercial inexperience, they all proved, instead of co-operativesuccesses, competitive failures. This fact added to our earlydifficulties.[39] It should be noted that this form of association for creditpurposes, owing to its peculiar constitution, applies only to a grade ofthe community whose members all live on about the same scale and that afairly low one. It is obvious that unlimited liability would lose itsefficacy in developing the sense of responsibility if some members ofthe association were so substantial that its creditors would make themprimarily responsible in the event of failure. The fact, however, thatthe scheme has worked with unvarying success among the poorest of thepoor, and the most Irish of the Irish, renders it as good anillustration as can be found of what may be done by sympathetic andintelligent treatment of Irish economic problems. Mr. Henry W. Wolff,the foremost authority on People's Banks in these islands, and Mr. R.A.Yerburgh, M.P., a generous subscriber to the Irish AgriculturalOrganisation Society, have taken great interest in this part of themovement and have rendered much assistance.[40] Those who wish to go more fully into the details of theco-operative agricultural movement in Ireland should write to theSecretary Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, 22 Lincoln-place,Dublin. The publications of the Society are somewhat voluminous, and theinquirer should intimate any particular branches of the subject in whichhe is especially interested. Those wishing to keep _au courant_ with thefurther development of the movement would do well to take in the _IrishHomestead_, post free _6s. 6d._ per annum.[41] The chief donors belong to the class of philanthropists who do notcare to advertise their beneficence. I, therefore, respect their wishesand withhold their names.[42] I recall an occasion when the Vice-President of the I.A.O.S. (aNationalist in politics and a Jesuit priest), who has been ever ready tolend a hand as volunteer organiser when the prior claims of hisreligious and educational duties allowed, found himself before anaudience which he was informed, when he came to the meeting, consistedmainly of Orangemen. He began his address by referring to the new andsomewhat strange environment into which he had drifted. He did not,however, see why this circumstance should lead to any misunderstandingbetween himself and his audience. He had never been able to understandwhat a battle fought upon a famous Irish river two centuries ago had gotto do with the practical issues of to-day which he had come to discuss.The dispute in question was, after all, between a Scotchman and aDutchman, and if it had not yet been decided, they might be left tosettle it themselves--that is if too great a gulf did not separate them.CHAPTER VIII.THE RECESS COMMITTEE.The new movement, six years after its initiation, had succeeded beyondthe most sanguine expectations of its promoters. All over the countrythe idea of self-help was taking firm hold of the imagination of thepeople.Co-operation had got, so to speak, into the air to such an extent that,whereas at the beginning, as I well remember, our chief difficulty hadbeen to popularise a principle to which one section of the community wasstrongly opposed, and in which no section believed, it was now no longernecessary to explain or support the theory, but only to show how itcould be advantageously applied to some branch of the farmer's industry.It was not, strange to say, the economic advantage which had chieflyappealed to the quick intelligence of the Irish farmer, but rather thenovel sensation that he was thinking for himself, and that whileimproving his own condition he was working for others. This attitude wasessential to the success of the movement, because had it not been for avein of altruism, the "strong" farmers would have held aloof, and thesmall men would have been discouraged by the abstention of thebetter-off and presumably more enlightened of their class.Perhaps, too, we owed something to the recognition on the part of theworking farmers of Ireland that they were showing a capacity to grasp anidea which had so far failed to penetrate the bucolic intelligence ofthe predominant partner. Whatever the causes to which the success of themovement was attributable, those who were responsible for its promotionfelt in the year 1895 that it had reached a stage in its developmentwhen it was but a question of time to complete the projected revolutionin the farming industry, the substitution of combined for isolatedmethods of production and distribution. It was then further brought hometo them that the principle of self-help was destined to obtain generalacceptance in rural Ireland, and that the time had come when a soundsystem of State aid to agriculture might be fruitfully grafted on tothis native growth of local effort and self-reliance.From time to time our public men had included in the list of Irishgrievances the fact that England enjoyed a Board of Agriculture whileIreland had no similar institution. As a matter of fact a mere replicaof the English Board would not have fulfilled a tithe of the objects wehad in view. That much at least we knew, but beyond that our informationwas vague. What, having regard to Irish rural conditions, should be thecharacter and constitution of any Department called into being toadminister the aid required? Here indeed was a vital and difficultproblem. Even those of us who had given the closest thought to thematter did not know exactly what was wanted; nor, if we had known ourown minds, could we have formulated our demand in such a way as to haveobtained a backing from representative public bodies, associations, andindividuals sufficient to secure its concession. Instead, therefore, ofagitating in the conventional manner we determined to try to direct thebest thought of the country to the problem in hand, with a view tosatisfying the Government, and also ourselves, as to what was wanted. Wehad confidence that a demand presented to Parliament, based upon calmand deliberate debate among the most competent of Irishmen, would beconceded. The story of this agitation, its initiation, its conduct, andits final success will, I am sure, be of interest to all who feel anyconcern for the welfare of Ireland.I have accepted the common characterisation of the Irish as aleader-following people. When we come to analyse the human material outof which a strong national life may be constructed, we find that thereare in Ireland--in this connection I exclude the influence of theclergy, with which I have dealt specifically in another chapter--twoelements of leadership, the political and the industrial. The politicalleaders are seen to enjoy an influence over the great majority of thepeople which is probably as powerful as that of any political leaders inancient or modern times; but as a class they certainly do not take aprominent, or even an active part in business life. This fact is notintroduced with any controversial purpose, and I freely acknowledge canbe interpreted in a sense altogether creditable to the Nationalistmembers. The other element of leadership contains all that is prominentin industrial and commercial life, and few countries could producebetter types of such leaders than can be found in the northern capitalof the country. But, unhappily, these men are debarred from allinfluence upon the thought and action of the great majority of thepeople, who are under the domination of the political leaders. This isone of the strange anomalies of Irish life to which I have alreadyreferred. Its recognition, and the desire to utilise the knowledge ofbusiness men as well as politicians, took practical effect in theformation of the Recess Committee.The idea underlying this project was the combination of these two forcesof leadership--the force with political influence and that of provedindustrial and commercial capacity--in order to concentrate publicopinion, which was believed to be inclining in this direction, on thematerial needs of the country. The General Election of 1895 had, byuniversal admission, postponed, for some years at any rate, anypossibility of Home Rule, and the cessation of the bitter feelingsaroused when Home Rule seemed imminent provided the opportunity for anappeal to the Irish people in behalf of the views which I haveadumbrated. The appeal took the form of a letter, dated August 27th,1895, by the author to the Irish Press, under the quite sincere, ifsomewhat grandiloquent, title, "A proposal affecting the general welfareof Ireland."The letter set out the general scope and purpose of the scheme. After aconfession of the writer's continued opposition to Home Rule, theadmission was made that if the average Irish elector, who is moreintelligent than the average British elector, were also as prosperous,as industrious, and as well educated, his continued demand, in theproper constitutional way, for Home Rule would very likely result in theexperiment being one day tried. On the other hand, the opinion wasexpressed that if the material conditions of the great body of ourcountrymen were advanced, if they were encouraged in industrialenterprise, and were provided with practical education in proportion totheir natural intelligence, they would see that a political developmenton lines similar to those adopted in England was, considering thenecessary relations between the two countries, best for Ireland; andthen they would cease to desire what is ordinarily understood as HomeRule. A basis for united action between politicians on both sides of theIrish controversy was then suggested. Finding ourselves still opposedupon the main question, but all anxious to promote the welfare of thecountry, and confident that, as this was advanced, our respectivepolicies would be confirmed, it would appear, it was suggested, to bealike good patriotism and good policy to work for the material andsocial advancement of the people. Why then, it was asked, should anyIrishman hesitate to enter at once upon that united action between menof both parties which alone, under existing conditions, could enableeither party to do any real and lasting good to the country?The letter proceeded to indicate economic legislation which, thoughsorely needed by Ireland, was hopelessly unattainable unless it could beremoved from the region of controversy. The _modus co-operandi_suggested was as follows:--a committee sitting in the Parliamentaryrecess, whence it came to be known as the Recess Committee, was to beformed, consisting in the first instance, of Irish Members of Parliamentnominated by the leaders of the different sections. These nominees wereto invite to join them any Irishmen whose capacity, knowledge, orexperience might be of service to the Committee, irrespective of thepolitical party or religious persuasion to which they might belong. Theday had come, the letter went on to say, when "we Unionists, withoutabating one jot of our Unionism, and Nationalists, without abating onejot of their Nationalism, can each show our faith in the cause for whichwe have fought so bitterly and so long, by sinking our party differencesfor our country's good, and leaving our respective policies for thejustification of time."Needless to say, few were sanguine enough to hope that such a committeewould ever be brought together. If that were accomplished someprophesied that its members would but emulate the fame of the Kilkennycats. A severe blow was dealt to the project at the outset by therefusal of Mr. Justin McCarthy, who then spoke for the largest sectionof the Nationalist representatives, to have anything to do with it. Hisreply to the letter must be given in full:--     MY DEAR MR. PLUNKETT,     I am sure I need not say that any effort to promote the general     welfare of Ireland has my fullest sympathy. I readily acknowledge     and entirely believe in the sincerity and good purpose of your     effort, but I cannot see my way to associate myself with it. Your     frank avowal in your letter of August 27th is the expression of a     belief that if your policy could be successfully carried out the     Irish people "would cease to desire Home Rule." Now, I do not     believe that anything in the way of material improvement conferred     by the Parliament at Westminster, or by Dublin Castle, could     extinguish the national desire for Home Rule. Still, I do not feel     that I could possibly take part in any organisation which had for     its object the seeking of a substitute for that which I believe to     be Ireland's greatest need--Home Rule.     Yours very truly,     JUSTIN MCCARTHY.     73, Eaton-terrace, S.W., October 22nd, 1895.I had not much hope that I could influence Mr. McCarthy's decision; butit was so serious an obstacle to further action that I made one moreappeal. I wrote to my respected and courteous correspondent, pointingout the misconception of my proposal, which had arisen from the use madeof the six words quoted by him, which were hardly intelligible withoutthe context. I asked him to reconsider his refusal to join in theproposal for promoting the material improvement of our country, onaccount of a contingency which he confidently declared could not arise.But in those days economic seed fell upon stony political ground.The position was rendered still more difficult by the action of ColonelSaunderson, the leader of the Irish Unionist party, who wrote to thenewspapers declaring that he would not sit on a Committee with Mr. JohnRedmond. On the other hand, Mr. Redmond, speaking then for the"Independent" party, consisting of less than a dozen members, butcontaining some men who agreed with Mr. Field's admission in the Houseof Commons that "man cannot live on politics alone," joined theCommittee and acted throughout in a manner which was broad,statesmanlike, conciliatory, and as generous as it was courageous. Hisletter of acceptance ran as follows:--     DEAR MR. PLUNKETT,     I received your letter, in which you ask me to co-operate with you     in bringing together a small Committee of Members of Parliament to     discuss certain measures to be proposed next Session for the     benefit of Ireland. While I cannot take as sanguine a view as you     do of the benefits likely to flow from such a proceeding, I am     unwilling to take the responsibility of declining to aid in any     effort to promote useful legislation for Ireland.     I will, under the circumstances, co-operate with you in bringing     such a Committee as you suggest together. Very truly yours,     J.E. REDMOND.     October 21st, 1895.Before these decisions were officially announced the idea had "caughton." Public bodies throughout the country endorsed the scheme. Theparliamentarians, who formed the nucleus of the Committee, cametogether and invited prominent men from all quarters to join them. Acommittee which, though informal and self-appointed, might fairly claimto be representative in every material respect, was thus constituted onthe lines laid down.Truly, it was a strange council over which I had the honour to preside.All shades of politics were there--Lords Mayo and Monteagle, Mr. Daneand Sir Thomas Lea (Tories and Liberal Unionist Peers and Members ofParliament) sitting down beside Mr. John Redmond and his parliamentaryfollowers. It was found possible, in framing proposals fraught withmoral, social, and educational results, to secure the cordial agreementof the late Rev. Dr. Kane, Grand Master of the Belfast Orangemen, and ofthe eminent Jesuit educationist, Father Thomas Finlay, of the RoyalUniversity. The O'Conor Don, the able Chairman of the FinancialRelations Commission, and Mr. John Ross, M.P., now one of His Majesty'sJudges, both Unionists, were balanced by the Lord Mayor of Dublin, andMr. T.C. Harrington, M.P., who now occupies that post, bothNationalists. The late Sir John Arnott fitly represented the commercialenterprise of the South, while such men as Mr. Thomas Sinclair,universally regarded as one of the wisest of Irish public men, SirWilliam Ewart, head of the leading linen concern in the North, SirDaniel Dixon, now Lord Mayor of Belfast, Sir James Musgrave, Chairman ofthe Belfast Harbour Board, and Mr. Thomas Andrews, a well-knownflax-spinner and Chairman of the Belfast and County Down Railway, wouldbe universally accepted as the highest authorities upon the needs of thebusiness community which has made Ulster famous in the industrial world.Mr. T.P. Gill, besides undertaking investigation of the utmost valueinto State aid to agriculture in France and Denmark, acted as Hon.Secretary to the Committee, of which he was a member.The story of our deliberations and ultimate conclusions cannot be setforth here except in the barest outline. We instituted an inquiry intothe means by which the Government could best promote the development ofour agricultural and industrial resources, and despatched commissionersto countries of Europe whose conditions and progress might afford somelessons for Ireland. Most of this work was done for us by the lateeminent statistician, Mr. Michael Mulhall. Our funds did not admit of aninquiry in the United States or the Colonies. However, we obtainedinvaluable information as to the methods by which countries which wereour chief rivals in agricultural and industrial production have beenenabled to compete successfully with our producers even in our ownmarkets. Our commissioners were instructed in each case to collect thefacts necessary to enable us to differentiate between the parts playedrespectively by State aid and the efforts of the people themselves inproducing these results. With this information before us, after long andearnest deliberation we came to a unanimous agreement upon the mainfacts of the situation with which we had to deal, and upon therecommendations for remedial legislation which we should make to theGovernment.The substance of our recommendations was that a Department of Governmentshould be specially created, with a minister directly responsible toParliament at its head. The central body was to be assisted by aConsultative Council representative of the interests concerned. TheDepartment was to be adequately endowed from the Imperial Treasury, andwas to administer State aid to agriculture and industries in Irelandupon principles which were fully described. The proposal to amalgamateagriculture and industries under one Department was adopted largely onaccount of the opinion expressed by M. Tisserand, late Director-Generalof Agriculture in France, one of the highest authorities in Europe uponthe administration of State aid to agriculture.[43] The creation of anew minister directly responsible to Parliament was considered anecessary provision. Ireland is governed by a number of Boards, all,with the exception of the Board of Works (which is really a branch ofthe Treasury), responsible to the Chief Secretary--practically a wholecabinet under one hat--who is supposed to be responsible for them toParliament and to the Lord Lieutenant. The bearers of this burden aregenerally men of great ability. But no Chief Secretary could possiblytake under his wing yet another department with the entirely new andimportant functions now to be discharged. What these functions were tobe need not here be described, as the Department thus 'agitated' for hasnow been three years at work and will form the subject of the next twochapters.On August 1st, 1896, less than a year from the issue of the invitationto the political leaders, the Report was forwarded to the ChiefSecretary to the Lord Lieutenant for Ireland, with a covering letter,setting out the considerations upon which the Committee relied for thejustification of its course of action. Attention was drawn to the termsof the original proposal, its exceptional nature and essentialinformality, the political conditions which appeared to make itopportune, the spirit in which it was responded to by those who wereinvited to join, and the degree of public approval which had beenaccorded to our action. We were able to claim for the Committee that itwas thoroughly representative of those agricultural and industrialinterests, North and South, with which the Report was concerned.There were two special features in the brief history of this uniquecoming together of Irishmen which will strike any man familiar with theconditions of Irish public life. The first was the way in which thebusiness element, consisting of men already deeply engaged in theirvarious callings--and, indeed, selected for that very reason--devotedtime and labour to the service of their country. Still more significantwas the fact that the political element on the Committee should havecome to an absolutely unanimous agreement upon a policy which, thoughnot intended to influence the trend of politics, was yet bound to havefar-reaching consequences upon the political thought of the country, andupon the positions of parties and leaders. It was thought only fair tothe Nationalist members of the Committee that every precaution should betaken to prevent their being placed in a false position. 'To avoid anypossible misconception,' the covering letter ran, 'as to the attitude ofthose members of the Committee who are not supporters of the presentGovernment, it is right here to state that, while under existingpolitical conditions they agreed in recommending a certain course to theGovernment, they wish it to be understood that their politicalprinciples remain unaltered, and that, were it immediately possible,they would prefer that the suggested reforms should be preceded by theconstitutional changes of which they are the well-known advocates.'It is interesting to note that the Committee claimed favourableconsideration for their proposals on the ground that they sought to actas 'a channel of communication between the Irish Government and Irishpublic opinion.' Little interest, they pointed out, had been hithertoaroused in those economic problems for which the Report suggested somesolution. They expressed the hope that their action would do somethingto remedy this defect, especially in view of the importance whichforeign Governments had found it necessary to attach to public opinionin working out their various systems of State aid to agriculture andindustries. At the same time the Committee emphasised, in the coveringletter, their reliance on individual and combined effort rather than onState aid. They were able to point out that, in asking for the latter,they had throughout attached the utmost importance to its being grantedin such a manner as to evoke and supplement, and in no way be asubstitute for self-help. If they appeared to give undue prominence tothe capabilities of State initiation, it was to be remembered that theywere dealing with economic conditions which had been artificiallyproduced, and which, therefore, might require exceptional treatment of atemporary nature to bring about a permanent remedy.I fear those most intimately connected with the above occurrences willregard this chapter as a very inadequate description of events sounprecedented and so full of hope for the future. My purpose is,however, to limit myself, in dealing with the past, to such details asare necessary to enable the reader to understand the present facts ofIrish life, and to build upon them his own conclusions as to the mosthopeful line of future development. I shall, therefore, pass rapidly inreview the events which led to the fruition of the labours of the RecessCommittee.Public opinion in favour of the new proposals grew rapidly. Before theend of the year (1896) a deputation, representing all the leadingagricultural and industrial interests of the country, waited upon theIrish Government, in order to press upon them the urgent need for thenew department. The Lord Lieutenant, after describing the gathering as'one of the most notable deputations which had ever come to lay its casebefore the Irish Government,' and noting the 'remarkable growth ofpublic opinion' in favour of the policy they were advocating, expressedhis heartfelt sympathy with the case which had been presented, and hisearnest desire--which was well known--to proceed with legislation forthe agricultural and industrial development of the country at theearliest moment. The demand made upon the Government was,argumentatively, already irresistible. But economic agitation of thiskind takes time to acquire dynamic force. Mr. Gerald Balfour introduceda Bill the following year, but it had to be withdrawn to leave the wayclear for the other great Irish measure which revolutionised localgovernment. The unconventional agitation went on upon the originallines, appealing to that latent public opinion which we were striving todevelop. In 1899 another Bill was introduced, and, owing to its masterlyhandling by the Chief Secretary in the House of Commons, ably secondedby the strong support given by Lord Cadogan, who was in the Cabinet, itbecame law.I cannot conclude this chapter without a word upon the extraordinarymisunderstanding of Mr. Gerald Balfour's policy to which the obscuringatmosphere surrounding all Irish questions gave rise. In one respectthat policy was a new departure of the utmost importance. He provedhimself ready to take a measure from Ireland and carry it through,instead of insisting upon a purely English scheme which he could callhis own. These pre-digested foods had already done much to destroy ourpolitical digestion, and it was time we were given something to grow, tocook, and to assimilate for ourselves. It will be seen, too, in the nextchapter, that he had realised the potentiality for good of the newforces in Irish life to which he gave play in his two great linkedActs--one of them popularising local government, and the other creatinga new Department which was to bring the government and the peopletogether in an attempt to develop the resources of the country. Yet hiseminently sane and far-seeing policy was regarded in many quarters as asacrifice of Unionist interests in Ireland. Its real effect was to endowUnionism with a positive as well as a negative policy. But all reformersknow that the further ahead they look, the longer they have to wait fortheir justification. Meanwhile, we may leave out of consideration thedivision of honour or of blame for what has been done. The only matterof historic interest is to arrive at a correct measure of the progressmade.The new movement had thus completed the first and second stages of itsmission. The idea of self-help had become a growing reality, and uponthis foundation an edifice of State aid had been erected. When aNationalist member met a Tory member of the Recess Committee he laughedover the success with which they had wheedled a measure of industrialHome Rule out of a Unionist Government. None the less they cordiallyagreed that the people would rise to their economic responsibility. Thepromoters of the movement had faith that this new departure in Englishgovernment would be more than justified by the English test, and that inthe new sphere of administration the government would be accorded,without prejudice, of course, to the ultimate views either of Unionistsor Home Rulers, not only the consent, but the whole-hearted co-operationof the governed.FOOTNOTES:[43] The memorandum which he kindly contributed to the Recess Committeewas copied into the Annual Report of the United States Department ofAgriculture for 1896.CHAPTER IX.A NEW DEPARTURE IN IRISH ADMINISTRATION.To the average English Member of Parliament, the passing of an Act "forestablishing a Department of Agriculture and other Industries andTechnical Instruction in Ireland and for other purposes connectedtherewith," probably signified little more than the removal of anotherIrish grievance, which might not be imaginary, by the concession toIreland of an equivalent to the Board of Agriculture in England. Inreality the difference between the two institutions is as wide as thedifference between the two islands. The chief interest of the newDepartment consists in the free play which it gives to the pent-upforces of a re-awakening life. A new institution is at best but a newopportunity, but the Department starts with the unique advantage that,unlike most Irish institutions, it is one which we Irishmen plannedourselves and for which we have worked. For this reason the opportunityis one to which we may hope to rise.Before I can convey any clear impression of the part which theDepartment is, I believe, destined to play on the stage of Irish publiclife, it will be necessary for me to give a somewhat detaileddescription of its functions and constitution. The subject is perhapsdull and technical; but readers cannot understand the Ireland of to-dayunless they have in their minds not only an accurate conception of thenew moral forces in Irish life and of the movements to which theseforces have given rise, but also a knowledge of the administrativemachinery and methods by which the people and the Government are now,for the first time since the Union, working together towards thebuilding up of the Ireland of to-morrow.The Department consists of the President (who is the Chief Secretary forthe time being) and the Vice-President. The staff is composed of aSecretary, two Assistant Secretaries (one in respect of Agriculture andone in respect of Technical Instruction), as well as certain heads ofBranches and a number of inspectors, instructors, officers and servants.The Recess Committee, it will be remembered, had laid stress upon theimportance of having at the head of the Department a new Minister whoshould be directly responsible to Parliament; and, accordingly, it wasarranged that the Vice-President should be its direct Ministerial head.The Act provided that the Department should be assisted in its work by aCouncil of Agriculture and two Boards, and also by a ConsultativeCommittee to advise upon educational questions. But before discussingthe constitution of these bodies, it is necessary to explain the natureof the task assigned to the new Department which began work in April,1900. It was created to fulfil two main purposes. In the first place,it was to consolidate in one authority certain inter-related functionsof government in connection with the business concerns of the peoplewhich, until the creation of the Department, were scattered over somehalf-dozen Boards, and to place these functions under the direct controland responsibility of the new Minister. The second purpose was toprovide means by which the Government and the people might work togetherin developing the resources of the country so far as State interventioncould be legitimately applied to this end.To accomplish the first object, two distinct Government departments, theVeterinary Department of the Privy Council and the Office of theInspectors of Irish Fisheries, were merged in the new Department. Theimportance to the economic life of the country of having the laws forsafeguarding our flocks and herds from disease, our crops from insectpests, our farmers from fraud in the supply of fertilisers and feedingstuffs and in the adulteration of foods (which compete with theirproducts), administered by a Department generally concerned for thefarming industry need not be laboured. Similarly, it was well that thelaws for the protection of both sea and inland fisheries should beadministered by the authority whose function it was to develop theseindustries. There was also transferred from South Kensington theadministration of the Science and Arts grants and the grant in aid oftechnical instruction, together with the control of several nationalinstitutions, the most important being the Royal College of Science andthe Metropolitan School of Art; for they, in a sense, would stand at thehead of much of the new work which would be required for thecontemplated agricultural and industrial developments. The AlbertInstitute at Glasnevin and the Munster Institute in Cork, bothinstitutions for teaching practical agriculture, were, as a matter ofcourse, handed over from the Board of National Education.The desirability of bringing order and simplicity into these branches ofadministration, where co-related action was not provided for before, wasobvious. A few years ago, to take a somewhat extreme case, when avirulent attack of potato disease broke out which demanded prompt andactive Governmental intervention, the task of instructing farmers how tospray their potatoes was shared by no fewer than six official orsemi-official bodies. The consolidation of administration effected bythe Act, in addition to being a real step towards efficiency andeconomy, relieved the Chief Secretary of an immense amount of detailedwork to which he could not possibly give adequate personal attention,and made it possible for him to devote a greater share of his time tothe larger problems of general Irish legislation and finance.The newly created powers of the Department, which were added to andco-ordinated with the various pre-existing functions of the severaldepartments whose consolidation I have mentioned above, fairly fulfilledthe recommendation of the Recess Committee that the Department shouldhave 'a wide reference and a free hand.' These powers include theaiding, improving, and developing of agriculture in all its branches;horticulture, forestry, home and cottage industries; sea and inlandfisheries; the aiding and facilitating of the transit of produce; andthe organisation of a system of education in science and art, and intechnology as applied to these various subjects. The provision oftechnical instruction suitable to the needs of the few manufacturingcentres in Ireland was included, but need not be dealt with in anydetail in these pages, since, as I have said before, the questionsconnected therewith are more or less common to all such centres and haveno specially Irish significance.For all the administrative functions transferred to the new Departmentmoneys are, as before, annually voted by Parliament. Towards thefulfilment of the second purpose mentioned above--the development of theresources of the country upon the principles of the Recess Committee--anannual income of L166,000, which was derived in about equal parts fromIrish and imperial sources, and is called the Department's Endowment,together with a capital sum of about L200,000, were provided.It will be seen that a very wide sphere of usefulness was thus openedout for the new Department in two distinct ways. The consolidation,under one authority, of many scattered but co-related functions wasclearly a move in the right direction. Upon this part of itsrecommendations the Recess Committee had no difficulty in coming to aquick decision. But the real importance of their Report lay in thedirection of the new work which was to be assigned to the Department.Under the new order of things, if the Department, acting with as well asfor the people, succeeds in doing well what legitimately may and oughtto be done by the Government towards the development of the resources ofthe country, and, at the same time, as far as possible confines itsinterference to helping the Irish people to help themselves, a whollynew spirit will be imported into the industrial life of the nation.The very nature of the work which the Department was called intoexistence to accomplish made it absolutely essential that it should keepin touch with the classes whom its work would most immediately affect,and without whose active co-operation no lasting good could be achieved.The machinery for this purpose was provided by the establishment of aCouncil of Agriculture and two Boards, one of the latter being concernedwith agriculture, rural industries, and inland fisheries, the other withtechnical instruction. These representative bodies, whose constitutionis interesting as a new departure in administration, were adapted fromsimilar continental councils which have been found by experience, inthose foreign countries which are Ireland's economic rivals, to be themost valuable of all means whereby the administration keeps in touchwith the agricultural and industrial classes, and becomes trulyresponsive to their needs and wishes.The Council of Agriculture consists of two members appointed by eachCounty Council (Cork being regarded as two counties and returning fourmembers), making in all sixty-eight persons. The Department also appointone half this number of persons, observing in their nomination the sameprovincial proportions as obtained in the appointments by the popularbodies. This adds thirty-four members, and makes in all one hundred andtwo Councillors, in addition to the President and Vice-President of theDepartment, who are _ex-officio_ members. Thus, if all the membersattended a Council meeting, the Vice-President would find himselfpresiding over a body as truly representative of the interests concernedas could be brought together, consisting, by a strange coincidence, ofexactly the same number as the Irish representatives in Parliament.The Council, which is appointed for a term of three years, the firstterm dating from the 1st April, 1900, has a two-fold function. It is, inthe first place, a deliberative assembly which must be convened by theDepartment at least once a year. The domain over which its deliberationsmay travel is certainly not restricted, as the Act defines its functionas that of "discussing matters of public interest in connection with anyof the purposes of this Act." The view Mr. Gerald Balfour took was thatnothing but the new spirit he laboured to evoke would make his machinework. Although he gave the Vice-President statutory powers to makerules for the proper ordering of the Council debates, I have been wellcontent to rely upon the usual privileges of a chairman. I haveestimated beforehand the time required for the discussion of matters ofinquiry: the speakers have condensed their speeches accordingly, thebusiness has been expeditiously transacted, and in the mere exchange ofideas invaluable assistance has been given to the Department.The second function of the Council is exercised only at its firstmeeting, and consequently but once in three years. At this firsttriennial meeting it becomes an Electoral College. It divides itselfinto four Provincial Committees, each of which elects two members torepresent its province on the Agricultural Board and one member torepresent it on the Board of Technical Instruction. The AgriculturalBoard, which controls a sum of over L100,000 a year, consists of twelvemembers, and as eight out of the twelve are elected by the fourProvincial Committees--the remaining four being appointed by theDepartment, one from each province--it will be seen that the Council ofAgriculture exercises an influence upon the administration commensuratewith its own representative character. The Board of TechnicalInstruction, consisting of twenty-one members, together with thePresident and Vice-President of the Department, has a less simpleconstitution, owing to the fact that it is concerned with the morecomplex life of the urban districts of the country. As I have said, theCouncil of Agriculture elects only four members--one for each province.The Department appoints four others; each of the County Boroughs ofDublin and Belfast appoints three members; the remaining four CountyBoroughs appoint one member each; a joint Committee of the Councils ofthe large urban districts surrounding Dublin appoint one member; onemember is appointed by the Commissioners of National Education, and onemember by the Intermediate Board of Education.The two Boards have to advise upon all matters submitted to them by theDepartment in connection, in the one case, with agriculture and otherrural industries and inland fisheries, and, in the other case, inconnection with Technical Instruction. The advisory powers of the Boardsare very real, for the expenditure of all moneys out of the Endowmentfunds is subject to their concurrence. Hence, while they have notspecific administrative powers and apparently have only the right ofveto, it is obvious that, if they wished, they might largely force theirown views upon the Department by refusing to sanction the expenditure ofmoney upon any of the Department's proposals, until these were somodified as practically to be their own proposals. It is, therefore,clear that the machinery can only work harmoniously and efficiently solong as it is moved by a right spirit. Above all it is necessary thatthe central administrative body should gain such a measure of popularconfidence as to enable it, without loss of influence, to resistproposals for expenditure upon schemes which might ensure greatpopularity at the moment, but would do permanent harm to the industrialcharacter we are all trying to build up. I need not fear contradictionat the hands of a single member of either Board when I say that up tothe present perfect harmony has reigned throughout. The utmostconsideration has been shown by the Boards for the difficulties whichthe Department have to overcome; and I think I may add that due regardhas been paid by the administrative authority to the representativecharacter and the legitimate wishes of the bodies which advise andlargely control it.The other statutory body attached to the Department has a significanceand potential importance in strange contrast to the humble place itoccupies in the statute book. The Agriculture and Technical Instruction(Ireland) Act, 1899, has, like many other Acts, a part entitled'Miscellaneous,' in which the draughtsman's skill has attended tomultifarious practical details, and made provision for all manner ofcontingencies, many of which the layman might never have thought of orforeseen. Travelling expenses for Council, Boards, and Committees,casual vacancies thereon, a short title for the Act, and a seal for theDepartment, definitions, which show how little we know of our ownlanguage, and a host of kindred matters are included. In this miscellanyappears the following little clause:--     For the purpose of co-ordinating educational administration there     shall be established a Consultative Committee consisting of the     following members:--     (a.) The Vice-President of the Department, who shall be chairman     thereof;     (b.) One person to be appointed by the Commissioners of National     Education;     (c.) One person to be appointed by the Intermediate Education     Board;     (d.) One person to be appointed by the Agricultural Board; and     (e.) One person to be appointed by the Board of Technical     Instruction.Now the real value of this clause, and in this I think it shows aconsumate statesmanship, lies not in what it says, but in what itsuggests. The Committee, it will be observed, has an immensely importantfunction, but no power beyond such authority as its representativecharacter may afford. Any attempt to deal with a large educationalproblem by a clause in a measure of this kind would have alarmed thewhole force of unco-ordinated pedagogy, and perhaps have wrecked theBill. The clause as it stands is in harmony with the whole spirit of thenew movement and of the legislation provided for its advancement. TheCommittee may be very useful in suggesting improvements in educationaladministration which will prevent unnecessary overlapping and lead toco-operation between the systems concerned. Indeed it has already madesuggestions of far-reaching importance, which have been acted upon bythe educational authorities represented upon it. As I have said in anearlier chapter when discussing Irish education from the practicalpoint of view, I have great faith in the efficacy of the economic factorin educational controversy, and this Committee is certainly in aposition to watch and pronounce on any defects in our educational systemwhich the new efforts to deal practically with our industrial andcommercial problems may disclose.There remains to be explained only one feature of the new administrativemachinery, and it is a very important one. The Recess Committee hadrecommended the adaptation to Ireland of a type of central institutionwhich it had found in successful operation on the Continent wherever ithad pursued its investigations. So far as schemes applicable to thewhole country were concerned, the central Department, assuming that itgained the confidence of the Council and Boards, might easily justifyits existence. But the greater part of its work, the Recess Committeesaw, would relate to special localities, and could not succeed withoutthe cordial co-operation of the people immediately concerned. This factbrought Mr. Gerald Balfour face to face with a problem which the RecessCommittee could not solve in its day, because, when it sat, there stillexisted the old grand jury system, though its early abolition had beenpromised. It was extremely fortunate that to the same minister fell thetask of framing both the Act of 1898, which revolutionised localgovernment, and the Act of 1899, now under review. The success withwhich these two Acts were linked together by the provisions of thelatter forms an interesting lesson in constructive statesmanship. Timewill, I believe, thoroughly discredit the hostile criticism whichwithheld its due mead of praise from the most fruitful policy which anyadministration had up to that time ever devised for the bettergovernment of Ireland.The local authorities created by the Act of 1898 provided the machineryfor enabling the representatives of the people to decide themselves, toa large extent, upon the nature of the particular measures to be adoptedin each locality and to carry out the schemes when formulated. The Actcreating the new Department empowered the council of any county or ofany urban district, or any two or more public bodies jointly, to appointcommittees, composed partly of members of the local bodies and partly ofco-opted persons, for the purpose of carrying out such of theDepartment's schemes as are of local, and not of general importance.True to the underlying principle of the new movement--the principle ofself-reliance and local effort--the Act lays it down that 'theDepartment shall not, in the absence of any special considerations,apply or approve of the application of money ... to schemes in respectof which aid is not given out of money provided by local authorities orfrom other local sources.' To meet this requirement the localauthorities are given the power of raising a limited rate for thepurposes of the Act. By these two simple provisions for localadministration and local combination, the people of each district weremade voluntarily contributory both in effort and in money, towards thenew practical developments, and given an interest in, andresponsibility for their success. It was of the utmost importance thatthese new local authorities should be practically interested in thebusiness concerns of the country which the Department was to serve. Mr.Gerald Balfour himself, in introducing the Local Government Bill, hadshown that he was under no illusion as to the possible disappointment towhich his great democratic experiment might at first give rise. Heanticipated that it would "work through failure to success." To put itplainly, the new bodies might devote a great deal of attention topolitics and very little to business. I am told by those best qualifiedto form an opinion (some of my informants having been, to say the least,sceptical as to the wisdom of the experiment), that notwithstanding someextravagances in particular instances, it can already be statedpositively that local government in Ireland, taken as a whole, has notsuffered in efficiency by the revolution which it has undergone. This isthe opinion of officials of the Local Government Board,[44] and refersmainly to the transaction of the fiscal business of the new localauthorities. From a different point of observation I shall presentlybear witness to a display of administrative capacity on the part of themany statutory committees, appointed by County, Borough, and DistrictCouncils to co-operate with the Department, which is most creditable tothe thought and feeling of the people.It would be quite unfair to a large body of farmers in Ireland if, indescribing the administrative machinery for carrying out an economicpolicy based upon self-help and dependent for its success upon theconciliatory spirit abroad in the country, I were to ignore the partplayed by the large number of co-operative associations, theorganisation, work and multiplication of which have been described in aformer chapter. The Recess Committee, in their enquiries, found that, inthe countries whose competition Ireland feels most keenly, Departmentsof Agriculture had come to recognise it as an axiom of their policy thatwithout organisation for economic purposes amongst the agriculturalclasses, State aid to agriculture must be largely ineffectual, and evenmischievous. Such Departments devote a considerable part of theirefforts to promoting agricultural organisation. Short a time as thisDepartment has been in existence it has had some striking evidence ofthe justice of these views. As will be seen from the First Annual Reportof the Department, it was only where the farmers were organised inproperly representative societies that many of the lessons theDepartment had to teach could effectually reach the farming classes, orthat many of the agricultural experiments intended for their guidancecould be profitably carried out. Although these experiment schemes wereissued to the County Councils and the agricultural public generally, itwas only the farmers organised in societies who were really in aposition to take part in them. Some of these experiments, indeed, couldnot be carried out at all except through such societies.Both for the sake of efficiency in its educational work, and of economyin administration, the Department would be obliged to lay stress on thevalue of organisation.[45] But there are other reasons for its doing so:industrial, moral, and social. In an able critique upon Bodley's_France_ Madame Darmesteter, writing in the _Contemporary Review_, July,1898, points out that even so well informed an observer of French lifeas the author of that remarkable book failed to appreciate the steadyinginfluence exercised upon the French body politic by the network ofvoluntary associations, the _syndicats agricoles_, which are theanalogues and, to some extent, the prototypes, in France of ouragricultural societies in Ireland. The late Mr. Hanbury, during his toobrief career as President of the Board of Agriculture, frequently dweltupon the importance of organising similar associations in England as anecessary step in the development of the new agricultural policy whichhe foreshadowed. His successor, Lord Onslow, has fully endorsed hisviews, and in his speeches is to be found the same appreciation of theexemplary self-reliance of the Irish farmers. I have already referred tothe keen interest which both agricultural reformers and English andWelsh County Councils have been taking in the unexpectedly progressiveefforts of the Irish farmers to reorganise their industry and placethemselves in a position to take advantage of State assistance. Ibelieve that our farmers are going to the root of things, and that dueweight should be given to the silent force of organised self-help bythose who would estimate the degree in which the aims and sanguineanticipations of the new movement in Ireland are likely to be realised.And it is not only for its foundation upon self-reliance that the latestdevelopment of Irish Government will have a living interest foreconomists and students of political philosophy. They will see in thefacts under review a rapid and altogether healthy evolution of the Irishpolicy so honourably associated with the name of Mr. Arthur Balfour. HisChief Secretaryship, when all its storm and stress have been forgotten,will be remembered for the opening up of the desolate, poverty-strickenwestern seaboard by light railways, and for the creation of theCongested Districts Board. The latter institution has gained so wideand, as I think, well merited popularity, that many thought itsextension to other parts of Ireland would have been a simpler and safermethod of procedure than that actually recommended by the RecessCommittee, and adopted by Mr. Gerald Balfour. The Land Act of 1891applied a treatment to the problem of the congested districts--a problemof economic depression and industrial backwardness, differing rather indegree than in kind from the economic problem of the greater part ofrural Ireland--as simple as it was new. A large capital sum of Irishmoneys was handed over to an unpaid commission consisting of Irishmenwho were acquainted with the local circumstances, and who were in aposition to give their services to a public philanthropic purpose. Theywere given the widest discretion in the expenditure of the interest ofthis capital sum, and from time to time their income has been augmentedfrom annually voted moneys. They were restricted only to measurescalculated permanently to improve the condition of the people, asdistinct from measures affording temporary relief.I agree with those who hold that Mr. Arthur Balfour's plan was the bestthat could be adopted at the moment. But events have marched rapidlysince 1891, and wholly new possibilities in the sphere of Irish economiclegislation and administration have been revealed. A new Irish mind hasnow to be taken into account, and to be made part of any ameliorativeIrish policy. Hence it was not only possible, but desirable, toadminister State help more democratically in 1899 than in 1891. Thepolicy of the Congested Districts Board was a notable advance upon theinaction of the State in the pre-famine times, and upon the system ofdoles and somewhat objectless relief works of the latter half of thenineteenth century; but the policy of the new departure now under reviewwas no less notable a departure from the paternalism of the CongestedDistricts Board. When that body was called into existence it was thoughtnecessary to rely on persons nominated by the Government. When theDepartment was created eight years later it was found possible, owing tothe broadening of the basis of local government and to the moral andsocial effect of the new movement, to rely largely on the advice andassistance of persons selected by the people themselves.The two departments are in constant consultation as to the co-ordinationof their work, so as to avoid conflict of administrative system andsociological principle in adjoining districts; and much has already beendone in this direction. My own experience has not only made me a firmbeliever in the principle of self-help, but I carry my belief to theextreme length of holding that the poorer a community is the moreessential is it to throw it as much as possible on its own resources, inorder to develop self-reliance. I recognise, however, the undesirabilityof too sudden changes of system in these matters. Meanwhile, I may addin this connection that the Wyndham Land Act enormously increases theimportance of the Congested Districts Board in regard to its mainfunction--that of dealing directly with congestion, by the purchase andresettlement of estates, the migration of families, and the enlargementof holdings.[46]I have now said enough about the aims and objects, the constitution andpowers, and the relations with other Governmental institutions, of thenew Department, to enable the reader to form a fairly accurate estimateof its general character, scope and purpose. From what it is I shallpass in the next chapter to what it does, and there I must describe itseveryday work in some detail. But I wish I could also give the reader anadequate picture of the surge of activities raised by the first plungeof the Department into Irish life and thought. After a time the torrentof business made channels for itself and went on in a more orderlyfashion; practical ideas and promising openings were sifted out at anearly stage of their approach to the Department from those which wereneither one nor the other; time was economised, work distributed, andthe functions of demand and supply in relation to the Department's workthroughout Ireland were brought into proper adjustment with each other.Yet, even at first, to a sympathetic and understanding view, the wasteof time and thought involved in dealing with impossible projects anddispelling false hopes was compensated for by the evidence forced uponus that the Irish people had no notion of regarding the Department as analien institution with which they need concern themselves but little,however much it might concern itself with them. They were never for amoment in doubt as to its real meaning and purpose. They meant to makeit their own and to utilise it in the uplifting of their country. Nodescription of the machinery of the institution could explain the realplace which it took in the life of the country from the very beginning.But perhaps it may give the reader a more living interest in this partof the story, and a more living picture of the situation, if I try toconvey to his mind some of the impressions left on my own, by myexperiences during the period immediately following the projection ofthis new phenomenon into Irish consciousness.When in Upper Merrion-street, Dublin, opposite to the Land Commission,big brass plates appeared upon the doors of a row of houses announcingthat there was domiciled the Department of Agriculture and TechnicalInstruction, the average man in the street might have been expected tomurmur, 'Another Castle Board,' and pass on. It was not long, however,before our visiting list became somewhat embarrassing. We have since gotdown, as I have said, to a more humdrum, though no less interesting,official life inside the Department. But let the reader imagine himselfto have been concealed behind a screen in my office on a day when someevent, like the Dublin Horse Show, brought crowds in from the country tothe Irish capital. Such an experience would certainly have given him anew understanding of some then neglected men and things. While I wasopening the morning's letters and dealing with "Files" marked "urgent,"he would see nothing to distinguish my day's work from that of otherministers, who act as a link between the permanent officials of aspending Department and the Government of the day. But presently astream of callers would set in, and he would begin to realise that theminister is, in this case, a human link of another kind--a link betweenthe people and the Government. A courteous and discreet PrivateSecretary, having attended to those who have come to the wrongdepartment, and to those who are satisfied with an interview with him orwith the officer who would have to attend to their particular business,brings into my not august presence a procession of all sorts andconditions of men. Some know me personally, some bring letters ofintroduction or want to see me on questions of policy. Others--for thesethe human link is most needed--must see the ultimate source ofresponsibility, which, in Ireland, whether it be head of a family or ofa Department, is reduced from the abstract to the concrete by thepregnant pronoun 'himself.' I cannot reveal confidences, but I may givea few typical instances of, let us say, callers who might have called.First comes a visitor, who turns out to be a 'man with an idea,' justhome from an unpronounceable address in Scandinavia. He has come to tellme that we have in Ireland a perfect gold mine, if we only knew it--inextent never was there such a gold field--no illusory pockets--goodpayable stuff in sight for centuries to come--and so on for fiveprecious minutes, which seem like half a day, during which I haverealised that he is an inventor, and that it is no good asking him tocome to the point. But I keep my eye riveted on his leather bag which isfilled to bursting point, and manifest an intelligent interest andburning curiosity. The suggestion works, and out of the bag come blackbars and balls, samples of fabrics ranging from sack-cloth to finelinen, buttons, combs, papers for packing and for polite correspondence,bottles of queer black fluid, and a host of other miscellaneous wares. Irealise that the particular solution of the Irish Question which isabout to be unfolded is the utilisation of our bogs. Well, this _is_one of the problems with which we have to deal. It is physicallypossible to make almost anything out of this Irish asset, from mosslitter to billiard balls, and though one would not think it, aeons ofenergy have been stored in these inert looking wastes by the apparentlyunsympathetic sun, energy which some think may, before long, beconverted into electricity to work all the smokeless factories which therising generation are to see. Indeed, the vista of possibilities isendless, the only serious problem that remains to be solved being 'howto make it pay,' and upon that aspect of the question, unhappily, myvisitor had no light to throw.The next visitor, who brings with him a son and a daughter, is himselfthe product of an Irish bog in the wildest of the wilds. His ParishPriest had sent him to me. A little awkwardness, which is soondispelled, and the point is reached. This fine specimen of the 'bone andsinew' has had a hard struggle to bring up his 'long family'; but, witha capable wife, who makes the most of the _res angusta domi_--of thepig, the poultry, and even of the butter from the little black cows onthe mountain--he has risen to the extent of his opportunities. Thechildren are all doing something. Lace and crochet come out of thecabin, the yarn from the wool of the 'mountainy' sheep, carded and spunat home, is feeding the latest type of hosiery knitting machine and thehereditary handloom. The story of this man's life which was written tome by the priest cannot find space here. The immediate object of hisvisit is to get his eldest daughter trained as a poultry instructress totake part in some of the 'County Schemes' under the Department, and toobtain for his eldest son, who has distinguished himself under thetuition of the Christian Brothers, a travelling scholarship. For this hehas been recommended by his teachers. They had marked this bright boyout as an ideal agricultural instructor, and if I could give the readerall the particulars of the case it would be a rare illustration of thelatent human resources we mean to develop in the Ireland that is to be.I explain that the young man must pass a qualifying examination, but amglad to be able to admit that the circumstances of his life, which wouldhave to be taken into account in deciding between the qualified, are inhis case of a kind likely to secure favourable consideration.And now enters a sporting friend of mine, a 'practical angler,' whocomes with a very familiar tale of woe. The state of the salmonfisheries is deplorable: if the Department does not fulfil its obviousduties there will not be a salmon in Ireland outside a museum in tenyears more. He has lived for forty-five years on the banks of a salmonriver, and he knows that I don't fish. But this much the conversationreveals: his own knowledge of the subject is confined to the piece ofriver he happens to own, the gossip he hears at his club, and the ideasof the particular poacher he employs as his gillie. His suggested remedyis the abolition of all netting. But I have to tell him that only theday before I had a deputation from the net fishermen in the estuary ofthis very river, whose bitter complaint was that this 'poor man'sindustry' was being destroyed by the mackerel and herring nets round thecoast, and--I thought my friend would have a fit--by the way in whichthe gentlemen on the upper waters neglect their duty of protecting thespawning fish! Some belonging to the lower water interest carried theirscepticism as to the efficacy of artificial propagation to the length ofbelieving that hatcheries are partially responsible for the decrease. Asso often happens, the opposing interests, disagreeing on all else, findthat best of peacemakers, a common enemy, in the Government. TheDepartment is responsible--for two opposite reasons, it is true, butsomehow they seem to confirm each other. We must labour to find someother common ground, starting from the recognition that the salmonfisheries are a national asset which must be made to subserve thegeneral public interest. I assure my friend that when all parties maketheir proper contribution in effort and in cash, the Department will notbe backward in doing their part.At the end of this interview a messenger brings a telegram for 'himself'from a stockowner in a remote district.[47] 'My pigs,' runs one of themost businesslike communications I ever received, 'are all spotted.What shall I do?' I send it to the Veterinary Branch, which, with theBoard of Agriculture in England, is engaged in a scheme for staying theravages of swine fever, a scheme into which the late Mr. Hanbury threwhimself with his characteristic energy. The problem is of immenseimportance, and the difficulty is not mainly quadrupedal. Unless thepolice 'spot' the spotted pigs, we too often hear nothing about them. Iam sure it must be daily brought home to the English Board, as it is tothe Irish Department, that an enormous addition might be made to thewealth of the country if our veterinary officers were intelligently andactively aided, in their difficult duties for the protection of ourflocks and herds, by those most immediately concerned.So far it has been an interesting morning bright with the activities outof which the future is to be made. The element of hope has predominated,but now comes a visitor who wishes to see me upon the one part of myduties and responsibilities which is distasteful to me--the exercise ofpatronage. He has been unloaded upon me by an influential person, uponwhom he has more legitimate claims than upon the Department. He hasprepared the way for a favourable reception by getting his friends towrite to my friends, many of whom have already fulfilled a promise tointerview me in his behalf. His mother and two maiden aunts have writtenletters which have drawn from my poor Private Secretary, who has to readthem all, the dry quotation, 'there's such a thing as being so good asto be good for nothing.' The young hopeful quickly puts an end to myspeculations as to the exact capacity in which he means to serve theDepartment by applying for an inspectorship. I ask him what he proposesto inspect, and the sum and substance of his reply is that he is notparticular, but would not mind beginning at a moderate salary, say L200a year. As for his qualifications, they are a sadly minus quantity, hisblighted career having included failure for the army, and a clerkship ina bank, which only lasted a week when he proved to be deficient in thesecond and dangerous in the third of the three R's. His case reminds meof a story of my ranching days, which the exercise of patronage has sooften recalled to my mind that I must out with it. Riding into camp oneevening, I turned my horse loose and got some supper, which was a vilelycooked meal even for a cow camp. Recognising in the cook a cowboy I hadformerly employed, I said to him, 'You were a way up cow hand, but ascook you are no account. Why did you give up riding and take to cooking?What are your qualifications as a cook any way?' 'Qualifications!' hereplied, 'why, don't you know I've got varicose veins?' My caller'squalifications are of an equally negative description, though not of aphysical kind. He is one of the young Micawbers, to whom the Departmentfrom its first inception has been the something which was to turn up. Hehad, of course, testimonials which in any other country would havecommanded success by their terms and the position of the signatories,but which in Ireland only illustrate the charity with which we condoneour moral cowardice under the name of good nature. I am glad when thisinterview closes.One more type--a Nationalist Member of Parliament! He does not oftendarken the door of a Government office--they all have the samestructural defect, no front stairs--he never has asked and never thoughthe would ask anything from the Government. But he is interested in somepoor fishermen of County Clare who pursue their calling under crueldisadvantages for want of the protection from the Atlantic rollers whicha small breakwater would afford. It is true that they were the worstconstituents he had--- went against him in 'The Split,'--but if I sawhow they lived, and so on. I knew all about the case. A breakwater to beof any use would cost a very large sum, and the local authority, thoughsympathetic, did not see their way to contribute their proportion, andwithout a local contribution, I explained, the Department could not,consistently with its principles, unless in most exceptional--Here hebreaks in: 'Oh! that red tape. You're as bad as the rest--exceptional,indeed! Why, everything is exceptional in my constituency. I am a bitthat way myself. But, seriously, the condition of these poor peoplewould move even a Government official. Besides, you remember the night Imade thirteen speeches on the Naval Estimates--the Government wanted alittle matter of twenty millions--and you met me in the Lobby and toldme you wished to go to bed, and asked me what I really wanted, and--Iam always reasonable--I said I would pass the whole Naval Programme if Igot the Government to give them a boat-slip at Ballyduck.--"Done!" yousaid, and we both went home.--I believe you knew that I had gotconstituency matters mixed up, that Ballyduck was inland, and that itwas Ballycrow that I meant to say.--But you won't deny that you areunder a moral obligation.'Well, I would go into the matter again very carefully--for I thought wemight help these fishermen in some other way--and write to him. Heleaves me; and, while outside the door he travels over the main pointswith my Private Secretary, the lights and shades in the picture whichthis strange personality has left on my mind throw me back behind thepractical things of to-day. In Parliament facing the Sassanach, inIreland facing their police, he has for years--the best years of hislife--displayed the same love of fighting for fighting's sake. In theriots he has provoked, and they are not a few, he is ever regardless ofhis own skin, and would be truly miserable if he inflicted any seriousbodily harm on a human being--even a landlord. It is impossible not tolike this very human anachronism, who, within the limitations imposed bythe convenience of a citizenship to which he unwillingly belongs, doesbattle    For Faith, and Fame, and Honour, and the ruined hearths of Clare.The reader may take all this as fiction. I am sure no one will annoy meby trying on any of the caps I have displayed on the counter of myshop. What I do fear is that the picture of some of my duties which Ihave given may have made a wrong impression of the Department's workupon the reader's mind. He may have come to the conclusion that,contrary to all the principles laid down, an attempt was being made todo for the people things which the new movement was to induce the peopleto do for themselves. The Department may appear to be using its officialposition and Government funds to constitute itself a sort of UniversalProvidence, exercising an authority and a discretion over matters uponwhich in any progressive community the people must decide forthemselves. However near to the appearances such an impression might be,nothing could be further from the facts. If I have helped the reader tounravel the tangled skein of our national life, if I have sufficientlyrevealed the mind of the new movement to show that there is in it 'ascheme of things entire,' it should be quite clear that the deliberateintentions both of Mr. Gerald Balfour and of those Irishmen whom he tookinto his confidence are being fulfilled in letter and in spirit. It onlyremains for me to attempt an adequate description of the work of theDepartment created by that Chief Secretary, and, above all, of the wayin which the people themselves are playing the part which hisstatesmanship assigned to them.FOOTNOTES:[44] See Report of the Local Government Board, 1901-2.[45] See Annual General Report of the Department 1900-1901, pp. 25-27.[46] _Cf. ante_, pp. 46-49.[47] No fiction about this, nor about the following letter to theSecretary:--'The Scratatory, Vitny Dept.'Honord Sir,'I want to let ye know the terible state we're in now. Al the pigs abouthere is dyin in showers. Send down a Vit at oncet.'CHAPTER X.GOVERNMENT WITH THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.In the preceding chapter I attempted to give to the reader a roughimpression of the general purpose and miscellaneous functions of the newDepartment. I described in some detail the constitution and powers ofthe Council of Agriculture--a sort of Business Parliament--whichcriticises our doings and elects representatives on our Boards; and ofthe two Boards which, in addition to their advisory functions, possessthe power of the purse. I laid special stress upon the important partthese instruments of the popular will were intended to play as a linkbetween the people and the Department. I gave a similar description andexplanation of the Committees of Agriculture and Technical Instruction,appointed by local representative bodies, by means of which the peoplewere brought into touch with the local as distinct from the centralwork, and made responsible for its success. The details were necessarilydull; and so also must be those which will now be required in order toindicate the general nature and scope of the work for the accomplishmentof which all this machinery was designed. Yet I am not without hopethat even the general reader may find a deep human interest in thepractical endeavour of the humbler classes of my fellow-countrymen toreconstruct their national life upon the solid foundation of honestwork.The Department has at the time of writing been in existence for threeyears, the term of office, it will be remembered, of the Council ofAgriculture and of the two Boards. It would be unreasonable to expect inso short a time any great achievement; but the understanding critic willattach importance rather to the spirit in which the work was approachedthan to the actual amount of work which was accomplished. He may saythat no true estimate of its value can be formed until the enthusiasmaroused by its novelty has had time to wear off. Those of us who knowthe real character of the work are quite satisfied that the interestwhich it aroused during the period in which the people had yet to graspits meaning and utility is not likely to become less real as the blossomfades and the fruit begins to swell. The attitude of the Irish peopletowards the Department and its work has not been that of a child towardsa new toy, but of a full-grown man towards a piece of his life's work,upon which he feels that he entered all too late. Indeed, so quicklyhave the people grasped the significance of the new opportunities formaterial advancement now placed within their reach, that the Departmenthas had to carry out, and to assist the statutory local committees incarrying out, a number and variety of schemes which, at any rate, provedthat public opinion did not regard it as a transitory experiment; butas a much-needed institution which, if properly utilised, might do muchto make up for lost time, and which, in any case, had come to stay. Theamount of the work which we were thus constrained to undertake wassomewhat embarrassing; but so general and so genuine was the desire tomake a start that we have done our best to keep pace with the localdemands for immediate action. The staff of the Department caught thespirit in which the task had been set by the country, and showed a keenanxiety to get to work; and I am glad to have an opportunity ofacknowledging that both the indoor and outdoor support it has receivedleaves the Department without excuse if it has not already justified itsexistence.I shall deal as mercifully as I can with my readers in helping themtowards an understanding of what has been actually done in the threeyears under review. I am aware that if I were to attempt a descriptionof all the schemes which the variety of local needs suggested, and inthe execution of which the assistance of the many-sided Department wassought and obtained, I should lose the patient readers, who have notalready fainted by the way, in a jungle where they could not see thewood for the trees. These things can be studied by thoseinterested,--and they I hope, in Ireland at any rate, are not few--inthe Annual Reports and other official publications of the Department.For the general reader I must try to indicate in broad outline thenature and scope of that side of the new movement which seeks tosupplement organised self-help and open the way for individualenterprise by a well considered measure of State assistance. I shall bemore than satisfied if I succeed in giving him a clear insight into themanner in which the delicate task of making State interference with thebusiness of the people not only harmless but beneficial has been setabout. It is obvious that the fulfilment of this object must depend uponthe soundness of the economic policy pursued, and upon the establishmentand maintenance of mutual confidence between the central authority andthe popular representative bodies through which the people utilise thenew facilities afforded by the State.I think the best way of giving the information which is required for anunderstanding of our somewhat complicated scheme for agricultural andindustrial development under democratic control is first to explain theline of demarcation which we have drawn between the respective functionsof the Department and the people's committees throughout the country;and then I must give a rapid description of some of the most importantfeatures of the Department's policy and programme. I shall add asufficiency of detail from the actual work accomplished in theseorganising and experimental years, to illustrate both the difficultieswhich are incidental to such a policy, and the manner in which thesedifficulties may be surmounted.When it became manifest that both the country and the Department wereanxious to drive ahead, the first thing to do was to lay down a _modusoperandi_ which would assign to the local and central bodies theirproper shares in the work and responsibilities and secure some degree oforder and uniformity in administration. This was quickly done, and theplan adopted works smoothly. The Department gives the local committeegeneral information as to the kind of purpose to which it can legallyand properly apply the funds jointly contributed from the rates and thecentral exchequer. The committee, after full consideration of theconditions, needs and industrial environment of the community for whichit acts, selects certain definite projects which it considers mostapplicable to its district, allocates the amount required to eachproject, and sends the scheme to the Department for its approval. Whenthe scheme is formally approved, it becomes the official scheme in thelocality for the current year; and the local committee has to carry itout.Although harmony now usually exists between the local and centralauthorities to the advantage and comfort of both, a considerable amountof friction was inevitable until they got to understand each other. Theoccasional over-riding of local desires by the 'autocratic' Department,which in the first rush of its work had to act in a somewhat peremptoryfashion, was, no doubt, irritating. Now, however, it is generallyrecognised that the central body, having not only the advice of itsexperts and access to information from similar Departments in othercountries to guide it, but also being in a position to profit by theexchange of ideas which is constantly going on between it and all thelocal committees in Ireland, is in a position of special advantage fordeciding as to the bearing of local schemes upon national interests, andsometimes even as to their soundness from a purely local point of view.Passing now from the conditions under which the Department's work isdone, we come to review some typical portions of the work itself so faras it has proceeded. This falls naturally, both as regards that which isdone by the central authority for the country at large and that which islocally administered, into two divisions. The first consists of directaid to agriculture and other rural industries, and to sea and inlandfisheries. The second consists of indirect aid given to these objects,and also to town manufactures and commerce, through education--a termwhich must be interpreted in its widest sense. Needless to say, directaids, being tangible and immediately beneficial, are the more popular: abull, a boat, or a hand-loom is more readily appreciated than a lecture,a leaflet, or an idea. Yet in the Department we all realise--and, whatis more important, the people are coming to realise--that by far themost important work we have to do is that which belongs to the sphere ofeducation, especially education which has a distinctly practical aim. Tothis branch of the subject I shall, therefore, first direct the reader'sattention.It must be remembered that, for reasons fully set out in the earlierportions of the book, I am treating the Irish Question as being, in itsmost important economic and social aspects, the problem of rural life.The Department's scheme of technical instruction, therefore, need nothere be detailed in its application to the needs of our fewmanufacturing towns, but only in its application to agriculture and thesubsidiary industries. I do not suggest that the questions relating tothe revival of industry in our large manufacturing centres andprovincial towns are not of the first importance. The local authoritiesin these places have eagerly come into the movement, and the Departmenthas already taken part in founding, in our cities and larger towns,comprehensive schemes of technical education, as to the outcome of whichwe have every reason to be hopeful. Not only that, but it is highlynecessary for the Department to consider these schemes in close relationto its work upon the more specially rural problems, for, as I have saidelsewhere,[48] the interdependence of town and country, and theestablishment of proper relations between their systems of industry andeducation, is a prime factor in Irish prosperity. But the rural problem,as I have so often reiterated, is the core of the Irish Question; and todeal at all adequately with technical education, so far as we carry iton upon lines common both to Great Britain and Ireland, would lead ustoo far afield on the present occasion. I must, therefore, contentmyself with indicating my reasons for leaving it rather on one side, andpass on to a brief description of the Department's educational work inrespect of its two-fold aim of developing agriculture and the subsidiaryindustries.In the case of agriculture our task is perfectly plain. We know prettywell what we want to do, for we are dealing with an existing industry,and with known conditions. The productivity of the soil, the demand ofthe market, the means of transport from the one to the other, are alleasily ascertainable. What most needs to be provided in Ireland is amuch higher technical skill, a more advanced scientific and commercialknowledge, as applied to agricultural production and distribution.[49]This, in our belief, depends, more than upon any other agency, upon thesoundness of the education which is provided to develop the capacitiesof those in charge of these operations. Our chief difficulty is that ofco-ordinating our teaching of technical agriculture with the generaleducational systems of the country--a difficulty which the othereducational authorities are all united with us in seeking to remove.When, on the other hand, education--again, I believe, the chief agencyfor the purpose--is considered as a means for the creation of newindustries, we come face to face with a wholly different problem. Wehave no longer an industry which we are seeking to foster and developgoing on under our eyes, steadying us in our theorising, and in ourexperimenting upon the mind of the worker, by bringing us into closetouch with the actual conditions of his work. Our chief aim must be todevelop his adaptability for the ever-changing and, we hope, improvingeconomic industrial conditions amidst which he will have to work. Butunless we can satisfy parents that the schemes of development in whichtheir children are being educated to take their place have an assuredprospect of practical realisation, they will naturally prefer aninferior teaching which seems to them to offer a better prospect of animmediate wage or salary. The teachers in the secondary schools of thecountry, who, so far, have shown a desire to assist us in giving anindustrial and commercial direction to our educational policy, wouldalso in that event have to meet the wishes of the parents; and thuseducation would fall back into the old rut with its cramming, itsexaminations and result fees--all leading to the multiplication ofclerks and professional men, and preventing us from turning the thoughtsand energies of the people towards productive occupations.The natural trend of our educational policy will now be clear. Leavingout of account large towns, where our problem is, as I have said, thesame as that which confronts the industrial classes in the manufacturingcentres of Great Britain, we are chiefly concerned with the applicationof science to the cultivation of the soil and the improvement of livestock, and of business principles to the commercial side of farming;with the teaching of dairying, horticulture, apiculture, and what hasbeen called farm-yard lore, outside the rural home, and with domesticeconomy inside. On the industrial as distinct from the agricultural sideof the work in rural localities, technical instruction must be directedtowards the development of subsidiary rural industries.We early came to the conclusion that we could not expect to find asystem which we could simply transplant from some other country. Thesystem adopted in Great Britain, where each county or group of countiesmaintains an agricultural college and an experimental farm, and manymore elaborate systems on the continent, were all found on examinationto be inapplicable to our own rural conditions, unsuitable to thenational character, and unrelated to the history of our agriculture.Many of these schemes might have turned out a few highly qualifiedauthorities on the theory of agriculture, and even good practicaldirectors for those who farm on a large scale. But we are dealing with acountry with great possibilities from an agricultural point of view, butwhere, nevertheless, agriculture in many parts is in a very backwardcondition, and where it is probably safe to say that three-fifths of thefarms are crowded on one-fourth of the land. We are dealing with acommunity with whom the systems of elementary, secondary and highereducation have not tended to prepare the student for agriculturalpursuits. A system of agricultural and domestic education suited to thewants of those who are to farm the land must recognise and foster thenew spirit of self-help and hope which is springing up in the country,and must be made so interesting as to become a serious rival to the racemeeting and the public-house. The daily drudgery of farm work must becounteracted by the ambition to possess the best stock, the neatesthomestead and fences, the cleanest and the best tilled fields. Theunsolved problem of agricultural education is to devise a system whichwill reach down to the small working farmers who form the great bulk ofthe wealth producers of Ireland, to give them new hope, a new interest,new knowledge and, I might add, a new industrial character.We were met at the outset by the difficulty which would apply to anysystem--that of finding trained teachers. This deficiency was felt intwo directions--first, in the secondary school, in which the preliminaryscientific studies should be undertaken, which are necessary to enable alad to profit by more advanced instruction later on; and, secondly, inthe special training of technical agriculture. It would not have beendesirable to overcome these difficulties by any very extensiveimportation of teachers from without. I certainly hold the occasionalimportation of teachers with outside experience to be most desirable,but these should not form more than a leaven of the pedagogic lump; forit is a serious hindrance when to the task of familiarising studentswith a new system of education there is added that of familiarising alarge body of teachers with the intellectual, social and economicconditions of the people among whom they are to work.The manner in which the teacher difficulty was surmounted may be brieflystated, first, as regards the school, and, secondly, as regards theteaching of agriculture. Those already engaged in the teachingprofession could not be relegated again to the _status pupillaris_.There was only one way in which they could assist us to overcome thedifficulty, and that involved a great sacrifice on their part, thesacrifice of their well-earned vacation, but a sacrifice which theywillingly made. The teachers most urgently needed were those ofpractical science, with knowledge of experimental work; and about fivehundred teachers from secondary schools, in order to qualify themselves,have attended summer courses specially organised by the Department atseveral centres in Ireland, while about four hundred have availedthemselves of special summer courses in such subjects as drawing, manualinstruction, domestic economy, building construction, wood-carving andmodelling.For the provision of a future supply of thoroughly trained teachers ofscience and of technology, including agriculture, the Royal College ofScience has been re-organised. Although this institution was broughtunder the new conditions little more than three years ago, it will beseen that no time has been lost when I state that the first batch of menwho have received a three years' course of training under the newprogramme are already at work under County Committees. For the trainingof these teachers, scholarships had to be provided, and new professorsand teachers, particularly in agriculture, had to be appointed.In regard to agricultural instruction we had to begin by carefullyconsidering what, among many alternative plans, should be our immediateas well as our more remote aims. The Department's officers had studiedContinental systems, and some of them had taken part in establishingsystems of agricultural education in Great Britain. But it was not untilthe summer of 1901 that we had sufficiently studied the question inIreland itself, with direct reference to the history, the environment,and the ideals of the people, to justify us in initiating a policy orformulating a definite programme for its execution.[50] The main objectwas to secure for the youth of the present generation who will later beconcerned with agriculture, sound and thorough instruction in itsprinciples and practice. Everyone who has given any thought to thesubject knows how difficult it is to teach technical agriculture unlessprovision has been made in the general education of the country forinstruction in those fundamental principles of science which, recognisedor unrecognised, lie at the root of, and profoundly influenceagricultural practice. This foundation, as I have shown, is now beinglaid in Ireland. In our scheme the boy who has managed to avail himselfof a two or three years' course of practical science in one of thesecondary schools is then prepared to take full advantage of courses oftechnology, and will have to make up his mind as to the career he is tofollow. We are now considering the case of a boy who is going to becomea farmer, the class to which we chiefly look for the future well-beingof Ireland. It is necessary that he should be taught the practical aswell as the technical side of agriculture. The practical work he canlearn upon his father's farm during spring and summer, and the technicalby continuing his studies during the winter months in a school ofagriculture. The establishment of such winter schools is incontemplation. But, in the meanwhile, to bring home to farmers theadvantages of a first-class agricultural education for their sons, andat the same time to teach these farmers the more practical applicationof science to agriculture, the Department decided on a preliminaryperiod of Itinerant Instruction.The teacher difficulty, experienced on all sides of our work, wasprobably felt more acutely in regard to the specialised teachers ofagriculture than in any other connection. Here it was necessary to takethe young men brought up upon farms and possessed of the normalqualifications of the Irish practical farmer. We then had to make theminto teachers by adding to their inherited and home-manufacturedcapacities a scientific training. In the training of agriculturalteachers the Albert Institute, Glasnevin, has been utilised by theDepartment. This school has also been re-organised to meet the newprogramme, and it will probably form in future a link between the winterschools of agriculture and the Royal College of Science in the trainingof our agricultural teachers.Partly by these methods, partly by the temporary engagement of lecturerson special subjects, and partly by the appointment of trained teachersfrom England or Scotland, the system of itinerant instruction has beenbrought into operation as fully as could be expected in the time.Already half the County Committees have been provided with Countyinstructors, while the remainder have nearly all drafted schemes andallocated funds for a similar purpose, ready to go to work as soon asmore teachers have been trained.The Itinerant Instruction scheme, it may be pointed out, besides oneobvious, has another less immediately recognisable purpose. The directbusiness of the itinerant instructor is, by the aid of experimentalplots, simple lectures, and demonstrations, to teach the farmers of hisdistrict as much as they can take in without the scientific preparationin which, as adults who have grown up under the old system of education,they are still lacking. But he does more than that. He not only conductsa school for adults, but in the very process of instruction henecessarily makes them aware of the vital necessity of a school for theyoung; and they begin, as parents, to understand and to desire the kindof instruction in the schools of the country which will prepare theirchildren to take more advantage of the advanced teaching in agriculturethan they themselves can ever hope to do.This preparation is provided for as follows. To the Department, as hasalready been explained, was handed over the administration of theScience and Art Grants formerly administered by South Kensington. TheDepartment accordingly drew up a programme of experimental science anddrawing, carrying capitation grants, for day secondary schools. TheIntermediate Education Board, acting on the suggestion of theConsultative Committee for Co-ordinating Education,[51] adopted thisprogramme and at the same time undertook to accept the reports of theDepartment's inspectors as the basis of their awards in the new"subject." These steps insured the rapid and general introduction ofthis practical teaching in secondary schools, and, owing particularly tothe spirit in which their authorities and teaching staffs accepted theinnovation, the work has been carried out with the happiest results.I now come to the subjects grouped together under the classification of'domestic economy.' These differ only in detail in their application totown and country. To these subjects the Department attaches greatimportance. In the industrial life of manufacturing towns I am persuadedthat far too little thought has been given to this element of industrialefficiency. From a purely economic point of view a saving in theworker's income due to superior housewifery is equivalent to an increasein his earnings; but, morally, the superior thrift is, of course,immensely more important. "Without economy," says Dr. Johnson, "none canbe rich, and with it few can be poor," and the education which onlyincreases the productiveness of labour and neglects the principles ofwise spending will place us at a disadvantage in the great industrialstruggle. When we come to consider domestic economy as an agency forimproving the conditions of the peasant home, not only by thrift, but byincreasing the general attractiveness of home life, the introduction ofa sound system of domestic economy teaching becomes not only important,but vital.The establishment of such a system and the task of making it operativeand effective in the country is beset with difficulties. The teacherdifficulty confronts us again, and also that of making pupils and theirparents understand that there are other objects in domestic trainingthan that of qualifying for domestic service. A corps of instructressesin domestic economy is, however, already abroad throughout the country,nearly all the County Councils having already appointed them. Some ofthese teachers, who have made the best contributions towards the as yetonly partially determined question of the ultimate aim and presentpossibilities of a course of instruction in hygiene, laundry work,cookery, the management of children, sewing, and so forth, have told methat the demand in rural districts seems to be chiefly for the class ofinstruction which may lead to success in town life. I have heard of aclass of girls in a Connaught village who would not be content withknowing the accomplishments of a farmer's wife until they had learnedhow to make asparagus soup and cook sweetbreads. No doubt they had readof the way things are done in the kitchens of the great. This tendencyshould never be encouraged, but neither can it always be inflexiblyrepressed without endangering the main objects of the class.Women teachers of poultry-keeping, dairying, domestic science andkindred subjects are trained at the Munster Institute, Cork, and theSchool of Domestic Economy, Kildare Street, Dublin, both of which havebeen equipped to meet the needs of the new programme. The want ofteachers, and not any lack of interest on the part of the country, hasalone prevented all the counties from adopting schemes for encouragingimprovement in all these branches of work. I may add that more than onehundred and fifty of these qualified teachers are now at work underCounty Committees.I have already, in this chapter, indicated that outside large industrialcentres, our educational policy is, broadly speaking, twofold. We seek,in the first place, through our programme in Experimental Science andits allied subjects, now so generally adopted by secondary schools inIreland, to give that fundamental training in science and scientificmethod which, most thinkers are agreed, constitutes a conditionprecedent to sound specialised teaching of agriculture as well as otherforms of industry. We seek further, by methods less academic incharacter--for example, by itinerant instruction which is of valuechiefly to those with whom 'school' is a thing of the past--to teach notonly improved agricultural methods but also simple industries, and topromote the cultivation of industrial habits which are as essential tothe success of farming as to that of every other occupation. Classes inmanual work of various kinds--woodwork, carpentry, applied drawing andbuilding construction, lace and crochet making, needlework, dressmakingand embroidery, sprigging, hosiery and other such subjects, have beennumerously and steadily attended.I do not ignore the argument that such home industries must in time giveway before the competition of highly-organised factory industries. Thesimple answer is that it is desirable, and indeed necessary, to employthe energy now running to waste in our rural districts--energy whichcannot in the nature of things be employed in highly-organisedindustries. To the small farmer and his family, time is a realisable,though too often unrealised, asset, and it is part of our aim to aid thefamily income by employing their waste time. Even if we can only causethem to do at home what they now pay someone else to do, we shall notonly have improved their budget but shall have contributed to theelevation of the standard of home life, and thus, in no small measure,to the solution of the difficult problem of rural life in Ireland.I think the reader will now understand the general character of theproblem with which we were confronted and the means by which itssolution is being sought. Our policy was not one which was likely tocommend itself to the "man in the street." Indeed, to be quite candid,it was a little disappointing even to myself that I could notimmortalise my appointment by erecting monuments both to my constructiveability and to my educational zeal in the shape of stately edifices atconvenient railway centres, preferably along the tourist routes. We havehad to stand the fire of the critic fresh from his holiday on theContinent where he had seen agricultural and technological institutions,magnificently housed and lavishly equipped, fitting generations of youngmen and young women for competition with our less fortunate countrymen.It is hard to prevail in argument against the man who has gone and seenfor himself. It is useless to point out to the man with a kodak that theCorinthian facade and the marble columns of the _aula maxima_ whicharoused his patriotic envy are but a small part of the educationalstructure which he saw and thought he understood. If he would read thehistory of the systems and trace the successive stages by which the needfor these great institutions was established, he would have a littlemore sympathy with the difficulties of the Department, a little morepatience with its Fabian policy.I must not, however, utter a word which suggests that the Department hasany ground of complaint against the country for the spirit in which ithas been met; especially as there was one factor to be taken intoaccount which made it difficult for public opinion to approve of ourpolicy. As I have already explained, a large capital sum of a littleover L200,000 was handed over to the Department at its creation. Duringthe first year, what with the organisation of the staff, the thinkingout of a policy on every side of the Department's work, the constitutionof the statutory committees to administer its local schemes in town andcountry, the agreement, after long discussion, between the central bodyand these committees upon the local schemes, and all the otherpreparatory steps which had to be taken before money could wisely beapplied, it is obvious that the Department could not have spent itsincome. In the second year, and even the third year, savings wereeffected, and the original capital sum has been largely increased. Whatmore natural than that in a poor country a spending Department which wasbackward in spending should appear to be lacking in enterprise, if notin administrative capacity? But whether the policy was right or wrong ithas unquestionably been approved by the best thought in the country, afact which throws a very interesting light upon the constitutionalaspects of the Department. At each successive stage the policy wasdiscussed at the Council of Agriculture and its practical operation wasdependent upon the consent of the Boards which have the power of thepurse. A Vice-President who had not these bodies at his back would bepowerless, in fact would have to resign. Thoughtless criticism has nowand again condemned not only the parsimonious action of the Department,but the invertebrate conduct of the Council of Agriculture and theBoards in tolerating it. The time will soon come when the servicerendered to their country by the members of the first Council andBoards, who gave their representative backing to a slow but sureeducational policy, and scorned to seek popularity in showy projects andlocal doles, will be gratefully remembered to them.Already we have had some gratifying evidences that the country is withus in the paramount importance we attach to education as the real needof the hour. Most readers will be surprised to hear that in the shorttime the Department has been at work it has aided in the equipment ofnearly two hundred science laboratories and of about fifty manualinstruction workshops, while the many-sided programme involved in themovement as a whole is in operation in some four hundred schoolsattended by thirty-six thousand pupils.Nothing can be more gratifying than the unanimous testimony of theofficers of the Department to the increasing practical intelligence andreasonableness of the numerous Committees responsible for the localadministration of the schemes which the Department has to approve of andsupervise. The demand for visible money's worth has largely given placeto a genuine desire for schemes having a practical educational value forthe industry of the district. County Clare is not generally consideredthe most advanced part of Ireland, nor can Kilrush be very far distantfrom 'the back of Godspeed'; yet even from that storm-battered outpostof Irish ideas I was memorialised a year ago to induce the CountyCouncil to pay less attention to the improvement of cattle and more tothe technical education of the peasantry.Under the heading of direct aids to agriculture, rural industries, andsea and inland fisheries, there is much important and useful work whichthe Department has set in motion, partly by the use of its funds andpartly by suggestion and the organisation of local effort. The mostobvious, popular and easily understood schemes were those directed tothe improvement of live stock. The Department exercised its supervisionand control with the help of advisory committees composed of the bestexperts it could get to volunteer advice upon the various classes oflive stock. It is unnecessary to give any details of these schemes. TheDepartment profited by the experience of, and received considerableassistance from the Royal Dublin Society, which had for many yearsadministered a Government grant for the improvement of horses andcattle. The broad principle adopted by the Department was that itsefforts and its available resources should be devoted rather toimproving the quality, than to increasing the quantity, of the stock inthe country, the latter function being regarded as belonging to theregion of private enterprise.It is impossible to over-estimate the importance to the country ofhaving a widespread interest aroused and discussion stimulated onproblems of breeding which affect a trade of vast importance to theeconomic standing of the country--a trade which now reaches in hornedcattle alone an annual export of nearly three quarters of a millionanimals. All manner of practical discussions were set on foot, rangingfrom the production of the ideal, the general purposes cow, to thatcontroversy which competes, in the virulence with which it is waged,with the political, the educational, and the fiscal questions--thequestion whether the hackney strain will bring a new era of prosperityto Ireland, or whether it will irretrievably destroy the reputation ofthe Irish hunter. The discussion of these problems has been accompaniedby much practical work which, in due time, cannot fail to produce aconsiderable improvement upon the breed of different classes of livestock. In one year over one thousand sires have been selected by theexperts of the Department for admission to the stock improvementschemes. Probably an equal number of breeding animals offered forinspection have been rejected. Many a _cause celebre_ has notunnaturally arisen over the decisions of the equestrian tribunal, andthere have not been wanting threats that the attention of Parliamentshould be called to the gross partiality of the Department which hascast a reflection upon the form of stallion A or upon the constitutionalsoundness of stallion B. On the whole, as far as I can gather, the bestauthorities in the country are agreed that since the Department hasbeen at work there has been established a higher standard of excellencein the bucolic mind as regards that vastly important national asset, ourflocks and herds.Again for details I must refer the reader to official documents. Therehe will find as much information as he can digest about the vast varietyof agricultural activities which originate sometimes with theDepartment's officers or with its _Journal_ and leaflets, thecirculation of which has no longer to be stimulated from our Statisticsand Intelligence bureau, and sometimes emanate from the localcommittees, whose growing interest in the work naturally leads to thediscovery of fresh needs and hitherto unthought of possibilities ofagricultural and industrial improvement. I may, however, indicate a fewof the subjects which have been gone into even in these years while thenew Department has been trying so far as it might, without sacrifice ofefficiency and sound economic principle, to keep pace with the feverishanxiety of a genuinely interested people to get to work upon schemeswhich they believe to be practical, sound, and of permanent utility.A question which has troubled administrators of State aid to everyprogressive agricultural community, and which each country must settlefor itself, is by what form of object lesson in ordinary agricultureintelligent local interest can best be aroused We have advocated widelydiffused small experimental plots, and they have done much good.Probably the most useful of our crop improvement schemes have beenthose which have demonstrated the profitableness of artificial manures,the use of which has been enormously increased. The profits derivable inmany parts of Ireland from the cultivation of early potatoes has beendemonstrated in the most convincing manner. To what may be called theindustrial crops, notably flax and barley, a great deal of time andthought has been applied and much information disseminated andillustrated by practical experiments. In many quarters interest has beenaroused in the possibilities of profitable tobacco culture. Manynegative and some positive results have been attained by the Departmentin the as yet incomplete experiments upon this crop. Much has beenlearned about the functions of central and local agricultural and smallindustry shows, those occasional aids to the year's work whichdisseminate knowledge and stimulate interest and friendly rivalry amongthe different producers. The reduction in the death-rate among youngstock, due to preventible causes such as white scour and blackleg, iswell worthy of the attention of those who wish to study the morepractical work of the Department.The branch of the Department's work which deals with the Sea-fisheriescan only be very briefly touched on. It falls into two main heads whichmay roughly be termed the administrative and the scientific; the latter,of course, having economic developments as its ultimate object. Theissue of loans to fishermen for the purchase of boats and gear,contributing to the cost of fishery slips and piers, circulatingtelegraphic intelligence, the making of by-laws for the regulation ofthe fisheries, the patrolling of the Irish fishing grounds to preventillegalities, and the attempts which are being made to develop thevaluable Irish oyster fishery by the introduction, with modificationssuited to our own seaboard, of a system of culture comparable to thosewhich are pursued with success in France and Norway, may be mentioned asfalling under the more directly economic branch of our activities. Irishoysters are already attaining considerable celebrity, owing to thedistance of our oyster beds from contaminating influences; and it ishoped that when the Department's experiments are complete the Irishoyster will be made subject to direct control for all its life, until itis despatched to market. Attention is also being given to the relativevalue of seed oysters, other than native, for relaying on Irish beds.On the more directly scientific side, the Department has undertaken thesurvey of the trawling grounds around the coast to obtain an exactknowledge of the movements of the marketable fish at different times oftheir life, so that we may be guided in making by-laws and regulationsby a full knowledge of the times and places at which protection isnecessary. The biological and physical conditions of the western seasare also being studied in special reference to the mackerel fishery,with the object of correlating certain readily observable phenomena withthe movements of the fish, and so of predicting the probable success ofa fishery in a particular season. The routine observations of theDepartment's fishery cruiser have been so arranged as to synchronisewith those of other nations, in order to assist the international schemeof investigation now in progress, wherever its objects and those of theDepartment are the same. While these various practical projects havebeen in operation, we have done our best to keep abreast of the times bysending missions to other countries, consisting of an expert accompaniedby practical Irishmen who would bring home information which wasapplicable to the conditions of our own country. The first batch ofitinerant instructors in agriculture, whose training for the importantwork of laying the foundations for our whole scheme of agriculturalinstruction I have referred to, were taken on a continental tour by theProfessor of Agriculture at the Royal College of Science, in order togive special advantages to a portion of our outdoor staff upon thesuccess of whose work the rate of our progress in agriculturaldevelopment might largely depend. And not only have we in our firstthree years gleaned as much information as possible by sending qualifiedIrishmen to study abroad the industries in which we were particularlyinterested, but we also took steps to give the mass of our people athome an opportunity of studying these industries for themselves. Withthe somewhat unique experiment carried out for this object, I willconclude the story of the new Department's activities in its earlyyears.The part we took at the Cork Exhibition of 1902 was well understood inIreland, but not perhaps elsewhere. We secured a large space both in themain Industrial Hall and in the grounds, and gave an illustration not ofwhat Ireland had done, but of what, in our opinion, the country mightachieve in the way of agricultural and industrial development in thenear future. Exhibiting on the one hand our available resources in theway of raw material, we gave, on the other hand, demonstrations of alarge number of industries in actual operation. These exhibits, importedwith their workers, machinery and tools, from several European countriesand from Great Britain, all belonged to some class of industry which, inour belief, was capable of successful development in Ireland. In theindoor part of the exhibit there was nothing very original, exceptperhaps in its close relation to the work of a government department.But what attracted by far the greatest interest and attention was aseries of object lessons in many phases of farm activities, where, inour opinion, great and immediate improvements might be made. Here wereto be seen varieties of crops under various systems of treatment,demonstrations of sheep-dipping, calf-rearing on different foods,illustrations of the different breeds of fowl and systems of poultrymanagement, model buildings and gardens for farmer and labourer; whilein separate buildings the drying and pressing of fruit and vegetables,the manufacture of butter and cheese, and a very comprehensive forestryexhibit enabled our visitors to combine profitable suggestion with, if Imay judge from my frequent opportunities of observing the sightseers inwhom I was particularly interested, the keenest enjoyment.We kept at the Exhibition, for six months, a staff of competent experts,whose instructions were to give to all-comers this simple lesson. Theywere to bring home to our people that, here in Ireland before their veryeyes, there were industries being carried on by foreigners, byEnglishmen, by Scotchmen, and in some instances by Irishmen, but in allcases by men and women who had no advantage over our workers except thatthey had the technical training which it was the desire of theDepartment to give to the workers of Ireland. The officials of theDepartment entered into the spirit of this scheme enthusiastically andcheerfully, some of them, in addition to their ordinary work, turningthe office into a tourist agency for these busy months. With thegenerous help of the railway companies they organised parties offarmers, artisans, school teachers, members of the statutory committees,and, in fact, of all to whom it was of importance to give this objectlesson upon the relations between practical education and the promotionof industry. Nearly 100,000 persons were thus moved to Cork and backbefore the Exhibition closed--an achievement largely due to theassistance given by the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society and theclergy throughout the country.This experiment, both in its conception and in its results, was perhapsunique. There were not wanting critics of the new Department who stoodaghast at so large an expenditure upon temporary edifices and a passingshow; but those who are in touch with its educational work know thatthis novel application of State assistance fulfilled its purpose. Ithelped substantially to generate a belief in, and stimulate a demandfor, technical instruction which it will take us many years adequatelyto supply.An American visitor who, as I afterwards learned, takes an active partin the discussion of the rural problems of his own country, disembarkedat Queenstown in order to 'take in' the Cork Exhibition. In his rushthrough Dublin he 'took in' the Department and the writer. 'Mr.Vice-President,' he said, before the hand-shaking was completed, 'I havevisited all the great Expositions held in my time. I have been to theCork Exposition. I often saw more things, but never more ideas.'With this characteristically rapid appreciation of a movement whichseeks to turn Irish thought to action, my strange visitor vanished assuddenly as he came.       *       *       *       *       *Those whose sympathy with Ireland has induced them to persevere throughthe mass of details with which this story of small beginnings is piecedtogether may wonder why the bearing of hopeful efforts for bringingprosperity and contentment to Ireland upon the mental attitude ofmillions of Irishmen scattered throughout the British Empire and theUnited States, and so upon the lives of the countries in which they havemade their homes, is apparently ignored. I fully recognise the vastimportance of the subject. A book dealing comprehensively with theactual and potential influence of Irish intellect upon English politicsat home, and upon the politics of the United States, a carefullyreasoned estimate of the part which Irish intellect is qualified, andwhich I firmly believe it is destined, to play wherever the civilisationof the world is to be under the control of the English-speakingpeoples--more especially where these peoples govern races which speakother tongues and see through other eyes--a clear and strikingexposition of the true relation between the small affairs of the smallisland and that greater Ireland which takes its inspiration from thesorrows, the passions, the endeavours, and the hopes of those who stickto the old home--such a book would possess a deep human interest, andwould make a high and wide appeal. Nevertheless, I feel that at thepresent time the most urgent need, from every point of view on which Ihave touched, is to focus the thought available for the Irish Questionupon the definite work of a reconstruction of Irish life.Such is the purpose of this book. I do not wish to attach anyexaggerated importance to the scheme of social and economic reform ofwhich I have attempted to give a faithful account; nor is it in theirpractical achievement, be it great or small, that the initiators andorganisers of the new movement take most pride. What these Irishmen areproud of is the manner in which the people have responded to theirefforts to bring Irish sentiment into an intimate and helpful relationwith Irish economic problems. They had to reckon with that greatest ofhindrances to the spirit of enterprise, a rooted belief in thepotentiality of government to bring material prosperity to our doors. AsI have pointed out, the practical demonstration which Ireland hadreceived of the power of government to inflict lasting economic injurygave rise to this belief; and I have noted the present influences towhich it seems to owe its continuance until to-day. I believe that, ifany enduring interest attaches to the story which I have told, it willconsist in the successive steps by which this initial difficulty hasbeen overcome.Let me summarise in a few words what has been, so far, actuallyaccomplished. Those who did the work of which I have written firstlaunched upon Irish life a scheme of organised self-help which, perhapsmore by good luck than design, proved to be in accordance with theinherited instincts of the people, and, therefore, moved them to action.Next they called for, and in due season obtained, a department ofgovernment with adequate powers and means to aid in developing theresources of the country, so far as this end could be attained withouttransgressing the limits of beneficial State interference with thebusiness of the people. In its constitution this department was solinked with the representative institutions of the country that thepeople soon began to feel that they largely controlled its policy andwere responsible for its success. Meanwhile, the progress of economicthought in the country had made such rapid strides that, in theadministration of State assistance, the principle of self-help could berigidly insisted upon and was willingly submitted to. The result is thata situation has been created which is as gratifying as it may appear tobe paradoxical. Within the scope and sphere of the movement the Irishpeople are now, without any sacrifice of industrial character, combiningreliance upon government with reliance upon themselves.That a movement thus conceived should so rapidly have overcome itsinitial difficulties and should, I might almost add, have passed beyondthe experimental stage, will suggest to any thoughtful reader that aboveand beyond the removal by legislation of obstacles to progress--and muchhas been accomplished in this way of recent years--there must have beennew, positive influences at work upon the national mind. These will befound in the growing recognition of the fact that the path of progresslies along distinctively Irish lines, and that otherwise it will not betrodden by the Irish people. Much good in the same direction has beendone, too, by the generous and authoritative admission by England thatthe future development of Ireland should be assisted and promoted 'witha full and constant regard to the special traditions of thecountry.'[52] But after all, while these concessions to Irishsentiment, vitally important though they be, may speed us on our road tonational regeneration, they will not take us far. It remains for usIrishmen to realise--and the chief value of all the work I havedescribed consists in the degree in which it forces us to realise--theresponsibility which now rests with ourselves. We have been too long aprey to that deep delusion, which, because the ills of the country welove were in past days largely caused from without, bids us look to thesame source for their cure. The true remedies are to be soughtelsewhere; for, however disastrous may have been the past, the injurywas moral rather than material, and the opportunity has now arrived forthe patient building up again of Irish character in those qualitieswhich win in the modern struggle for existence. The field for that greatwork is clear of at least the worst of its many historic encumbrances.Ireland must be re-created from within. The main work must be done inIreland, and the centre of interest must be Ireland. When Irishmenrealise this truth, the splendid human power of their country, so muchof which now runs idly or disastrously to waste, will be utilised; andwe may then look with confidence for the foundation of a fabric of Irishprosperity, framed in constructive thought, and laid enduringly in humancharacter.THE END.FOOTNOTES:[48] Pages 38, 39.[49] It must be borne in mind that the Department is not officiallyconcerned with the question of the economic distribution of landreferred to on pp. 46-49.[50] For a full description of the Department's scheme of agriculturaleducation I may refer to a _Memorandum on Agricultural Education inIreland,_ written by the author and published by the Department, July,1901.[51] See _ante_, pp. 236-238.[52] Speech of the Lord Lieutenant to the Incorporated Law Society,November 20th, 1902.

"Something is happening to me, for Ican't find the rest of this article. Something is happening to you,for you're losing your temper.""I'm not, sir! I deny it.""As for Patsy," continued the other, "she is sixteen years old andknows New York like a book. The girl is safe enough.""Then where is she? Tell me that, sir. Here it is, seven o'clock, darkas pitch and raining hard, and Patsy is never out after six. Can you,John Merrick, sit there like a lump o' putty and do nothing, when yourniece and my own darlin' Patsy is lost--or strayed or stolen?""What would you propose doing?" asked Uncle John, looking up with asmile."We ought to get out the police department. It's raining and cold,and--""Then we ought to get out the fire department. Call Mary to put onmore coal and let's have it warm and cheerful when Patsy comes in.""But, sir--""The trouble with you, Major, is that dinner is half an hour late. Onecan imagine all sorts of horrible things on an empty stomach. Now,then--"He paused, for a pass-key rattled in the hall door and a moment laterPatsy Doyle, rosy and animated, fresh from the cold and wet outside,smilingly greeted them.She had an umbrella, but her cloak was dripping with moisture and inits ample folds was something huddled and bundled up like a baby,which she carefully protected."So, then," exclaimed the Major, coming forward for a kiss, "you'reback at last, safe and sound. Whatever kept ye out 'til this time o'night, Patsy darlin'?" he added, letting the brogue creep into histone, as he did when stirred by any emotion.Uncle John started to take off her wet cloak."Look out!" cried Patsy; "you'll disturb Mumbles."The two men looked at her bundle curiously."Who's Mumbles?" asked one."What on earth is Mumbles?" inquired the other.The bundle squirmed and wriggled. Patsy sat down on the floor andcarefully unwound the folds of the cloak. A tiny dog, black andshaggy, put his head out, blinked sleepily at the lights, pulled hisfat, shapeless body away from the bandages and trotted solemnly overto the fireplace. He didn't travel straight ahead, as dogs ought towalk, but "cornerwise," as Patsy described it; and when he got to thehearth he rolled himself into a ball, lay down and went to sleep.During this performance a tense silence had pervaded the room. TheMajor looked at the dog rather gloomily; Uncle John with critical eyesthat held a smile in them; Patsy with ecstatic delight."Isn't he a dear!" she exclaimed."It occurs to me," said the Major stiffly, "that this needs anexplanation. Do you mean to say, Patsy Doyle, that you've worried thehearts out of us this past hour, and kept the dinner waiting, allbecause of a scurvy bit of an animal?""Pshaw!" said Uncle John. "Speak for yourself, Major. I wasn't worrieda bit.""You see," explained Patsy, rising to take off her things and put themaway, "I was coming home early when I first met Mumbles. A little boyhad him, with a string tied around his neck, and when Mumbles triedto run up to me the boy jerked him back cruelly--and afterward kickedhim. That made me mad.""Of course," said Uncle John, nodding wisely."I cuffed the boy, and he said he'd take it out on Mumbles, as soon asI'd gone away. I didn't like that. I offered to buy the dog, but theboy didn't dare sell him. He said it belonged to his father, who'dkill him and kick up a row besides if he didn't bring Mumbles home.So I found out where they lived and as it wasn't far away I went homewith him.""Crazy Patsy!" smiled Uncle John."And the dinner waiting!" groaned the Major, reproachfully."Well, I had a time, you can believe!" continued Patsy, withanimation. "The man was a big brute, and half drunk. He grabbed up thelittle doggie and threw it into a box, and then told me to go home andmind my business.""Which of course you refused to do.""Of course. I'd made up my mind to have that dog.""Dogs," said the Major, "invariably are nuisances.""Not invariably," declared Patsy. "Mumbles is different. Mumbles is agood doggie, and wise and knowing, although he's only a baby dog yet.And I just couldn't leave him to be cuffed and kicked and thrownaround by those brutes. When the man found I was determined to haveMumbles he demanded twenty-five dollars.""Twenty-five dollars!" It startled Uncle John."For that bit of rags and meat?" asked the Major, looking at the puppywith disfavor. "Twenty-five cents would be exorbitant.""The man misjudged me," observed Patsy, with a merry laugh thatmatched her twinkling blue eyes. "In the end he got just twodollars for Mumbles, and when I came away he bade me good-bye veryrespectfully. The boy howled. He hasn't any dog to kick and isbroken-hearted. As for Mumbles, he's going to lead a respectable lifeand be treated like a dog.""Do you mean to keep him?" inquired the Major."Why not?" said Patsy. "Don't you like him, Daddy?"Her father turned Mumbles over with his toe. The puppy lay upon itsback, lazily, with all four paws in the air, and cast a comical glancefrom one beady bright eye at the man who had disturbed him.The Major sighed."He can't hunt, Patsy; he's not even a mouser.""We haven't a mouse in the house.""He's neither useful nor ornamental. From the looks o' the beast he'sonly good to sleep and eat.""What's the odds?" laughed Patsy, coddling Mumbles up in her arms."We don't expect use or ornamentation from Mumbles. All we ask is hiscompanionship."Mary called them to dinner just then, and the girl hurried to her roomto make a hasty toilet while the men sat down at the table and eyedtheir soup reflectively."This addition to the family," remarked Uncle John, "need not makeyou at all unhappy, my dear Major. Don't get jealous of Mumbles, forheaven's sake, for the little brute may add a bit to Patsy's bliss.""It's the first time I've ever allowed a dog in the house.""You are not running this present establishment. It belongsexclusively to Patsy.""I've always hated the sight of a woman coddling a dog," added theMajor, frowning."I know. I feel the same way myself. But it isn't the dog's fault.It's the woman's. And Patsy won't make a fool of herself over thatfrowsy puppy, I assure you. On the contrary, she's likely to get a lotof joy out of her new plaything, and if you really want to make herhappy, Major, don't discourage this new whim, absurd as it seems. LetPatsy alone. And let Mumbles alone."The girl came in just then, bringing sunshine with her. Patsy Doylewas not very big for her years, and some people unkindly described herform as "chubby." She had glorious red hair--really-truly red--and herblue eyes were the merriest, sweetest eyes any girl could possess. Youseldom noticed her freckles, her saucy chin or her turned-up nose; youonly saw the laughing eyes and crown of golden red, and seeing themyou liked Patsy Doyle at once and imagined she was very good to lookat, if not strictly beautiful. No one had friends more loyal,and these two old men--the stately Major and round little UncleJohn--fairly worshiped Patsy.No one might suspect, from the simple life of this household, whichoccupied the second corner flat at 3708 Willing Square, that MissDoyle was an heiress. Not only that, but perhaps one of the veryrichest girls in New York. And the reason is readily explained whenI state the fact that Patsy's Uncle John Merrick, the round littlebald-headed man who sat contentedly eating his soup, was a man of manymillions, and this girl his favorite niece. An old bachelor who hadacquired an immense fortune in the far Northwest, Mr. Merrick hadlately retired from active business and come East to seek anyrelatives that might remain to him after forty years' absence. Hissister Jane had gathered around her three nieces--Louise Merrick,Elizabeth De Graf and Patricia Doyle--and when Aunt Jane died UncleJohn adopted these three girls and made their happiness the one careof his jolly, unselfish life. At that time Major Doyle, Patsy's onlysurviving parent, was a poor bookkeeper; but Uncle John gave himcharge of his vast property interests, and loving Patsy almost asdevotedly as did her father, made his home with the Doyles and beganto enjoy himself for the first time in his life.At the period when this story opens the eldest niece, Louise Merrick,had just been married to Arthur Weldon, a prosperous young businessman, and the remaining two nieces, as well as Uncle John, were feelingrather lonely and depressed. The bride had been gone on her honeymoonthree days, and during the last two days it had rained persistently;so, until Patsy came home from a visit to Beth and brought the tinydog with her, the two old gentlemen had been feeling dreary enough.Patsy always livened things up. Nothing could really depress thisspirited girl for long, and she was always doing some interestingthing to create a little excitement."If she hadn't bought a twenty-five cent pup for two dollars,"remarked the Major, "she might have brought home an orphan from thegutters, or a litter of tomcats, or one of the goats that eat thetin cans at Harlem. Perhaps, after all, we should be thankful it'sonly--what's his name?""Mumbles," said Patsy, merrily. "The boy said they called him thatbecause he mumbled in his sleep. Listen!"Indeed, the small waif by the fire was emitting a series of noisesthat seemed a queer mixture of low growls and whines--evidenceunimpeachable that he had been correctly named.At Patsy's shout of laughter, supplemented by Uncle John's chucklesand a reproachful cough from the Major, Mumbles awakened and liftedhis head. It may be an eye discovered the dining-table in the nextroom, or an intuitive sense of smell directed him, for presently thesmall animal came trotting in--still traveling "cornerwise"--and satup on his hind legs just beside Patsy's chair."That settles it," said the Major, as his daughter began feeding thedog. "Our happy home is broken up.""Perhaps not," suggested Uncle John, reaching out to pat the soft headof Mumbles. "It may be the little beggar will liven us all up a bit."CHAPTER IIUNCLE JOHN'S IDEATwo hours later Uncle John, who had been dozing in his big chair bythe fire while Patsy drummed on the piano, sat up abruptly and lookedaround him with a suddenly acquired air of decision."I have an idea," he announced."Did you find it in your dreams, then?" asked the Major, sharply."Why, Daddy, how cross you are!" cried Patsy. "Can't Uncle John havean idea if he wants to?""I'm afraid of his ideas," admitted the Major, suspiciously. "Everytime he goes to sleep and catches a thought, it means trouble."Patsy laughed, looking at her uncle curiously, and the little mansmiled at her genially in return."It takes me a long time to figure a thing out," he said; "and whenI've a problem to solve a bit of a snooze helps wonderfully. Patsy,dear, it occurs to me we're lonely.""We surely are, Uncle!" she exclaimed."And in the dumps.""Our spirits are at the bottom of the bottomless pit.""So what we need is--a change.""There it goes!" said the Major ruefully. "I knew very well any ideaof John Merrick's would cause us misery. But understand this, youmiserable home-wrecker, sir, my daughter Patsy steps not one foot outof New York this winter.""Why not?" mildly inquired Uncle John."Because you've spirited her away from me times enough, and deprivedher only parent of her society. First you gallivanted off to Europe,and then to Millville, and next to Elmhurst; so now, egad, I'm goingto keep the girl with me if I have to throttle every idea in yourwicked old head!""But I'm planning to take you along, this time. Major," observed UncleJohn reflectively."Oh. Hum! Well, I can't go. There's too much business to be attendedto--looking after your horrible money.""Take a vacation. You know I don't care anything about the business.It can't go very wrong, anyhow. What does it matter if my income isn'tinvested properly, or the bond coupons cut when they're due? Drat themoney!""That's what I say," added Patsy eagerly. "Be a man, Major Doyle, andput the business out of your mind. Let's go somewhere and have a goodromp. It will cheer us up."The Major stared first at one and then at the other."What's the programme, John?" he asked stiffly."It's going to be a cold winter," remarked the little man, bobbing hishead up and down slowly."It is!" cried Patsy, clasping her hands fervently. "I can feel it inmy bones.""So we're going," said Uncle John, impressively, "to California--wherethey grow sunshine and roses to offset our blizzards and icicles.""Hurray!" shouted Patsy. "I've always wanted to go to California.""California!" said the Major, amazed; "why, it's farther away thanEurope. It takes a month to get there.""Nonsense." retorted Uncle John. "It's only four days from coast tocoast. I have a time-table, somewhere," and he began searching in hispockets.There was a silence, oppressive on the Major's part, ecstatic as faras Patsy was concerned. Uncle John found the railway folder, put onhis spectacles, and began to examine it."At my time of life," remarked Major Doyle, who was hale and hearty asa boy, "such a trip is a great undertaking.""Twenty-four hours to Chicago," muttered Uncle John; "and then threedays to Los Angeles or San Francisco. That's all there is to it.""Four days and four nights of dreary riding. We'd be dead by thattime," prophesied the Major.Uncle John looked thoughtful. Then he lay back in his chair and spreadhis handkerchief over his face again."No, no!" cried the Major, in alarm. "For mercy's sake, John, don'tgo to sleep and catch any more of those terrible ideas. No one knowswhere the next one might carry us--to Timbuktu or Yucatan, probably.Let's stick to California and settle the question before your hothousebrain grows any more weeds.""Yucatan," remarked Mr. Merrick, composedly, his voice muffled by thehandkerchief, "isn't a bad suggestion.""I knew it!" wailed the Major. "How would Ethiopia or Hindustan strikeyou?"Patsy laughed at him. She knew something good was in store for herand like all girls was enraptured at the thought of visiting new andinteresting scenes."Don't bother Uncle John, Daddy," she said. "You know very well hewill carry out any whim that seizes him; especially if you oppose theplan, which you usually do.""He's the most erratic and irresponsible man that ever lived,"announced her father, staring moodily at the spread handkerchief whichcovered Uncle John's cherub-like features. "New York is good enoughfor anybody, even in winter; and now that you're in society, Patsy--""Oh, bother society! I hate it.""True," he agreed; "it's a regular treadmill when it has enslaved one,and keeps you going on and on without progressing a bit. The object ofsociety is to tire you out and keep you from indulging in any otheroccupation.""You know nothing about it," observed Patsy, demurely, "and that iswhy you love to rail at society. The things you know, Daddy dear, arethe things you never remark upon.""Huh!" grunted the Major, and relapsed into silence.Mumbles had finished his after-dinner nap and was now awakening toactivity. This dog's size, according to the Major, was "about 4x6; butyou can't tell which is the 4 and which the 6." He was distressinglyshaggy. Patsy could find the stump of his tail only by careful search.Seldom were both eyes uncovered by hair at the same time. But, as hisnew mistress had said, he was a wise little dog for one who had onlyknown the world for a few months, and his brain was exceedingly alert.After yawning at the fire he rubbed his back against the Major's legs,sat up beside Patsy and looked at her from one eye pleadingly. Next hetrotted over to Uncle John. The big white handkerchief attracted himand one corner hung down from the edge of the reclining chair. Mumblessat up and reached for it, but could not quite get it in his teeth.So he sat down and thought it over, and presently made a leap sounexpectedly agile that Patsy roared with merriment and even the Majorgrinned. Uncle John, aroused, sat up and found the puppy rolling onthe floor and fighting the handkerchief as if it had been some deadlyfoe."Thank goodness," sighed the Major. "The little black rascal hasprovidently prevented you from evolving another idea.""Not so," responded Mr. Merrick amiably. "I've thought the thing allout, and completed our programme.""Is it still to be California?" anxiously inquired Patsy."Of course. I can't give up the sunshine and roses, you know. But wewon't bore the Major by four solid days of railway travel. We'll breakthe journey, and take two or three weeks to it--perhaps a month.""Conquering Caesar! A month!" ejaculated the old soldier, a desperatelook on his face."Yes. Listen, both of you. We'll get to Chicago in a night and a day.We will stop off there and visit the stockyards, and collect a fewsqueals for souvenirs.""No, we won't!" declared Patsy, positively."We might sell Mumbles to some Chicago sausage factory," remarked theMajor, "but not for two whole dollars. He wouldn't make more than halfa pound at twenty cents the pound.""There are other sights to be seen in Chicago," continued Uncle John."Anyhow, we'll stop off long enough to get rested. Then on to Denverand Pike's Peak.""That sounds good," said Patsy."At Denver," said Uncle John, "we will take a touring car and crossthe mountains in it. There are good roads all the way from there toCalifornia.""Who told you so?" demanded the Major."No one. It's a logical conclusion, for I've lived in the West andknow the prairie roads are smoother than boulevards. However, Haggertytold me the other day that he has made the trip from Denver to LosAngeles by automobile, and what others can do, we can do.""It will be glorious!" prophesied Patsy, delightedly.The Major looked grave, but could find no plausible objection tooffer. He really knew nothing about the West and had never hadoccasion to consider such a proposition before."We'll talk to Haggerty," he said. "But you must remember he's adesperate liar, John, and can't be trusted as a guidepost. When do youintend to start?""Why not to-morrow?" asked Uncle John mildly.Even Patsy demurred at this."Why, we've got to get ready, Uncle," she said. "And who's going? Justwe three?""We will take Beth along, of course." Beth was Elizabeth De Graf,another niece. "But Beth is fortunately the sort of girl who can pullup stakes and move on at an hour's notice.""Beth is always ready for anything," agreed Patsy. "But if we aregoing to a warm climate we will need summer clothes.""You can't lug many clothes in a motor car," observed the Major."No; but we can ship them on ahead.""Haggerty says," remarked Uncle John, "that you won't need thinclothes until you get out to California. In fact, the mountain trip israther cool. But it's perpetual sunshine, you know, even there, withbrisk, keen air; and the whole journey, Haggerty says, is one ofabsolute delight.""Who is Haggerty?" asked Patsy."A liar," answered the Major, positively."He's a very good fellow whom we sometimes meet in the city," saidUncle John. "Haggerty is on the Board, and director in a bank or two,and quite respectable. But the Major--""The Major's going to California just to prove that Haggerty can'tspeak the truth," observed that gentleman, tersely heading off anythreatened criticism. "I see there is no opposing your preposterousscheme, John, so we will go with you and make the best of it. But I'msure it's all a sad mistake. What else did Haggerty tell you?""He says it's best to pick up a motor car and a chauffeur in Denver,rather than ship them on from here. There are plenty of cars to behad, and men who know every inch of the road.""That seems sensible," declared Patsy, "and we won't lose time waitingfor our own car to follow by freight. I think, Uncle John, I can beready by next Tuesday.""Why, to-morrow's Saturday!" gasped the Major. "The business--""Cut the business off short," suggested his brother-in-law. "You've tocut it somewhere, you know, or you'll never get away; and, as it's mybusiness, I hereby authorize you to neglect it from this moment untilthe day of our return. When we get back you can pick up the detailsagain and worry over it as much as you please.""Will we ever get back?" asked the Major, doubtingly."If we don't, the business won't matter.""That's the idea," cried Patsy, approvingly. "Daddy has worked hardall summer, Uncle John, looking after that annoying money of yours,and a vacation will do him oodles of good."Major Doyle sighed."I misdoubt the wisdom of the trip," said he, "but I'll go, of course,if you all insist. Over the Rocky Mountains and across the GreatAmerican Desert in an automobile doesn't sound very enticing, but--""Haggerty says--""Never mind Haggerty. We'll find out for ourselves.""And, after all," said Patsy, "there are the sunshine and roses at theend of the journey, and they ought to make up for any amount of botherin getting there.""Girl, you're attempting to deceive me--to deceive your old Daddy,"said the Major, shaking his head at her. "You wouldn't have any funriding to California in a palace car; even the sunshine and rosescouldn't excite you under such circumstances; but if there's a chancefor adventure--a chance to slide into trouble and make a mightystruggle to get out again--both you and that wicked old uncle of yourswill jump at it. I know ye both. And that's the real reason we'regoing to travel in an automobile instead of progressing comfortably asall respectable people do.""You're a humbug," retorted Mr. Merrick. "You wouldn't go by train ifI'd let you.""No," admitted the Major; "I must be on hand to rescue you when youand Patsy go fighting windmills."CHAPTER IIIMYRTLE DEAN"We were due in Denver three hours ago, and it's an hour's run or moreyet," remarked Beth De Graf, walking briskly up and down the platformof a way station where the train had stopped for orders."And it's beginning to snow," observed Patricia Doyle, beside her."I'm afraid this weather isn't very propitious for an automobiletrip.""Uncle John doesn't worry," said Beth. "He believes there is perpetualsunshine west of Denver.""Yes; a man named Haggerty told him. But you'll notice that Daddydoesn't seem to believe the tale. Anyhow, we shall soon know thetruth, Beth, and the trip is somewhat on the order of a voyage ofdiscovery, which renders it fascinating to look forward to. There issuch fun in not knowing just what is going to happen next.""When one travels with Uncle John," returned Beth, smiling, "sheknows exactly--nothing. That is why I am always eager to accept if heinvites me to go anywhere with him."The passengers thronging the platform--"stretching their legs" afterthe confinement of the tedious railway journey--eyed these two girlsadmiringly. Beth was admitted a beauty, and one of the societyjournals had lately announced that she had few peers in all the greatmetropolis. Chestnut brown hair; dark, serious and steady eyes; anexquisite complexion and rarely regular features all conspired torender the young girl wonderfully attractive. Her stride was athletic,free and graceful; her slender form well poised and dignified. Patsy,the "plug-ugly," as she called herself, was so bright and animated andher blue eyes sparkled so constantly with fun and good humor, thatshe attracted fully as much attention as her more sedate and morebeautiful cousin, and wherever she went was sure to make a host offriends."See!" she cried, clasping Beth's arm; "there is that lovely girl atthe window again. I've noticed her ever since the train left Chicago,and she is always in the same seat in that tourist coach. I wonder whyshe doesn't get out for a bit of fresh air now and then."Beth looked up at the fair, girlish face that gazed wistfully fromthe window. The unknown seemed very young--not more than fourteen orfifteen years of age. She wore a blue serge suit of rather coarseweave, but it was neat and becoming. Around the modest, sweet eyeswere deep circles, denoting physical suffering or prolonged worry; yetthe lips smiled, wanly but persistently. She had evidently noticedUncle John's two nieces, for her eyes followed them as they marchedup and down the platform and when Patsy looked up and nodded, a softflush suffused her features and she bowed her head in return.At the cry of "all aboard!" a scramble was made for the coaches andBeth and Patsy, re-entering their staterooms, found their Uncle andthe Major still intent upon their interminable game of cribbage."Let's go back and talk to the girl," suggested Patsy. "Somehow,the poor thing seems lonely, and her smile was more pathetic thancheerful."So they made their way through the long train to the tourist coach,and there found the girl they were seeking. The surrounding seats wereoccupied by groups of passengers of rather coarse caliber, many beingforeign laborers accompanied by their wives and children. The air inthe car was close and "stuffy" and the passengers seemed none too neatin their habits and appearance. So the solitary girl appeared like arose blooming in a barnyard and her two visitors were instantly sorryfor her. She sat in her corner, leaning wearily against the back ofthe cane seat, with a blanket spread over her lap. Strangelyenough the consideration of her fellow passengers left the girl inundisturbed possession of a double seat."Perhaps she is ill," thought Patsy, as she and Beth sat down oppositeand entered into conversation with the child. She was franklycommunicative and they soon learned that her name was Myrtle Dean, andthat she was an orphan. Although scarcely fifteen years of age shehad for more than two years gained a livelihood by working in a skirtfactory in Chicago, paying her board regularly to a cross old aunt whowas her only relative in the big city. Three months ago, however, shehad met with an accident, having been knocked down by an automobilewhile going to her work and seriously injured."The doctors say," she confided to her new friends, "that I shallalways be lame, although not quite helpless. Indeed, I can creeparound a little now, when I am obliged to move, and I shall get betterevery day. One of my hips was so badly injured that it will never bequite right again, and my Aunt Martha was dreadfully worried for fearI would become a tax upon her. I cannot blame her, for she has reallybut little money to pay for her own support. So, when the man who ranover me paid us a hundred dollars for damages--""Only a hundred dollars!" cried Beth, amazed."Wasn't that enough?" inquired Myrtle innocently."By no means," said Patsy, with prompt indignation. "He should havegiven you five thousand, at least. Don't you realize, my dear, thatthis accident has probably deprived you of the means of earning alivelihood?""I can still sew," returned the girl, courageously, "although ofcourse I cannot get about easily to search for employment.""But why did you leave Chicago?" asked Beth."I was coming to that part of my story. When I got the hundred dollarsAunt Martha decided I must use it to go to Leadville, to my UncleAnson, who is my mother's only brother. He is a miner out there, andAunt Martha says he is quite able to take care of me. So she bought myticket and put me on the train and I'm now on my way to Leadville tofind Uncle Anson.""To _find_ him!" exclaimed Patsy. "Don't you know his address?""No; we haven't had a letter from him for two years. But Aunt Marthasays he must be a prominent man, and everybody in Leadville will knowhim, as it's a small place.""Does he know you are coming?" asked Beth, thoughtfully."My aunt wrote him a letter two days before I started, so he oughtto receive it two days before I get there," replied Myrtle, a littleuneasily. "Of course I can't help worrying some, because if I failedto find Uncle Anson I don't know what might happen to me.""Have you money?" asked Beth."A little. About three dollars. Aunt gave me a basket of food to lastuntil I get to Leadville, and after paying for my ticket and takingwhat I owed her for board there wasn't much left from the hundreddollars.""What a cruel old woman!" cried Patsy, wrathfully. "She ought to behorsewhipped!""I am sure it was wrong for her to cast you off in this heartlessway," added Beth, more conservatively."She is not really bad," returned Myrtle, the tears starting to hereyes. "But Aunt Martha has grown selfish, and does not care for mevery much. I hope Uncle Anson will be different. He is my mother'sbrother, you know, while Aunt Martha is only my father's sister, andan old maid who has had rather a hard life. Perhaps," she added,wistfully, "Uncle Anson will love me--although I'm not strong orwell."Both Patsy and Beth felt desperately sorry for the girl."What is Uncle Anson's other name?" asked the latter, for Beth wasthe more practical of Uncle John's nieces and noted for her clearthinking."Jones. Mr. Anson Jones.""Rather a common name, if you have to hunt for him," observed thequestioner, musingly. "Has he been in Leadville long?""I do not know," replied Myrtle. "His last letter proved that he wasin Leadville two years ago, and he said he had been very successfuland made money; but he has been in other mining camps, I know, and haswandered for years all over the West.""Suppose he should be wandering now?" suggested Patsy; but at the lookof alarm on Myrtle's face she quickly changed the subject, saying:"You must come in to dinner with us, my dear, for you have had nothingbut cold truck to eat since you left Chicago. They say we shall be inDenver in another hour, but I'm afraid to believe it. Anyhow, there isplenty of time for dinner.""Oh, I can't go, really!" cried the girl. "It's--it's so hard for meto walk when the train is moving; and--and--I wouldn't feel happy inthat gay, luxurious dining car.""Well, we must go, anyway, or the Major will be very disagreeable,"said Patsy. "Good-bye, Myrtle; we shall see you again before we leavethe train."As the two girls went forward to their coach Beth said to Patsy:"I'm afraid that poor thing will be greatly disappointed when she getsto Leadville. Imagine anyone sending a child on such a wild goosechase--and an injured and almost helpless child, at that!""I shudder to think what would become of her, with no uncle to carefor her and only three dollars to her name," added Patsy. "I havenever heard of such an inhuman creature as that Aunt Martha, Beth. Ihope there are not many like her in the world."At dinner they arranged with the head waiter of the dining car to sendin a substantial meal, smoking hot, to Myrtle Dean, and Patsy herselfinspected the tray before it went to make sure everything was therethat was ordered. They had to satisfy Uncle John's curiosity at thisproceeding by relating to him Myrtle Dean's story, and the kindlylittle man became very thoughtful and agreed with them that it was acruel act to send the poor girl into a strange country in search of anuncle who had not been heard of in two years.When the train pulled into the station at Denver the first care ofJohn Merrick's party was to look after the welfare of the lame girl.They got a porter to assist her into the depot waiting room and thenUncle John inquired about the next train for Leadville, and found itwould not start until the following morning, the late overland trainhaving missed that day's connections. This was a serious discovery forpoor Myrtle, but she smiled bravely and said:"I can pass the night in this seat very comfortably, so please don'tworry about me. It is warm here, you know, and I won't mind a bit thesitting up. Thank you all very much for your kindness, and good-bye.I'll be all right, never fear."Uncle John stood looking down at her thoughtfully."Did you engage a carriage, Major?" he asked."Yes; there's one now waiting," was the reply."All right. Now, then, my dear, let's wrap this blanket around youtight and snug.""What are you going to do?" asked Myrtle with a startled look."Carry you outside. It's pretty cold and snowy, so we must wrap you up.Now, Major, take hold on the other side. Here we go!"Patsy smiled--rather pitifully--at the expression of bewilderment onMyrtle's face. Uncle John and the Major carried her tenderly to acarriage and put her in the back seat. Patsy sprang in next, withMumbles clasped tightly in her arms, the small dog having been forcedto make the journey thus far in the baggage car. Beth and the Majorentered the carriage next, while Uncle John mounted beside the driverand directed him to the Crown Palace Hotel.It was growing dark when they reached the dingy hostelry, which mighthave been palatial when it was named but was now sadly faded andtawdry. It proved to be fairly comfortable, however, and the firstcare of the party was to see Myrtle Dean safely established in a cosyroom, with a grate fire to cheer her. Patsy and Beth had adjoiningrooms and kept running in for a word with their protege, who wasso astonished and confused by her sudden good fortune that she wasincapable of speech and more inclined to cry than to laugh.During the evening Uncle John was busy at the telegraph booth. He sentseveral messages to Leadville, to Anson Jones, to the Chief of Policeand to the various hotels; but long before midnight, when the lastreplies were received, he knew that Anson Jones had left Leadvillefive months ago, and his present whereabouts were unknown. Havinglearned these facts the little man went to bed and slept peacefullyuntil morning.Myrtle had begged them to see that she was called at five o'clock,that she might have ample time to get to the depot for her train, butno one called her and the poor child was so weary and worn with hertrip that the soft bed enthralled her for many hours after daybreak.Patsy finally aroused her, opening the blinds to let in the sunshineand then sitting beside Myrtle's bed to stroke her fair hair and tellher it was nearly noon."But my train!" wailed the girl, greatly distressed."Oh, the train has gone hours ago. But never mind that, dear. UncleJohn has telegraphed to Leadville and found that Anson Jones isnot there. He left months ago, and is now wandering; in fields andpastures unknown."Myrtle sat up in bed and glared at Patsy wild-eyed."Gone!" she said. "Gone! Then what am I to do?""I can't imagine, dear," said Patsy, soothingly. "What do you thinkyou will do?"The girl seemed dazed and for a time could not reply."You must have thought of this thing," suggested her new friend, "forit was quite possible Anson Jones would not be in Leadville when youarrived there.""I did not dare think of it," returned Myrtle in a low, frightenedtone. "I once asked Aunt Martha what I could do in case Uncle Ansonwasn't to be found, and she said he _must_ be found, for otherwise Iwould be obliged to earn my own living.""And she knew you to be so helpless!""She knows I can sew, if only I can get work to do," said the girl,simply. "I'm not really a cripple, and I'm getting better of my hurtevery day. Aunt Martha said I would be just as well off in Denver orLeadville as in Chicago, and made me promise, if the worst came, notto let any charitable organization send me back to her.""In other words," exclaimed Patsy, indignantly, "she wanted to get ridof you, and did not care what became of you.""She was afraid I would cost her money," admitted the poor child, withshamed, downcast eyes.Patsy went to the window and stood looking out for a time. Myrtlebegan to dress herself. As she said, she was not utterly helpless,moving the upper part of her body freely and being able to walk slowlyabout a room by holding on to chairs or other furniture."I'm afraid I'm causing you a lot of worry over me," said she, smilingsadly as Patsy turned toward her; "and that is ungrateful when Iremember how kind you have all been. Why, these hours since I met youhave seemed like fairyland. I shall treasure them as long as I live.There must be another train to Leadville soon, and I'll take that. Assoon as I am ready I will go to the depot and wait there."Patsy looked at her reflectively. The poor child was called upon tosolve a queer problem--one which might well have bewildered the brainof a more experienced person."Tell me," she said; "why should you go to Leadville at all, now thatyou have no friend or relative there to care for you?""My ticket is to Leadville, you know," replied Myrtle. "If I did notgo I would waste the money it cost."Patsy laughed at this."You're a wonderfully impractical child," she said, deftly assistingMyrtle to finish dressing. "What you really need is some one to orderyou around and tell you what to do. So you must stop thinking aboutyourself, for a time, and let _us_ do the thinking. Here--sit in thischair by the window. Do you want Mumbles in your lap? All right. Nowgaze upon the scenery until I come back. There's a man washing windowsacross the street; watch and see if he does his work properly."Then she went away to join a conference in Uncle John's sitting room.Major Doyle was speaking when she entered and his voice was coldlyironical."The temperature outside is six degrees above freezing," he observed."The clerk downstairs says the snow is nine feet deep over themountain trails and the wind would cut an iron beam in two. If youtake an automobile to California, John, you must put it on snowshoesand connect it with a steam heating-plant."Uncle John, his hands thrust deep in his pockets, paced thoughtfullyup and down the room."Haggerty said--""Didn't I give you Haggerty's record, then?" asked the Major. "Ifyou want the exact truth it's safe to go directly opposite to whatHaggerty says.""He's a very decent fellow," protested Mr. Merrick, "and is consideredin the city to be strictly honest.""But after this?""You can't blame him for the weather conditions here. I've beentalking with Denver people myself, this morning, and they all sayit's unusual to have such cold weather at this time of year. Thethermometer hasn't been so low in the past twenty-six years, thenatives say.""Are they all named Haggerty?" asked the Major, scornfully."If you will kindly allow me to speak, and tell you what Haggertysaid," remarked Uncle John tersely, "I shall be able to add to yourinformation.""Go ahead, then.""Haggerty said that in case we ran into cold weather in Denver, whichwas possible--""Quite possible!""Then we had best go south to Santa Fe and take the route of the oldSanta Fe Trail as far as Albuquerque, or even to El Paso. Either waywe will be sure to find fine weather, and good roads into California.""So Haggerty says.""It stands to reason," continued Mr. Merrick, "that on the Southernroute we will escape the severe weather. So I have decided to adoptthat plan.""I think you are quite wise in that," broke in Patsy, before herfather could object."All those queer Spanish names sound interesting," said Beth. "When dowe start, Uncle?""In a day or two. I have some things here to attend to that may delayus that long. But when once we are started southward we shall bowlalong right merrily.""Unless we run into more snowstorms." Of course it was the Major whosaid that, and pointedly ignoring the remark Uncle John turned toPatsy and said:"How did you find Myrtle Dean this morning?""She is rested, and seems very bright and cheerful, Uncle; but ofcourse she is much distressed by the news that her Uncle Anson hasvanished from Leadville. Yet she thinks she will continue her journeyby the next train, as she has paid for her ticket and can't afford towaste the money.""It would be absurd for the child to go to Leadville on that account.A mining camp is no place for such a frail thing," returned Mr.Merrick. "What would you suggest, Patsy?""Really, Uncle John, I don't know what to suggest.""She can never earn her living by sewing," declared Beth. "What sheought to have is a trained nurse and careful attention.""I'll have a doctor up to look her over," said Uncle John, in hisdecisive way. He was a mild little man generally, but when he made uphis mind to do a thing it was useless to argue with him. Even MajorDoyle knew that; but the old soldier was so fond of arguing forthe sake of argument, and so accustomed to oppose his wealthybrother-in-law--whom he loved dearly just the same--that he waswilling to accept defeat rather than permit Mr. Merrick to act withoutprotest.CHAPTER IVAN INTERESTING PROTEGEA young physician was appointed by the management to attend any guestwho might require his services, and Uncle John had a talk with him andsent him to Myrtle's room to give her a thorough examination. This hedid, and reported that the girl's present condition was due largely tomismanagement of her case at the time she was injured. With care shewould get better and stronger rapidly, but the hip joint was out ofits socket and only a skillful operation would serve to permanentlyrelieve her of lameness."What she needs just now," continued the doctor, "is a pair ofcrutches, so she can get around better and be in the fresh air andsunshine as much as possible. She is a very frail little woman atpresent and must build up her health and strength before submittingto the operation I have mentioned. Then, if it is properly done, sheought to recover completely and be as good as new.""I must inform you," said Uncle John, "that Myrtle Dean is just alittle waif whom my nieces picked up on the train. I believe she iswithout friends or money. Such being the circumstances, what would youadvise?"The doctor shook his head gravely."Poor thing!" he said. "She ought to be rich, at this juncture,instead of poor, for the conditions facing her are serious. Theoperation I speak of is always an expensive one, and meantime thechild must go to some charitable institution or wear out her feeblestrength in trying to earn enough to keep the soul in her body. Sheseems to have a brave and beautiful nature, sir, and were she educatedand cared for would some day make a splendid woman. But the world isfull of these sad cases. I'm poor myself, Mr. Merrick, but this childinterests me, and after you have gone I shall do all in my power toassist her.""Thank you," said Uncle John, thoughtfully nodding his bald head."I'll think it over and see you again, doctor, before I leave."An hour later Myrtle was fitted with crutches of the best sortobtainable, and was overjoyed to find how greatly they assisted her.The Major, a kindly man, decided to take Myrtle out for a drive, andwhile they were gone Uncle John had a long conversation with Beth andPatsy."Here is a case," said he, "where my dreadful money can do some good.I am anxious to help Myrtle Dean, for I believe she is deserving ofmy best offices. But I don't exactly know what to do. She is really_your_ protege, my dears, and I am going to put the affair in yourhands for settlement. Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it. Spendmy money as freely upon Myrtle as you please."The girls faced the problem with enthusiasm."She's a dear little thing," remarked Patsy, "and seems very gratefulfor the least kindness shown her. I am sure she has never been treatedvery nicely by that stony-hearted old aunt of hers.""In all my experience," said Beth, speaking as if her years weredoubled, "I have never known anyone so utterly helpless. She is veryyoung and inexperienced, with no friends, no money, and scarcelyrecovered from an accident. It is clearly our duty to do something forMyrtle, and aside from the humane obligation I feel that already Ilove the child, having known her only a day.""Admitting all this, Beth," returned her uncle, "you are not answeringmy question. What shall we do for Myrtle? How can we best assist her?""Why not take her to California with us?" inquired Patsy, with suddeninspiration. "The sunshine and roses would make a new girl of her in afew weeks.""Could she ride so far in an automobile?" asked Beth, doubtfully."Why not? The fresh air would be just the thing for her. You'll get abig touring car, won't you, Uncle John?""I've bought one already--a seven-seated 'Autocrat'--and there will beplenty of room in it for Myrtle," he said."Good gracious! Where did you find the thing so suddenly?" criedPatsy."I made the purchase this morning, bright and early, before you wereup," replied Mr. Merrick, smilingly. "It is a fine new car, and assoon as I saw it I knew it was what I wanted. It is now being fittedup for our use.""Fitted up?""Yes. I've an idea in my head to make it a movable hotel. If we'regoing to cross the plains and the mountains and the deserts, and allthat sort of thing, we must be prepared for any emergencies. I've alsosent for a chauffeur who is highly recommended. He knows the routewe're going to take; can make all repairs necessary in case ofaccident, and is an experienced driver. I expect him here any minute.His name is Wampus.""But about Myrtle,"' said Beth. "Can we make her comfortable on a longride?""Certainly," asserted Uncle John. "We are not going to travel day andnight, my dear, for as soon as we get away from this frozen country wecan take our time and journey by short stages. My notion is that wewill have more fun on the way than we will in California.""Myrtle hasn't any proper clothes," observed Patsy, reflectively."We'll have to shop for her, Beth, while Uncle is getting the carready.""Are you sure to leave to-morrow, Uncle John?" inquired Beth."To-morrow or the next day. There's no use leaving before the'Autocrat' is ready to ship.""Oh; we're not going to ride in it, then?""Not just yet. We shall take the train south to Santa Fe, and perhapsto Albuquerque. I'll talk to Wampus about that. When we reach a goodclimate we'll begin the journey overland--and not before.""Then," said Patsy, "I'm sure we shall have time to fit out Myrtlevery nicely."Mr. Wampus was announced just then, and while Uncle John conferredwith the chauffeur his two nieces went to their room to talk overMyrtle Dean's outfit and await the return of the girl from her ride."They tell me," said Mr. Merrick, "that you are an experiencedchauffeur.""I am celebrate," replied Wampus. "Not as chauffeur, but as expertautomobilist."He was a little man and quite thin. His legs were short and his armslong. He had expressionless light gray eyes and sandy hair croppedclose to his scalp. His mouth was wide and good-humored, his chin longand broad, his ears enormous in size and set at right angles withhis head. His cheek bones were as high and prominent as those of anIndian, and after a critical examination of the man Uncle John wasimpelled to ask his nationality."I am born in Canada, at Quebec Province," he answered. "My fatherhe trapper; my mother squaw. For me, I American, sir, and my namecelebrate over all the world for knowing automobile like father knowshis son." He paused, and added impressively: "I am Wampus!""Have you ever driven an 'Autocrat' car?" asked Mr. Merrick."'Autocrat?' I can take him apart blindfold, an' put him togetheragain.""Have you ever been overland to California?""Three time.""Then you know the country?""In the dark. I am Wampus.""Very good, Wampus. You seem to be the man I want, for I am goingto California in an 'Autocrat' car, by way of the Santa Fe Trailand--and--""No matter. We find way. I am--""I know. Now tell me, Wampus: if I employ you will you be faithful andcareful? I have two girls in my party--three girls, in fact--and fromthe moment you enter my service I shall expect you to watch over ourwelfare and guide us with skill and intelligence. Will you do this?"The man seemed somewhat offended by the question."When you have Wampus, what more you want?" he inquired. "Maybe younot know Wampus. You come from far East. All right. You go out and askautomobile man about Wampus. Ask ever'body. When you have inquire youfeel more happy. I come again."He started to go, but Mr. Merrick restrained him."You have been highly recommended already," said he. "But you cannotexpect me to have as high an opinion of you as you have of yourself;at least, until I know you better. Would you like to undertake thisengagement?""Yes. Just now I free. My business is expert automobilist. I amWampus. But perhaps you want cheap man. My price high.""What is your price?""Fifty dollar week. You eat me an' sleep me.""I do not object to your price. Come out with me to the garage and Iwill show you my car and explain what is being done to it."Although all the automobile men seemed to defer most respectfully toWampus, Mr. Merrick did not neglect to make proper inquiries in regardto the man. Locally he really was "celebrate" and Uncle John wasassured on all sides that he was fortunate to get so intelligent andexperienced a chauffeur as this same Wampus."He seems to have instinctive knowledge of all machinery," said oneinformant, "and can handle perfectly any car that is made. The onlytrouble with the fellow is that he is conceited.""I've noticed that," returned Mr. Merrick."Another thing," said the gentleman; "don't believe implicitly allthat Wampus tells you. He has a habit of imagining things. But he is afaithful, honest fellow, for all that, and will handle your car betterthan any other man you could get in Denver--or anywhere in the West, Iimagine."So Wampus was engaged, and putting the man's references andindorsements all together Mr. Merrick felt that he had gained a prize.When the big Major, returning from his drive, escorted Myrtle Dean tothe elevator, the girl was joyously using her new crutches. Patsy andBeth met her and said they had important news to communicate. Notuntil she was in her own room, seated in a comfortable chair andgazing at them anxiously, did they tell the poor waif of the goodfortune in store for her."Uncle John," announced Patsy, "has invited you to join our party andgo to California with us."Myrtle stared a moment, as if trying to realize what that meant. Thetiny Mumbles, sitting beside the chair with his head cocked to oneside, suddenly made a prodigious leap and landed in Myrtle's lap,where he began licking her chin and wagging his stumpy tail as ifseconding the invitation. As the girl stroked his soft hair her eyesfilled with tears."Oh, you are all so kind to me!" she sobbed, losing her composure."But I can't go! Of course I can't go.""Why not?" asked Beth, smiling."It would be an--impersition!" Poor Myrtle sometimes stumbled over bigwords. "I know that. I can't let you burden your happy party with apoor cripple, just because your hearts are kind and you pity me!""Nonsense!" said Beth. "You're not a cripple, dear; you're just aninvalid, and will soon be as strong as any of us. We have invited you,Myrtle, because we all like you, and shall soon learn to love you. Weare selfish enough to want your companionship. It isn't pity, at all,you see.""I'm mighty glad," added Patsy, "your Uncle Anson ran away fromLeadville. If he hadn't done that we should have had to give youup; but now we may keep you as long as we wish, for you haven't anyparticular engagement to interfere with our plans."All this was said so frankly and unaffectedly that little Myrtle wasled to abandon her suspicion and grew radiant with delight. Indeed,she hugged and squeezed the squirming Mumbles until he resented suchstrenuous fondling and escaped to Patsy's more moderate embraces.Myrtle had never yet ridden in an automobile, and the prospect ofa long journey across the country in a big touring car, withCalifornia's roses and sunshine at the end of it, was certainlyalluring enough to intoxicate one far more accustomed to pleasure thanthis friendless, impoverished girl.After the cousins had explained all their plans to Myrtle and assuredher she was to be their cherished guest for a long time--until she waswell and strong again, at the least--they broached the subject ofher outfit. The poor child flushed painfully while admitting themeagerness of her wardrobe. All her possessions were contained in onesmall canvas "hold-all," and she lacked many necessities which hercallous aunt had suggested that Uncle Anson might be induced to buyfor her once she had joined him in Leadville. Uncle John's nieces grewmore and more indignant as they discovered the details of this selfishwoman's crime--for Patsy declared it was nothing less than a crime tosend a helpless child far into the West to search for an unknown unclewhose whereabouts were only conjectural.That very afternoon Beth and Patsy began shopping for Myrtle, andpresently all sorts of parcels, big and little, began to arrive fortheir new protege. Myrtle was amazed and awed by the splendor of hernew apparel, and could scarcely believe her good fortune. It seemedlike a fairy tale to her, and she imagined herself a Cinderella withtwo fairy godmothers who were young and pretty girls possessing thepurse of Fortunatus and the generosity of Glinda the Good. At night,when she was supposed to be asleep, Myrtle crept from her bed, turnedon the electric light and gloated over her treasures, which she hadalmost feared might vanish into thin air and leave her as desolate asbefore.Next morning, as soon as breakfast was over, the girls took Myrtle outwith them to some of the shops, fitting her to shoes and gloves andhaving her try on some ready-made gowns so that they might be quicklyaltered for her use. Patsy also bought her a set of soft and prettyfurs, thinking she might need them on the journey if the weathercontinued cool, and this seemed to cap the climax of Myrtle'shappiness."What 'stonishes me most," gasped the child, trying to get her breathbetween the surprises she experienced, "is how you can think of somany things to do for me. Of course I know you are rich; but I'venever before heard of rich people being so very generous to poorones.""Once," said Beth, gravely, "we were poor ourselves, Patsy and I, andhad to work hard for our living. That was before our Uncle John cameand gave us a share of his money, together with his love and sympathy.Isn't it natural, my dear, that we should now be eager to share ourgood fortune with you, since we have more money than we can useotherwise, and you are to be our little friend and companion?""Perhaps so," replied Myrtle, smiling gaily and much comforted by theexplanation. "But, oh dear! I'm so glad you found me!""We are glad, too," said Patsy. "But here it is, time for luncheon,and we've wasted the whole morning in shopping. I'm sure the Majorwill be cross if we do not hurry back to the hotel."CHAPTER VA WONDER ON WHEELSBut the Major was not cross when they met him in Uncle John's sittingroom. He beamed upon the three girls most genially, for he likedMyrtle and fully approved all that was being done for her."Of course it's like Patsy," he had said to Mr. Merrick that morning."She couldn't help being a sweet ministering angel if she tried; andBeth is growing more and more like her. It will do those girls good,John, to have some human being to coddle and care for. If Patsy couldhave a fault, it would be wasting so much affection on that bunch o'rags Mumbles, who audaciously chewed up one of my pet slippers while Iwas at dinner last evening. No dog is a fit thing to occupy a girl'stime, and this imp o' mischief Mumbles must take a back seat from nowon."Uncle John laughed, for he knew his brother-in-law had never conqueredhis antipathy for poor Mumbles, and realized why."Take care that you do not get jealous of Myrtle," he replied."You're a selfish old beast, and don't wish Patsy to love anyone butyourself.""And why should she?" was the inquiry. "Any dutiful daughter ought tobe satisfied with loving such a father as I am.""And in that," remarked Uncle John, whimsically, "you remind me ofWampus. You should strut around and say: 'Behold me! I am Patsy'sfather!'"The Major was full of news at luncheon time."What do you think, my dears?" he said, addressing the girls. "Yourcrazy uncle must have had another snooze, unbeknown to us, for he'sgot the wildest idea into his head that human brains--or lack ofthem--ever conceived.""You are not very respectful, sir," retorted Mr. Merrick stiffly,as he ate his salad. "But we must not expect too much of a disabledsoldier--and an Irishman to boot--who has not been accustomed to goodsociety."Major Doyle looked at his brother-in-law with an approving smile."Very well put, John," he said. "You're improving in repartee.Presently you'll add that I'm unlettered and uncivilized, and no fitassociate for a person who has made an egregious fortune out of tincans in the wilds of Oregon.""But what's the news?" asked Patsy impatiently. "What new idea hasUncle John conceived?""First," replied the Major, "he has bought an automobile as big as abaggage car. Next he has engaged a chauffeur who is a wild CanadianIndian with a trace of erratic French blood in his veins--acombination liable to result in anything. Mr. Wampus, the half-breedcalls himself, and from the looks of him he's murdered many a one inhis day.""Oh, Major!""Show me an automobile driver that hasn't. Myrtle knows. It's no trickto knock over a peaceful pedestrian or so, to say nothing of chickens,cats and dogs mangled by the roadside. I confidently expect he'll makea pancake of dear little Mumbles before he's five miles on the road.Eh, Patsy?""Be sensible, Daddy.""It's my strong point. If I'm any judge of character this Wampus is aspeed fiend.""He is recommended as a very careful driver," said Mr. Merrick; "andmoreover he has signed a contract to obey my orders.""Very good," said Beth. "I'm not afraid of Mr. Wampus. What next,Major?""Next," continued Patsy's father, with a solemn wink at the row ofcurious faces, "your inventive relative has ordered the automobilerebuilt, thinking he's wiser than the makers. He's having a furnaceput in it, for one thing--it's a limousine, you know, and all enclosedin glass. Also it's as big as a barn, as I said.""You said a freight car," observed Patsy."True. A small barn or a big freight car. The seats are to be madeconvertible into sleeping berths, so if we get caught out overnight wehave all the comforts of a hotel except the bell boys.""I'll be the bell boy," promised Patsy."Also we're to take a portable kitchen along, like they use in thearmy, with a gasoline stove all complete. The thing fits under theback seat, I believe.""All this," said Beth, "strikes me as being very sensible and a creditto Uncle John's genius. I'm a good cook, as you know, and the kitchenoutfit appeals to me. But how about provisions?""Provisions are being provided," replied her uncle, geniallysmiling at her praise. However scornfully the Major might view hispreparations he was himself mightily proud of them."Tinned stuff, I presume," remarked his brother-in-law. "John Merrickhas a weakness for tin cans, having got his money out of them.""You're wrong," protested Uncle John. "I merely made my money from thetin the cans were made of. But we won't get money out of these canswhen they're opened; it will be something better, such as sardines andhominy, preserved cream and caviar, beans and boned chicken.""Sounds fine!" cried Patsy with enthusiasm. "But how can you arrangeto carry so much, Uncle?""The limousine body is pretty big, as the Major says, and high enoughto allow me to put in a false bottom. In the space beneath it I shallstow all the bedding, the eatables and kitchen utensils, and a smalltent. Then we shall be prepared for whatever happens.""I doubt it," objected the Major. "There's gasoline to be reckonedwith. It's well enough to feed ourselves, but what if we ran short ofthe precious feed for the engines?""The two tanks will hold sixty gallons. That ought to carry us anyreasonable distance," replied Mr. Merrick."You see, Daddy, our Uncle John is an experienced traveler, while youare not," declared Patsy. "In all our journeys together I've found himfull of resources and very farsighted. This trip doesn't worry me atall.""Nor me," added Beth. "We are sure to have a delightful time underUncle's auspices.""Wampus," said Uncle John, "is so pleased with my preparations that hewants us to start in the car from here.""Can you put it on runners, like a sledge?" asked the Major. "That'sthe only way it could travel through this snow. Or perhaps you'll hirea snowplow to go ahead of it.""No; I told Wampus it was impracticable," was the reply. "We shallload our machine on a flat car and ship it to Albuquerque, which is inNew Mexico and almost directly south of Denver. We shall then be overthe worst grades of the Rocky Mountains.""And which way do we go then?" inquired Beth."I have not yet decided. We can go still farther south, into Texas,or make our way down into Phoenix and across the prairies to ImperialValley, or follow the Santa Fe route by way of the Grand Canyon.""Oh, let's go that way!" exclaimed Patsy."And freeze to death?" asked the Major. "It's the northernmost route.""When we get to Albuquerque we will be below the line of frosts andsnow," explained Mr. Merrick. "The climate is genial all through thatsection during winter. Haggerty says--""I guessed it!" groaned the Major. "If Haggerty recommends this tripwe'll surely be in trouble.""Aside from Haggerty, Wampus knows that country thoroughly," saidUncle John stoutly."Tell me: did Haggerty recommend Wampus?""No.""Then there's hopes of the fellow. As you say, John, there is no needto decide until we get to Albuquerque. When do we make the start?""Day after to-morrow. The car will be shipped to-morrow night, but ourparty will follow by daylight, so as to see Colorado Springs, Pike'sPeak and Pueblo as we pass by them."CHAPTER VIWAMPUS SPEEDS"So this is Albuquerque," observed Patsy Doyle, as they alighted fromthe train. "Is it a big town playing peek-a-boo among those hills,Uncle John, or is this really all there is to the place?""It's a pretty big town, my dear. Most of the houses are back on theprairie, but fortunately our hold is just here at the depot."It was a quaint, attractive building, made of adobe cement, in theancient mission style; but it proved roomy and extremely comfortable."Seems to me," whispered Myrtle to Beth, "we're high up on themountains, even yet.""So we are," was the reply. "We're just between Glorietta Pass and theGreat Continental Divide. But the steepest of the Rockies are behindus, and now the slopes are more gradual all the way to California. Howdo you like it, dear?""Oh, the mountains are grand!" exclaimed Myrtle. "I had never imaginedanything so big and stately and beautiful." The other girls had seenmountains before, but this was their friend's first experience, andthey took much pleasure in Myrtle's enthusiastic delight over all shesaw.Adjoining the hotel was a bazaar, in front of which sat squatted uponthe ground two rows of Mojave Indians, mostly squaws, with theircurious wares spread out for sale upon blankets. There must havebeen a score of them, and they exhibited odd pottery ornaments ofindistinguishable shapes, strings of glass beads and beadwork bags,and a few really fine jardinieres and baskets. After the girls hadbeen to their rooms and established themselves in the hotel theyhurried out to interview the Indians, Myrtle Dean supporting herselfby her crutches while Patsy and Beth walked beside her. The lame girlseemed to attract the squaws at once, and one gave her a bead necklacewhile another pressed upon her a small brown earthenware fowl withwhite spots all over it. This latter might have been meant torepresent a goose, an ostrich or a guinea hen; but Myrtle wasdelighted with it and thanked the generous squaw, who responded merelywith a grunt, not understanding English. A man in a wide sombrero whostood lazily by observed the incident and said:"Don't thank the hag. She's selfish. The Mojaven think it brings luckto have a gift accepted by a cripple."Myrtle flushed painfully."I suppose my crutches make me look more helpless than I really am,"she whispered to her friends as they moved away. "But they're such ahelp in getting around that I'm very grateful to have them, and as Iget stronger I can lay them aside and not be taken for a cripple anymore."The air was delightfully invigorating here in the mountains, yet itwas not at all cold. The snow, as Uncle John had predicted, had allbeen left behind them. After dinner they took a walk through thepretty town and were caught in the dark before they could get back.The twilights are very brief in Albuquerque."This is a very old town," remarked Uncle John. "It was founded by aSpanish adventurer named Cabrillo in the seventeenth century, longbefore the United States came into existence. But of course it neveramounted to anything until the railroad was built."Next day they were sitting in a group before the hotel when a man wasseen approaching them with shuffling steps. Uncle John looked at himclosely and Mumbles leaped from Patsy's lap and rushed at the strangerwith excited barks."Why, it's Wampus," said Mr. Merrick. "The car must have arrived."Wampus caught up the baby dog and held it under his arm while he tookhis cap off and bowed respectfully to his employer."He an' me, we here," he announced."Who is 'he,' Wampus?""Aut'mob'l'.""When did you arrive?""Half hour ago. He on side track.""Very good. You have made capital time, for a freight train. Let us goat once and get the car unloaded."Wampus hesitated, looking sheepish."I been arrest," he said."Arrested! For what?""I make speed. They not like it. They arrest me--_Me_--Wampus!" Hestraightened his slim little form with an assumption of dignity."I knew it," sighed the Major. "I decided he was a speed fiend thefirst time I saw him.""But--dear me!" said Uncle John; "how could you be arrested forspeeding when the automobile was on a fiat car?"Wampus glanced over his shoulder. Two railroad men had followed himand were now lounging against the porch railing. One had his right eyebandaged while the other carried one arm in a sling. Both scowled asthey eyed the Canadian fixedly."Freight train make pretty slow time," began the chauffeur. "I knowyou in hurry, so freight train he make me nervous. I say polite toconductor I like to go faster. He laugh. I say polite to brakeman wemust go faster. He make abusing speech. I climb into engine an' saypolite to engineer to turn on steam. He insult me. So I put my footon him an' run engine myself. I am Wampus. I understan' engine--allkinds. Brakeman he swear; he swear so bad I put him off train.Conductor must have lump of coal in eye to keep quiet. Fireman he jus'smile an' whistle soft an' say nothing; so we friends. When I say'shovel in coal,' he shovel. When we pass stations quick like, hewhistle with engine loud. So now we here an' I been arrest."Patsy tittered and stuffed her handkerchief into her mouth. Uncle Johnfirst chuckled and then looked grave. The Major advanced to Wampus andsoberly shook his hand."You're a brave man, sir, for a chauffeur," he said. "I congratulateyou,"Wampus still looked uneasy."I been arrest," he repeated.Uncle John beckoned the railroad men to come forward."Is this story true?" he asked."Most of it, sir," answered the conductor. "It's only by the mercy ofProvidence we're here alive. This scoundrel held up the whole crewand ran away with the engine. We might have had a dozen collisions orsmash-ups, for he went around curves at sixty miles an hour. We'd cutour train in two, so as to pull half of it at a time up the grade atLamy, and so there were only six cars on this end of it. The otherhalf is seventy miles back, and part of what we have here ought tohave been left at the way stations. I can't make out, sir, whetherit's burglary, or highway robbery or arson an' murder he's guilty of,or all of 'em; but I've telegraphed for instructions and I'll hold hima prisoner until the superintendent tells me what to do with him."Mr. Merrick was very sober now."The matter is serious," he said. "This man is in my employ, but I didnot hire him to steal a railway train or fight its crew. Not badlyhurt, I hope, sir?""My eye's pretty bad," growled the conductor. "Tom, here, thought hisarm was broken, at first; but I guess it's only sprained.""How about the brakeman he threw off the train?""Why, we were not going fast, just then, and it didn't hurt him. Wesaw him get up and shake his fist at the robber. If he ever meets Mr.Wampus again he'll murder him.""Come with me to the telegraph office and I'll see what I can do tostraighten this out," said Mr. Merrick briskly. On the way he remarkedto the conductor: "I'm sorry I let Wampus travel alone. He's justa little bit affected in his mind, you know, and at times isn'tresponsible for what he does."The conductor scratched his head doubtfully."I suspected he was crazy," he replied, "and that's why I didn't hurthim. But if he's crazy he's the most deliberate loonatic I ever runacrost."The superintendent had just wired instructions to put the outlaw injail when Mr. Merrick reached the telegraph office, but after an hourspent in sending messages back and forth a compromise was affected andthe little millionaire had agreed to pay a goodly sum to the companyby way of damages and to satisfy the crew of the freight train--whichhe succeeded in doing by a further outlay of money."You're not worth all this bother," said Mr. Merrick to the humbledWampus, when the final settlement had been made, "but chauffeurs arescarce in Albuquerque and I can't be delayed. Never, sir, while youare in my employ, must you allow yourself to be guilty of such an actagain!"Wampus sighed."Never," he promised, "will I ride by freight train again. Send car byexpress. I am Wampus. Freight train he make me nervous."The automobile was quickly unloaded and at once Wampus set to work toget it in running order. He drove it to the hotel at about sundownand Mr. Merrick told the girls to be ready to start after an earlybreakfast the next morning."Which way do we go?" asked the Major."We'll have a talk with Wampus this evening and decide," said UncleJohn."Don't leave out the Grand Canyon!" begged Patsy."Nor the Petrified Forests." added Beth. "And couldn't we visit theMoki Indian reservation?""Those things may be well enough in their way," observed the Major,"but is their way our way? That's the question. The one thing we musttake into consideration is the matter of roads. We must discover whichroad is the best and then take it. We're not out of the mountains yet,and we shall have left the railroad, the last vestige of civilization,behind us."But the conference evolved the fact, according to Wampus, that thebest and safest roads were for a time along the line of the Santa Fe,directly west; and this would enable them to visit most of the scenesthe girls were eager to see."No boulevard in mountain anywhere," remarked Wampus; "but road hegood enough to ride on. Go slow an' go safe. I drive 'Autocrat' fromhere to Los Angeles blindfold."With this assurance they were obliged to be content, and an eagerand joyful party assembled next morning to begin the journey so longlooked forward to. The landlord of the hotel, a man with a carewornface, shook his head dismally and predicted their return toAlbuquerque within twenty-four hours."Of course people _do_ make the trip from here to the coast," he said;"but it's mighty seldom, and they all swear they'll never do it again.It's uncomfortable, and it's dangerous.""Why?" asked Uncle John."You're headed through a wild country, settled only by Mexicans,Indians, and gangs of cowboys still worse. The roads are somethingawful. That man Wampus is an optimist, and will tackle anything andthen be sorry for it afterward. The towns are scattered from here on,and you won't strike a decent meal except at the railway stations.Taking all these things into consideration, I advise you to make yourheadquarters here for the winter.""Thank you," returned Mr. Merrick pleasantly. "It's too late for us toback out now, even if we felt nervous and afraid, which I assure youwe do not.""We are not looking for excessive comfort on this journey, you know,"remarked Patsy. "But thank you for your warning, sir. It has given usgreat pleasure; for if there were no chance of adventure before us weshould all be greatly disappointed."Again the landlord shook his head."Right?" asked Wampus, at the wheel."Go ahead," said Mr. Merrick, and slowly the big car started upon itsjourney into the Golden West.The air was keen and bracing, but not chilly. The sunshine flooded thelandscape on every side. All the windows of the limousine had beenlowered.Myrtle Dean had been established in one corner of the broad back seat,where she nestled comfortably among the cushions. Uncle John satbeside her, with Beth and the Major on the seat on front. There weretwo folding chairs that could be used on occasion, and the back seateasily accommodated three, the "Autocrat" being a seven passenger car;but Patsy was perched in front beside Wampus, which was really thechoicest seat of all, so there was ample room inside to "swing a cat,"as the Major stated--if anyone had cared to attempt such a feat. Ofcourse the wee Mumbles was in Patsy's lap, and he seemed to haveovercome his first aversion of Wampus and accepted the littlechauffeur into the circle of his favored acquaintances. Indeed, theysoon became fast friends.On leaving the town Wampus turned into a smooth, hard wagon road thatran in zigzag fashion near the railroad grade. The car bowled alongright merrily for some twenty miles, when the driver turned to theright and skimmed along a high plateau. It was green and seemedfertile, but scarcely a farmhouse could they see, although the clearair permitted a broad view."He up hill now all way to Continental Divide," said Wampus to Patsy;"then he go down hill long time.""It doesn't seem to be much uphill," returned the girl, "and the roadis very good.""We make time here," observed the driver. "By'm-by we find rock an'bad road. Then we go slow."The Major was watching the new chauffeur carefully, and despite hisdismal forebodings the man seemed not at all reckless but handled hiscar with rare skill. So the critic turned to his brother-in-law andasked:"Is it fully decided which way we shall go?""I've left it to Wampus and the girls," was the reply. "On accountof our little invalid here we shall take the most direct route toCalifornia. It isn't a short route, at that. On Beth's account weshall visit the Moki and Navajo reservations, and on Patsy's accountwe're going by way of the Grand Canyon of Arizona. Wampus says heknows every inch of the road, so for my part I'm content to be just apassenger.""Which remark," said the Major, "indicates that I'm to be just apassenger also. Very well, John; I'm willing. There may be troubleahead of us, but to-day is so magnificent that it's wise to forgeteverything but the present."CHAPTER VIITHE CHAUFFEUR IMPROVESThey all enjoyed that first day's ride. Wampus did not drive fast,for there were places where he couldn't; yet by one o'clock they hadreached Laguna, sixty miles from their starting point. There was anexcellent railway hotel here, so they decided to spend the rest of theday and the night at Laguna and proceed early the next morning.The big car was an object of much curiosity to the natives, and duringthe afternoon Wampus was the center of attraction. Myrtle had stoodthe ride remarkably well, and Uncle John noticed that her eyes werebrighter and a shade of color had already crept into her pale cheeks.Having risen early all three of the girls took a nap during theafternoon, as did Mr. Merrick. The Major gossiped with the stationagent, the most important individual in town, and gleaned sundryinformation that made him look rather glum."I don't say the road's exactly dangerous, mind you," added the man,"but these greasers and Injuns get mischievous, at times, harmlessas they look. All I'm advisin' is that you keep a sharp eye on 'em."Finding Wampus cleaning his car, while a circle of silent, attentiveinhabitants looked on, the Major said to him in a low voice: "Have youa revolver?"Wampus shook his head."Never carry him," he replied. "All gun he make trouble. Sometime heshoot wrong man. Don't like gun. Why should I? I am Wampus!"The Major entered the hotel frowning."That fellow," he muttered, "is a natural-born coward, and we needn'texpect help from him if trouble comes."No trouble came that night, however, and in the early morning, whilethe sky was still reddened by the rising sun, they were off again,following more closely now the railroad, as rocky defiles began toloom up before them.By the zigzag course they were obliged to take it was ninety miles toGallup, and this they easily made, despite the growing steepness ofthe mountain road. Here was the famous Continental Divide, and theState of Arizona lay just beyond. The Continental Divide is the ridgethat separates the streams tributary to the Atlantic ocean from thosetributary to the Pacific, so that after crossing it one might wellfeel that at last the East was left behind and the great West with itsromance now faced him.They came to the little town in time to see the gorgeous sunset fromthis, the highest point of the Rockies, and especially to Myrtle, whohad traveled so little, was the sight impressive and awe inspiring.There was a small but fairly good hotel in the place, and after supperPatsy and Beth went out for a stroll, being much interested in thedark-skinned Mexicans and still darker Indians who constituted farthe larger part of the population. The party had everywhere met withrespect from these people, who, although curious, were silent andwell-behaved; so Uncle John and the Major, deep in a politicalargument on the hotel porch, had no thought of danger when they sawthe two girls start away arm in arm.The sky was still aglow, although the sun had set, and in the subduedlight the coarse adobe huts and rickety frame dwellings were endowedwith a picturesque appearance they did not really possess. Beth andPatsy came to the end of the main street rather suddenly, and stood amoment looking at the shadows cast by the rocky cliffs near by. Someof the peaks had snow upon them, and there was a chill in the air, nowthat the sun had withdrawn its warmth. The girls turned presently andtook another route that might bring them quicker to the hotel, but hadonly proceeded a short way when in passing a rather solitary adobestructure a man stepped from the shadow of the wall and confrontedthem. He wore a red flannel shirt and a broad sombrero, the latterscarcely covering his dark, evil features.The cousins stopped short. Then Beth whispered: "Let's go the otherway." But as they were about to turn the Mexican drew a revolver andsaid in harsh, uneven English: "You halt. Keep a-still, or I shoot.""What do you want?" asked Beth, quietly."Money. All you got. Jew'lry--all you got. Give 'm quick, or I shoot!"As they stood hesitating a sound of footsteps was heard and someoneapproached quickly from behind them. Patsy looked hurriedly aroundand saw Wampus. He was walking with his thin little form bent and hishands deep in his trousers pockets. Incidentally Wampus was smokingthe stub of a cigar, as was his custom when off duty.The Mexican saw him, but marking his small size and mild manner didnot flinch from his position. With one revolver still leveled at thegirls he drew another from a hip pocket and turned it upon Wampus."You stop--halt!" he exclaimed fiercely.Wampus did not halt. His eyes fixed upon the bandit's ugly features,still puffing his cigar and with hands in his pockets he walkeddeliberately past Patsy and Beth and straight up to the muzzles of therevolvers."Stop!" cried the Mexican; and again: "Stop!"Wampus stopped when one revolver nearly touched his nose and anothercovered his body. Slowly he drew one hand from his pocket and graspedthe barrel of the nearest weapon."Let him go," he said, not raising his voice. The man stared into thelittle chauffeur's eyes and released his hold of the revolver. Wampuslooked at it, grunted, and put it in his pocket."Now the other gun," he said.The fellow drew back and half turned, as if to escape."No, no!" said Wampus, as if annoyed. "You give me gun. See--I amWampus!"Sheepishly enough the Mexican surrendered the other weapon."Now turn aroun' an' go to hotel," commanded the chauffeur.The man obeyed. Wampus turned to the girls, who were now not onlyrelieved but on the verge of laughter and said deprecatingly:"Do not be scare, for poor man he make no harm. He jus' try agoozle--no dare shoot here in town. Then come; I go back with you."Silently they accompanied him along the lane, the Mexican keeping infront and looking around from time to time to see if they followed.A short distance from the hotel Wampus gave a queer whistle whichbrought the bandit cringing to his side. Without ado he handed thefellow his two revolvers and said calmly: "Go 'long."The Mexican "went along" briskly and the dusk soon swallowed him up."Thank you, Wampus," said Patsy, gratefully; "you've saved us from adreadful experience.""Oh, that!" snapping his fingers scornfully. "He not a good bad-man,for he too much afraid. I have no gun, for I do not like gun. Still,if I not come, he make you give him money an' trinkets.""You were very kind," replied Beth, "and I thank you as much as Patsydoes. If you had not arrived just when you did I might have killed theman.""You?" inquired Wampus, doubtingly."Yes." She showed him a small pearl-handled revolver which she carriedin the pocket of her jacket. "I can shoot, Wampus."The little chauffeur grinned; then looked grave and shook his head."It make funny world, these day," said he. "One time girl from citywould scream to see a gun; now she carry him in pocket an' can shoot!Ver' fine; ver' fine. But I like me old style girl who make scream.Then a man not feel foolish when he try protect her."Patsy laughed merrily; but Beth saw he was offended and hastened tosay:"I am very grateful to you, Wampus, and I know you are a brave andtrue man. I shall expect you to protect me at all times, for I reallydon't wish to shoot anyone, although I think it best to carry arevolver. Always after this, before I am tempted to fire, I shall lookto see if you are not near me.""All right," he said more cheerfully. "I am Wampus. I will be there,Miss 'Lizbeth."CHAPTER VIIIAMONG THE INDIANSLittle Myrtle grew brighter day by day. She even grew merry anddeveloped a fine sense of humor, showing new traits in her hithertoundeveloped character. The girl never mentioned her injury noradmitted that she suffered any pain, even when directly questioned.Indeed she was not uncomfortable during that splendid automobile rideover mountain and plain into the paradise of the glowing West. Neverbefore in her life had Myrtle enjoyed an outing, except for an hour ortwo in a city park; never before had she known a friend to care forher and sympathize honestly with her griefs. Therefore this experiencewas so exquisitely delightful that her responsive heart nearly burstwith gratitude. Pretty thoughts came to her that she had never hadbefore; her luxurious surroundings led her to acquire dainty ways anda composed and self-poised demeanor."Our rosebud is unfolding, petal by petal, and beginning to bloomgloriously," said Patsy to sympathetic Uncle John. "Could anyone bemore sweet or lovely?"Perhaps almost any girl, situated as Myrtle Dean was, would haveblossomed under similar influences. Certain it was that Uncle Johncame to have a tender affection for the poor child, while the Major'sbig heart had warmed from the first toward the injured girl. Beth andPatsy were devoted to their new friend and even Mumbles was never sohappy as when Myrtle would hold and caress him. Naturally the formerwaif responded freely to all this wealth of affection and strove to becompanionable and cheery, that they might forget as much as possibleher physical helplessness.Mumbles was not the least important member of the party, but proveda constant source of amusement to all. In the novel domains they nowtraversed the small dog's excitable nature led him to investigateeverything that seemed suspicious, but he was so cowardly, in spite ofthis, that once when Patsy let him down to chase a gopher or prairiedog--they were not sure which--the animal turned at bay and sentMumbles retreating with his stubby tail between his legs. Hiscomradeship for Wampus surprised them all. The Canadian would talkseriously to the dog and tell it long stories as if the creature couldunderstand every word--which perhaps he did. Mumbles would sit upbetween the driver and Patsy and listen attentively, which encouragedWampus to talk until Patsy in self-defense turned and tossed the fuzzyanimal in to Myrtle, who was always glad to receive him.But Patsy did not always sit on the front seat. That honor was dividedamong them all, by turns, except the Major, who did not care for theplace. Yet I think Patsy rode there oftener than anyone else, and itcame to be considered her special privilege because she had firstclaimed it.The Major, after the incident at Gallup, did not scorn Wampus soopenly as before; but he still reserved a suspicion that the fellowwas at heart a coward and a blusterer. The chauffeur's sole demerit inthe eyes of the others was his tremendous egotism. The proud remark:"I am Wampus!" was constantly on his lips and he had wonderful talesto tell to all who would listen of his past experiences, in every oneof which he unblushingly figured as the hero. But he really handledthe big touring car in an admirable manner, and when one afternoona tire was punctured by a cactus spine by the roadside--their firstaccident--they could not fail to admire the dexterous manner in whichhe changed the tube for a new one.From Gallup they took a wagon road to Fort Defiance, in the NavajoIndian reservation; but the Navajos proved uninteresting people, noteven occupying themselves in weaving the famous Navajo blankets, whichare now mostly made in Philadelphia. Even Patsy, who had longed to"see the Indians in their native haunts," was disgusted by their filthand laziness, and the party expected no better results when they cameto the adjoining Moki reservation. Here, however, they were happilydisappointed, for they arrived at the pueblo of Oraibi, one ofthe prettiest villages on the mesa, on the eve of one of theircharacteristic snake dances, and decided to remain over night andsee the performance. Now I am not sure but the "Snake Dance" was soopportune because Uncle John had a private interview with the nativechieftain, at which the head Snake Priest and the head Antelope Priestof the tribe were present. These Indians spoke excellent English andthe chief loved the white man's money, so a ceremony that has beenheld during the month of August for many centuries--long before theSpanish conquistadors found this interesting tribe--was found to be ontap for that very evening. The girls were tremendously excited at theprospect and Wampus was ordered to prepare camp for the night--thefirst they had spent in their automobile and away from a hotel. Notonly was the interior of the roomy limousine converted into sleepingquarters for the three girls, but a tent was spread, one side fastenedto the car while the other was staked to the ground. Three wirefolding cots came from some hidden place beneath the false bottom ofthe car, with bedding enough to supply them, and these were for theuse of the men in the tent. The two "bedrooms" having been thusprepared, Wampus lighted the tiny gasoline stove, over which Patsy andBeth enthusiastically cooked the supper. Beth wanted to "Newburg" thetinned lobster, and succeeded in creaming it very nicely. They hadpotato chips, coffee and toasted Holland rusks, as well, and allthoroughly enjoyed the improvised meal.Their camp had been pitched just at the outskirts of the Indianvillage, but the snake dance was to take place in a rocky glen somedistance away from the pueblo and so Uncle John instructed Wampus toremain and guard their outfit, as the Moki are notorious thieves. Theyleft the lean little chauffeur perched upon the driver's seat, smokingone of his "stogie" cigars and with Mumbles sitting gravely besidehim.Myrtle hobbled on her crutches between Beth and Patsy, who carriedlittle tin lanterns made with lamp chimneys that had candles insidethem. They first visited the chief, who announced that the ceremonieswere about to begin. At a word from this imposing leader a big Indiancaught up Myrtle and easily carried her on his shoulder, as if shewere light as a feather, leading the way to the rocky amphitheatre.Here were assembled all the inhabitants of the village, forming a widecircle around the performers. The snakes were in a pit dug in thecenter of the space, over which a few branches had been placed. Thisis called the "kisi."These unique and horrifying snake dances of the Moki have beendescribed so often that I need not speak of this performance indetail. Before it was half over the girls wished they were back intheir automobile; but the Major whispered that for them to leave wouldcause great offense to the Indians and might result in trouble. Thedance is supposedly a religious one, in honor of the Rain God, and atfirst the snakes were not used, but as the dancers became wrought upand excited by their antics one by one they reached within the kisiand drew out a snake, allowing the reptiles to coil around theiralmost naked bodies and handling them with seeming impunity. A fewwere harmless species, as bull snakes and arrow snakes; but mostly theMoki used rattlesnakes, which are native to the mesa and its rockycliffs. Some travelers have claimed that the fangs of the rattlers aresecretly withdrawn before the creatures are handled, but this has beenproved to be untrue. The most accepted theory is that the snakes arenever permitted to coil, and cannot strike unless coiled, while theweird chanting and graceful undulating motions of the dancers in somemanner "charms" or intoxicates the serpents, which are not aroused toantagonism. Occasionally, however, one of the Moki priests is bitten,in which case nothing is done to aid him and he is permitted to die,it being considered a judgment of the Rain God for some sin he hascommitted.The barbaric rites seemed more picturesque, as well as more revolting,in that they took place by the flickering light of torches andbonfires in a rock strewn plain usually claimed by nature. When thedancers were more frenzied they held the squirming serpents in theirmouths by the middle and allowed them to coil around their necks,dancing wildly the while. The whole affair was so nauseating andoffensive that as soon as it was possible the visitors withdrew andretired to their "camp." It was now almost midnight, but the path waslighted by the little lanterns they carried.As they approached the automobile Uncle John was disturbed not to seeWampus at his post. A light showed from the front of the car, but thechauffeur seemed to be missing. Coming nearer, however, they soonwere greeted by a joyous barking from Mumbles and discovered Wampussquatting upon the ground, puffing at the small end of the cigar andseeming quite composed and tranquil."What are you doing there?" demanded the Major, raising his lanternthe better to light the scene."I play jailer," grunted Wampus, without moving. "Him want to steal;Mumble he make bark noise; for me, I steal too--I steal Injun."A dusky form, prone upon the ground, began to squirm under Wampus, whowas then discovered to be sitting upon a big Indian and holding himprisoner. The chauffeur, partly an Indian himself, knew well how tomanage his captive and quieted the fellow by squeezing his throat withhis broad stubby fingers."How long have you had him there?" inquired Uncle John, looking at thediscomfited "brave" curiously."About an hour," was the reply."Let him go, then. We have no prison handy, and the man has perhapsbeen punished enough.""I have wait to ask permission to kill him," said Wampus solemnly. "Heknow English talk, an' I have told him he is to die. I have describe,sir, several torture we make on Injun who steal, which make him thinkhe die several time. So he is now prepare for the worst."The Indiam squirmed again, and with a sigh Wampus arose and set himfree."See," he said; "you are save only by mercy of Great White Chief. Youver' lucky Injun. But Great White Chief will leave only one eye herewhen he go away. If you try to steal again the eye will see, an' thenthe torture I have describe will be yours. I am Wampus. I have spoke."The Indian listened intently and then slunk away into the darknesswithout reply. The night had no further event and in spite of theirunusual experiences all slept excellently and awoke in the morningrefreshed and ready for new adventures.CHAPTER IXNATURE'S MASTERPIECEFrom the reservation to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado was not far,but there was no "crosscut" and so they were obliged to make a widedetour nearly to Williams before striking the road that wound upwardto the world's greatest wonder.Slowly and tediously the big car climbed the miserable trail to therim of the Grand Canyon. It was night when they arrived, for they hadtimed it that way, having been told of the marvelous beauty of thecanyon by moonlight. But unfortunately the sky filled with cloudstoward evening, and they came to Bright Angel, their destination, in adrizzling rain and total darkness. The Major was fearful Wampus mightrun them into the canyon, but the machine's powerful searchlightsshowed the way clearly and by sticking to the road they finally drewup before an imposing hotel such as you might wonder to find in soremote a spot.Eagerly enough they escaped from the automobile where they had beenshut in and entered the spacious lobby of the hotel, where a merrythrong of tourists had gathered."Dinner and bed," said Patsy, decidedly. "I'm all tired out, and poorMyrtle is worn to a frazzle. There's no chance of seeing the canyonto-night, and as for the dancing, card playing and promiscuous gaiety,it doesn't appeal much to a weary traveler."The girls were shown to a big room at the front of the hotel, havingtwo beds in it. A smaller connecting-room was given to Myrtle, whilePatsy and Beth shared the larger apartment. It seems the hotel, bigas it was, was fairly filled with guests, the railway running threetrains a day to the wonderful canyon; but Uncle John's nieces didnot mind occupying the same room, which was comfortably and evenluxuriously furnished.A noise of footsteps along the corridor disturbed Patsy at an earlyhour. She opened her eyes to find the room dimly lighted, as by thefirst streaks of dawn, and sleepily arose to raise the window shadeand see if day was breaking. Her hand still upraised to guide theshade the girl stood as motionless as if turned to stone. With a longdrawn, gasping breath she cried: "Oh, Beth!" and then stood staring atwhat is undoubtedly the most entrancing, the most awe inspiring and atthe same time the most magnificent spectacle that mortal eye has everbeheld--sunrise above the Grand Canyon of Arizona.The master painters of the world have gathered in this spot in a vainattempt to transfer the wondrous coloring of the canyon to canvas.Authors famed for their eloquent command of language have striven asvainly to tell to others what their own eyes have seen; how theirsenses have been thrilled and their souls uplifted by the marvel thatGod's hand has wrought. It can never be pictured. It can never bedescribed. Only those who have stood as Patricia Doyle stood thatmorning and viewed the sublime masterpiece of Nature can realize whatthose homely words, "The Grand Canyon" mean. Grand? It is well named.Since no other adjective can better describe it, that much abused onemay well be accepted to incompletely serve its purpose.Beth joined her cousin at the window and was instantly as awedand absorbed as Patsy. Neither remembered Myrtle just then, butfortunately their friend had left the connecting door of theirrooms ajar and hearing them stirring came in to see if anything hadhappened. She found the two cousins staring intently from the windowand went to the second window herself, thus witnessing the spectaclein all its glory.Even after the magnificent coloring of sunrise had faded the sight wasone to rivet the attention. The hotel seemed built at the very edge ofthe canyon, and at their feet the ground appeared to fall away and agreat gulf yawned that was tinted on all its diverse sides with huesthat rivaled those of the rainbow. Across the chasm they could clearlysee the trees and hills; yet these were fully thirteen miles distant,for here is one of the widest portions of the great abyss."I'm going to dress," said Beth, breaking the silence at last. "Itseems a sin to stay cooped up in here when such a glorious panorama isat one's feet."The others did not reply in words, but they all began to dresstogether with nervous haste, and then made their way down to thecanyon's brink. Others were before them, standing upon the ampleporches in interested groups; but such idleness would not content ourgirls, who trooped away for a more intimate acquaintance with thewonderful gorge."Oh, how small--how terribly small--I am!" cried Patsy, lost inthe immensity of the canyon's extent; but this is a common cry oftravelers visiting Bright Angel. You might place a baker's dozen ofthe huge Falls of Niagara in the Grand Canyon and scarcely notice theywere there. All the vast cathedrals of Europe set upon its plateauwould seem like pebbles when viewed from the brink. The thing issimply incomprehensible to those who have not seen it.Presently Uncle John and the Major came out to join them and they allwandered along the edge until they came to a huge rock that juttedout far over the monster gulf. On the furthermost point of this rock,standing with his feet at the very brink, was a tall, thin man, hisback toward them. It seemed a fearful thing to do--to stand where theslightest slip would send him reeling into the abyss."It's like tempting fate," whispered Patsy, a safe distance away. "Iwish he would step back a little."As if he had overheard her the man half turned and calmly examined thegroup. His eyes were an almost colorless blue, his features destituteof any expression. By his dress he seemed well-to-do, if notprosperous, yet there was a hint of melancholy in his poise and abouthim a definite atmosphere of loneliness.After that one deliberate look he turned again and faced the canyon,paying no attention to the interested little party that hovered farenough from the edge to avoid any possible danger."Oh, dear!" whispered Myrtle, clinging to Beth's arm with tremblingfingers, "I'm afraid he's going to--to commit suicide!""Nonsense!" answered Beth, turning pale nevertheless.The figure was motionless as before. Uncle John and the Major startedalong the path but as Beth attempted to follow them Myrtle broke awayfrom her and hobbled eagerly on her crutches toward the stranger. Shedid not go quite to the end of the jutting rock, but stopped some feetaway and called in a low, intense voice:"Don't!"The man turned again, with no more expression in his eyes or face thanbefore. He looked at Myrtle steadily a moment, then turned and slowlyleft the edge, walking to firm ground and back toward the hotelwithout another glance at the girl."I'm so ashamed," said Myrtle, tears of vexation in her eyes as sherejoined her friends. "But somehow I felt I must warn him--it was animpulse I just couldn't resist.""Why, no harm resulted, in any event, my dear," returned Beth. "Iwouldn't think of it again."They took so long a walk that all were nearly famished when theyreturned to the hotel for breakfast.Of course Patsy and Beth wanted to go down Bright Angel Trail into thedepths of the canyon, for that is the thing all adventurous spiritslove to do."I'm too fat for such foolishness," said Uncle John, "so I'll stay uphere and amuse Myrtle."The Major decided to go, to "look after our Patsy;" so the threejoined the long line of daring tourists and being mounted on docile,sure-footed burros, followed the guide down the trail.Myrtle and Uncle John spent the morning on the porch of the hotel. Atbreakfast the girl had noticed the tall man they had encountered atthe canyon's edge quietly engaged in eating at a small table in a farcorner of the great dining room. During the forenoon he came from thehotel to the porch and for a time stood looking far away over thecanyon.Aroused to sympathy by the loneliness of this silent person, UncleJohn left his chair and stood beside him at the railing."It's a wonderful sight, sir," he remarked in his brisk, sociable way;"wonderful indeed!"For a moment there was no reply."It seems to call one," said the man at length, as if to himself. "Itcalls one.""It's a wonder to me it doesn't call more people to see it," observedMr. Merrick, cheerfully. "Think of this magnificent thing--greater andgrander than anything the Old World can show, being here right in theheart of America, almost--and so few rush to see it! Why, in time tocome, sir," he added enthusiastically, "not to have seen the GrandCanyon of Arizona will be an admission of inferiority. It's--it's thebiggest thing in all the world!"The stranger made no reply. He had not even glanced at Uncle John. Nowhe slowly turned and stared fixedly at Myrtle for a moment, till shecast down her eyes, blushing. Then he re-entered the hotel; nor was heagain seen by them.The little man was indignant at the snub. Rejoining Myrtle he said toher:"That fellow wasn't worth saving--if you really saved him, my dear. Hesays the canyon calls one, and for all I care he may go to the bottomby any route he pleases."Which speech showed that gentle, kindly Mr. Merrick was reallyannoyed. But a moment later he was all smiles again and Myrtle foundhim a delightful companion because he knew so well how to readpeople's thoughts, and if they were sad had a tactful way of cheeringthem.The girls and the Major returned from their trip to the plateau fullof rapture at their unique experiences."I wouldn't have missed it for a million dollars!" cried the Major;but he added: "and you couldn't hire me to go again for two million!""It was great," said Patsy; "but I'm tuckered out.""I had nineteen narrow escapes from sudden death," began Beth, but hercousin interrupted her by saying: "So had everyone in the party;and if the canyon had caved in we'd all be dead long ago. Stop yourchattering now and get ready for dinner. I'm nearly starved."Next morning they took a farewell view of the beautiful scene and thenclimbed into their automobile to continue their journey. Many of thetourists had wondered at their temerity in making such a long tripthrough a poorly settled country in a motor car and had plied themwith questions and warnings. But they were thoroughly enjoying thisouting and nothing very disagreeable had happened to them so far. I amsure that on this bright, glorious morning you could not have hiredany one of the party to abandon the automobile and finish the trip bytrain.CHAPTER XA COYOTE SERENADEThe roads were bad enough. They were especially bad west of Williams.Just now an association of automobile tourists has been formed tocreate a boulevard route through from the Atlantic to the Pacificcoast, but at the time of this story no attention had been given theroads of the far West and only the paths of the rancheros from town totown served as guides. On leaving Williams they turned south so as toavoid the more severe mountain roads, and a fine run through a ratheruninteresting country brought them to Prescott on the eve of thesecond day after leaving the Canyon. Here they decided to take a day'srest, as it was Sunday and the hotel was comfortable; but Mondaymorning they renewed their journey and headed southwesterly across thealkali plains--called "mesa"--for Parker, on the boundary line betweenArizona and California.Towns of any sort were very scarce in this section and the country waswild and often barren of vegetation for long stretches. There weresome extensive ranches, however, as this is the section favored forsettlement by a class of Englishmen called "remittance men." These aremostly the "black sheep" or outcasts of titled families, who havinggot into trouble of some sort at home, are sent to America to isolatethemselves on western ranches, where they receive monthly or quarterlyremittances of money to support them. The remittance men are poorfarmers, as a rule. They are idle and lazy except when it comes toriding, hunting and similar sports. Their greatest industry is cattleraising, yet these foreign born "cowboys" constitute an entirelydifferent class from those of American extraction, found in Texas andon the plains of the Central West. They are educated and to an extentcultured, being "gentlemen born" but sad backsliders in the practiseof the profession. Because other ranchers hesitate to associate withthem they congregate in settlements of their own, and here in Arizona,on the banks of the Bill Williams Branch of the Colorado River, theyform almost the total population.Our friends had hoped to make the little town of Gerton for the night,but the road was so bad that Wampus was obliged to drive slowly andcarefully, and so could not make very good time. Accidents beganto happen, too, doubtless clue to the hard usage the machine hadreceived. First a spring broke, and Wampus was obliged to halt longenough to clamp it together with stout steel braces. An hour later thefront tire was punctured by cactus spines, which were thick upon theroad. Such delays seriously interfered with their day's mileage.Toward sunset Uncle John figured, from the information he had receivedat Prescott, that they were yet thirty miles from Gerton, and so hedecided to halt and make camp while there was yet sufficient daylightremaining to do so conveniently."We might hunt for a ranch house and beg for shelter," said he, "butfrom the stories I've heard of the remittance men I am sure we willenjoy ourselves better if we rely entirely upon our own resources."The girls were, of course, delighted at the prospect of such anexperience, for the silent, solitary mesa made them feel they wereindeed "in the wilds of the Great American Desert." The afternoon hadbeen hot and the ride dusty, but there was now a cooler feeling in theair since the sun had fallen low in the horizon.They carried their own drinking water, kept ice-cold in thermosbottles, and Uncle John also had a thermos tub filled with smallsquares of ice. This luxury, in connection with their ample supplyof provisions, enabled the young women to prepare a supper not to besurpassed in any modern hotel. The soup came from one can, the curriedchicken from another, while artichokes, peas, asparagus and plumpudding shed their tin coverings to complete the meal. Fruits, cheeseand biscuits they had in abundance, so there was no hardship incamping out on a deserted Arizona table-land, as far as food wasconcerned. The Interior of the limousine, when made into berths forthe three girls, was as safe and cosy as a Pullman sleeping coach.Only the men's quarters, the "lean-to" tent, was in any way open toinvasion.After the meal was ended and the things washed and put away they allsat on folding camp chairs outside the little tent and enjoyed theintense silence surrounding them. The twilight gradually deepened intodarkness. Wampus kept one of the searchlights lit to add an element ofcheerfulness to the scene, and Myrtle was prevailed upon to sing oneor two of her simple songs. She had a clear, sweet voice, although nota strong one, and they all--especially Uncle John--loved to hear hersing.Afterward they talked over their trip and the anticipated change fromthis arid region to the verdure of California, until suddenly a long,bloodcurdling howl broke the stillness and caused them one and allto start from their seats. That is, all but Wampus. The chauffeur,sitting apart with his black cigar in his mouth, merely nodded andsaid: "Coyote."The Major coughed and resumed his seat. Uncle John stood looking intothe darkness as if trying to discern the creature."Are coyotes considered dangerous?" he asked the Canadian."Not to us," replied Wampus. "Sometime, if one man be out on mesaalone, an' plenty coyote come, he have hard fight for life. Coyote iswild dog. He is big coward unless pretty hungry. If I leave light burnhe never come near us.""Then let it burn--all night," said Mr. Merrick. "There he goesagain--and another with him! What a horrible wail it is.""I rather like it," said Patsy, with her accustomed calmness. "It iscertainly an added experience to be surrounded by coyotes. Probablyour trip wouldn't have been complete without it.""A little of that serenade will suffice me," admitted Beth, as thehowls grew nearer and redoubled in volume.Myrtle's eyes were big and earnest. She was not afraid, but there wassomething uncanny in being surrounded by such savage creatures.Nearer and nearer sounded the howls, until it was easy to see a dozenfierce eyes gleaming in the darkness, not a stone's throw away fromthe camp."I guess you girls had better go to bed," remarked Uncle John, a bitnervously. "There's no danger, you know--none at all. Let the bruteshowl, if they want to--especially as we can't stop them. But you aretired, my dears, and I'd like to see you settled for the night."Somewhat reluctantly they entered the limousine, drew the curtains andprepared for bed. Certainly they were having a novel experience, andif Uncle John would feel easier to have them listen to the howlingcoyotes from inside the limousine instead of outside, they could notwell object to his request.Presently Wampus asked the Major for his revolver, and on obtainingthe weapon he walked a few paces toward the coyotes and fired a shotinto their group. They instantly scattered and made off, only toreturn in a few moments to their former position."Will they continue this Grand Opera chorus all night?" asked UncleJohn."Perhap," said Wampus. "They hungry, an' smell food. Coyote can noreason. If he could, he know ver' well we never feed him.""The next time we come this way let us fetch along a ton or so ofcoyote feed," suggested the Major. "I wonder what the poor bruteswould think if they were stuffed full for once in their lives?""It have never happen, sir," observed Wampus, shaking his headgravely. "Coyote all born hungry; he live hungry; he die hungry. Ifever coyote was not hungry he would not be coyote.""In that case, Major," said Uncle John, "let us go to bed and try tosleep. Perhaps in slumber we may forget these howling fiends.""Very well," agreed Major Doyle, rising to enter the little tent.Wampus unexpectedly interposed. "Wait," called the little chauffeur."Jus' a minute, if you please."While the Major and Mr. Merrick stood wondering at the request, theCanadian, who was still holding the revolver in one hand, picked asteel rod from the rumble of the automobile and pushing aside the flapof the little tent entered. The tail-lamp of the car burned inside,dimly lighting the place.The Major was about to follow Wampus when a revolver shot arrestedhim. This sound was followed by a quick thumping against the ground ofthe steel bar, and then Wampus emerged from the tent holding a dark,squirming object on the end of the rod extended before him."What is it?" asked Mr. Merrick, somewhat startled."Rattlesnake," said Wampus, tossing the thing into the sagebrush. "Isee him crawl in tent while you eat supper.""Why did you not tell us?" cried the Major excitedly."I thought him perhaps crawl out again. Him sometime do that. But no.Mister snake he go sleep in tent which is reserve for his superior. Isay nothing, for I do not wish to alarm the young ladies. That is whyI hold the dog Mumble so tight, for he small eye see snake too, an'fool dog wish to go fight him. Rattlesnake soon eat Mumble up--eh? Butnever mind; there is no worry. I am Wampus, an' I am here. You go tobed now, an' sleep an' be safe."He said this rather ostentatiously, and for that reason neither of theothers praised his watchful care or his really brave act. That Wampuswas proving himself a capable and faithful servant even the Major wasforced to admit, yet the man's bombast and self-praise robbed him ofany word of commendation he justly earned."I think," said Uncle John, "I'll bunk on the front seat to-night. I'mshort, you see, and will just about curl up in the space. I believesnakes do not climb up wheels. Make my bed on the front seat, Wampus."The man grinned but readily obeyed. The Major watched himthoughtfully."For my part," he said, "I'll have a bed made on top the roof.""Pshaw!" said Uncle John; "you'll scratch the paint.""That is a matter of indifference to me," returned the Major."You'll roll off, in your sleep, and hurt yourself.""I'll risk that, sir.""Are you afraid, Major?""Afraid! Me? Not when I'm awake, John. But what's to prevent more ofthose vermin from crawling into the tent during the night?""Such thing very unusual." remarked Wampus, placing the last blanketon Mr. Merrick's improvised bed. "Perhaps you sleep in tent a week an'never see another rattler.""Just the same," concluded the Major, "I'll have my bed on top thelimousine."He did, Wampus placing blankets and a pillow for him without a word ofprotest. The Major climbed over Uncle John and mounted to the roof ofthe car, which sloped to either side but was broad and long enoughto accommodate more than one sleeper. Being an old campaigner and ashrewd tactician, Major Doyle made two blankets into rolls, which heplaced on either side of him, to "anchor" his body in position. Thenhe settled himself to rest beneath the brilliant stars while thecoyotes maintained their dismal howling. But a tired man soon becomesinsensible to even such annoyances.The girls, having entered the limousine from the door opposite thetent, were all unaware of the rattlesnake episode and supposed theshot had been directed against the coyotes. They heard the Majorclimbing upon the roof, but did not demand any explanation, being deepin those bedtime confidences so dear to all girls. Even they cameto disregard the persistent howls of the coyotes, and in time fellasleep.Wampus did not seem afraid of snakes. The little chauffeur went to bedin the tent and slept soundly upon his cot until daybreak, when thecoyotes withdrew and the Canadian got up to make the coffee.The Major peered over the edge of the roof to watch him. He had asleepy look about his eyes, as if he had not rested well. Uncle Johnwas snoring with gentle regularity and the girls were still asleep."Wampus," said the Major, "do you know the proper definition of afool?"Wampus reflected, stirring the coffee carefully."I am not--what you call him?--a dictionairre; no. But I am Wampus. Ihave live much in very few year. I would say a fool is man who thinkhe is wise. For what is wise? Nothing!"The Major felt comforted."It occurred to me," he said, beginning to climb down from the roof,"that a fool was a man who left a good home for this uncomfortablelife on a barren desert. This country wasn't made for humans; itbelongs to the coyotes and the rattlesnakes. What right have we tointrude upon them, then?"Wampus did not reply. It was not his business to criticise hisemployers.CHAPTER XIA REAL ADVENTURE AT LASTUncle John woke up when the Major inadvertently placed a heel upon hisround stomach on the way to the ground. The chubby little millionairehad slept excellently and was in a genial humor this morning. Hehelped Wampus fry the bacon and scramble the eggs, while the Majorcalled the girls.It proved a glorious sunrise and the air was full of pure ozone. Theyhad suffered little from cold during the trip, although it was inthe dead of winter and the altitude considerable. Just now they weregetting closer to California every hour, and when they descended fromthe mesa it would gradually grow warmer.They were all becoming expert at "breaking camp," and preparing forthe road. Beth and Patsy put away the bedding and "made up" theinterior of the limousine for traveling. The Major and Uncle Johnfolded the tent and packed it away, while Wampus attended to thedishes and tinware and then looked over his car. In a surprisinglyshort time they were all aboard and the big machine was gliding overthe faint trail.The mesa was not a flat or level country, for they were still near tothe mountain ranges. The way was up hill and down, in gentle slopes,and soon after starting they breasted the brow of a hill and wereconfronted by half a dozen mounted men, who seemed as much astonishedat the encounter as they were.It being an event to meet anyone in this desolate place Wampusinvoluntarily brought the car to a halt, while the riders lined upbeside it and stared rather rudely at the party. They were dressed ascowboys usually are, with flannel shirts, chapelets and sombrero hats;but their faces were not rugged nor healthy, as is the case with mostWestern cowboys, but bore marks of dissipation and hard living."Remittance men," whispered Wampus.Uncle John nodded. He had heard of this curious class. Especially werethe men staring at the three pretty, feminine faces that peered fromthe interior of the limousine. They had remained silent thus far, butnow one of them, a fellow with dark eyes and a sallow complexion,reined his horse nearer the car and removed his hat with a sweepinggesture that was not ungraceful."A merry morning to you, fair ladies--or angels--I much misdoubt whichwe have chanced upon. Anyhow, welcome to Hades!"Uncle John frowned. He did not like the bantering, impudent tone. Bethflushed and turned aside her head; Myrtle shrank back in her cornerout of sight; but Patsy glared fixedly at the speaker with anexpression that was far from gracious. The remittance man did not seemdaunted by this decided aversion. A sneering laugh broke from hiscompanions, and one of them cried:"Back up, Algy, and give your betters a chance. You're out of it, oldman.""I have no betters," he retorted. Then, turning to the girls again andignoring the presence of the men accompanying them, he continued:"Beauteous visions, since you have wilfully invaded the territory ofHades Ranch, of which diabolical domain I, Algernon Tobey, am by graceof his Satanic majesty the master, I invite you to become my guestsand participate in a grand ball which I shall give this evening inyour honor."His comrades laughed again, and one of them shouted:"Good for you, Algy. A dance--that's the thing!""Why, we haven't had the chance of a dance for ages," said anotherapprovingly."Because we have had no ladies to dance with," explained Algy. "Buthere are three come to our rescue--perhaps more, if I could see insidethat barricade--and they cannot refuse us the pleasure of theirsociety.""Sir," said Major Doyle, stiffly, "you are pleased to be impertinent.Ride on, you rascals, and spare us further sight of you."The man turned upon him a scowling face."Don't interfere," he said warningly. "This isn't your party, you oldduffer!""Drive ahead, Wampus," commanded Uncle John.Wampus had to get out and crank the engines, which he calmly proceededto do. The man who had called himself Algernon Tobey perceived hisintention and urged his pony to the front of the car."Let that thing alone. Keep your hands off!" he said.Wampus paid no attention. The fellow brought his riding whip downsharply on the chauffeur's shoulders, inflicting a stinging blow.Instantly little Wampus straightened up, grasped Tobey by the legand with a swift, skillful motion jerked him from his horse. The manstarted to draw his revolver, but in an instant he and Wampus wererolling together upon the ground and the Canadian presently cameuppermost and held his antagonist firmly between his knees. Thenwith deliberation he raised his clinched fist and thrust it forciblyagainst Mr. Tobey's eye, repeating the impact upon his nose, his chinand his cheek in a succession of jarring thumps that were deliveredwith scientific precision. Algy fairly howled, kicking and strugglingto be free. None of his comrades offered to interfere and it seemedthey were grimly enjoying the punishment that was being; inflictedupon their leader.When Wampus had quite finished his work he arose, adjusted hisdisarranged collar and tie and proceeded to crank the engines. Then heclimbed into his seat and started the car with a sudden bound. As hedid so a revolver shot rang out and one of the front tires, pierced bythe bullet, ripped itself nearly in two as it crumpled up. A shout ofderisive laughter came from the cowboys. Algy was astride his ponyagain, and as Wampus brought the damaged car to a stop the remittancemen dashed by and along the path, taking the same direction UncleJohn's party was following". Tobey held back a little, calling out:"Au revoir! I shall expect you all at my party. I'm going now to getthe fiddler."He rejoined his comrades then, and they all clattered away until aroll of the mesa hid them from sight.Uncle John got down from his seat to assist his chauffeur."Thank you, Wampus," he said. "Perhaps you should have killed himwhile you had the opportunity; but you did very well."Wampus was wrestling with the tire."I have never start a private graveyard," he replied, "for reason Iam afraid to hurt anyone. But I am Wampus. If Mister Algy he danceto-night, somebody mus' lead him, for he will be blind.""I never met such a lawless brood in my life," prowled the Major,indignantly. "If they were in New York they'd be put behind the barsin two minutes.""But they are in Arizona--in the wilderness," said Uncle John gravely."If there are laws here such people do not respect them."It took a long time to set the new tire and inflate it, for the outertube was torn so badly that an extra one had to be substituted. Butfinally the task was accomplished and once more they renewed theirjourney.Now that they were alone with their friends the girls were excitedlygossiping over the encounter."Do you really suppose we are on that man's ground--his ranch, as hecalls it?" asked Myrtle, half fearfully."Why, I suppose someone owns all this ground, barren as it is,"replied Patsy. "But we are following a regular road--not a very goodone, nor much traveled; but a road, nevertheless--and any road ispublic property and open for the use of travelers.""Perhaps we shall pass by their ranch house," suggested Beth."If we do," Uncle John answered, "I'll have Wampus put on full speed.Even their wild ponies can't follow us then, and if they try shootingup the tires again they are quite likely to miss as we spin by.""Isn't there any other road?" the Major asked.Wampus shook his head."I have never come jus' this same route before," he admitted; "but Imake good friend in Prescott, who know all Arizona blindfold. Him saythis is nice, easy road and we cannot get lost for a good reason--thereason there is no other road at all--only this one.""Did your friend say anything about Hades Ranch?" continued thequestioner."He say remittance man make much mischief if he can; but he oneforeign coward, drunk most time an' when sober weak like my aunt'stea. He say don't let remittance man make bluff. No matter how manycome, if you hit one they all run.""H-m," murmured Uncle John, "I'm not so sure of that, Wampus. Thereseems to be a good many of those insolent rascals, and I hope we shallnot meet them again. They may give us trouble yet.""Never be afraid," advised the chauffeur. "I am Wampus, an' I amhere!"Admitting that evident truth, our tourists were not greatly reassured.Wampus could not tell where the road might lead them, for he did notknow, save that it led by devious winds to Parker, on the borderbetween Arizona and California; but what lay between them and thatdestination was a sealed book to them all.The car was heavy and the road soft; so in spite of their powerfulengines the car was not making more than fifteen miles an hour. Ashort ride brought them to a ridge, from the top of which they saw ahuddle of buildings not far distant, with a near-by paddock containinga number of ponies and cattle. The buildings were not palatial, beingcomposed mostly of adobe and slab wood; but the central one, probablythe dwelling or ranch house, was a low, rambling pile coveringconsiderable ground.The road led directly toward this group of buildings, which ourtravelers at once guessed to be "Hades Ranch." Wampus slowed down andcast a sharp glance around, but the land on either side of the trailwas thick with cactus and sagebrush and to leave the beaten path meanta puncture almost instantly. There was but one thing to be done."Pretty good road here," said Wampus. "Hold tight an' don't get scare.We make a race of it.""Go ahead," returned Uncle John, grimly. "If any of those scoundrelsget in your way, run them down.""I never like to hurt peoples; but if that is your command, sir, Iwill obey," said Wampus, setting his jaws tightly together.The car gathered speed and shot over the road at the rate of twentymiles an hour; then twenty-five--then thirty--and finally forty. Thegirls sat straight and looked eagerly ahead. Forms were darting hereand there among the buildings of the ranch, quickly congregating ingroups on either side of the roadway. A red flag fluttered in thecenter of the road, some four feet from the ground."Look out!" shouted Uncle John. "Stop, Wampus; stop her, I say!"Wampus saw why, and applied his brakes. The big car trembled, sloweddown, and came to a stop less than a foot away from three ugly bars ofbarbed wire which had been placed across the road. They were now justbeside the buildings, and a triumphant shout greeted them from theircaptors, the remittance men.CHAPTER XIICAPTURED"Welcome to Hades!" cried a stout little man in a red blouse, stickinghis leering countenance through the door of the limousine."Shut up, Stubby," commanded a hoarse voice from the group. "Haven'tyou any manners? You haven't been introduced yet.""I've engaged the dark eyed one for the first dance," persistedStubby, as a dozen hands dragged him away from the door.The Major sprang out and confronted the band."What are we to understand by this outrage?" he demanded fiercely."It means you are all invited to a party, and we won't accept anyregrets," replied a laughing voice.Patsy put her head out of the window and looked at the speaker. It wasMr. Algernon Tobey. He had two strips of sticking plaster over hisnose. One of his eyes was swollen shut and the other was almostclosed. Yet he spoke in a voice more cheerful than it was when theyfirst met him."Don't be afraid," he added. "No one has the slightest intention ofinjuring any of you in any way, I assure you.""We have not the same intention in regard to you, sir," replied MajorDoyle, fuming with rage, for his "Irish was up," as he afterwardadmitted. "Unless you at once remove that barricade and allow us toproceed we will not be responsible for what happens. You are warned,sir!"Uncle John, by this time standing beside the Major upon the ground,had been quietly "sizing up the situation," as he would have expressedit. He found they had been captured by a party of fourteen men, mostof whom were young, although three or four, including Tobey, wereof middle age. The atmosphere of the place, with its disorderlysurroundings and ill kept buildings, indicated that Hades Ranch wasbachelor quarters exclusively. Half a dozen Mexicans and one or twoChinamen were in the background, curious onlookers.Mr. Merrick noted the fact that the remittance men were an unkempt,dissipated looking crew, but that their faces betokened reckless goodhumor rather than desperate evil. There was no doubt but most ofthem were considering this episode in the light of a joke, and weredetermined to enjoy the experience at the expense of their enforcedguests.Uncle John had lived many years in the West and knew something ofthese peculiar English exiles. Therefore he was neither frightenednor unduly angry, but rather annoyed by the provoking audacity of thefellows. He had three young girls to protect and knew these men couldnot be fit acquaintances for them. But he adopted a tone differentfrom the Major's and addressed himself to Tobey as the apparent leaderof the band."Sir," he said calmly but with pointed emphasis, "I believe you wereborn a gentleman, as were your comrades here.""You are right," answered Tobey. "And each and every one you seebefore you has fallen from his former high estate--through no faultof his own." This may have been a sarcasm, for the others laughed inboisterous approval. "In some respects we are still gentlemen," Tobeywent on, "but in others we are not to be trusted. Be reasonable,sir--I haven't the faintest idea who you are or what your name is--andconsider calmly our proposition. Here we are, a number of youngfellows who have seen better and happier days, living alone in themidst of an alkali desert. Most of us haven't seen a female formonths, nor a lady for years. Why, last fall Stubby there rode eightymiles to Buxton, just to stand on a corner and see a lot of greasyMexican women go by. We tire of exclusive male society, you see. Weget to bore one another terribly. So here, like a visitation fromheaven, three attractive young ladies descend upon us, travelingthrough our domain, and having discovered their presence we instantlydecided to take advantage of the opportunity and invite them to animpromptu ball. There's no use refusing us, for we insist on carryingout our plan. If you men, perhaps the fathers of the young ladies,behave reasonably, we will entertain you royally and send you on yourway rejoicing. Won't we, boys?"They shouted approval."But if you oppose us and act ugly about this fete, gentlemen, weshall be obliged to put a few bullets into you, and decide afterwardwhat disposition to make of the girls. About the best stunt we do isshooting. We can't work; we're too poor to gamble much; but we hunta good bit and we can shoot straight. I assure you we wouldn't mindlosing and taking a few lives if a scrimmage is necessary. Eh, boys?""That's right, Algy," said one, answering for the others; "we'll havethat dance if we die for it--ev'ry man Jack of us."Myrtle was trembling in her corner of the limousine. Beth sat stillwith a curl on her lips. But Patsy was much interested in theproceedings and had listened attentively to the above conversation.Now the girl suddenly swung open the door and sprang out beside herfather, facing the group of cowboys."I am Patricia Doyle," she said in a clear voice, "and thesegentlemen," indicating the Major and Mr. Merrick, "are my father andmy uncle. You understand perfectly why they object to the arrangementyou suggest, as any one of you would object, had you a daughter ina like position. But you are arbitrary and not inclined to respectwomanhood. Therefore but one course is open to us--to submit underprotest to the unwelcome attentions you desire to thrust upon us."They listened silently to this frank speech, and some of their faceswore crestfallen expressions by the time she had finished. Indeed,one of the older men turned on his heel and walked away, disappearingamong the buildings. After a brief hesitation a delicate youngfellow--almost a boy--followed this man, his face flaming red withshame. But the others stood their ground."Very good, Miss Doyle," remarked Tobey, with forced cheerfulness."You are quite sensible to submit to the inevitable. Bring out yourfriends and introduce them, and then we'll all go in to luncheon andprepare for the dance.""I won't submit to this!" cried the Major, stamping his foot angrily."Yes, you will," said Uncle John, with a motion preventing his iratebrother-in-law from drawing a revolver, "Patsy is quite right, and wewill submit with as much dignity as we can muster, being overpoweredby numbers."He beckoned to Beth, who stepped out of the car and assisted Myrtleto follow her. A little cheer of bravado had arisen from the group,inspired by their apparent victory; but when Myrtle's crutchesappeared and they saw the fair, innocent face of the young girl whorested upon them, the shout died away in a hush of surprise."This is my cousin, Elizabeth De Graf," announced Patsy, with colddeliberation, determined that the proprieties should be observed inall intercourse with these people. "And I present our friend, MyrtleDean. Under ordinary circumstances I believe Myrtle would be excusedfrom dancing, but I suppose no brute in the form of a man would haveconsideration for her infirmity."This time even Tobey flushed."You've a sharp tongue, Miss Doyle, and it's liable to lead you intotrouble," he retorted, losing for the moment his suave demeanor. "Wemay be brutes--and I imagine we are--but we're not dangerous unlessprovoked."It was savagely said, and Uncle John took warning and motioned Patsyto be silent."Lead the way, sir," he said. "Our chauffeur will of course remainwith the car."Wampus had kept his seat, motionless and silent. He only nodded inanswer to Mr. Merrick's instructions and was entirely disregarded bythe remittance men.The man called "Stubby," who had a round, good-humored face, steppedeagerly to Myrtle's side and exclaimed: "Let me assist you, please.""No," she said, shaking her head with a wan smile; "I am quite able towalk alone."He followed her, though, full of interest and with an air of deeprespect that belied his former actions. Tobey, content with hispresent success, walked beside Mr. Merrick and led the processiontoward the ranch house. The Major followed, his tall form upright, hismanner bellicose and resentful, with Beth and Patsy on either side ofhim. The remittance men followed in a straggling crowd, laughing andboisterously talking among themselves. Just as they reached the housea horseman came clattering down the road and all paused involuntarilyto mark the new arrival. The rider was a handsome, slim young fellow,dressed as were the other cowboys present, and he came on at abreakneck speed that seemed only warranted by an errand of life anddeath.In front of him, tied to the saddle, appeared a huge bundle, and asthe horse dashed up to the group standing by the ranch house the ridergracefully threw himself off and removed his hat with a sweepinggesture as he observed the young ladies."I've got him, Algy!" he cried merrily."Dan'l?" asked Tobey."Dan'l himself." He pointed to the bundle, which heaved and wriggledto show it was alive. "He refused to come willingly, of course; soI brought him anyhow. Never yet was there a fiddler willing to beaccommodating.""Good for you, Tim!" shouted a dozen voices. And Stubby added in hisearnest way; "Dan'l was never more needed in his life."Tobey was busy unwinding a long lariat that bent the captive nearlydouble and secured him firmly to the panting horse. When the bondswere removed Dan'l would have tumbled prone to the ground had notwilling hands caught him and supported him upon his feet. Our friendsthen observed that he was an aged man with a face thickly furrowedwith wrinkles. He had but one eye, small and gray and very shrewd inexpression, which he turned contemptuously upon the crowd surroundinghim. Numb and trembling from his cramped position upon the horse andthe terrible jouncing he had endured, the fiddler could scarcely standat first and shook as with a palsy; but he made a brave effort tocontrol his weakness and turned smilingly at the murmur of pity andindignation that came from the lips of the girls."Where's the fiddle?" demanded Tobey, and Tim unhooked a calico bagfrom the saddlebow and held it out. A laugh greeted the gesture."Dan'l said he be hanged if he'd come," announced Tim, with a grimappreciation of the humorous side of the situation; "so I hung him andbrought him along--and his fiddle to boot. But don't boot it untilafter the dance.""What do you mean, sir, by this rebellious attitude?" questionedTobey, sticking his damaged face close to that of the fiddler.Dan'l blinked with his one eye but refused to answer."I've a good mind to skin you alive," continued the leader, in asavage tone. "You'll either obey my orders or I'll throw you into thesnake pit.""Let him alone, Algy," said Tim, carelessly. "The old scoundrel hasbeen tortured enough already. But I see we have partners for thedance," looking critically at the girls, "and I claim first choicebecause I've brought the fiddler."At this a roar of protest arose and Tobey turned and said sullenly:"Come in, all of you. We'll settle the order of dancing later on."The interior of the ranch house was certainly picturesque. A greatliving room ran all across the front, with an immense fireplacebuilt of irregular adobe bricks. The floor was strewn with skins ofanimals--mostly coyotes, a few deer and one or two mountain lions--andthe walls were thickly hung with weapons and trophies of the chase.A big table in one corner was loaded with bottles and glasses,indicating the intemperate habits of the inmates, while on the chimneyshelf were rows of pipes and jars of tobacco. An odor similar to thatof a barroom hung over the place which the air from the open windowsseemed unable to dissipate.There were plenty of benches and chairs, with a long mess tableoccupying the center of the room. In a corner was an old square piano,which a Mexican was trying to dust as the party entered."Welcome to Hades!" exclaimed Tobey, with an absurd gesture. "Be goodenough to make yourselves at home and I'll see if those devils ofChinamen are getting luncheon ready."Silently the prisoners sat down. The crowd poured in after them anddisposed themselves in various attitudes about the big room, allstaring with more or less boldness at the three girls. Dan'l thefiddler was pushed in with the others and given a seat, while two orthree of the imitation cowboys kept guard over him to prevent anypossible escape. So far the old man had not addressed a word toanyone.With the absence of the leader the feeling of restraint seemed torelax. The cowboys began whispering among themselves and chucklingwith glee, as if they were enjoying some huge joke. Stubby had placedhimself near the three young ladies, whom he eyed with adoringglances, and somehow none of the prisoners regarded this childishyoung fellow in exactly the same light as they did his comrades. Tim,his attitude full of grace as he lounged against a settle, was alsonear the group. He seemed a bit thoughtful since his dramatic arrivaland had little to say to anyone.Mr. Merrick engaged Stubby in conversation."Does Mr. Tobey own this place?" he asked."By proxy, yes," was the reply. "It isn't in his name, you know,although that doesn't matter, for he couldn't sell his desert ranch ifhe had a title to it. I suppose that is what his folks were afraidof. Algy is the fourth son of old Lord Featherbone, and got into adisgraceful mess in London some years ago. So Featherbone shippedhim over here, in charge of a family solicitor who hunted out thissequestered spot, bought a couple of thousand acres and built thishut. Then he went home and left Algy here to keep up the place on apaltry ten pounds--fifty dollars--a month.""Can he manage to do that?" asked Uncle John."Why, he has to, you see. He's got together a few cattle, mostlystolen I imagine; but he doesn't try to work the land. Moreover he'sestablished this community, composed of his suffering fellow exiles,the secret of which lies in the fact that we work the cooperativeplan, and all chip in our remittances to boil the common pot. We cankeep more servants and buy more food and drink, that way, than if eachone of us lived separately.""Up in Oregon," said Mr. Merrick, "I've known of some very successfuland prosperous ranchmen among the remittance men.""Oh, we're all kinds, I suppose, good and bad," admitted Stubby. "Thiscrew's mostly bad, and they're moderately proud of it. It's a devilof a life, sir, and Hades Ranch is well named. I've only been here amonth. Had a little property up North; but the sheriff took it fordebt, and that forced me to Algy, whom I detest. I think I'll move on,before long. But you see I'm limited. Can't leave Arizona or I'll getmy remittance cut off.""Why were you sent here into exile?" asked Myrtle artlessly.He turned red and refused to meet her eyes."Went wrong, Miss," he said, "and my folks wouldn't stand forit. We're all in the same boat," sweeping his arm around, "doingpunishment for our misdeeds.""Do none of you ever reform?" inquired Patsy."What's the use? We're so far away from home no one there would everbelieve in our reformation. Once we become outcasts, that's the endof our careers. We're buried in these Western wilds and allowed justenough to keep alive.""I would think," said Uncle John musingly, "that the manly way wouldbe to cut yourself off entirely from your people at home and go tosome city in the United States where honesty and industry would win anew name for you. Then you could be respected and happy and become ofuse to the world."Stubby laughed."That has been tried," he replied; "but few ever made a success of it.We're generally the kind that prefers idleness to work. My family iswealthy, and I don't mind taking from them what little they give mewillingly and all that I can screw out of them besides. I'm in forlife, as the saying is, and I've no especial ambition except to drinkmyself to death as soon as possible."Patsy shuddered. It seemed a horrible thing to be so utterly hopeless.Could this young fellow have really merited his fate?CHAPTER XIIITHE FIDDLERTim had listened carelessly to the conversation until now, when hesaid listlessly:"Don't think us all criminals, for we're not. In my own case I didnothing to deserve exile except that I annoyed my elder brother bybecoming more popular with our social set than he was. He had all theproperty and I was penniless, so he got rid of me by threatening tocut off my allowance unless I went to America and stayed there.""And you accepted such a condition?" cried Patsy, scornfully. "Whywere you not independent enough to earn your own living?"He shrugged his shoulders, yet seemed amused."I simply couldn't," said he. "I was not educated to work, you know,and to do so at home would be to disgrace my noble family. I've toomuch respect for my lineage to labor with my hands or head.""But here in America no one would know you," suggested Beth."I would only humiliate myself by undertaking such a task. And whyshould I do so? While I am in America my affectionate brother, thehead of the family, supports me, as is his duty. Your philosophy ispretty enough, but it is not practical. The whole fault lies in ourold-fashioned system of inheritance, the elder male of a familygetting all the estate and the younger ones nothing at all. Here, inthis crude and plebeian country, I believe it is the custom to providefor all one's children, and a father is at liberty to do so becausehis estate is not entailed.""And he earns it himself and can do what he likes with it," addedUncle John, impatiently. "Your system of inheritance and entail maybe somewhat to blame, but your worst fault is in rearing a class ofmollycoddles and social drones who are never of benefit to themselvesor the world at large. You, sir, I consider something less than aman.""I agree with you," replied Tim, readily. "I'm only good to cumber theearth, and if I get little pleasure out of life I must admit that it'sall I'm entitled to.""And you can't break your bonds and escape?" asked Patsy."I don't care to. People who are ambitious to do things merely boreme. I don't admire them or care to imitate them."From that moment they took no further interest in the handsomeoutcast. His world was not their world.And now Tobey came in, driving before him a lot of Mexicans bearingtrays of food. The long table was laid in a moment, for everythingwas dumped upon it without any attempt at order. Each of the cowboysseized a plate from a pile at one end and helped himself to whateverhe wanted.Two or three of the men, however, were courteous enough to attend totheir unwilling guests and see they were served as well as conditionswould permit The food was plentiful and of good quality, but althoughnone of Uncle John's party was squeamish or a stickler for form, allmore or less revolted from the utter disregard of all the proprieties."I'm sorry we have no wine; but there's plenty of whiskey, if you likeit," remarked Tobey.The girls were silent and ate little, although they could not helpbeing interested in observing the bohemianism of these gently rearedbut decadent sons of respectable English families. As soon as theycould they left the table, and Tobey, observing their uneasiness inspite of his damaged and nearly useless optics, decided to send themto another room where they could pass the afternoon without furtherannoyance. Stubby escorted the party and ushered them into a goodsized room which he said was "Algy's study," although no one everstudied there."Algy's afraid you'll balk at the dance; so he wants to please youhowever he can," remarked the round faced youth. "You won't mind beingleft alone, will you?""We prefer it, sir," answered the Major, stiffly."You see, we're going to have a rare lark this afternoon," continuedStubby, confidentially. "Usually it's pretty dull here, and all wecan do is ride and hunt--play cards and quarrel. But your coming hascreated no end of excitement and this dance will be our red-letter dayfor a long time to come. The deuce of if is, however, that there areonly two girls to dance with thirteen men. We limit our community tofifteen, you know; but little Ford and old Rutledge have backed downand won't have anything to do with this enterprise. I don't know why,"he continued, thoughtfully."Perhaps they still have some gentlemanly instincts," suggested Patsy."That must be it," he replied in a relieved tone. "Well, anyhow,to avoid quarrels and bloodshed we've agreed to throw dice for thedances. Every one is to have an equal chance, you see, and when youyoung ladies open the dance the entire programme will be arranged foryou.""Are we to have no choice in the matter of partners?" inquired Bethcuriously."None whatever. There would surely be a row, in that case, and weintend to have everything; pass off pleasantly if we have to kill afew to keep the peace."With this Stubby bowed low and retreated toward the door, whichsuddenly opened to admit old Dan'l the fiddler, who was thrust inso violently that his body collided with that of Stubby and nearlyknocked him over."That's all right," laughed the remittance man, recovering from theshock. "You mustn't escape, you know, Dan'l, for we depend on you forthe music."He closed the door as he went out and they all heard a bolt shoot intoplace. Yet the broad window, scarcely six feet from the ground, stoodwide open to admit the air.Dan'l stood in the middle of the room, motionless for a moment. Thenhe raised his wrinkled face and clinched his fists, shaking them inthe direction of the living-room."Me!" he muttered; "me play for dese monkeys to dance--me! amaestro--a composer--a artiste! No; I vill nod! I vill die before Icondescention to such badness, such mockery!"They were the first words he had spoken since his arrival, and theyseemed to hold all his pentup indignation. The girls pitied the oldman and, recognizing in him a fellow prisoner, sought to comfort him."If the dance depends upon us, there will be no dance," said Patsy,firmly."I thought you advised submitting to the whim of these ruffians," saidUncle John in surprise."Only to gain time, Uncle. And the scheme has succeeded. Now is ourtime to plot and plan how to outwit our enemies.""Goot!" cried Dan'l approvingly. "I help you. Dey are vermin--pah! Ivould kill dem all mitout mercifulness, unt be glad!""It won't be necessary to kill them, I hope," said Beth, smiling. "Allwe wish is to secure our escape.""Vot a time dey make me!" said Dan'l, more calmly. "You see, I amliving peacefulness in mine bungalow by der river--ten mile away. Dotbrute Tim, he come unt ask me to fiddle for a dance. I--fiddle! Ven Irefuse me to do it, he tie me up unt by forcibleness elope mit me. Issid nod a crime--a vickedness--eh?""It certainly is, sir," said Uncle John. "But do not worry. Thesegirls have some plan in their heads, I'm sure, and if we manage toescape we will carry you home in safety. Now, my dears, what is it?""Oh, we've only begun to think yet," said Patsy, and walked to thewindow. All but Myrtle and Dan'l followed her.Below the window was a jungle of cactus, with hundreds of spines asslender and sharp as stilettos sticking in every direction."H-m; this room is burglar proof," muttered Uncle John, with markeddisappointment."It also makes an excellent prison," added Patsy. "But I suspectedsomething of this sort when I saw they had left the window open. Wecan't figure on getting out that way, you see.""Id vould be suiciding," Dan'l said, mournfully shaking his head. "Ifdese fiends were as goot as dey are clefer, dey vould be angels.""No argument seems to prevail with them," remarked Beth. "They arelawless and merciless, and in this far-away country believe they maydo as they please.""They're as bad as the bandits of Taormina," observed Patsy, smilingat the recollection of an adventure they had abroad; "but we must findsome way to evade them."Dan'l had gone over to Myrtle's corner and stood staring at her withhis one shrewd eye. Uncle John looked thoughtfully out of the windowand saw Wampus busy in the road before the house. He had his coat offand was cutting the bars of barbed wire and rolling them out of theway, while Mumbles, who had been left with him, ran here and there athis heels as if desiring to assist him.From the big hall, or living room, at the right came a dull roar ofvoices, subdued shouts and laughter, mingled with the clinking ofglasses. All the remittance men were gathered there deep in the gameof dice which was to determine the order in which they were to dancewith Beth and Patsy. The servants were out of sight. Wampus had thefield to himself."Come here," said Uncle John to the girls, and when they stood besidehim pointed to the car. "Wampus is making ready for the escape," hecontinued. "He has cleared the road and the way is now open if we canmanage to get to the machine. Has your plan matured yet?"Patsy shook her head."Not yet, Uncle," she replied."Couldn't Wampus throw us a rope?" inquired the Major."He could," said Uncle John; "but we would be unable to use it. Thoseterrible cactus spines are near enough to spear anyone who dared tryto slide down a rope. Think of something else."They all tried to do that, but no practical idea seemed forthcoming."Oh, no," Dan'l was saying to Myrtle; "dey are nod afraid to shoot;bud dey vill nod shoot ladies, belief me. Always dey carry refolfersin deir belts--or deir holsterses. Dey eat mit refolfers; dey schleepmit refolfers; dey hunt, dey quarrel, unt sometimes dey shoot eachodder--de best enactionment vot dey do. Bud dey do nod shoot atladies--nefer.""Will they wear their revolvers at the dance?" asked Beth, overhearingthis speech."I belief id," said Dan'l, wagging his ancient head. "Dey like to beready to draw quick like, if anybody shteps on anybody's toes. Yes; ofcourse.""What a horrible idea!" exclaimed Patsy."They're quite liable to dance and murder in the same breath," theMajor observed, gloomily."I don't like it," said Beth. "It's something awful just to think of.Haven't they any gallantry?""No," answered Patsy. "But I wouldn't dance with a lot of half drunkenmen wearing revolvers, if they burned me at the stake for refusing.""Ah! shtick to dat fine expressionment," cried Dan'l, eagerly. "Shtickto id! Say you won't dance if dey wear de refolfers--unt den we win deschweepstakes!"Patsy looked at him critically, in the instant catching a part of hisidea."What do you mean?" she asked.Dan'l explained, while they all listened carefully, absorbed infollowing in thought his unique suggestions."Let's do it!" exclaimed Beth. "I'm sure the plan will succeed.""It's leaving a good deal to chance," objected Uncle John, with atouch of nervousness."There is an element of chance in everything," declared Patsy. "ButI'm sure we shall escape, Uncle. Why it's a regular coup!""We take them by surprise, you know," explained the Major, whoheartily favored the idea.They talked it over for a time, perfecting the details, and thenbecame as calm and composed as a group of prisoners might. Uncle Johnwaved his handkerchief to attract the attention of Wampus, who stolesoftly around the corner of the house and approached the window,taking care to keep at a respectful distance from the dangerouscactus."Is everything ready?" inquired Uncle John in a subdued voice."To be sure all is ready. Why not? I am Wampus!" was the reply, incautious tones."Go back to the machine and guard it carefully, Wampus," commanded Mr.Merrick. "We expect to escape soon after dark, so have the headlightsgoing, for we shall make a rush for it and there mustn't be a moment'sdelay.""All right," said the chauffeur. "You may depend on me. I am Wampus,an' not 'fraid of a hundred coward like these. Is not Mister Algy hiseye mos' beautiful blacked?""It is," agreed Uncle John. "Go back to the car now, and wait for us.Don't get impatient. We don't know just when we will join you, but itwill be as soon as we can manage it. What is Mumbles doing?""Mumble he learn to be good automobilist. Jus' now he sit on seat an'watch wheel to see nobody touch. If anybody touch, Mumble he eat himup."They all laughed at this whimsical notion and it served to relieve thestrain of waiting. Wampus, grinning at the success of his joke, wentback to the limousine to inspect it carefully and adjust it in everypart until it was in perfect order.Now that a definite plan of action had been decided upon their spiritsrose considerably, and they passed the afternoon in eager anticipationof the crisis.Rather earlier than expected Stubby and Tim came to say "they had beenappointed a committee to escort their guests to the banquet hall,where dinner would at once be served.""We shall have to clear away for the dance," added Stubby, "so we wantto get the feast over with as quickly as possible. I hope you are allhungry, for Algy has spread himself on this dinner and we are tohave every delicacy the ranch affords, regardless of expense. We caneconomize afterward to make up for it."Elaborate preparations were not greatly in evidence, however. TheMexican servants had washed themselves and the floor of the big roomhad been swept and cleared of some of its rubbish; but that was all.The remittance men were in their usual rough costumes and the air wasredolent with the fumes of liquor.CHAPTER XIVTHE ESCAPEAs the prisoners quietly took their places at the table Tobey, whohad been drinking hard, decided to make a speech. His face was badlyswollen and he could only see through a slit in one eye, so severe hadbeen the beating administered by Wampus earlier in the day; but thefellow had grit, in spite of his other unmanly qualities, and hisimperturbable good humor had scarcely been disturbed by the punishmentthe Canadian had inflicted upon him."Ladies," said he, "and gentlemen--which of course includes ourrespected male guests--I am happy to inform you that the programme forthe First Annual Hades Ranch Ball has finally been arranged, and thedances apportioned in a fair and impartial manner. The Grand Marchwill take place promptly at seven o'clock, led by Miss Doyle andKnuckles, who has won the privilege by throwing four sixes. I am tofollow with Miss De Graf, and the rest will troop on behind with theprivilege of looking at the ladies. If anyone dares to create disorderhis dances with the young ladies will be forfeited. Dan'l will playthe latest dance music on his fiddle, and if it isn't spiritedand up-to-date we'll shoot his toes off. We insist upon plenty oftwo-steps and waltzes and will wind up with a monney-musk in thegray light of dawn. This being fully understood, I beg you, my goodfriends, to fall to and eat and be merry; but don't linger unduly overthe dainties, for we are all anxious, like good soldiers, to get intoaction."The remittance men applauded this oratory, and incidentally attackedthe eatables with evident determination to obey their leader'sinjunction."We can eat any time," remarked Stubby, with his mouth full; "buthis Satanic majesty only knows when Hades Ranch will see anotherdance--with real ladies for partners."The Chinese cooks and the Mexican servants had a lively time duringthis meal, for the demands made upon them were incessant. Uncle John,whose even disposition was seldom ruffled, ate with a good appetite,while even the Major, glum and scowling, did not disdain the numerouswell-prepared dishes. As for Dan'l, he took full advantage of theoccasion and was the last one to leave the table. Our girls, however,were too excited to eat much and little Myrtle, especially, was pallidand uneasy and had a startled look in her eyes whenever anyone made asudden motion.As soon as the repast was concluded the servants cleared the longtable in a twinkling and pushed it back against the wall at one end ofthe long room. A chair was placed for Dan'l on top of this expansiveboard, which thus became a stage from whence he could overlook theroom and the dancers, and then two of the remittance men tossed theold fiddler to his elevated place and commanded him to make ready.Dan'l said nothing and offered no resistance. He sat plaintivelysawing upon his ancient but rich-toned violin while the floor wasbrushed, the chairs and benches pushed against the wall and the roomprepared for action. Behind the violinist was a low, broad windowfacing a grass plot that was free from the terrifying cactus, and theold man noted with satisfaction that it stood wide open.Uncle John's party had pressed close to the table and stood watchingthe proceedings."Ready now!" called Tobey; "the Grand March is about to begin. Takeyour partners, boys. Look sharp, there, Dan'l, and give us a martialtune that will lift our feet."Dan'l meekly set the violin underneath his chin and raised the bow asif in readiness. "Knuckles," a brawny fellow with a florid face and apeculiar squint, approached Patsy and bowed."You're to lead with me, Miss," he said. "Are you ready?""Not quite," she returned with dignified composure; "for I perceiveyou are not quite ready yourself.""Eh? Why not?" he inquired, surprised."You are still wearing your firearms," she replied. "I cannot and willnot dance with a man who carries a revolver.""That's nothing," he retorted. "We always do.""Always?""Of course. And if I shed my gun what's to prevent some one elsegetting the drop on me?""That's it," said Patsy, firmly. "The weapons must all be surrenderedbefore we begin. We positively refuse to dance if rioting and shootingare likely to occur."A murmur of protest arose at this speech, for all the remittance menhad gathered around to listen to the argument."That's all tommy-rot," observed Handsome Tim, in a sulky tone. "We'renot spoiling for a row; it's the dance we're after.""Then give up the revolvers," said Beth, coming to her cousin'sassistance. "If this is to be a peaceful entertainment you will notneed to be armed, and it is absurd to suppose a lady will dance with agentleman who is a walking arsenal."They looked into one another's faces uncertainly. Dan'l sat softlytuning his violin, as if uninterested in the controversy. Uncle Johnand the Major looked on with seeming indifference."You must decide which you prefer--the revolvers or the dance,"remarked Patsy, staring coolly into the ring of faces."Would your English ladies at home consent to dance with armed men?"asked Beth."They're quite right, boys," said Stubby, nodding his bullethead."Let's agree to deposit all the shooting irons 'til the dance isover.""I won't!" cried Knuckles, his scowl deepening."By Jove, you will!" shouted Tobey, with unexpected vehemence. "You'redelaying the programme, old man, and it's a nuisance to dance in thisarmor, anyway. Here--pile all your guns in this corner; every one ofyou, mind. Then we shall all stand on an equal footing.""Put them on the table there, by the old fiddler," said Patsy; "thenwe will know we are perfectly safe."Rather unwillingly they complied, each man walking up to the table andplacing his revolver at Dan'l's feet. The girls watched them intently."That man over there is still armed," called Beth, pointing to aswarthy Mexican who squatted near the door."That's all right," said Tobey, easily. "He's our guard, Pedro. I'vestationed him there so you won't attempt to escape till we get readyto let you go."Patsy laughed."There's little danger of that," she said."All ready, now!" exclaimed Knuckles, impatiently. "We're all asharmless as doves. Let 'er go, Dan'l!"The old man was just then assisting Uncle John to lift Myrtle to thetop of the table, where the Major had placed a chair for her. Knucklesgrowled, but waited until the girl was seated near the window. ThenDan'l drew his bow and struck up a spirited march. Patsy took the armof Knuckles and paraded down the long room. Beth followed with Tobey,and behind them tramped the remittance men in files of two. At the farend were grouped the servants, looking curiously upon the scene, whichwas lighted by lamps swung from the ceiling and a row of candles uponthe edge of the mantelshelf.To carry out the idea of a grand march Patsy drew her escort here andthere by sharp turns and half circles, the others trailing behind likea huge snake until she had passed down the length of the room andstarted to return up the other side to the starting point. Soengrossed had been the cowboys that they did not observe the Major andUncle John clamber upon the table and stand beside Myrtle.The procession was half way up the hall on its return when Patsy saidabruptly: "Now, Beth!" and darted away from her partner's side andtoward the table. Beth followed like a streak, being an excellentrunner, and for a moment Knuckles and Tobey, thus deserted by theirpartners, stopped to watch them in amazement. Then their comradesbumped into them and recalled them to their senses.By that time the two girls had reached the table and leaped upon it.Uncle John was waving his handkerchief from the window as a signalto Wampus; Dan'l had laid aside his fiddle and seized a revolver ineither hand, and the Major had caught up two more of the discardedweapons.As Beth and Patsy turned, panting, and from their elevation looked upthe room, the cowboys gave a bellow of rage and rushed forward."Keep back!" shouted the Major, in stentorian tones, "I'll shoot thefirst man that interferes."Noting the grim determination in the old soldier's eye, they hesitatedand came to a halt."What do you mean by this infernal nonsense?" cried Tobey, in disgust."Why, it's just checkmate, and the game is up," replied Uncle Johnamiably. "We've decided not to hold the proposed dance, but to takeour departure at once."He turned and passed Myrtle out of the window where Wampus took herin his arms, crutches and all, and carried her to the automobile. Theremittance men, unarmed and confronted by their own revolvers, stoodgaping open-mouthed and seemingly dazed."Let's rush 'em, boys!" shouted Handsome Tim, defiantly."Rush 'em alone, if you like," growled Knuckles. "I'm not ready forthe graveyard yet.""You are vot iss called cowardices," said Dan'l, flourishing therevolvers he held. "Come on mit der courage, somebotty, so I can shootholes in you.""You're building your own coffin just now, Dan'l," retorted Tobey,in baffled rage. "We know where to get you, old boy, and we'll haverevenge for this night's work.""I vill take some popguns home mit me," was the composed reply. "Den,ven you come, I vill make a receptioning for you. Eh?"Uncle John, Patsy and Beth had followed Myrtle through the window anddisappeared."Now, sir," said the Major to the old fiddler, "make your escape whileI hold them at bay.""Nod yet," replied Dan'l. "Ve must gif ourselves de mostprotectionment ve can."With this he gathered up the firearms, one by one, and tossed themthrough the window. Then he straightened up and a shot flashed downthe hall and tumbled the big Mexican guard to the floor just as he wasabout to glide through the doorway."Dit ve say shtand still, or dit ve nod say shtand still?" askedDan'l, sternly. "If somebody gets hurt, it iss because he don'd obeyde orderations.""Go, sir!" commanded the Major."I vill; bud I go last," declared the old man. "I follow you--see? Budyou take my violin, please--unt be very tender of id, like id vas yoursveetheardt."The Major took the violin and climbed through the window, proceedingto join the others, who were by now seated in the car. When he hadgone Dan'l prepared to follow, first backing toward the window andthen turning to make an agile leap to the ground below. And now with ashout the cowboys made their rush, only to halt as Dan'l reappeared atthe window, covering them again with his revolvers."So, you defils--make a listen to me," he called. "I am experiencinga goot-bye to you, who are jackals unt imitation men unt haf no gootright to be alive. Also if I see any of you de next time, I vill shootfirst unt apologise at der funeral. I haf no more monkey business mityou voteffer; so keep vere you are until I am gone, unt you vill besafeness."He slowly backed away from the window, and so thoroughly cowed was thegroup of ruffians that the old fiddler had been lifted hastily intothe automobile before the cowboys mustered courage to leap throughthe window and search in the darkness for their revolvers, which layscattered widely upon the ground.Wampus, chuckling gleefully, jerked the hoods off his glaringsearchlights, sprang to his seat and started the machine down the roadbefore the crack of a single revolver was heard in protest. The shotscame thicker after that, but now the automobile was bowling merrilyalong the road and soon was out of range."De road iss exceptionalment goot," remarked Dan'l. "Dere iss nodangerousness from here to der rifer.""Danger?" said the chauffeur, scornfully. "Who cares for danger? I amWampus, an' I am here!""We are all here," said Patsy, contentedly nestling against thecushions; "and I'm free to confess that I'm mighty glad of it!"CHAPTER XVTHE ROMANCE OF DAN'LIt did not take them very long to reach the river, a muddy littlestream set below high banks. By Dan'l's direction they turned tothe left and followed the wind of the river for a mile or so untilsuddenly out of the darkness loomed a quaint little bungalow which theold German claimed to be his home."I haf architectured it mineself, unt make it built as I like it. Youvill come in unt shtop der night mit me," he said, as Wampus haltedthe machine before the door.There was a little murmur of protest at this, for the house appearedto be scarcely bigger than the automobile. But Uncle John pointed out,sensibly enough, that they ought not to undertake an unknown road atnighttime, and that Spotville, the town for which they wereheaded, was still a long way off. The Major, moreover, had a vividrecollection of his last night's bed upon the roof of the limousine,where he had crept to escape rattlesnakes, and was in no mood to againcamp out in the open while they traveled in Arizona. So he advocatedaccepting Dan'l's invitation. The girls, curious to know how so manycould be accommodated in the bungalow, withdrew all further objectionsand stood upon the low, pergola-roofed porch while their host wentinside to light the lamps.They were really surprised at the cosy aspect of the place. Half theone-story dwelling was devoted to a living room, furnished simply butwith modest taste. A big square table was littered with music, muchbeing in manuscript--thus proving Dan'l's assertion that he wasa composer. Benches were as numerous as chairs, and all werewell-cushioned with tanned skins as coverings. A few good prints wereon the walls and the aspect of the place was entirely agreeable to theold man's guests.As the room was somewhat chilly he made a fire in the ample fireplaceand then with an air of pride exhibited to his visitors his tinykitchen, his own bedroom and a storeroom, which occupied the remainderof the space in the bungalow. He told them he would prepare beds inthe living room for the girls, give his own room to Mr. Merrick andMajor Doyle, while he and Wampus would bunk in the storeroom."I haf much blankets," he said; "dere vill be no troubles to keepvarm."Afterward they sat before the fire and by the dim lights of thekerosene lamps chatted together of the day's adventures.Uncle John asked Dan'l what had brought him to this deserted,out-of-the-way spot, and the old man told his story in a manner thatamused them all greatly."I haf been," said he, "much famous in my time, unt had aindividualness pointed out whereeffer I went. I vas orchestra leaderat the Theater Royal in Stuttgart, unt our king haf complimented memany times. But I vas foolish. I vas foolish enough to think that vena man iss great he can stay great. I married me to a clefer primadonna, unt composed a great opera, which vas finer as anythingHerr Wagner has efer done. Eh? But dere vas jealousness at work toopposition me. Von day ven my fine opera vas all complete I ventto the theater to lead mine orchestra. To my surprisement der HerrDirector tells me I can retire on a pension; I am too old unt he hashired a younger man, who iss Herr Gabert. I go home bewildered untmishappy, to find that Herr Gabert has stole the score of mine operaunt run avay mit mine vife. Vot I can do? Nothing. Herr Gabert he leadmy orchestra tint all der people applauds him. I am forgot. One day Isee our king compliment Herr Gabert. He produces my opera unt say hecompositioned it. Eferybody iss crazy aboud id, unt crown Herr Gabertmit flowers. My vife sings in der opera. The people cheer her unt sherides avay mit Herr Gabert in his carriage to a grand supper mit dernobility unt der Herr Director."I go home unt say: 'Who am I?' I answer: 'Nobody!' Am I now great?No; I am a speck. Vot can I do? Veil, I go avay. I haf some money--aleedle. I come to America. I do not like crowds any more. I like to bealone mit my violin. I find dis place; I build dis house; I lif hereunt make happiness. My only neighbors are de remittance men, who issmore mischiefing as wicked. Dey vill nod bother me much. So after atime I die here. Vy nod? I am forgot in Stuttgart."There was pathos in the tale and his way of telling it. The old manspoke cheerfully, but they could see before them the tragedy depictedby his simple words. His hearers were all silent when he hadconcluded, feeling they could say nothing to console him or lightenhis burden. Only Wampus, sitting in the background, looked scornfullyupon the man who had once been the idol of his townspeople.Dan'l took a violin from a shelf and began to play, softly but withmasterly execution. He caught their mood instantly. The harmony wasrestful and contented. Patsy turned down the lamps, to let the flickerof the firelight dominate the room, and Dan'l understood and blendedthe flickering light into his melody.For a long time he continued to improvise, in a way that fairlycaptivated his hearers, despite their varied temperaments, and madethem wonder at his skill. Then without warning he changed to astirring, martial air that filled the room with its rich, resonanttones. There was a fugue, a wonderful finale, and while the concludingnotes rang in their ears the old man laid his violin in his lap,leaned back against his cushions and heaved a deep sigh.They forebore disturbing him for a while. How strange it seemed thatthis really talented musician should be banished to a wilderness whilestill possessing power to stir the souls of men with his marvelousexecution. Truly he was a "maestro," as he had said; a genius whosestar had risen, flashed across the sky and suddenly faded, leaving hisfuture a blank.Wampus moved uneasily in his chair."I like to know something," he remarked.Dan'l roused himself and turned to look at the speaker."You have one bad eye," continued Wampus, reflectively. "What make himso? You stick violin bow in eye some day?""No," grunted Dan'l."Bad eye he no make himself," persisted the little chauffeur. "Whatmake him, then?"For a moment there was an awkward silence. The girls considered thispersonal inquiry offensive and regretted admitting Wampus to the room.But after a time the old German answered the question, quietly and ina half amused tone."Can you nod guess?" he said. "Herr Gabert hurt mine eye.""Oh!" exclaimed Wampus, nodding approvingly "You fight duel with him?Of course. It mus' be.""I haf one goot eye left, howefer," continued Dan'l. "It vill do mefery well. Dere iss nod much to see out here.""I know," said Wampus. "But Herr Gabert. What happen to him?"Again there was a pause. Then the German said slowly:"I am nod rich; but efery year I send a leetle money to Stuttgart toput some flowers on Herr Gabert's grave."The chauffeur's face brightened. He got up from his chair and solemnlyshook Dan'l's hand."You are great musician," he announced. "You can believe it, for it istrue. An' you have shake the hand of great chauffeur. I am Wampus."Dan'l did not answer. He had covered his good eye with his hand.CHAPTER XVITHE LODGING AT SPOTVILLE"Wake up, Patsy: I smell coffee!" called Beth, and soon the two girlswere dressed and assisting Myrtle to complete her toilet. Through theopen windows came the cool, fragrant breath of morning; the sky wasbeginning to blush at the coming of the sun."To think of our getting up at such unearthly hours!" cried Patsycheerfully. "But I don't mind it in the least, Beth; do you?""I love the daybreak," returned Beth, softly. "We've wasted the besthours of morning abed, Patsy, these many years.""But there's a difference," said Myrtle, earnestly. "I know thedaybreak in the city very well, for nearly all my life I have had torise in the dark in order to get my breakfast and be at work on time.It is different from this, I assure you; especially in winter, whenthe chill strikes through to your bones. Even in summer time the airof the city is overheated and close, and the early mornings cheerlessand uncomfortable. Then I think it is best to stay in bed as long asyou can--if you have nothing else to do. But here, out in the open, itseems a shame not to be up with the birds to breathe the scent of thefields and watch the sun send his heralds ahead of him to proclaim hiscoming and then climb from the bottomless pit into the sky and takepossession of it.""Why, Myrtle!" exclaimed Patsy, wonderingly; "what a poetic notion.How did it get into your head, little one?"Myrtle's sweet face rivaled the sunrise for a moment. She made noreply but only smiled pathetically.Uncle John's knock upon the door found them ready for breakfast, whichold Dan'l had skilfully prepared in the tiny kitchen and now placedupon a round table set out upon the porch. By the time they hadfinished the simple meal Wampus had had his coffee and prepared theautomobile for the day's journey. A few minutes later they saidgood-bye to the aged musician and took the trail that led throughSpotville.The day's trip was without event. They encountered one or two Indianson the way, jogging slowly along on their shaggy ponies; but thecreatures were mild and inoffensive. The road was fairly good andthey made excellent time, so that long before twilight Spotvillewas reached and the party had taken possession of the one small andprimitive "hotel" the place afforded. It was a two-story, clapboardedbuilding, the lower floor being devoted to the bar and dining room,while the second story was divided into box-like bedrooms none tooclean and very cheaply furnished."I imagine we shall find this place 'the limit'," remarked Uncle Johnruefully. "But surely we shall be able to stand it for one night," headded, with a philosophic sigh."Want meat fer supper?" asked the landlord, a tall, gaunt man whoconsidered himself dressed when he was in his shirt sleeves."What kind of meat?" inquired Uncle John, cautiously."Kin give yeh fried pork er jerked beef. Ham 'a all out an' thechickens is beginnin' to lay.""Eggs?""Of course, stranger. Thet's the on'y thing Spotville chickens lay,nowadays. I s'pose whar yeh come from they lay biscuits 'n' porkchops.""No. Door knobs, sometimes," said Mr. Merrick, "but seldom pork chops.Let's have eggs, and perhaps a little fried pork to go with them. Anymilk?""Canned er fresh?""Fresh preferred."The landlord looked at him steadily."Yeh've come a long-way, stranger," he said, "an' yeh must 'a' spent alot of money, here 'n' there. Air yeh prepared to pay fer thet orderin solid cash?"Uncle John seemed startled, and looked at the Major, who smileddelightedly."Are such things expensive, sir?" the latter asked the landlord."Why, we don't eat 'em ourselves, 'n' thet's a cold fact. Eggs iseggs, an' brings forty cents a dozen to ship. There's seven cowsin town, 'n' forty-one babies, so yeh kin figger what fresh milk'sworth.""Perhaps," said Uncle John mildly, "we can stand the expense--if wewon't rob the babies.""Don't worry 'bout thet. The last autymobble folks as come this waygot hot because I charged 'em market prices fer the truck they et. SoI'm jest inquirin' beforehand, to save hard feelin's. I've found outone thing 'bout autymobble folks sense I've ben runnin' this hoe-tel,an' thet is thet a good many is ownin' machines thet oughter be payin'their bills instid o' buyin' gasoline."The Major took him aside. He did not tell the cautious landlord thatMr. Merrick was one of the wealthiest men in America, but he exhibiteda roll of bills that satisfied the man his demands would be paid infull.The touring; party feasted upon eggs and fresh milk, both verydelicious but accompanied by odds and ends of food not so palatable.The landlord's two daughters, sallow, sunken cheeked girls, waited onthe guests and the landlord's wife did the cooking.Beth, Patsy and Myrtle retired early, as did Uncle John. The Major,smoking his "bedtime cigar," as he called it, strolled out into theyard and saw Wampus seated in the automobile, also smoking."We get an early start to-morrow, Wampus," said the Major. "Better getto bed.""Here is my bed," returned the chauffeur, quietly."But there's a room reserved for you in the hotel.""I know. Don't want him. I sleep me here."The Major looked at him reflectively."Ever been in this town before, Wampus?" he asked."No, sir. But I been in other towns like him, an' know this kind ofhotel. Then why do I sleep in front seat of motor car?""Because you are foolish, I suppose, being born that way and unableto escape your heritage. For my part, I shall sleep in a bed; like aChristian," said the Major rather testily."Even Christian cannot sleep sometime," returned Wampus, leaning backin his seat and puffing a cloud of smoke into the clear night air."For me, I am good Christian; but I am not martyr.""What do you mean by that?" demanded the Major."Do you sometime gamble?" inquired Wampus softly."Not often, sir.""But sometime? Ah! Then I make you a bet. I bet you ten dollar to onecent you not sleep in your bed to-night."The Major coughed. Then he frowned."Is it so bad as that?" he asked."I think he is.""I'll not believe it!" exclaimed Major Doyle. "This hotel isn't whatyou might call first-class, and can't rank with the Waldorf-Astoria;but I imagine the beds will be very comfortable.""Once," said Wampus, "I have imagination, too. Now I have experience;so I sleep in automobile."The Major walked away with an exclamation of impatience. He had neverpossessed much confidence in the Canadian's judgment and on thisoccasion he considered the fellow little wiser than a fool.Wampus rolled himself in a rug and was about to stretch his moderatelength upon the broad double seat when a pattering of footsteps washeard and Beth came up to the car. She was wrapped in a dark cloakand carried a bundle of clothing under one arm and her satchel in theunoccupied hand. There was a new moon which dimly lighted the scene,but as all the townspeople were now in bed and the hotel yard desertedthere was no one to remark upon the girl's appearance."Wampus," she said, "let me into the limousine, please. The night isso perfect I've decided to sleep here in the car."The chauffeur jumped down and opened the door."One moment an' I make up the beds for all," he said."Never mind that," Beth answered. "The others are all asleep, I'msure."Wampus shook his head."They all be here pretty soon," he predicted, and proceeded to deftlyprepare the interior of the limousine for the expected party. WhenBeth had entered the car Wampus pitched the lean-to tent and arrangedthe cots as he was accustomed to do when they "camped out."Scarcely had he completed this task when Patsy and Myrtle appeared.They began to explain their presence, but Wampus interrupted them,saying:"All right, Miss Patsy an' Miss Myrtle. Your beds he made up an' Miss'Lizbeth already asleep in him."So they crept inside with sighs of relief, and Wampus had just mountedto the front seat again and disposed himself to rest when Uncle Johntrotted up, clad in his trousers and shirt, with the balance of hisapparel clasped in his arms. He looked at the tent with pleasedapproval."Good boy, Wampus!" he exclaimed. "That room they gave me is aninferno. I'm afraid our young ladies won't sleep a wink.""Oh, yes," returned Wampus with a nod; "all three now inside car, safean' happy.""I'm glad of it. How was your own room, Wampus?""I have not seen him, sir. But I have suspect him; so I sleep here.""You are a wise chauffeur--a rare genus, in other words. Good night,Wampus. Where's the Major?"Wampus chuckled."In hotel. Sir, do the Major swear sometime?"Uncle John crept under the tent."If he does," he responded, "he's swearing this blessed minute.Anyhow, I'll guarantee he's not asleep."Wampus again mounted to his perch."No use my try to sleep 'til Major he come," he muttered, and settledhimself to wait.It was not long.Presently some one approached on a run, and a broad grin overspreadthe chauffeur's features. The Major had not delayed his escape longenough to don his trousers even; he had grabbed his belongings in botharms and fled in his blue and white striped undergarments.Wampus leaped down and lifted the flap of the tent. The Major pausedlong enough in the moonlight to stare at the chauffeur and saysternly:"If you utter one syllable, you rascal, I'll punch your head!"Wampus was discreet. He said not a word.CHAPTER XVIIYELLOW POPPIES"So this is California!" exclaimed Patsy gleefully, as the automobileleft Parker and crossed the Arizona line."But it doesn't look any different," said Myrtle, peering out of thewindow."Of course not," observed Uncle John. "A State boundary is a man-madething, and doesn't affect the country a bit. We've just climbed aminiature mountain back in Arizona, and now we must climb a mate toit in California. But the fact is, we've entered at last the Land ofEnchantment, and every mile now will bring us nearer and nearer to theroses and sunshine.""There's sunshine here now," declared the Major. "We've had it rightalong. But I haven't seen the roses yet, and a pair of ear muffswouldn't be uncomfortable in this cutting breeze.""The air _is_ rather crisp," admitted Uncle John. "But we're still inthe mountainous district, and Haggerty says--"The Major coughed derisively and Mumbles barked and looked at UncleJohn sagaciously."Haggerty says--""Is that a rabbit or a squirrel? Something has caught the eye of ourMumbles," interrupted the Major, pointing vaguely across the mesa."Haggerty says--""I wonder if Mumbles could catch 'em," remarked the Major, withcomplacence."He says that every mile we travel brings us nearer the scent of theorange blossoms and the glare of the yellow poppies," persisted UncleJohn. "You see, we've taken the Southern route, after all, for soon weshall be on the Imperial road, which leads to San Diego--in the heartof the gorgeous Southland.""What is the Imperial road?" inquired Beth."The turnpike through Imperial Valley, said to be the richest bit ofland in all the world, not excepting the famous Nile banks of Egypt.There is no railway there yet, but the Valley is settling very fast,and Haggerty says--""How remarkable!" exclaimed the Major, gazing straight ahead. Andagain Mumbles, curled in Patsy's lap, lifted his shaggy head and gavea wailing bark.Uncle John frowned, but was loyal to Haggerty."He says that if America was now unknown to all the countries of theworld, Imperial would soon make it famous. They grow wonderful cropsthere--strawberries and melons the year around, as well as all thetropical and semi-tropical fruits and grains, flowers and vines knownto any country yet discovered.""Do we go to Imperial?" asked Myrtle, eagerly."I think not, my dear; we just skirt the edge of the Valley. It'srather wild and primitive there yet; for although many settlers areflocking to that favored district Imperial is large enough to be anempire by itself. However, we shall find an ideal climate at Coronado,by the edge of the blue Pacific, and there and at Los Angeles we shallrest from our journey and get acquainted with the wonders of theGolden State. Has the trip tired you, girls?""Not me," answered Beth, promptly. "I've enjoyed every mile of theway.""And so have I," added Patsy; "except perhaps the adventure with theremittance men. But I wouldn't care to have missed even that, for itled to our acquaintance with old Dan'l.""For my part," said Myrtle softly, "I've been in a real fairyland. Ithas seemed like a dream to me, all this glorious journey, and I shallhate to wake up, as I must in time.""Don't worry just yet about the awakening, dear," returned Patsy,leaning over to kiss her little friend. "Just enjoy it while you can.If fairylands exist, they were made for just such as you, Myrtle.""One of the greatest marvels of our trip," said the Major, with asmile, "is the improvement in our dear little invalid. It isn't thesame Myrtle who started out with us, believe me. Can't you all see thechange?""I can _feel_ it," returned Myrtle, happily. "And don't you notice howwell I walk, and how little use I have now for the crutches?""And can you feel the rosy cheeks and bright eyes, too?" asked UncleJohn, regarding her with much satisfaction."The trip was just the thing for Myrtle," added Patsy. "She has grownstronger every day; but she is not quite well yet, you know, and Idepend a good deal upon the genial climate of California to insure hercomplete recovery."Uncle John did not reply. He remembered the doctor's assertion that apainful operation would be necessary to finally restore Myrtle to anormal condition, and his kindly heart disliked to reflect upon theordeal before the poor girl.Haggerty proved a prophet, after all. Each mile they covered openednew vistas of delight to the eager travelers. The air grew more balmyas they left the high altitudes and came upon the level country tothe north, of the San Bernardino range of mountains, nor was itlong before they sighted Imperial and sped through miles of countrycarpeted with the splendid yellow poppies which the State has adoptedas the emblems of California. And behind this golden robe loomed thecotton fields of Imperial, one of the most fascinating sights thetraveler may encounter. They made a curve to the right here, andheaded northerly until they came to Salton. Skirting the edge of thecurious Salton Sea they now headed directly west toward Escondido,finding the roads remarkably good and for long stretches as smooth andhard as an asphalt boulevard. The three days it took them to cross theState were days of wonder and delight.It was not long before they encountered the roses and carnationsgrowing on every side, which the Major had persistently declared to bemythical."It seems all wrong," asserted Patsy's father, moodily, "for suchdelicate flowers to be growing out of doors in midwinter. And look atthe grass! Why, the seasons are changed about. It's Springtime justnow in California.""The man at the last stop we made told me his roses bloomed the yearround," said Patsy, "And just smell the orange blossoms, will you!Aren't they sweet, and don't they remind you of brides?"From Escondido it was a short run to the sea and their first glimpseof the majestic Pacific was from a high bluff overhanging the water.From this point the road ran south to San Diego, skirting the coastalong a mountain trail that is admitted to be one of the mostpicturesque rides in America.Descending the hills as they neared San Diego they passed throughfields of splendid wild flowers so extensive and beautiful thatour girls fairly gasped in wonder. The yellow and orange poppiespredominated, but there were acres of wild mustard throwing countlessnumbers of gorgeous saffron spikes skyward, and vistas of bluecarconnes, white daisies and blood-red delandres. The yucca was inbloom, too, and added its mammoth flower to the display.They did not halt at San Diego, the southernmost city of California,from whence the Mexican line is in plain sight, but drove to the bay,where Wampus guided the limousine on to the big ferryboat bound forCoronado. They all left the car during the brief voyage and watchedthe porpoises sporting in the clear water of the bay and gazedabstractedly at the waving palms on the opposite shore, where liesnestled "the Crown of the Pacific"--Coronado.CHAPTER XVIIITHE SILENT MANEven the Major smiled benignantly when he reached his appointed roomin the magnificent Hotel del Coronado, which is famed throughout theworld."This," said he, "reminds me of New York; and it's the first thingthat has, since I left home.""Why, Daddy, it isn't like New York at all," protested Patsy, standingbeside him at the broad window overlooking the ocean. "Did you eversee a palm tree waving in New York; or daisy bushes as tall as a man;or such masses of roses and flowering vines? And then just notice themountains over there--they're in Mexico, I'm told--and this greatheadland in the other direction; it's called Point Loma. Oh, I neverimagined any place could be so beautiful!"The others were equally excited, and Uncle John said, smiling broadly:"Well, we're here at last, my dears, and I'm sure we are already wellpaid for our trip across the continent. What pleasant rooms these are.If the hotel table is at all to be compared with the house itself weshall have a happy time here, which means we will stay as long aspossible."But the table was another surprise, for the meals were equal to anyserved in the great Eastern metropolis. Uncle John complimented thelandlord, a cheery faced, fat little man who had at one time manageda famous New York hotel and had brought his talents and experience tofar California."I'm sorry," said this gentle boniface, "that I could not reservebetter rooms for you--for there are some choice views from somelocations. I had a corner suite saved for your party, a suite Iconsider the most desirable in the hotel; but an eccentric individualarrived yesterday who demanded the entire suite, and I had to let himhave it. He will not stay long, and as soon as he goes you shall havethe rooms.""Who is he?" asked Uncle John."A rich miner; a most melancholy and peculiar person, by the way,"replied landlord Ross. "I believe his name is Jones."Mr. Merrick started."Jones, and a miner?" he said. "What's his other name--Anson?""We'll look and see," replied Mr. Ross, turning to the hotel register."No; not Anson. He is registered as C.B. Jones, of Boston.""Oh; that's not the Jones at all," said Uncle John, disappointed."It's the Jones who is our guest," replied the landlord, smiling.Meantime the three girls had gone for a walk along the coast. Thebeach is beautiful at Coronado. There is a high sea wall of rock, andthe path runs along its edge almost the length of the promontory. Therocks are sloping, however, and it is not very difficult to climb downthem to where the waves break against the wall.Near the hotel they met straggling groups, strolling in eitherdirection, but half a mile away the promenade was practicallydeserted. It was beginning to grow dark, and Beth said, regretfully:"We must get back, girls, and dress for dinner--an unusual luxury,isn't it? Our trunks arrived at the hotel two weeks ago, and are nowin our rooms, doubtless, awaiting us to unpack them.""Don't let's return just yet," begged Myrtle. "I want to see the sunset.""It will be gorgeous," said Patsy, glancing at the sky; "but we cansee it from our windows, and as we're a long way from the hotel now Ibelieve Beth's suggestion is wise."So they began to retrace their steps. Myrtle still walked with somedifficulty, and they had not proceeded far when Beth exclaimed:"Look at that man down there!"Her companions followed her direction and saw standing upon a hugepile of rocks at the water's edge a slight, solitary figure. Somethingin the poise, as he leaned forward staring at the darkened waves--forthe sun was low and cast shadows aslant the water--struck Myrtle asfamiliar."Oh, girls!" she exclaimed; "it's the Grand Canyon man.""Why, I believe it is," agreed Patsy. "What is he doing?""Nothing," said Beth, briefly. "But he is going to do something, Ithink."While they stared at him from their elevation the man straightened aninstant and cast a hasty glance to either side. The place seemed tohim deserted, for he failed to observe the group of three intentlywatching his motions from the high bank overhead. Next moment heturned back to the water and leaned over the edge of rock again."Don't!" cried Myrtle, her clear voice ringing over the lap of thewaves; "please don't!"He swung around and turned his gaunt features upward to where theyoung girl leaned upon her crutches, with clasped hands and a look ofdistress upon her sweet face."Don't!" she repeated, pleadingly.He passed his hand over his eyes with a very weary gesture and lookedat Myrtle again--this time quite steadily. She was trembling in everylimb and her cheeks were white with fear.Slowly--very slowly--the man turned and began to climb the rocks; notdirectly upward to where the girls stood, but diagonally, so as toreach the walk some distance ahead of them. They did not move until hehad gained the path and turned toward the hotel. Then they followedand kept him in sight until he reached the entrance to the court anddisappeared within."I wonder," said Patsy, as they made their way to their rooms,"whether he really was thinking of plunging into the ocean; or whetherthat time at the Grand Canyon he had a notion of jumping into thechasm.""If so," added Beth, "Myrtle has saved his life twice. But she can'tbe always near to watch the man, and if he has suicidal intentions,he'll make an end of himself, sooner or later, without a doubt.""Perhaps," said Myrtle, hesitatingly, "I am quite wrong, and thestrange man had no intention of doing himself an injury. But each timeI obeyed an impulse that compelled me to cry out; and afterward I havebeen much ashamed of my forwardness."They did not see the melancholy man at dinner; but afterward, in thespacious lobby, they discovered him sitting in a far corner reading amagazine. He seemed intent on this occupation and paid no attention tothe life around him. The girls called Uncle John's attention to him,and Mr. Merrick at once recognized him as the same individual they hadmet at the Grand Canyon."But I am not especially pleased to encounter him again," he said witha slight frown; "for, if I remember aright, he acted very rudely toMyrtle and proved unsociable when I made overtures and spoke to him.""I wonder who he is?" mused Patsy, watching the weary, haggardfeatures as his eyes slowly followed the lines of his magazine."I'll inquire and find out," replied her uncle.The cherubic landlord was just then pacing up and down the lobby,pausing here and there to interchange a word with his guests. UncleJohn approached him and said:"Can you tell me, Mr. Ross, who the gentleman is in the corner?"The landlord looked around at the corner and smiled."That," said he, "is the gentleman we spoke of this afternoon--Mr.C.B. Jones--the man who usurped the rooms intended for you.""Rooms?" repeated Uncle John. "Has he a large party, then?""He is alone; that is the queer part of it," returned the landlord."Nor has he much baggage. But he liked the suite--a parlor with fiverooms opening out of it--and insisted upon having them all, despitethe fact that it is one of the most expensive suites in the hotel. Isaid he was eccentric, did I not?""You were justified," said Mr. Merrick, thought fully. "Thank you,sir, for the information."Even as he rejoined the girls, who were seated together upon a broaddivan, the man arose, laid down his magazine and came slowly downthe room, evidently headed for the elevator. But with a start herecognized the girl who had accosted him on the beach, and the otherswith her, and for an instant came to a full stop before the group, hissad eyes fixed intently upon Myrtle's face.The situation was a bit awkward, and to relieve it Uncle John remarkedin his cheery voice:"Well, Mr. Jones, we meet again, you see."The man turned slowly and faced him; then bowed in a mechanical wayand proceeded to the elevator, into which he disappeared.Naturally Uncle John was indignant."Confound the fellow!" he exclaimed. "He's worse than a boor. Butperhaps his early education was neglected.""Did you call him Mr. Jones, sir?" asked Myrtle in a voice thattrembled with excitement."Yes, my dear; but it is not your Uncle Anson. I've inquired abouthim. The Joneses are pretty thick, wherever you go; but I hope notmany are like this fellow.""Something's wrong with him," declared Patsy. "He's had some sadbereavement--a great blow of some sort--and it has made him somber andmelancholy. He doesn't seem to know he acts rudely. You can tell bythe man's eyes that he is unhappy.""His eyes have neither color nor expression," remarked Beth. "At hisbest, this Mr. Jones must have been an undesirable acquaintance.""You can't be sure of that," returned Patsy; "and I'm positive mytheory is correct. More and more am I inclined to agree with Myrtlethat he is disgusted with life, and longs to end it.""Let him, then," retorted Uncle John. "I'm sure such a person is of nouse to the world, and if he doesn't like himself he's better out ofit."That kindly Mr. Merrick should give vent to such a heartless speechproved how much annoyed he had been by Mr. Jones' discourtesy."He might be reclaimed, and--and comforted," said Myrtle, softly."When I think of the happiness you have brought into my life, sir, Ilong to express my gratitude by making some one else happy.""You're doing it, little one," he answered, pinching her cheek. "Ifwe've brought a bit of sunshine into your life we've reaped an amplereward in your companionship. But if you can find a way to comfortthat man Jones, and fetch him out of his dumps, you are certainly amore wonderful fairy than I've given you credit for."Myrtle did not reply to this, although it pleased her. She presentlypleaded weariness and asked permission to return to her room. Bethand Patsy wanted to go into the great domed ballroom and watch thedancing; so Myrtle bade them good night and ascended by the elevatorto her floor.CHAPTER XIX"THREE TIMES"Softly stepping over the thick carpets, which deadened the sound ofthe crutches--now becoming scarcely necessary to her--the young girlpassed along the corridor, passing angles and turns innumerable on herway to her room. Some erratic architect certainly concocted theplan of the Hotel del Coronado. It is a very labyrinth of passagesconnecting; its nine hundred rooms, and one has to have a good bump oflocation to avoid getting lost in its mazes.Near one of the abrupt turns a door stood ajar, and in passing Myrtleglanced in, and then paused involuntarily. It was a small parlor,prettily furnished, and in a big chair reclined a man whose hands wereboth pressed tight against his face, thus covering it completely. ButMyrtle knew him. The thin frame, as well as the despairing attitude,marked him as the man who had come so strangely into her life andwhose personality affected her so strangely. She now stood in thedimly lighted corridor looking in upon him with infinite pity, and asshe looked her glance fell upon the table beside him, where somethingbright glittered beneath the electric lamps.Her heart gave a sudden thump of mingled fear and dismay. She knewintuitively what that "something" was. "Let him," Uncle John had said;but Myrtle instantly determined _not_ to let him.She hesitated a moment; but seeing that the man remained motionless,his eyes still covered, as if lost to all his surroundings, she softlycrept forward and entered the room. She held the crutches under herarms, but dared not use them for fear of making a noise. Step by stepshe stole forward until the table was within reach. Then she stretchedout her hand, seized the revolver, and hid it in the folds of herblouse.Turning for a final glance at the man she was startled to find he hadremoved his hands and was steadfastly regarding her.Myrtle leaned heavily on her crutches. She felt faint and miserable,like a criminal caught in the act. As her eyes fell before the intentgaze her face turned scarlet with humiliation and chagrin. Still, shedid not attempt to escape, the idea not occurring to her; so for atime the tableau was picturesque--the lame girl standing motionlesswith downcast eyes and the man fixedly staring at her."Three times!" he slowly said, in a voice finally stirred by a traceof emotion. "Three times. My child, why are you so persistent?"Myrtle tried to be brave and meet his gaze. It was not quite sodifficult now the silent man had spoken."Why do you force me to be persistent?" she asked, a tremor in hervoice. "Why are you determined to--to--"Words failed her, but he nodded to show he understood."Because," said he, "I am tired; very tired, my child. It's a bigworld; too big, in fact; but there's nothing in it for me any more."There was expression enough in his voice now; expression of utterdespondency."Why?" asked Myrtle, somewhat frightened to find herself so bold.He did not answer for a long time, but sat reading her mobile faceuntil a gentler look came into his hard blue eyes."It is a story too sad for young ears," he finally replied. "Perhaps,too, you would not understand it, not knowing or understanding me. I'man odd sort of man, well along in years, and I've lived an odd sortof life. But my story, such as it is, has ended, and I'm too weary tobegin another volume.""Oh, no!" exclaimed Myrtle, earnestly. "Surely this cannot be thefulfillment and end of your life. If it were, why should _I_ come intoyour life just now?"He stared at her with a surprised--an even startled--look."Have you come into my life?" he inquired, in a low, curious tone."Haven't I?" she returned. "At the Grand Canyon--""I know," he interrupted hastily. "That was your mistake; and mine.You should not have interfered. I should not have let you interfere.""But I did," said Myrtle."Yes. Somehow your voice sounded like a command, and I obeyed it;perhaps because no living person has a right to command me. You--youtook me by surprise."He passed his hand over his eyes with that weary gesture peculiar tohim, and then fell silent.Myrtle had remained standing. She did not know what to do in thisemergency, or what more to say. The conversation could not be ended inthis summary fashion. The hopeless man needed her in some way; how,she did not know. Feeling weak and very incompetent to meet theimportant crisis properly, the girl crept to a chair opposite the manand sank into it. Then she leaned her chin upon her hand and lookedpleadingly at her strange acquaintance. He met her eyes frankly.The hard look in his own seemed to have disappeared, dispelled by asympathy that was new to him.And so they sat, regarding one another silently yet musingly, for along time."I wish," said Myrtle once, in her softest, sweetest tones, "I couldhelp you. Some one helped me when I was in great trouble, so I want tohelp you."He did not reply, and another period of silence ensued. But his nextspeech showed he had been considering her words."Because you have suffered," he said, "you have compassion for otherswho suffer. But your trouble is over now?""Almost," she said, smiling brightly.He sighed, but questioned her no farther."A while ago," she volunteered, "I had neither friends nor relatives."He gave her a queer look, then. "I had no money. I had been hurt in anaccident and was almost helpless. But I did not despair, sir--and I amonly an inexperienced girl."In my darkest hour I found friends--kind, loving friends--who showedme a new world that I had not suspected was in existence. I thinkthe world is like a great mirror," she continued, meditatively, "andreflects our lives just as we ourselves look upon it. Those who turnsad faces toward the world find only sadness reflected. But a smile isreflected in the same way, and cheers and brightens our hearts. Youthink there is no pleasure to be had in life. That is because you areheartsick and--and tired, as you say. With one sad story ended you areafraid to begin another--a sequel--feeling it would be equally sad.But why should it be? Isn't the joy or sorrow equally divided inlife?""No," he replied."A few days ago," she continued earnestly, "we were crossing theArizona deserts. It was not pleasant, but we did not despair, forwe knew the world is not all desert and that the land of roses andsunshine lay just beyond. Now that we're in California we've forgottenthe dreary desert. But you--Why, sir, you've just crossed your desert,and you believe all the world is bitter and cruel and holds no joy foryou! Why don't you step out bravely into the roses and sunshine oflife, and find the joy that has been denied you?"He looked into her eyes almost fearfully, but it seemed to her thathis own held a first glimmer of hope."Do you believe there can be joy for me anywhere in the world?" heasked."Of course. I tell you there's just as much sweet as there is bitterin life. Don't I know it? Haven't I proved it? But happiness doesn'tchase people who try to hide from it. It will meet you halfway, butyou've got to do your share to deserve it. I'm not preaching; I'velived this all out, in my own experience, and know what I'm talkingabout. Now as for you, sir, I can see very plainly you haven't beendoing your duty. You've met sorrow and let it conquer you. You'vetaken melancholy by the hand and won't let go of it. You haven't triedto fight for your rights--the rights God gave to every man and expectshim to hold fast to and take advantage of. No, indeed!""But what is the use?" he asked, timidly, yet with an eager look inhis face. "You are young, my child; I am nearly old enough to havebeen your father. There are things you have not yet learned; things Ihope you will never learn. An oak may stand alone in a field, and belonely because it cannot touch boughs with another. A flower may bloomalone in a garden, and wither and die for want of companionship. God'swisdom grouped every living thing. He gave Adam a comrade. He createdno solitary thing. But see, my child: although this world containscountless thousands, there is not one among them I may call myfriend.""Oh, yes; just one!" said Myrtle quickly. "I am your friend. Notbecause you want me, but because you need me. And that's a beginning,isn't it? I can find other friends for you, among _my_ friends, andyou will be sure to like them because I like them."This naive suggestion did not affect him as much as the fact that thisfair young girl had confessed herself his friend. He did not look atMyrtle now; he stared straight ahead, at the wall paper, and his browwas furrowed as if he was thinking deeply.Perhaps any other man would have thanked the girl for her sympathy andher proffered friendship, or at the least have acknowledged it. Butnot so this queer Mr. Jones; eccentric, indeed, as the shrewd landlordhad described him. Nor did Myrtle seem to expect an acknowledgment.It was enough for her that her speech had set him thinking along newlines.He sat musing for so long that she finally remembered it was growinglate, and began to fear Patsy and Beth would seek their rooms, whichconnected with her own, and find her absent. That would worry them. Soat last she rose softly, took her crutches and turned to go."Good night, my--friend," she said."Good night, my child," he answered in a mechanical tone, withoutrousing from his abstraction.Myrtle went to her room and found it was not so late as she hadfeared. She opened a drawer and placed the revolver in it, not withouta little shudder."At any rate," she murmured, with satisfaction, "he will not use thisto-night."CHAPTER XXON POINT LOMANext morning a beautiful bunch of roses was brought to Myrtle'sroom--roses so magnificent that it seemed impossible they could begrown out of doors. But there are few hothouses in California, and theboy who brought the flowers confided to her the information that theywere selected from more than five hundred blooms. She ran to show themto Patsy and Beth, who were amazed not only by the roses but by thefact that the queer Mr. Jones had sent them to Myrtle. There was nocard or note accompanying the gift, but after the younger girl hadrelated her conversation with Mr. Jones the previous evening, theycould not doubt but he had sent the flowers."Perhaps," reflected Patsy, "we've been misjudging him. I never beheldsuch a stolid, unimpressive countenance in my life; but the man musthave a soul of some sort, or he would not think of sending flowers tohis new friend.""It's a pretty idea," said Beth. "He wanted to assure Myrtle that heappreciated her kindness.""I'm sure he likes me," declared Myrtle, simply. "He wasn't a bitcross when I ran in and took away his pistol, or when I preached tohim. I really gave him a good talking to, and he didn't object a bit.""What he needs," commented Beth, "is to get away from himself, andmingle with people more. I wonder if we could coax him to join us inour ride to Point Loma.""Would we care to ask him?" said Patsy. "He's as sour and crabbed inlooks as he is in disposition, and has treated Uncle John's advancesshamefully. I'd like to help Myrtle bring the old fellow back to life;but perhaps we can find an easier way than to shut him up with us inan automobile.""He wouldn't go, I'm sure," declared Myrtle. "He has mellowed alittle--a very little--as these roses prove. But he treated me lastnight just as he does Mr. Merrick, even after our conversation. WhenI said 'Good night' I had to wait a long time for his answer. But I'dlike you to meet him and help cheer him up; so please let me introducehim, if there's a chance, and do be nice to him.""I declare," cried Patsy, laughing, "Myrtle has assumed an air ofproprietorship over the Sad One already.""She has a right to, for she saved his life," said Beth."Three times," Myrtle added proudly. "He told me so himself."Uncle John heard the story of Myrtle's adventure with considerablesurprise, and he too expressed a wish to aid her in winning Mr. Jonesfrom his melancholy mood."Every man is queer in one way or another," said he, "and I'd say thewomen were, too, if you females were not listening. I also imagine avery rich man has the right to be eccentric, if it pleases him.""Is Mr. Jones rich, then?" inquired Beth."According to the landlord he's rich as Croesus. Made his money inmining--manipulating stocks, I suppose. But evidently his wealthhasn't been a comfort to him, or he wouldn't want to shuffle off hismortal coil and leave it behind"They did not see the object of this conversation before leaving forthe trip to Point Loma--a promontory that juts out far into thePacific. It is reached by a superb macadamized boulevard, which passesdown the north edge of the promontory, rounds the corner where standsthe lighthouse, and comes back along the southern edge, all the time ahundred feet or more in elevation above the ocean.The view from the Point is unsurpassed. Wampus stopped his car besidea handsomely appointed automobile that was just then deserted."Some one is here before us," remarked Patsy. "But that is notstrange. The wonder is that crowds are not here perpetually.""It is said," related the Major, who had really begun to enjoyCalifornia, "that the view from this Point includes more variedscenery than any other that is known in the world. Here we see thegrand San Bernardino range of mountains; the Spanish Bight on theMexican shore; the pretty city of San Diego climbing its hills, withthe placid bay in front, where float the warships of the PacificSquadron; the broad stretch of orange and lemon groves, hedged withtowering palm trees; Santa Catalina and the Coronado Islands; the bluePacific rolling in front and rugged Loma with its rocky cliffs behind.What more could we ask to see from any one viewpoint?""Don't forget the monster hotel, with its hundred towers and gables,dominating the strip of land between the bay and the ocean," addedBeth. "How near it seems, and yet it is many miles away."Some one had told them that moonstones were to be found on the beachat the base of the cliff; so they all climbed down the steep path,followed by Mumbles, who had not perceptibly grown in size during thetrip but had acquired an adventurous disposition which, coupled withhis native inquisitiveness, frequently led him into trouble.Now, when they had reached the narrow beach, Mumbles ran ahead, passedaround the corner of a cliff that almost touched the water, and waspresently heard barking furiously."Sounds as if he scented game," said Patsy."A turtle, perhaps, or a big fish washed ashore," suggested the Major.But now the small dog's voice changed suddenly and became a successionof yelps expressing mingled pain and terror."Oh, he's hurt!" cried Myrtle; and they all hurried forward, UncleJohn leading them on a run, and passed around the big rock to rescuetheir pet.Some one was before them, however. The foolish dog had found a hugecrab in the sand and, barking loudly, had pushed his muzzle againstthe creature, with the result that the crab seized his black nose ina gripping claw and pinched as hard as it was able. Mumbles tried toback away, madly howling the while; but the crab, although the smallerantagonist, gripped a rock with its other claw and held on, anchoringthe terrified dog to the spot.But help was at hand. A tall, thin man hurried to the rescue, and justas Uncle John came in sight, leading his procession, a knife severedthe crab's claw and Mumbles was free. Seeing his mistress, the puppy,still whining with pain, hurried to her for comfort, while Uncle Johnturned to the man and said:"Thank you, Mr. Jones, for assisting our poor beast. Mumbles is anEastern dog, you know, and inexperienced in dealing with crabs."Mr. Jones was examining the claw, the despoiled owner of which hadquickly slid into the water."It is a species of crawfish," he observed, meditatively. Then, seeingthe girls approach, he straightened up and rather awkwardly lifted hishat.The gesture surprised them all. Heretofore, when they had met, the manhad merely stared and turned away, now his attempt at courtesy wasstartling because unexpected.Myrtle came close to his side."How nice to find you here, Mr. Jones," she said brightly. "And oh, Imust thank you for my lovely roses."He watched her face with evident interest and it seemed that his owncountenance had become less haggard and sad than formerly."Let me introduce my friends," said the girl, with sudden recollectionof her duty. "This is Mr. Merrick, my good friend and benefactor; andthis is Major Doyle and his daughter Miss Patricia Doyle, both of whomhave the kindest hearts in the world; Miss Beth De Graf, Mr. Merrick'sniece, has watched over and cared for me like a sister, and--oh, Iforgot; Miss Patsy is Mr. Merrick's niece, too. So now you know themall."The man nodded briefly his acknowledgment."You--you are Mr. Jones, I believe, of--of Boston?""Once of Boston," he repeated mechanically. Then he looked at her andadded: "Go on.""Why--what--I don't understand," she faltered. "Have I overlookedanyone?""Only yourself," he said."Oh; but I--I met you last night.""You did not tell me your name," he reminded her."I'm Myrtle," she replied, smiling in her relief. "Myrtle Dean.""Myrtle Dean!" His voice was harsh; almost a shout."Myrtle Dean. And I--I'm from Chicago; but I don't live there anymore."He stood motionless, looking at the girl with a fixed expression thatembarrassed her and caused her to glance appealingly at Patsy. Herfriend understood and came to her rescue with some inconsequent remarkabout poor Mumbles, who was still moaning and rubbing; his pinchednose against Patsy's chin to ease the pain.Mr. Jones paid little heed to Miss Doyle's observation, but as Myrtletried to hide behind Beth Mr. Merrick took the situation in hand bydrawing the man's attention to the scenery, and afterward inquiring ifhe was searching for moonstones.The conversation now became general, except that Mr. Jones remainedpractically silent He seemed to try to interest himself in the chatteraround him, but always his eyes would stray to Myrtle's face and holdher until she found an opportunity to turn away."We've luncheon in the car," announced Uncle John, after a time."Won't you join us, Mr. Jones?""Yes," was the unconventional reply. The man was undoubtedlyabstracted and did not know he was rude. He quietly followed them upthe rocks and when they reached the automobile remained by Myrtle'sside while Wampus brought out the lunch basket and Beth and Patsyspread the cloth upon the grass and unpacked the hamper.Mr. Jones ate merely a mouthful, but he evidently endeavored to followthe conversation and take an interest in what was said. He finallybecame conscious that his continuous gaze distressed Myrtle, andthereafter strove to keep his eyes from her face. They would creepback to it, from time to time; but Beth, who was watching himcuriously, concluded he was making a serious effort to deport himselfagreeably and credited him with a decided improvement in manners astheir acquaintance with him progressed.After luncheon, when their return by way of Old Town and the SpanishMission was proposed, Mr. Jones said, pointing to the car that stoodbeside their own:"This is my automobile. I drive it myself. I would like Myrtle Dean toride back with me."The girl hesitated, but quickly deciding she must not retreat, now shehad practically begun the misanthrope's reformation, she replied:"I will be very glad to. But won't you take one of my friends, also?That will divide the party more evenly."He looked down at his feet, thoughtfully considering the proposition."I'll go with you," said Beth, promptly. "Get into the front seat withMr. Jones, Myrtle, and I'll ride behind."The man made no protest. He merely lifted Myrtle in his arms andgently placed her in the front seat. Beth, much amused, took the seatbehind, unassisted save that the Major opened the door for her. Mr.Jones evidently understood his car. Starting the engines withouteffort he took his place at the wheel and with a nod to Mr. Merricksaid:"Lead on, sir; I will follow."Wampus started away. He was displeased with the other car. It didnot suit him at all. And aside from the fact that the sour-facedindividual who owned it had taken away two of Wampus' own passengers,the small shaggy Mumbles, who had been the established companion ofUncle John's chauffeur throughout all the long journey, suddenlydeserted him. He whined to go with the other car, and when Patsylifted him aboard he curled down beside the stranger as if thoroughlysatisfied. Patsy knew why, and was amused that Mumbles showed hisgratitude to Mr. Jones for rescuing him from the crab; but Wampusscowled and was distinctly unhappy all the way to Old Town."Him mebbe fine gentleman," muttered the Canadian to the Major; "butif so he make a disguise of it. Once I knew a dog thief who resemblehim; but perhaps Mumble he safe as long as Miss Myrtle an' Miss Beththey with him.""Don't worry," said the Major, consolingly. "I'll keep my eye on therascal. But he's a fine driver, isn't he?""Oh, _that_!" retorted Wampus, scornfully. "Such little cheap car likethat he drive himself."At Old Town Mr. Jones left them, saying he had been to the Mission anddid not care for it. But as he drove his car away there was a gentlerand more kindly expression upon his features than any of them had everseen there before, and Myrtle suspected her charm was working and theregeneration really begun.CHAPTER XXIA TALE OF WOEThat evening after dinner, as Mr. Merrick sat alone in the hotellobby, the girls having gone to watch the Major bowl tenpins, Mr.Jones approached and sat down in the chair beside him.Uncle John greeted the man with an attempt at cordiality. He could notyet bring himself to like his personality, but on Myrtle's account andbecause he was himself generous enough to wish to be of service toanyone so forlorn and unhappy, he treated Mr. Jones with more respectthan he really thought he deserved."Tell me, Mr. Merrick," was the abrupt request, "where you foundMyrtle Dean."Uncle John told him willingly. There was no doubt but Myrtle hadinterested the man."My girls found her on the train between Chicago and Denver," hebegan. "She was on her way to join her uncle in Leadville.""What is her uncle's name?""Anson Jones. But the child was almost helpless, ill and withoutfriends or money. She was not at all sure her uncle was still inLeadville, in which case she would be at the mercy of a cold world. SoI telegraphed and found that Anson Jones had been gone from the miningcamp for several months. Do you know, sir, I at first suspected youmight be the missing uncle? For I heard you were a miner and foundthat your name is Jones. But I soon discovered you are not AnsonJones, but C.B. Jones--which alters the case considerably."Mr. Jones nodded absently."Tell me the rest," he said.Uncle John complied. He related the manner in which Beth and Patsyhad adopted Myrtle, the physician's examination and report upon hercondition, and then told the main points of their long but delightfuljourney from Albuquerque to San Diego in the limousine."It was one of the most fortunate experiments we have ever tried," heconcluded; "for the child has been the sweetest and most agreeablecompanion imaginable, and her affection and gratitude have amplyrepaid us for anything we have done for her. I am determined she shallnot leave us, sir. When we return to New York I shall consult the bestspecialist to be had, and I am confident she can be fully cured andmade as good as new."The other man had listened intently, and when the story was finishedhe sat silent for a time, as if considering and pondering over what hehad heard. Then, without warning, he announced quietly:"I am Anson Jones."Uncle John fairly gasped for breath."_You_ Anson Jones!" he exclaimed. Then, with plausible suspicion headded: "I myself saw that you are registered as C.B. Jones.""It is the same thing," was the reply. "My name is Collanson--but myfamily always called me 'Anson', when I had a family--and by that nameI was best known in the mining camps. That is what deceived you.""But--dear me!--I don't believe Myrtle knows her uncle's name isCollanson.""Probably not. Her mother, sir, my sister, was my only remainingrelative, the only person on earth who cared for me--although Ifoolishly believed another did. I worked for success as much onKitty's account--Kitty was Myrtle's mother--as for my own sake. Iintended some day to make her comfortable and happy, for I knew herhusband's death had left her poor and friendless. I did not see herfor years, nor write to her often; it was not my way. But Kitty alwaysknew I loved her."He paused and sat silent a moment. Then he resumed, in his quiet, eventones:"There is another part of my story that you must know to understandme fully; to know why I am now a hopeless, desperate man; or wasuntil--until last night, perhaps. Some years ago, when in Boston, Ifell in love with a beautiful girl. I am nearly fifty, and she was notquite thirty, but it never occurred to me that I was too old to winher love, and she frankly confessed she cared for me. But she said shecould not marry a poor man and would therefore wait for me to make afortune. Then I might be sure she would marry me. I believed her. I donot know why men believe women. It is an absurd thing to do. I did it;but other men have been guilty of a like folly. Ah, how I worked andplanned! One cannot always make a fortune in a short time. It took meyears, and all the time she renewed her promises and kept my hopes andmy ambitions alive."At last I won the game, as I knew I should do in time. It was a bigstrike. I discovered the 'Blue Bonnet' mine, and sold a half interestin it for a million. Then I hurried to Boston to claim my bride....She had been married just three months, after waiting, or pretendingto wait, for me for nearly ten years! She married a poor lawyer, too,after persistently refusing me because _I_ was poor. She laughed atmy despair and coldly advised me to find some one else to share myfortune."He paused again and wearily passed his hand over his eyes--a familiargesture, as Myrtle knew. His voice had grown more and more dismal ashe proceeded, and just now he seemed as desolate and unhappy as whenfirst they saw him at the Grand Canyon."I lived through it somehow," he continued; "but the blow stunned me.It stuns me yet. Like a wounded beast I slunk away to find my sister,knowing she would try to comfort me. She was dead. Her daughterMyrtle, whom I had never seen, had been killed in an automobileaccident. That is what her aunt, a terrible woman named Martha Dean,told me, although now I know it was a lie, told to cover her ownbaseness in sending an unprotected child to the far West to seek anunknown uncle. I paid Martha Dean back the money she claimed she hadspent for Myrtle's funeral; that was mere robbery, I suppose, but notto be compared with the crime of her false report. I found myselfbereft of sweetheart, sister--even an unknown niece. Despair claimedme. I took the first train for the West, dazed and utterly despondent.Some impulse led me to stop off at the Grand Canyon, and there I sawthe means of ending all my misery. But Myrtle interfered."Uncle John, now thoroughly interested and sympathetic, leaned over andsaid solemnly:"The hand of God was in that!"Mr. Jones nodded."I am beginning to believe it," he replied. "The girl's face won meeven in that despairing mood. She has Kitty's eyes.""They are beautiful eyes," said Uncle John, earnestly. "Sir, you havefound in your niece one of the sweetest and most lovely girls thatever lived. I congratulate you!"Mr. Jones nodded again. His mood had changed again since they beganto speak of Myrtle. His eyes now glowed with pleasure and pride. Heclasped Mr. Merrick's hand in his own as he said with feeling:"She has saved me, sir. Even before I knew she was my niece I began towonder if it would not pay me to live for her sake. And now--""And now you are sure of it," cried Uncle John, emphatically. "But whois to break the news to Myrtle?""No one, just yet," was the reply. "Allow me, sir, if you please, tokeep her in ignorance of the truth a little longer. I only made thediscovery myself today, you see, and I need time to think it all outand determine how best to take advantage of my good fortune.""I shall respect your wish, sir," said Mr. Merrick.The girls came trooping back then, and instead of running away AnsonJones remained to talk with them.Beth and Patsy were really surprised to find the "Sad One" chattingpleasantly with Uncle John. The Major looked at the man curiously, notunderstanding the change in him. But Myrtle was quite proud of theprogress he was making and his improved spirits rendered the girl veryhappy indeed. Why she should take such an interest in this man shecould not have explained, except that he had been discouraged andhopeless and she had succeeded in preventing him from destroying hislife and given him courage to face the world anew. But surely that wasenough, quite sufficient to give her a feeling of "proprietorship," asPatsy had expressed it, in this queer personage. Aside from all this,she was growing to like the man who owed so much to her. Neither Patsynor Beth could yet see much to interest them or to admire in hisgloomy character; but Myrtle's intuition led her to see beneath thesurface, and she knew there were lovable traits in Mr. Jones' natureif he could only be induced to display them.CHAPTER XXIITHE CONFESSIONAfter that evening the man attached himself to the party on everypossible occasion. Sometimes in their trips around Coronado he rodein their automobile, at other times he took Myrtle, and perhaps oneother, in his own car. Every day he seemed brighter and more cheerful,until even Major Doyle admitted he was not a bad companion.Three weeks later they moved up to Los Angeles, taking two days forthe trip and stopping at Riverside and Redlands on the way. Theyestablished their headquarters at one of the handsome Los Angeleshotels and from there made little journeys through the surroundingcountry, the garden spot of Southern California. One day they went toPasadena, which boasts more splendid residences than any city of itssize in the world; at another time they visited Hollywood, famed as"the Paradise of Flowers." Both mountains and sea were within easyreach, and there was so much to do that the time passed all tooswiftly.It was on their return from such a day's outing that Myrtle met withher life's greatest surprise. Indeed, the surprise was shared by allbut Uncle John, who had religiously kept the secret of Mr. Jones'identity.As they reached the hotel this eventful evening Mr. Merrick said tothe girls:"After you have dressed for dinner meet us on the parlor floor. Wedine privately to-night."They were mildly astonished at the request, but as Uncle John wasalways doing some unusual thing they gave the matter little thought.However, on reaching the parlor floor an hour later they found Mr.Merrick, the Major and Mr. Jones in a group awaiting them, andall were garbed in their dress suits, with rare flowers in theirbuttonholes."What is it, then?" asked Patsy. "A treat?""I think so," said Uncle John, smiling. "Your arm, please, MissDoyle."The Major escorted Beth and Mr. Jones walked solemnly beside Myrtle,who still used crutches, but more as a matter of convenience thanbecause they were necessary. At the end of a corridor a waiter threwopen the door of a small but beautiful banquet room, where a roundtable, glistening with cut glass and silver, was set for six. In thecenter of the table was a handsome centerpiece decorated with vinesof myrtle, while the entire room was filled with sprays of the daintyvines, alive with their pretty blue flowers."Goodness me!" exclaimed Patsy, laughing gleefully. "This seems to beour little Myrtle's especial spread. Who is the host, Uncle John?""Mr. Jones, of course," announced Beth, promptly.Myrtle blushed and glanced shyly at Mr. Jones. His face was fairlyillumined with pleasure. He placed her in the seat of honor and saidgravely:"This is indeed Myrtle's entertainment, for she has found something.It is also partly my own thanksgiving banquet, my friends; for I, too,have found something."His tone was so serious that all remained silent as they took theirseats, and during the many courses served the conversation was lesslively than on former occasions when there had been no ceremony.Myrtle tried hard to eat, but there was a question in her eyes--aquestion that occupied her all through the meal. When, finally, thedessert was served and the servants had withdrawn and left them tothemselves, the girl could restrain her curiosity no longer."Tell me, Mr. Jones," she said, turning to him as he sat beside her;"what have you found?"He was deliberate as ever in answering."You must not call me 'Mr. Jones,' hereafter," said he."Why not? Then, what _shall_ I call you?" she returned, greatlyperplexed."I think it would be more appropriate for you to call me 'UncleAnson.'""Uncle Anson! Why, Uncle Anson is--is--"She paused, utterly bewildered, but with a sudden suspicion that madeher head whirl."It strikes me, Myrtle," said Uncle John, cheerfully, "that you havenever been properly introduced to Mr. Jones. If I remember aright youscraped acquaintance with him and had no regular introduction. So Iwill now perform that agreeable office. Miss Myrtle Dean, allow me topresent your uncle, Mr. Collanson B. Jones.""Collanson!" repeated all the girls, in an astonished chorus."That is my name," said Mr. Jones, the first smile they had seenradiating his grim countenance. "All the folks at home, among them mysister Kitty--your mother, my dear--called me 'Anson'; and that iswhy, I suppose, old Martha Dean knew me only as your 'Uncle Anson.'Had she told you my name was Collanson you might have suspectedearlier that 'C.B. Jones' was your lost uncle. Lost only because hewas unable to find you, Myrtle. While you were journeying West insearch of him he was journeying East. But I'm glad, for many reasons,that you did not know me. It gave me an opportunity to learn thesweetness of your character. Now I sincerely thank God that He led youto me, to reclaim me and give me something to live for. If you willpermit me, my dear niece, I will hereafter devote my whole life toyou, and earnestly try to promote your happiness."During this long speech Myrtle had sat wide eyed and white, watchinghis face and marveling at the strangeness of her fate. But she wasvery, very glad, and young enough to quickly recover from the shock.There was a round of applause from Patsy, Beth, the Major andUncle John, which served admirably to cover their little friend'sembarrassment and give her time to partially collect herself. Then sheturned to Mr. Jones and with eyes swimming with tears tenderly kissedhis furrowed cheek."Oh, Uncle Anson; I'm _so_ happy!" she said.Of course Myrtle's story is told, now. But it may be well to add thatUncle Anson did for her all that Uncle John had intended doing, andeven more. The consultation with a famous New York specialist, ontheir return a month later, assured the girl that no painful operationwas necessary. The splendid outing she had enjoyed, with the fine airof the far West, had built up her health to such an extent that natureremedied the ill she had suffered. Myrtle took no crutches back to NewYork--a city now visited for the first time in her life--nor did sheever need them again. The slight limp she now has will disappearin time, the doctors say, and the child is so radiantly happy thatneither she nor her friends notice the limp at all.Patsy Doyle, as owner of the pretty flat building on Willing Square,has rented to Uncle Anson the apartment just opposite that of theDoyles, and Mr. Jones has furnished it cosily to make a home for hisniece, to whom he is so devoted that Patsy declares her own doting andadoring father is fairly outclassed.The Major asserts this is absurd; but he has acquired a genuinefriendship for Anson Jones, who is no longer sad but has grown lovableunder Myrtle's beneficent influence.***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK AUNT JANE'S NIECES AND UNCLE JOHN********** This file should be named 10124.txt or 10124.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/1/2/10124Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

We are taught by _TheBook_ of sacred history that the disobedience of our first parentsentailed on our globe of earth a sinful and a suffering race: in ourtime there has sprung up from the most abandoned of this sinfulfamily--from pirates, mutineers, and murderers--a little society which,under the precepts of that sacred volume, is characterized by religion,morality, and innocence. The discovery of this happy people, asunexpected as it was accidental, and all that regards their conditionand history, partake so much of the romantic as to render the story notill adapted for an epic poem. Lord Byron, indeed, has partially treatedthe subject; but by blending two incongruous stories, and leaving bothof them imperfect, and by mixing up fact with fiction, has been lessfelicitous than usual; for, beautiful as many passages in his _Island_are, in a region where every tree, and flower, and fountain breathepoetry, yet as a whole the poem is feeble and deficient in dramaticeffect.There still remains to us at least one poet, who, if he could beprevailed on to undertake it, would do justice to the story. To hissuggestion the publication of the present narrative owes its appearance.But a higher object at present is engaging his attention, which, whencompleted, judging from that portion already before the public, willhave raised a splendid and lasting monument to the name of WilliamSotheby, in his translation of the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_.To the kindness of Mrs. Heywood, the relict of the late Captain PeterHeywood, the Editor is indebted for those beautiful and affectionateletters, written by a beloved sister to her unfortunate brother, while aprisoner and under sentence of death; as well as for some occasionalpoetry, which displays an intensity of feeling, a tenderness ofexpression, and a high tone of sentiment that do honour to the head andheart of this amiable and accomplished lady. Those letters also from thebrother to his deeply afflicted family will be read with peculiarinterest.CHAPTER IOTAHEITE     The gentle island, and the genial soil,     The friendly hearts, the feasts without a toil,     The courteous manners but from nature caught,     The wealth unhoarded, and the love unbougnt,            *       *       *       *       *     The bread-tree, which, without the ploughshare, yields     The unreap'd harvest of unfurrow'd fields,     And bakes its unadulterated loaves     Without a furnace in unpurchased groves,     And flings off famine from its fertile breast,     A priceless market for the gathering guest;--     These, etc.--                              BYRON.The reign of George III will be distinguished in history by the greatextension and improvement which geographical knowledge received underthe immediate auspices of this sovereign. At a very early period, afterhis accession to the throne of these realms, expeditions of discoverywere undertaken, 'not (as Dr. Hawkesworth observes) with a view to theacquisition of treasure, or the extent of dominion, but for theimprovement of commerce, and the increase and diffusion of knowledge.'This excellent monarch was himself no mean proficient in the science ofgeography; and it may be doubted if any one of his subjects, at theperiod alluded to, was in possession of so extensive or so well-arrangeda cabinet of maps and charts as his was, or who understood their meritsor their defects so well as he did.The first expeditions that were sent forth, after the conclusion of thewar, were those of Byron, Wallis, and Carteret. In the instructions tothe first of these commanders it is said, 'there is reason to believethat lands and islands of great extent, hitherto unvisited by anyEuropean power, may be found in the Atlantic Ocean, between the Cape ofGood Hope and the Magellanic Strait, within the latitudes convenient fornavigation, and in climates adapted to the produce of commodities usefulin commerce.' It could not require much knowledge or consideration to beassured that, between the Cape and the Strait, climates producingcommodities useful in commerce, with the exception of whales and seals,were likely to be found. The fact was that, among the real objects ofthis and other subsequent voyages, there was one which had engaged theattention of certain philosophers, from the time of the Spanishnavigator, Quiros: this able navigator had maintained that a _TerraAustralis incognita_ must necessarily exist, somewhere in the highlatitudes of the southern hemisphere, to counterbalance the greatmasses of land in those of the northern one, and thus maintain a justequipoise of the globe.While these expeditions were in progress, the Royal Society, in 1768,addressed an application to the king, praying him to appoint a ship ofwar to convey to the South Seas Mr. Alexander Dalrymple (who had adoptedthe opinion of Quiros), and certain others, for the main purpose,however, of observing the transit of Venus over the sun's disc, whichwas to happen in the year 1769. By the king's command, a bark of threehundred and seventy tons was taken up by the Admiralty to perform thisservice, but, as Mr. Dalrymple was a civilian, he could not be entrustedwith the command of the ship, and on that account declined going in her.The command was therefore conferred on Lieutenant James Cook, an officerof undoubted ability, and well versed in astronomy and the theory andpractice of navigation, with whom the Royal Society associated Mr.Charles Green, who had long been assistant to Dr. Bradley, theastronomer royal, to aid him in the observation of the transit. Mr.Banks, a private gentleman of good fortune, who afterwards became thevaluable and distinguished President of the Royal Society, and Dr.Solander, a Swedish gentleman of great acquirements, particularly innatural history, accompanied Lieutenant Cook on this interesting voyage.The islands of Marquesas de Mendoza, or those of Rotterdam or Amsterdam,were proposed by the Royal Society as proper places for making theobservation. While fitting out, however, Captain Wallis returned fromhis expedition, and strongly recommended as most suitable for thepurpose, Port Royal Harbour, on an island he had discovered, to which hehad given the name of 'King George's Island,' and which has since beenknown by its native name, _Otaheite_ or _Tahite_.[1]This lovely island is most intimately connected with the mutiny whichtook place on board the _Bounty_, and with the fate of the mutineers andtheir innocent offspring. Its many seducing temptations have been urgedas one, if not the main, cause of the mutiny, which was supposed, atleast by the commander of that ship, to have been excited by--     Young hearts which languish'd for some sunny isle,     Where summer years, and summer women smile,     Men without country, who, too long estranged,     Had found no native home, or found it changed,     And, half uncivilized, preferr'd the cave     Of some soft savage to the uncertain wave.It may be proper, therefore, as introductory to the present narrative,to give a general description of the rich and spontaneous gifts whichNature has lavished on this once 'happy island;'--of the simple andingenuous manners of its natives,--and of those allurements which weresupposed, erroneously however, to have occasioned the unfortunatecatastrophe alluded to;--to glance at     The nymphs' seducements and the magic bower,as they existed at the period of the first intercourse between theOtaheitans and the crews of those ships, which carried to their shores,in succession, Wallis, Bougainville, and Cook.The first communication which Wallis had with these people wasunfortunately of a hostile nature. Having approached with his ship closeto the shore, the usual symbol of peace and friendship, a branch of theplantain tree, was held up by a native in one of the numerous canoesthat surrounded the ship. Great numbers, on being invited, crowded onboard the stranger ship, but one of them, being butted on the haunchesby a goat, and turning hastily round, perceived it rearing on its hindlegs, ready to repeat the blow, was so terrified at the appearance ofthis strange animal, so different from any he had ever seen, that, inthe moment of terror, he jumped overboard, and all the rest followed hisexample with the utmost precipitation.This little incident, however, produced no mischief; but as the boatswere sounding in the bay, and several canoes crowding round them, Wallissuspected the islanders had a design to attack them, and, on this meresuspicion, ordered the boats by signal to come on board, 'and at thesame time,' he says, 'to intimidate the Indians, I fired a nine-pounderover their heads.' This, as might have been imagined, startled theislanders, but did not prevent them from attempting immediately to cutoff the cutter, as she was standing towards the ship. Several stoneswere thrown into this boat, on which the commanding officer fired amusket, loaded with buck-shot, at the man who threw the first stone, andwounded him in the shoulder.Finding no good anchorage at this place, the ship proceeded to anotherpart of the island, where, on one of the boats being assailed by theIndians in two or three canoes, with their clubs and paddles in theirhands, 'Our people,' says the commander, 'being much pressed, wereobliged to fire, by which one of the assailants was killed, and anothermuch wounded.' This unlucky rencontre did not, however, prevent, as soonas the ship was moored, a great number of canoes from coming off thenext morning, with hogs, fowls, and fruit. A brisk traffic sooncommenced, our people exchanging knives, nails, and trinkets, for moresubstantial articles of food, of which they were in want. Among thecanoes that came out last were some double ones of very large size, withtwelve or fifteen stout men in each, and it was observed that they hadlittle on board except a quantity of round pebble stones. Other canoescame off along with them, having only women on board; and while thesefemales were assiduously practising their allurements, by attitudes thatcould not be misunderstood, with the view, as it would seem, to distractthe attention of the crew, the large double canoes closed round theship; and as these advanced, some of the men began singing, some blowingconchs, and others playing on flutes. One of them, with a person sittingunder a canopy, approached the ship so close, as to allow this person tohand up a bunch of red and yellow feathers, making signs it was for thecaptain. He then put off to a little distance, and, on holding up thebranch of a cocoa-nut tree, there was an universal shout from all thecanoes, which at the same moment moved towards the ship, and a shower ofstones was poured into her on every side. The guard was now ordered tofire, and two of the quarter-deck guns, loaded with small shot, werefired among them at the same time, which created great terror andconfusion, and caused them to retreat to a short distance. In a fewminutes, however, they renewed the attack. The great guns were nowordered to be discharged among them, and also into a mass of canoes thatwere putting off from the shore. It is stated that, at this time, therecould not be less than three hundred canoes about the ship, having onboard at least two thousand men. Again they dispersed, but having sooncollected into something like order, they hoisted white streamers, andpulled towards the ship's stern, when they again began to throw stoneswith great force and dexterity, by the help of slings, each of thestones weighing about two pounds, and many of them wounded the people onboard. At length a shot hit the canoe that apparently had the chief onboard, and cut it asunder. This was no sooner observed by the rest, thanthey all dispersed in such haste, that in half an hour there was not asingle canoe to be seen; and all the people who had crowded the shorefled over the hills with the utmost precipitation. What was to happen onthe following day was matter of conjecture, but this point was soondecided.     The white man landed;--need the rest be told?     The new world stretch'd its dusk hand to the old.Lieutenant Furneaux, on the next morning, landed, without opposition,close to a fine river that fell into the bay--stuck up a staff on whichwas hoisted a pendant,--turned a turf,--and by this process tookpossession of the island in the name of his Majesty, and called it _KingGeorge the Third's Island_. Just as he was embarking, an old man, towhom the Lieutenant had given a few trifles, brought some green boughs,which he threw down at the foot of the staff, then retiring, broughtabout a dozen of his countrymen, who approached the staff in asupplicating posture, then retired and brought two live hogs, which theylaid down at the foot of the staff, and then began to dance. After thisceremony the hogs were put into a canoe and the old man carried them onboard, handing up several green plantain leaves, and uttering a sentenceon the delivery of each. Some presents were offered him in return, buthe would accept of none.Concluding that peace was now established, and that no further attackwould be made, the boats were sent on shore the following day to getwater. While the casks were filling, several natives were perceivedcoming from behind the hills and through the woods, and at the same timea multitude of canoes from behind a projecting point of the bay. Asthese were discovered to be laden with stones, and were making towardsthe ship, it was concluded their intention was to try their fortune in asecond grand attack. 'As to shorten the contest would certainly lessenthe mischief, I determined,' says Captain Wallis, 'to make this actiondecisive, and put an end to hostilities at once.' Accordingly atremendous fire was opened at once on all the groups of canoes, whichhad the effect of immediately dispersing them. The fire was thendirected into the wood, to drive out the islanders, who had assembled inlarge numbers, on which they all fled to the hill, where the women andchildren had seated themselves. Here they collected to the amount ofseveral thousands, imagining themselves at that distance to be perfectlysafe. The captain, however, ordered four shot to be fired over them, buttwo of the balls, having fallen close to a tree where a number of themwere sitting, they were so struck with terror and consternation, that,in less than two minutes, not a creature was to be seen. The coast beingcleared, the boats were manned and armed, and all the carpenters withtheir axes were sent on shore, with directions to destroy every canoethey could find; and we are told this service was effectually performed,and that more than fifty canoes, many of which were sixty feet long, andthree broad, and lashed together, were cut to pieces.This act of severity must have been cruelly felt by these poor people,who, without iron or any kind of tools, but such as stones, shells,teeth, and bones supplied them with, must have spent months and probablyyears in the construction of one of these extraordinary double boats.Such was the inauspicious commencement of our acquaintance with thenatives of Otaheite. Their determined hostility and perseverance in anunequal combat could only have arisen from one of two motives--eitherfrom an opinion that a ship of such magnitude, as they had never beforebeheld, could only be come to their coast to take their country fromthem; or an irresistible temptation to endeavour, at all hazards, topossess themselves of so valuable a prize. Be that as it may, the dreadinspired by the effects of the cannon, and perhaps a conviction of thetruth of what had been explained to them, that the 'strangers wantedonly provisions and water,' had the effect of allaying all jealousy; forfrom the day of the last action, the most friendly and uninterruptedintercourse was established, and continued to the day of the _Dolphin's_departure; and provisions of all kinds, hogs, dogs, fruit, andvegetables, were supplied in the greatest abundance, in exchange forpieces of iron, nails, and trinkets.As a proof of the readiness of these simple people to forgive injuries,a poor woman, accompanied by a young man bearing a branch of theplantain tree, and another man with two hogs, approached the gunner,whom Captain Wallis had appointed to regulate the market, and lookinground on the strangers with great attention, fixing her eyes sometimeson one and sometimes on another, at length burst into tears. It appearedthat her husband and three of her sons had been killed in the attack onthe ship. While this was under explanation, the poor creature was soaffected as to require the support of the two young men, who from theirweeping were probably two more of her sons. When somewhat composed, sheordered the two hogs to be delivered to the gunner, and gave him herhand in token of friendship, but would accept nothing in return.Captain Wallis was now so well satisfied that there was nothing furtherto apprehend from the hostility of the natives, that he sent a party upthe country to cut wood, who were treated with great kindness andhospitality by all they met, and the ship was visited by persons of bothsexes, who by their dress and behaviour appeared to be of a superiorrank. Among others was a tall lady about five and forty years of age, ofa pleasing countenance and majestic deportment. She was under norestraint, either from diffidence or fear, and conducted herself withthat easy freedom which generally distinguishes conscious superiorityand habitual command. She accepted some small present which the captaingave her, with a good grace and much pleasure; and having observed thathe was weak and suffering from ill health, she pointed to the shore,which he understood to be an invitation, and made signs that he would gothither the next morning. His visit to this lady displays so muchcharacter and good feeling, that it will best be described in thecaptain's own words.'The next morning I went on shore for the first time, and my princess orrather queen, for such by her authority she appeared to be, soon aftercame to me, followed by many of her attendants. As she perceived that mydisorder had left me very weak, she ordered her people to take me intheir arms, and carry me not only over the river, but all the way to herhouse; and observing that some of the people who were with me,particularly the first lieutenant and purser, had also been sick, shecaused them also to be carried in the same manner, and a guard, which Ihad ordered out upon the occasion, followed. In our way, a vastmultitude crowded about us, but upon her waving her hand, withoutspeaking a word, they withdrew, and left us a free passage. When weapproached near her house, a great number of both sexes came out to meether; these she presented to me, after having intimated by signs thatthey were her relations, and taking hold of my hand she made them kissit.'We then entered the house, which covered a piece of ground threehundred and twenty-seven feet long, and forty-two feet broad. Itconsisted of a roof thatched with palm leaves, and raised uponthirty-nine pillars on each side, and fourteen in the middle. The ridgeof the thatch, on the inside, was thirty feet high, and the sides of thehouse, to the edge of the roof, were twelve feet high; all below theroof being open. As soon as we entered the house, she made us sit down,and then calling four young girls, she assisted them to take off myshoes, draw down my stockings, and pull off my coat, and then directedthem to smooth down the skin, and gently chafe it with their hands. Thesame operation was also performed on the first lieutenant and thepurser, but upon none of those who appeared to be in health. While thiswas doing, our surgeon, who had walked till he was very warm, took offhis wig to cool and refresh himself: a sudden exclamation of one of theIndians, who saw it, drew the attention of the rest, and in a momentevery eye was fixed upon the prodigy, and every operation was suspended.The whole assembly stood some time motionless, in silent astonishment,which could not have been more strongly expressed, if they haddiscovered that our friend's limbs had been screwed on to the trunk. Ina short time, however, the young women who were chafing us, resumedtheir employment, and having continued for about half an hour, theydressed us again, but in this they were, as may easily be imagined, veryawkward; I found great benefit, however, from the chafing, and so didthe lieutenant and the purser.'After a little time our generous benefactress ordered some bales ofIndian cloth to be brought out, with which she clothed me, and all thatwere with me, according to the fashion of the country. At first Ideclined the acceptance of this favour, but being unwilling not to seempleased with what was intended to please me, I acquiesced. When we wentaway, she ordered a very large sow, big with young, to be taken down tothe boat, and accompanied us thither herself. She had given directionsto her people to carry me, as they had done when I came, but as I choserather to walk, she took me by the arm, and whenever we came to a plashof water or dirt, she lifted me over with as little trouble as it wouldhave cost me to have lifted over a child, if I had been well.'The following morning Captain Wallis sent her a present by the gunner,who found her in the midst of an entertainment given to at least athousand people. The messes were put into shells of cocoa-nuts, and theshells into wooden trays, like those used by our butchers, and shedistributed them with her own hands to the guests, who were seated inrows in the open air, round the great house. When this was done, she satdown herself upon a place somewhat elevated above the rest, and twowomen, placing themselves, one on each side of her, fed her, she openingher mouth as they brought their hands up with the food. From this time,provisions were sent to market in the greatest abundance. The queenfrequently visited the captain on board, and always with a present, butshe never condescended to barter, nor would she accept of any return.One day, after visiting her at her house, the captain at parting madeher comprehend by signs, that he intended to quit the island in sevendays: she immediately understood his meaning, and by similar signs,expressed her wish that he should stay twenty days; that he should gowith her a couple of days' journey into the country, stay there a fewdays, return with plenty of hogs and poultry, and then go away; but onpersisting in his first intention, she burst into tears, and it was notwithout great difficulty that she could be pacified. The next time thatshe went on board, Captain Wallis ordered a good dinner for herentertainment and those chiefs who were of her party; but the queenwould neither eat nor drink. As she was going over the ship's side, sheasked, by signs, whether he still persisted in leaving the island at thetime he had fixed, and on receiving an answer in the affirmative, sheexpressed her regret by a flood of tears; and as soon as her passionsubsided, she told the captain that she would come on board again thefollowing day.Accordingly, the next day she again visited the ship twice, bringingeach time large presents of hogs, fowls, and fruits. The captain, afterexpressing his sense of her kindness and bounty, announced his intentionof sailing the following morning. This, as usual, threw her into tears,and after recovering herself, she made anxious inquiry when he shouldreturn; he said in fifty days, with which she seemed to be satisfied.'She stayed on board,' says Captain Wallis, 'till night, and it was thenwith the greatest difficulty that she could be prevailed upon to go onshore. When she was told that the boat was ready, she threw herself downupon the arm-chest, and wept a long time, with an excess of passion thatcould not be pacified; at last, however, with the greatest reluctance,she was prevailed upon to go into the boat, and was followed by herattendants.'The next day, while the ship was unmooring, the whole beach was coveredwith the inhabitants. The queen came down, and having ordered a doublecanoe to be launched, was rowed off by her own people, followed byfifteen or sixteen other canoes. She soon made her appearance on board,but, not being able to speak, she sat down and gave vent to her passionby weeping. Shortly after a breeze springing up, the ship made sail; andfinding it now necessary to return into her canoe, 'she embraced usall,' says Captain Wallis, 'in the most affectionate manner, and withmany tears; all her attendants also expressed great sorrow at ourdeparture. In a few minutes she came into the bow of her canoe, whereshe sat weeping with inconsolable sorrow. I gave her many things which Ithought would be of great use to her, and some for ornament; shesilently accepted of all, but took little notice of any thing. About teno'clock we had got without the reef, and a fresh breeze springing up,our Indian friends, and particularly the queen, once more bade usfarewell, with such tenderness of affection and grief, as filled both myheart and my eyes.'The tender passion had certainly caught hold of one or both of theseworthies; and if her Majesty's language had been as well understood byCaptain Wallis, as that of Dido was to AEneas, when pressing him to staywith her, there is no doubt it would have been found not less pathetic--     Nec te noster amor, nec te data dextera quondam,     Nec moritura tenet crudeli funere Dido?This lady, however, did not sink, like the 'miserrima Dido,' under hergriefs; on the contrary, we find her in full activity and animation, andequally generous, to Lieut. Cook and his party, under the name of_Oberea_, who, it now appeared, was no queen, but whose husband theydiscovered was uncle to the young king, then a minor, but from whom shewas separated. She soon evinced a partiality for Mr. Banks, though notquite so strong as that for Wallis, but it appears to have been mutual,until an unlucky discovery took place, that she had, at her command, astout strong-boned _cavaliere servente_; added to which, a theft, ratherof an amusing nature, contributed for a time to create a coolness, andsomewhat to disturb the good understanding that had subsisted betweenthem. It happened that a party, consisting of Cook, Banks, Solander, andthree or four others, were benighted at a distance from the anchorage.Mr. Banks, says Lieut. Cook, thought himself fortunate in being offereda place by Oberea, in her own canoe, and wishing his friends a goodnight, took his leave. He went to rest early, according to the custom ofthe country; and taking off his clothes, as was his constant practice,the nights being hot, Oberea kindly insisted upon taking them into herown custody, for otherwise, she said, they would certainly be stolen.Mr. Banks having, as he thought, so good a safeguard, resigned himselfto sleep with all imaginable tranquillity; but awakening about eleveno'clock, and wanting to get up, he searched for his clothes where he hadseen them carefully deposited by Oberea, when he lay down to sleep, andperceived to his sorrow and surprise, that they were missing. Heimmediately awakened Oberea, who, starting up and hearing his complaint,ordered lights, and prepared in great haste to recover what had beenlost. Tootahah (the regent) slept in the next canoe, and being soonalarmed, he came to them and set out with Oberea in search of the thief.Mr. Banks was not in a condition to go with them, as of his apparelscarcely any thing was left him but his breeches. In about half an hourhis two noble friends returned, but without having obtained anyintelligence of his clothes or of the thief. Where Cook and Solander haddisposed of themselves he did not know; but hearing music, which wassure to bring a crowd together, in which there was a chance of hisassociates being among them, he rose, and made the best of his waytowards it, and joined his party, as Cook says, 'more than half naked,and told us his melancholy story.'It was some consolation to find that his friends were fellow-sufferers,Cook having lost his stockings, that had been stolen from under hishead, though he had never been asleep, and his associates their jackets.At day-break Oberea brought to Mr. Banks some of her country clothes;'so that when he came to us,' says Cook, 'he made a most motleyappearance, half Indian and half English.' Such an adventure must havebeen highly amusing to him who was the object of it, when theinconvenience had been removed, as every one will admit who knew thelate venerable President of the Royal Society. He never doubted,however, that Oberea was privy to the theft, and there was strongsuspicion of her having some of the articles in her custody. Being awarethat this feeling existed, she absented herself for some time, and whenshe again appeared, she said a favourite of hers had taken them away,whom she had beaten and dismissed; 'but she seemed conscious,' saysCook, 'that she had no right to be believed; she discovered thestrongest signs of fear, yet she surmounted it with astonishingresolution, and was very pressing to be allowed to sleep with herattendants in Mr. Banks's tent; in this, however, she was notgratified.' Sir Joseph might have thought that, if he complied with herrequest, his breeches might be in danger of following the other articlesof his dress.The Otaheitans cannot resist pilfering. 'I must bear my testimony,'says Cook, 'that the people of this country, of all ranks, men andwomen, are the arrantest thieves upon the face of the earth; but,' headds, 'we must not hastily conclude that theft is a testimony of thesame depravity in them that it is in us, in the instances in which ourpeople were sufferers by their dishonesty; for their temptation wassuch, as to surmount what would be considered as a proof of uncommonintegrity among those who have more knowledge, better principles, andstronger motives to resist the temptations of illicit advantage; anIndian among penny knives and beads, and even nails and broken glass, isin the same state of mind with the meanest servant in Europe amongunlocked coffers of jewels and gold.' Captain Wallis has illustrated thetruth of this position by an experiment he made on some persons, whosedress and behaviour indicated that they were of a superior cast. 'Todiscover what present,' he says, 'would most gratify them, I laid downbefore them a Johannes, a guinea, a crown piece, a Spanish dollar, a fewshillings, some new halfpence, and two large nails, making signs thatthey should take what they liked best. The nails were first seized withgreat eagerness, and then a few of the halfpence, but the silver andgold lay neglected.' Here then it might with truth be said wasdiscovered     The goldless age, where gold disturbs no dreams.But their thirst after iron was irresistible; Wallis's ship was strippedof all the nails in her by the seamen to purchase the good graces ofthe women, who assembled in crowds on the shore. The men even drew outof different parts of the ship those nails that fastened the cleats toher side. This commerce established with the women rendered the men, asmight readily be expected, less obedient to command, and made itnecessary to punish some of them by flogging. The Otaheitans regardedthis punishment with horror. One of Cook's men having insulted a chief'swife, he was ordered to be flogged in their presence. The Indians sawhim stripped and tied up to the rigging with a fixed attention, waitingin silent suspense for the event; but as soon as the first stroke wasgiven, they interfered with great agitation, earnestly entreating thatthe rest of the punishment might be remitted; and when they found theywere unable to prevail, they gave vent to their pity by tears. 'Buttheir tears,' as Cook observes, 'like those of children, were alwaysready to express any passion that was strongly excited, and like thoseof children, they also appeared to be forgotten as soon as shed.' And heinstances this by the following incident:--Mr. Banks seeing a youngwoman in great affliction, the tears streaming from her eyes, inquiredearnestly the cause; but instead of answering, she took from under hergarment a shark's tooth, and struck it six or seven times into her headwith great force; a profusion of blood followed, and disregarding hisinquiries, she continued to talk loud in a melancholy tone, while thosearound were laughing and talking without taking the least notice of herdistress. The bleeding having ceased, she looked up with a smile, andcollecting the pieces of cloth which she had used to stanch the blood,threw them into the sea; then plunging into the river, and washing herwhole body, she returned to the tents with the same gaiety andcheerfulness as if nothing had happened. The same thing occurred in thecase of a chief, who had given great offence to Mr. Banks, when he andall his followers were overwhelmed with grief and dejection; but one ofhis women, having struck a shark's tooth into her head several times,till it was covered with blood, the scene was immediately changed, andlaughing and good humour took place. Wallis witnessed the same kind ofconduct. This, therefore, and the tears, are probably considered a sortof expiation or doing penance for a fault.But the sorrows of these simple and artless people are transient. Cookjustly observes, that what they feel they have never been taught eitherto disguise or suppress; and having no habits of thinking, whichperpetually recall the past and anticipate the future, they are affectedby all the changes of the passing hour, and reflect the colour of thetime, however frequently it may vary. They grieve for the death of arelation, and place the body on a stage erected on piles and coveredwith a roof of thatch, for they never bury the dead, and never approachone of these _morais_ without great solemnity; but theirs is no lastinggrief.An old woman having died, Mr. Banks, whose pursuit was knowledge ofevery kind, and to gain it made himself one of the people, requested hemight attend the ceremony and witness all the mysteries of the solemnityof depositing the body in the morai. The request was complied with, buton no other condition than his taking a part in it. This was just whathe wished. In the evening he repaired to the house of mourning, where hewas received by the daughter of the deceased and several others, amongwhom was a boy about fourteen years old. One of the chiefs of thedistrict was the principal mourner, wearing a fantastical dress. Mr.Banks was stripped entirely of his European clothes, and a small pieceof cloth was tied round his middle. His face and body were then smearedwith charcoal and water, as low as the shoulders, till they were asblack as those of a negro: the same operation was performed on the rest,among whom were some women, who were reduced to a state as near tonakedness as himself; the boy was blacked all over, after which theprocession set forward, the chief mourner having mumbled something likea prayer over the body. It is the custom of the Indians to fly fromthese processions with the utmost precipitation. On the present occasionseveral large bodies of the natives were put to flight, all the houseswere deserted, and not an Otaheitan was to be seen. The body beingdeposited on the stage, the mourners were dismissed to wash themselvesin the river, and to resume their customary dresses and their usualgaiety.They are, however, so jealous of any one approaching these abodes ofthe dead, that one of Cook's party, happening one day to pull a flowerfrom a tree which grew in one of these sepulchral inclosures, was struckby a native who saw it, and came suddenly behind him. The morai ofOberea was a pile of stone-work raised pyramidically, two hundred andsixty-seven feet long, eighty-seven feet wide, and forty-four feet high,terminating in a ridge like the roof of a house, and ascended by stepsof white coral stone neatly squared and polished, some of them not lessthan three feet and a half by two feet and a half. Such a structure,observes Cook, raised without the assistance of iron tools, or mortar tojoin them, struck us with astonishment, as a work of considerable skilland incredible labour.On the same principle of making himself acquainted with every noveltythat presented itself, Captain Cook states that 'Mr. Banks saw theoperation of _tattooing_ performed upon the back of a girl aboutthirteen years old. The instrument used upon this occasion had thirtyteeth, and every stroke, of which at least a hundred were made in aminute, drew an ichor or serum a little tinged with blood. The girl boreit with most stoical resolution for about a quarter of an hour; but thepain of so many hundred punctures as she had received in that time thenbecame intolerable: she first complained in murmurs, then wept, and atlast burst into loud lamentations, earnestly imploring the operator todesist. He was however inexorable; and when she began to struggle, shewas held down by two women, who sometimes soothed and sometimes chidher, and now and then, when she was most unruly, gave her a smart blow.Mr. Banks stayed in the neighbouring house an hour, and the operationwas not over when he went away.'The sufferings of this young lady did not however deter the latePresident of the Royal Society from undergoing the operation on his ownperson.The skill and labour which the Otaheitans bestow on their large doubleboats is not less wonderful than their stone morais, from the felling ofthe tree and splitting it into plank, to the minutest carved ornamentsthat decorate the head and the stern. The whole operation is performedwithout the use of any metallic instrument. 'To fabricate one of theirprincipal vessels with their tools is,' says Cook, 'as great a work asto build a British man of war with ours.' The fighting boats aresometimes more than seventy feet long, but not above three broad; butthey are fastened in pairs, side by side, at the distance of about threefeet; the head and stern rise in a semi-circular form, the latter to theheight of seventeen or eighteen feet. To build these boats, and thesmaller kinds of canoes;--to build their houses, and finish the slightfurniture they contain;--to fell, cleave, carve, and polish timber forvarious purposes;--and, in short, for every conversion of wood--thetools they make use of are the following: an adze of stone; a chisel orgouge of bone, generally that of a man's arm between the wrist andelbow; a rasp of coral; and the skin of a sting-ray, with coral sand asa file or polisher.The persons of the Otaheitan men are in general tall, strong,well-limbed and finely shaped; equal in size to the largest ofEuropeans. The women of superior rank are also above the middle statureof Europeans, but the inferior class are rather below it. The complexionof the former class is that which we call a brunette, and the skin ismost delicately smooth and soft. The shape of the face is comely, thecheek bones are not high, neither are the eyes hollow, nor the browprominent; the nose is a little, but not much, flattened; but theireyes, and more particularly those of the women, are full of expression,sometimes sparkling with fire, and sometimes melting with softness;their teeth also are, almost without exception, most beautifully evenand white, and their breath perfectly without taint. In their motionsthere is at once vigour as well as ease; their walk is graceful, theirdeportment liberal, and their behaviour to strangers and to each other,affable and courteous. In their dispositions they appear to be brave,open, and candid, without suspicion or treachery, cruelty or revenge.Mr. Banks had such confidence in them, as to sleep frequently in theirhouses in the woods, without a companion, and consequently wholly intheir power. They are delicate and cleanly, almost wholly withoutexample.'The natives of Otaheite,' says Cook, 'both men and women, constantlywash their whole bodies in running water three times every day; once assoon as they rise in the morning, once at noon, and again before theysleep at night, whether the sea or river be near them or at a distance.They wash not only the mouth, but the hands at their meals, almostbetween every morsel; and their clothes, as well as their persons, arekept without spot or stain.'If any one should think this picture somewhat overcharged, he will findit fully confirmed in an account of them made by a description of menwho are not much disposed to represent worldly objects in the mostfavourable light. In the first missionary voyage, in the year 1797, thenatives of Otaheite are thus described:'Natural colour olive, inclining to copper; the women, who carefullyclothe themselves, and avoid the sun-beams, are but a shade or twodarker than an European brunette; their eyes are black and sparkling;their teeth white and even; their skin soft and delicate; their limbsfinely turned; their hair jetty, perfumed and ornamented with flowers;they are in general large and wide over the shoulders; we were thereforedisappointed in the judgement we had formed from the report of precedingvisitors; and though here and there was to be seen a young person whomight be esteemed comely, we saw few who, in fact, could be calledbeauties; yet they possess eminent feminine graces: their faces arenever darkened with a scowl, or covered with a cloud of sullenness orsuspicion. Their manners are affable and engaging; their step easy,firm, and graceful; their behaviour free and unguarded; alwaysboundless in generosity to each other, and to strangers; their tempersmild, gentle, and unaffected; slow to take offence, easily pacified, andseldom retaining resentment or revenge, whatever provocation they mayhave received. Their arms and hands are very delicately formed; andthough they go barefoot, their feet are not coarse and spreading.'As wives in private life, they are affectionate, tender and obedient totheir husbands, and uncommonly fond of their children: they nurse themwith the utmost care, and are particularly attentive to keep theinfant's limbs supple and straight. A cripple is hardly ever seen amongthem in early life. A rickety child is never known; anything resemblingit would reflect the highest disgrace on the mother.'The Otaheitans have no partitions in their houses; but, it may beaffirmed, they have in many instances more refined ideas of decency thanourselves; and one, long a resident, scruples not to declare, that henever saw any appetite, hunger and thirst excepted, gratified in public.It is too true that, for the sake of gaining our extraordinarycuriosities, and to please our brutes, they have appeared immodest inthe extreme. Yet they lay this charge wholly at our door, and say thatEnglishmen are ashamed of nothing, and that we have led them to publicacts of indecency never before practised among themselves. Iron here,more precious than gold, bears down every barrier of restraint; honestyand modesty yield to the force of temptation.'[2]Such are the females and the mothers here described, whose interestingoffspring are now peopling Pitcairn's Island, and who, while theyinherit their mothers' virtues, have hitherto kept themselves free fromtheir vices.The greater part of the food of Otaheitans is vegetable. Hogs, dogs, andpoultry are their only animals, and all of them serve for food. 'We allagreed,' says Cook, 'that a South-Sea dog was little inferior to anEnglish lamb,' which he ascribes to its being kept up and fed wholly onvegetables. Broiling and baking are the only two modes of applying fireto their cookery. Captain Wallis observes, that having no vessel inwhich water could be subjected to the action of fire, they had no moreidea that it could be made _hot_, than that it could be made _solid_;and he mentions that one of the attendants of the supposed queen, havingobserved the surgeon fill the tea-pot from an urn, turned the cockhimself, and received the water in his hand; and that as soon as he felthimself scalded, he roared out and began to dance about the cabin withthe most extravagant and ridiculous expressions of pain andastonishment; his companions, unable to conceive what was the matter,staring at him in amaze, and not without some mixture of terror.One of Oberea's peace-offerings to Mr. Banks, for the robbery of hisclothes committed in her boat, was a fine fat dog, and the way in whichit was prepared and baked was as follows. Tupei, the high priest,undertook to perform the double office of butcher and cook. He firstkilled him by holding his hands close over his mouth and nose for thespace of a quarter of an hour. A hole was then made in the ground abouta foot deep, in which a fire was kindled, and some small stones placedin layers, alternately with the wood, to be heated. The dog was thensinged, scraped with a shell, and the hair taken off as clean as if hehad been scalded in hot water. He was then cut up with the sameinstrument, and his entrails carefully washed. When the hole wassufficiently heated, the fire was taken out, and some of the stones,being placed at the bottom, were covered with green leaves. The dog,with the entrails, was then placed upon the leaves, and other leavesbeing laid upon them, the whole was covered with the rest of the hotstones, and the mouth of the hole close stopped with mould. In somewhatless than four hours, it was again opened, and the dog taken outexcellently baked, and the party all agreed that he made a very gooddish. These dogs it seems are bred to be eaten, and live wholly onbread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, yams, and other vegetables of the like kind.The food of the natives, being chiefly vegetable, consists of thevarious preparations of the bread-fruit, of cocoa-nuts, bananas,plantains, and a great variety of other fruit, the spontaneous productsof a rich soil and genial climate. The bread-fruit, when baked in thesame manner as the dog was, is rendered soft, and not unlike a boiledpotato; not quite so farinaceous as a good one, but more so than thoseof the middling sort. Much of this fruit is gathered before it is ripe,and by a certain process is made to undergo the two states offermentation, the saccharine and acetous, in the latter of which it ismoulded into balls, and called _Mahie_. The natives seldom make a mealwithout this sour paste. Salt water is the universal sauce, withoutwhich no meal is eaten. Their drink in general consists of water, or thejuice of the cocoa-nut; the art of producing liquors that intoxicate byfermentation being at this time happily unknown among them; neither didthey make use of any narcotic, as the natives of some other countries doopium, beetel-nut, and tobacco. One day the wife of one of the chiefscame running to Mr. Banks, who was always applied to in every emergencyand distress, and with a mixture of grief and terror in her countenance,made him understand that her husband was dying, in consequence ofsomething the strangers had given him to eat. Mr. Banks found his friendleaning his head against a post, in an attitude of the utmost languorand despondency. His attendants brought out a leaf folded up with greatcare, containing part of the poison of the effects of which their masterwas now dying. On opening the leaf Mr. Banks found in it a chew oftobacco, which the chief had asked from some of the seamen, andimitating them, as he thought, he had rolled it about in his mouth,grinding it to powder with his teeth, and ultimately swallowing it.During the examination of the leaf he looked up at Mr. Banks with themost piteous countenance, and intimated that he had but a very shorttime to live. A copious draught of cocoa-nut milk, however, set all torights, and the chief and his attendants were at once restored to thatflow of cheerfulness and good-humour, which is the characteristic ofthese single-minded people.There is, however, one plant from the root of which they extract a juiceof an intoxicating quality, called _Ava_, but Cook's party saw nothingof its effects, probably owing to their considering drunkenness as adisgrace. This vice of drinking ava is said to be peculiar almost to thechiefs, who vie with each other in drinking the greatest number ofdraughts, each draught being about a pint. They keep this intoxicatingjuice with great care from the women.As eating is one of the most important concerns of life, here as well aselsewhere, Captain Cook's description of a meal made by one of thechiefs of the island cannot be considered as uninteresting, and is heregiven in his own words.'He sits down under the shade of the next tree, or on the shady side ofhis house, and a large quantity of leaves, either of the bread-fruit orbananas, are neatly spread before him upon the ground as a table-cloth;a basket is then set by him that contains his provision, which, if fishor flesh, is ready dressed, and wrapped up in leaves, and two cocoa-nutshells, one full of salt water and one of fresh. His attendants, whichare not few, seat themselves round him, and when all is ready, he beginsby washing his hands and his mouth thoroughly with the fresh water, andthis he repeats almost continually throughout the whole meal. He thentakes part of his provision out of the basket, which generally consistsof a small fish or two, two or three bread-fruits, fourteen or fifteenripe bananas, or six or seven apples. He first takes half a bread-fruit,peels off the rind, and takes out the core with his nails; of this heputs as much into his mouth as it can hold, and while he chews it, takesthe fish out of the leaves and breaks one of them into the salt water,placing the other, and what remains of the bread-fruit, upon the leavesthat have been spread before him. When this is done, he takes up a smallpiece of the fish that has been broken into the salt-water, with all thefingers of one hand, and sucks it into his mouth, so as to get with itas much of the salt-water as possible. In the same manner he takes therest by different morsels, and between each, at least very frequently,takes a small sup of the salt-water, either out of the cocoa-nut shell,or the palm of his hand. In the meantime one of his attendants hasprepared a young cocoa-nut, by peeling off the outer rind with histeeth, an operation which to an European appears very surprising; but itdepends so much upon sleight, that many of us were able to do it beforewe left the island, and some that could scarcely crack a filbert. Themaster when he chooses to drink takes the cocoa-nut thus prepared, andboring a hole through the shell with his fingers, or breaking it with astone, he sucks out the liquor. When he has eaten his bread-fruit andfish, he begins with his plantains, one of which makes but a mouthful,though it be as big as a black-pudding; if instead of plantains he hasapples, he never tastes them till they have been pared; to do this ashell is picked up from the ground, where they are always in plenty, andtossed to him by an attendant. He immediately begins to cut or scrapeoff the rind, but so awkwardly that great part of the fruit is wasted.If, instead of fish, he has flesh, he must have some succedaneum for aknife to divide it; and for this purpose a piece of bamboo is tossed tohim, of which he makes the necessary implement by splitting ittransversely with his nail. While all this has been doing, some of hisattendants have been employed in beating bread-fruit with a stone pestleupon a block of wood; by being beaten in this manner, and sprinkled fromtime to time with water, it is reduced to the consistence of a softpaste, and is then put into a vessel somewhat like a butcher's tray, andeither made up alone, or mixed with banana or _mahie_, according to thetaste of the master, by pouring water upon it by degrees and squeezingit often through the hand. Under this operation it acquires theconsistence of a thick custard, and a large cocoa-nut shell full of itbeing set before him, he sips it as we should do a jelly if we had nospoon to take it from the glass. The meal is then finished by againwashing his hands and his mouth. After which the cocoa-nut shells arecleaned, and everything that is left is replaced in the basket.'Captain Cook adds, 'the quantity of food which these people eat at ameal is prodigious. I have seen one man devour two or three fishes asbig as a perch; three bread-fruits, each bigger than two fists; fourteenor fifteen plantains or bananas, each of them six or seven inches long,and four or five round; and near a quart of the pounded bread-fruit,which is as substantial as the thickest unbaked custard. This is soextraordinary that I scarcely expect to be believed; and I would nothave related it upon my own single testimony, but Mr. Banks, Dr.Solander, and most of the other gentlemen have had ocular demonstrationof its truth, and know that I mention them on the occasion.'The women, who, on other occasions, always mix in the amusements of themen, who are particularly fond of their society, are wholly excludedfrom their meals; nor could the latter be prevailed on to partake ofanything when dining in company on board ship; they said it was notright: even brothers and sisters have each their separate baskets, andtheir provisions are separately prepared; but the English officers andmen, when visiting the young ones at their own houses, frequently ateout of the same basket and drank out of the same cup, to the horror anddismay of the older ladies, who were always offended at this liberty;and if by chance any of the victuals were touched, or even the basketthat contained them, they would throw them away.In this fine climate houses are almost unnecessary. The minimum range ofthe thermometer is about 63 deg., the maximum 85 deg., giving an average of 74 deg..Their sheds or houses consist generally of a thatched roof raised onposts, the eaves reaching to within three or four feet of the ground;the floor is covered with soft hay, over which are laid mats, so thatthe whole is one cushion, on which they sit by day and sleep by night.They eat in the open air, under the shade of the nearest tree. In eachdistrict there is a house erected for general use, much larger thancommon, some of them exceeding two hundred feet in length, thirty broad,and twenty high. The dwelling-houses all stand in the woody belt whichsurrounds the island, between the feet of the central mountains and thesea, each having a very small piece of ground cleared, just enough tokeep the dropping of the trees from the thatch. An Otaheitan woodconsists chiefly of groves of bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts, withoutunderwood, and intersected in all directions by the paths that lead fromone house to another. 'Nothing,' says Cook, 'can be more grateful thanthis shade, in so warm a climate, nor anything more beautiful than thesewalks,'With all the activity they are capable of displaying, and thesprightliness of their disposition, they are fond of indulging in easeand indolence. The trees that produce their food are mostly ofspontaneous growth--the bread-fruit, cocoa-nut, bananas of thirteensorts, besides plantains; a fruit not unlike an apple, which, when ripe,is very pleasant; sweet potatoes, yams, and a species of _arum_; thepandanus, the jambu and the sugar-cane; a variety of plants whose rootsare esculent--these, with many others, are produced with so littleculture, that, as Cook observes, they seem to be exempted from the firstgeneral curse that 'man should eat his bread in the sweat of his brow.'Then for clothing they have the bark of three different trees, the papermulberry, the bread-fruit tree, and a tree which resembles the wildfig-tree of the West Indies; of these the mulberry only requires to becultivated.In preparing the cloth they display a very considerable degree ofingenuity. Red and yellow are the two colours most in use for dyeingtheir cloth; the red is stated to be exceedingly brilliant andbeautiful, approaching nearest to our full scarlet; it is produced bythe mixture of the juices of two vegetables, neither of which separatelyhas the least tendency to that hue: one is the _Cordia Sebestina_, theother a species of _Ficus_; of the former the leaves, of the latter thefruits yield the juices. The yellow dye is extracted from the bark ofthe root of the _Morinda citrifolia_, by scraping and infusing it inwater.Their matting is exceedingly beautiful, particularly that which is madefrom the bark of the _Hibiscus tiliaceus_, and of a species of_Pandanus_. Others are made of rushes and grass with amazing facilityand dispatch. In the same manner their basket and wicker work are mostingeniously made; the former in patterns of a thousand different kinds.Their nets and fishing-lines are strong and neatly made, so are theirfish-hooks of pearl-shell; and their clubs are admirable specimens ofwood-carving.A people so lively, sprightly, and good-humoured as the Otaheitans are,must necessarily have their amusements. They are fond of music, such asis derived from a rude flute and a drum; of dancing, wrestling, shootingwith the bow, and throwing the lance. They exhibit frequent trials ofskill and strength in wrestling; and Cook says it is scarcely possiblefor those who are acquainted with the athletic sports of very remoteantiquity, not to remark a rude resemblance of them in a wrestling-match(which he describes) among the natives of a little island in the midstof the Pacific Ocean.But these simple-minded people have their vices, and great ones too.Chastity is almost unknown among a certain description of women: thereis a detestable society called _Arreoy_, composed, it would seem, of aparticular class, who are supposed to be the chief warriors of theisland. In this society the men and women live in common; and on thebirth of a child it is immediately smothered, that its bringing up maynot interfere with the brutal pleasures of either father or mother.Another savage practice is that of immolating human beings at the_Morais_, which serve as temples as well as sepulchres, and yet, by thereport of the missionaries, they entertain a due sense and reverentialawe of the Deity. 'With regard to their worship,' Captain Cook does theOtaheitans but justice in saying, 'they reproach many who bear the nameof Christians. You see no instances of an Otaheitan drawing near theEatooa with carelessness and inattention; he is all devotion; heapproaches the place of worship with reverential awe; uncovers when hetreads on sacred ground; and prays with a fervour that would do honourto a better profession. He firmly credits the traditions of hisancestors. None dares dispute the existence of the Deity.' Thieving mayalso be reckoned as one of their vices; this, however, is common to alluncivilized nations, and, it may be added, civilized too. But to judgethem fairly in this respect, we should compare their situation with thatof a more civilized people. A native of Otaheite goes on board a shipand finds himself in the midst of iron bolts, nails, knives, scatteredabout, and is tempted to carry off a few of them. If we could suppose aship from El Dorado to arrive in the Thames, and that the custom-houseofficers, on boarding her, found themselves in the midst of bolts,hatchets, chisels, all of solid gold, scattered about the deck, one needscarcely say what would be likely to happen. If the former found thetemptation irresistible to supply himself with what was essentiallyuseful--the latter would be as little able to resist that which wouldcontribute to the indulgence of his avarice or the gratification of hispleasures, or of both.Such was the state of this beautiful island and its interesting andfascinating natives at the time when Captain Wallis first discovered andLieutenant Cook shortly afterwards visited it. What they now are, asdescribed by Captain Beechey, it is lamentable to reflect. All theirusual and innocent amusements have been denounced by the missionaries,and, in lieu of them, these poor people have been driven to seek forresources in habits of indolence and apathy: that simplicity ofcharacter, which atoned for many of their faults, has been convertedinto cunning and hypocrisy; and drunkenness, poverty, and disease havethinned the island of its former population to a frightful degree. By asurvey of the first missionaries, and a census of the inhabitants, takenin 1797, the population was estimated at 16,050 souls; CaptainWaldegrave, in 1830, states it, on the authority of a census also takenby the missionaries, to amount only to 5000--and there is but too muchreason to ascribe this diminution to praying, psalm-singing, anddram-drinking.[3]The island of Otaheite is in shape two circles united by a low andnarrow isthmus. The larger circle is named Otaheite Mooe, and is aboutthirty miles in diameter; the lesser, named Tiaraboo, about ten miles indiameter. A belt of low land, terminating in numerous valleys, ascendingby gentle slopes to the central mountain, which is about seven thousandfeet high, surrounds the larger circle, and the same is the case withthe smaller circle on a proportionate scale. Down these valleys flowstreams and rivulets of clear water, and the most luxuriant and verdantfoliage fills their sides and the hilly ridges that separate them, amongwhich were once scattered the smiling cottages and little plantations ofthe natives. All these are now destroyed, and the remnant of thepopulation has crept down to the flats and swampy ground on the seashore, completely subservient to the seven establishments ofmissionaries, who have taken from them what little trade they used tocarry on, to possess themselves of it; who have their warehouses, act asagents, and monopolize all the cattle on the island--but, in return,they have given them a new religion and a _parliament (risum teneatis?)_and reduced them to a state of complete pauperism--and all, as they say,and probably have so persuaded themselves, for the honour of God, andthe salvation of their souls! How much is such a change brought about bysuch conduct to be deprecated! how lamentable is it to reflect, that anisland on which Nature has lavished so many of her bounteous gifts, withwhich neither Cyprus nor Cythera, nor the fanciful island of Calypso,can compete in splendid and luxuriant beauties, should be doomed to sucha fate,--in an enlightened age, and by a people that call themselvescivilized!CHAPTER IITHE BREAD-FRUIT     --The happy shores without a law,            *       *       *       *       *     Where all partake the earth without dispute,     And bread itself is gather'd as a fruit;     Where none contest the fields, the woods, the streams:--     The goldless age, where gold disturbs no dreams,     Inhabits or inhabited the shore,     Till Europe taught them better than before,     Bestow'd her customs, and amended theirs,     But left her vices also to their heirs.     BYRON.In the year 1787, being seventeen years after Cook's return from hisfirst voyage, the merchants and planters resident in London, andinterested in the West India possessions, having represented to hisMajesty, that the introduction of the bread-fruit tree into the islandsof those seas, to constitute an article of food, would be of veryessential benefit to the inhabitants, the king was graciously pleased tocomply with their request; and a vessel was accordingly purchased, andfitted at Deptford with the necessary fixtures and preparations, forcarrying into effect the benevolent object of the voyage. Thearrangements for disposing the plants were undertaken, and completed ina most ingenious and effective manner, by Sir Joseph Banks, whosuperintended the whole equipment of the ship with the greatestattention and assiduity till she was in all respects ready for sea. Henamed the ship the _Bounty_, and recommended Lieutenant Bligh, who hadbeen with Captain Cook, to command her. Her burden was about two hundredand fifteen tons; and her establishment consisted of one lieutenant, whowas commanding officer, one master, three warrant officers, one surgeon,two master's mates, two midshipmen, and thirty-four petty officers andseamen, making in all forty-four; to which were added two skilful andcareful men, recommended by Sir Joseph Banks, to have the management ofthe plants intended to be carried to the West Indies, and others to bebrought home for his Majesty's garden at Kew: one was David Nelson, whohad served in a similar situation in Captain Cook's last voyage; theother William Brown, as an assistant to him.The object of all the former voyages to the South Seas, undertaken bycommand of his Majesty George III, was the increase of knowledge by newdiscoveries, and the advancement of science, more particularly ofnatural history and geography: the intention of the present voyage wasto derive some practical benefit from the distant discoveries that hadalready been made; and no object was deemed more likely to realise theexpectation of benefit than the bread-fruit, which afforded to thenatives of Otaheite so very considerable a portion of their food, andwhich it was hoped it might also do for the black population of the WestIndia Islands. The bread-fruit plant was no new discovery of eitherWallis or Cook. So early as the year 1688, that excellent old navigator,Dampier, thus describes it:--'The bread-fruit, as we call it, grows on alarge tree, as big and high as our largest apple-trees; it hath aspreading head, full of branches and dark leaves. The fruit grows on theboughs like apples; it is as big as a penny-loaf, when wheat is at fiveshillings the bushel; it is of a round shape, and hath a thick toughrind; when the fruit is ripe it is yellow and soft, and the taste issweet and pleasant. The natives of Guam use it for bread. They gatherit, when full grown, while it is green and hard; then they bake it in anoven, which scorcheth the rind and makes it black, but they scrape offthe outside black crust, and there remains a tender thin crust; and theinside is soft, tender, and white, like the crumb of a penny-loaf. Thereis neither seed nor stone in the inside, but all is of a pure substancelike bread. It must be eaten new; for if it is kept above twenty-fourhours, it grows harsh and choaky; but it is very pleasant before it istoo stale. This fruit lasts in season eight months in the year, duringwhich the natives eat no other sort of food of bread kind. I did neversee of this fruit anywhere but here. The natives told us that there isplenty of this fruit growing on the rest of the Ladrone Islands; and Idid never hear of it anywhere else.'Lord Anson corroborates this account of the bread-fruit, and says that,while at Tinian, it was constantly eaten by his officers and ship'scompany during their two months' stay, instead of bread; and souniversally preferred, that no ship's bread was expended in that wholeinterval. The only essential difference between Dampier's and Cook'sdescription is, where the latter says, which is true, that this fruithas a _core_, and that the eatable part lies between the skin and thecore. Cook says also that its taste is insipid, with a slight sweetness,somewhat resembling that of the crumb of wheaten bread mixed with aJerusalem artichoke. From such a description, it is not surprising thatthe West India planters should have felt desirous of introducing it intothose islands; and accordingly the introduction of it was subsequentlyaccomplished, notwithstanding the failure of the present voyage; it hasnot, however, been found to answer the expectation that had reasonablybeen entertained. The climate, as to latitude, ought to be the same, ornearly so, as that of Otaheite, but there would appear to be somedifference in the situation or nature of the soil, that prevents it fromthriving in the West India Islands. At Otaheite and on several of thePacific Islands,     The bread-tree, which, without the ploughshare yields,     The unreap'd harvest of unfurrow'd fields,     And bakes its unadulterated loaves     Without a furnace in unpurchased groves,     And flings off famine from its fertile breast,     A priceless market for the gathering guest--is to the natives of those islands a most invaluable gift, but it hasnot been found to yield similar benefits to the West India Islands.On the 23rd December, 1787, the _Bounty_ sailed from Spithead, and onthe 26th it blew a severe storm of wind from the eastward, whichcontinued to the 29th, in the course of which the ship suffered greatly.One sea broke away the spare-yards and spars out of the starboardmain-chains. Another heavy sea broke into the ship and stove all theboats. Several casks of beer that had been lashed upon deck, were brokeloose and washed overboard; and it was not without great difficulty andrisk that they were able to secure the boats from being washed awayentirely. Besides other mischief done to them in this storm, a largequantity of bread was damaged and rendered useless, for the sea hadstove in the stern and filled the cabin with water.This made it desirable to touch at Teneriffe to put the ship to rights,where they arrived on the 5th January, 1788, and having refitted andrefreshed, they sailed again on the 10th.'I now,' says Bligh, 'divided the people into three watches, and gavethe charge of the third watch to Mr. Fletcher Christian, one of themates. I have always considered this a desirable regulation whencircumstances will admit of it, and I am persuaded that unbroken restnot only contributes much towards the health of the ship's company, butenables them more readily to exert themselves in cases of suddenemergency.'Wishing to proceed to Otaheite without stopping, and the late stormhaving diminished their supply of provisions, it was deemed expedient toput all hands on an allowance of two-thirds of bread. It was alsodecided that water for drinking should be passed through filteringstones that had been procured at Teneriffe. 'I now,' says Bligh, 'madethe ship's company acquainted with the object of the voyage, and gaveassurances of the certainty of promotion to every one whose endeavoursshould merit it.' Nothing, indeed, seemed to be neglected on the part ofthe commander to make his officers and men comfortable and happy. He washimself a thorough-bred sailor, and availed himself of every possiblemeans of preserving the health of his crew. Continued rain and a closeatmosphere had covered everything in the ship with mildew. She wastherefore aired below with fires, and frequently sprinkled with vinegar,and every interval of dry weather was taken advantage of to open all thehatchways, and clean the ship, and to have all the people's wet thingswashed and dried. With these precautions to secure health, they passedthe hazy and sultry atmosphere of the low latitudes without a singlecomplaint.On Sunday, the 2nd of March, Lieutenant Bligh observes, 'after seeingthat every person was clean, Divine service was performed, according tomy usual custom. On this day I gave to Mr. Fletcher Christian, whom Ihad before desired to take charge of the third watch, a written orderto act as lieutenant.'Having reached as far as the latitude of 36 degrees south, on the 9thMarch, 'the change of temperature,' he observes, 'began now to besensibly felt, there being a variation in the thermometer, sinceyesterday, of eight degrees. That the people might not suffer by theirown negligence, I gave orders for their light tropical clothing to beput by, and made them dress in a manner more suited to a cold climate. Ihad provided for this before I left England, by giving directions forsuch clothes to be purchased as would be found necessary. On this day,on a complaint of the master, I found it necessary to punish MatthewQuintal, one of the seamen, with two dozen lashes, for insolence andmutinous behaviour. Before this I had not had occasion to punish anyperson on board.'The sight of New Year's Harbour, in Staaten Land, almost tempted him, hesays, to put in; but the lateness of the season, and the people being ingood health, determined him to lay aside all thoughts of refreshmentuntil they should reach Otaheite. Indeed the extraordinary care he hadtaken to preserve the health of the ship's company rendered any delay inthis cold and inhospitable region unnecessary.They soon after this had to encounter tremendous weather off Cape Horn,storms of wind, with hail and sleet, which made it necessary to keep aconstant fire night and day; and one of the watch always attended todry the people's wet clothes. This stormy weather continued for ninedays; the ship began to complain, and required pumping every hour; thedecks became so leaky that the commander was obliged to allot the greatcabin to those who had wet berths, to hang their hammocks in. Findingthey were losing ground every day, and that it was hopeless to persistin attempting a passage by this route, at this season of the year, tothe Society Islands, and after struggling for thirty days in thistempestuous ocean, it was determined to bear away for the Cape of GoodHope. The helm was accordingly put a-weather, to the great joy of everyperson on board.They arrived at the Cape on the 23rd of May, and having remained therethirty-eight days to refit the ship, replenish provisions, and refreshthe crew, they sailed again on the 1st July, and anchored in AdventureBay, in Van Diemen's Land, on the 20th August. Here they remained takingin wood and water till the 4th September, and on the evening of the 25thOctober they saw Otaheite; and the next day came to anchor in MatavaiBay, after a distance which the ship had run over, by the log, sinceleaving England, of twenty-seven thousand and eighty-six miles, being onan average one hundred and eight miles each twenty-four hours. Of theirproceedings in Otaheite a short abstract from Bligh's Journal willsuffice.Many inquiries were made by the natives after Captain Cook, Sir JosephBanks, and others of their former friends. 'One of my first questions,'says Bligh, 'was after our friend Omai; and it was a sensiblemortification and disappointment to me to hear, that not only Omai, butboth the New Zealand boys who had been left with him, were dead. Thereappeared among the natives in general great good-will towards us, andthey seemed to be much rejoiced at our arrival. The whole day weexperienced no instance of dishonesty; and we were so much crowded, thatI could not undertake to remove to a more proper station, without dangerof disobliging our visitors, by desiring them to leave the ship.'Otoo, the chief of the district, on hearing of the arrival of the_Bounty_, sent a small pig and a young plantain tree, as a token offriendship. The ship was now plentifully supplied with provisions; everyman on board having as much as he could consume.As soon as the ship was secured, Lieutenant Bligh went on shore with thechief, Poeeno, passing through a walk delightfully shaded withbread-fruit trees, to his own house, where his wife and her sister werebusily employed staining a piece of cloth red. They desired him to sitdown on a mat, and with great kindness offered him refreshments. Severalstrangers were now introduced, who came to offer their congratulations,and behaved with great decorum and attention. On taking leave, he says,'the ladies, for they deserve to be called such from their natural andunaffected manners, and elegance of deportment, got up, and taking someof their finest cloth and a mat, clothed me in the Otaheitan fashion,and then said, "We will go with you to your boat;" and each taking me bythe hand, amidst a great crowd, led me to the water side, and then tooktheir leave.' In this day's walk, Bligh had the satisfaction to see thatthe island had received some benefit from the former visits of CaptainCook. Two shaddocks were brought to him, a fruit which they had not tillCook introduced it; and among the articles which they brought off to theship, and offered for sale, were capsicums, pumpkins, and two younggoats. In the course of two or three days,' says he, 'an intimacybetween the natives and the ship's company was become so general, thatthere was scarcely a man in the ship who had not already his _tayo_ orfriend.'Nelson, the gardener, and his assistant, being sent out to look foryoung plants, it was no small degree of pleasure to find them report ontheir return, that, according to appearances, the object of the voyagewould probably be accomplished with ease; the plants were plentiful, andno apparent objection on the part of the natives to collect as many asmight be wanted. Nelson had the gratification to meet with two fineshaddock trees which he had planted in 1777, and which were now full offruit, but not ripe.Presents were now given to Otoo, the Chief of Matavai, who had changedhis name to Tinah. He was told that, on account of the kindness of hispeople to Captain Cook, and from a desire to serve him and his country;King George had sent out those valuable presents to him; and 'will younot, Tinah,' said Bligh, 'send something to King George in return?''Yes,' he said, 'I will send him anything I have;' and then began toenumerate the different articles in his power, among which he mentionedthe bread-fruit. This was the exact point to which Bligh wasendeavouring to lead him, and he was immediately told that thebread-fruit trees were what King George would like very much, on whichhe promised that a great many should be put on board.Hitherto no thefts had been committed, and Bligh was congratulatinghimself on the improvement of the Otaheitans in this respect, as thesame facilities and the same temptations were open to them as before.The ship, as on former occasions, was constantly crowded with visitors.One day, however, the gudgeon of the rudder belonging to the largecutter was drawn out and stolen, without being perceived by the man whowas stationed to take care of her; and as this and some other pettythefts, mostly owing to the negligence of the men, were commencing, andwould have a tendency to interrupt the good terms on which they werewith the chiefs, 'I thought,' says Bligh, 'it would have a good effectto punish the boat-keeper in their presence, and accordingly I orderedhim a dozen lashes. All who attended the punishment interceded veryearnestly to get it mitigated: the women shewed great sympathy, and thatdegree of feeling which characterizes the amiable part of their sex.'The longer they remained on the island, the more they had occasion tobe pleased with the conduct of the islanders, and the less incommodedeither on board or when on shore, by the natives following them as atfirst. Into every house they wished to enter, they always experienced akind reception. The Otaheitans, we are told, have the most perfecteasiness of manner, equally free from forwardness and formality; andthat 'there is a candour and sincerity about them that is quitedelightful.' When they offer refreshments, for instance, if they are notaccepted, they do not think of offering them a second time; for theyhave not the least idea of that ceremonious kind of refusal whichexpects a second invitation. 'Having one day,' says Bligh, 'exposedmyself too much in the sun, I was taken ill, on which all the powerfulpeople, both men and women, collected round me, offering theirassistance. For this short illness I was made ample amends by thepleasure I received from the attention and appearance of affection inthese kind people.'On one occasion the _Bounty_ had nearly gone ashore in a tremendous galeof wind, and on another did actually get aground; on both whichaccidents, these kind-hearted people came in crowds to congratulate thecaptain on her escape; and many of them are stated to have been affectedin the most lively manner, shedding tears while the danger in which theship was placed continued.On the 9th December, the surgeon of the _Bounty_ died from the effectsof intemperance and indolence. This unfortunate man is represented tohave been in a constant state of intoxication, and was so averse fromany kind of exercise, that he never could be prevailed on to take half adozen hours upon deck at a time in the whole course of the voyage.Lieutenant Bligh had obtained permission to bury him on shore; and ongoing with the chief Tinah to the spot intended for his burial place, 'Ifound,' says he, 'the natives had already begun to dig his grave.' Tinahasked if they were doing it right? 'There,' says he, 'the sun rises, andthere it sets.' Whether the idea of making the grave east and west istheir own, or whether they learnt it from the Spaniards, who buried thecaptain of their ship on the island in 1774, there were no means ofascertaining; but it was certain they had no intimation of that kindfrom anybody belonging to the _Bounty._ When the funeral took place, thechiefs and many of the natives attended the ceremony, and shewed greatattention during the service. Many of the principal natives attendeddivine service on Sundays, and behaved with great decency. Some of thewomen at one time betrayed an inclination to laugh at the generalresponses; but, the captain says, on looking at them they appeared muchashamed.The border of low land, which is of the breadth of about three miles,between the sea-coast and the foot of the hills, consists of a verydelightful country, well covered with bread-fruit and cocoa-trees, andstrewed with houses in which are swarms of children playing about. 'Itis delightful,' Bligh observes, 'to see the swarms of little childrenthat are every where to be seen employed at their several amusements;some flying kites, some swinging in ropes suspended from the boughs oftrees, others walking on stilts, some wrestling, and others playing allmanner of antic tricks such as are common to boys in England. The littlegirls have also their amusements, consisting generally of heivahs ordances. On an evening, just before sunset the whole beach abreast theship is described as being like a parade, crowded with men, women, andchildren, who go on with their sports and amusements till nearly dark,when every one peaceably returns to his home. At such times, we aretold, from three to four hundred people are assembled together, and allhappily diverted, good humoured, and affectionate to one another,without a single quarrel having ever happened to disturb the harmonythat existed among these amiable people. Both boys and girls are said tobe handsome and very sprightly.It did not appear that much pains were taken in their plantations,except those of the ava and the cloth-plant; many of the latter arefenced with stone, and surrounded with a ditch. In fact, Nature has doneso much for them, that they have no great occasion to use exertion inobtaining a sufficient supply of either food or raiment. Yet when Blighcommenced taking up the bread-fruit plants, he derived much assistancefrom the natives in collecting and pruning them, which they understoodperfectly well.The behaviour of these people on all occasions was highly deserving ofpraise. One morning, at the relief of the watch, the small cutter wasmissing. The ship's company were immediately mustered, when it appearedthat three men were absent. They had taken with them eight stand of armsand ammunition; but what their plan was, or which way they had gone, noone on board seemed to have the least knowledge. Information being givenof the route they had taken, the master was dispatched to search for thecutter, and one of the chiefs went with him; but before they had gothalf way, they met the boat with five of the natives, who were bringingher back to the ship. For this service they were handsomely rewarded.The chiefs promised to use every possible means to detect and bring backthe deserters, which, in a few days, some of the islanders had so faraccomplished as to seize and bind them, but let them loose again on apromise that they would return to their ship, which they did not exactlyfulfil, but gave themselves up soon after on a search being made forthem.A few days after this, a much more serious occurrence happened, that wascalculated to give to the commander great concern. The wind had blownfresh in the night, and at daylight it was discovered that the cable, bywhich the ship rode, had been cut near the water's edge, in such amanner, that only one strand remained whole. While they were securingthe ship, Tinah came on board; and though there was no reason whateverto suppose otherwise than that he was perfectly innocent of thetransaction, nevertheless, says the commander, 'I spoke to him in a veryperemptory manner, and insisted upon his discovering and bringing to methe offender. He promised to use his utmost endeavours to discover theguilty person. The next morning he and his wife came to me, and assuredme that they had made the strictest inquiries without success. This wasnot at all satisfactory, and I behaved towards them with great coolness,at which they were much distressed; and the lady at length gave vent toher sorrow by tears. I could no longer keep up the appearance ofmistrusting them, but I earnestly recommended to them, as they valuedthe King of England's friendship, that they would exert their utmostendeavours to find out the offenders, which they faithfully promised todo.'Here Bligh observes, it had since occurred to him, that this attempt tocut the ship adrift was most probably the act of some of his own people;whose purpose of remaining at Otaheite might have been effectuallyanswered without danger, if the ship had been driven on shore. At thetime it occurred, he says, he entertained not the least thought of thiskind, nor did the possibility of it enter into his ideas, having nosuspicion that so general an indication, or so strong an attachment tothese islands, could prevail among his people, as to induce them toabandon every prospect of returning to their native country.This after-thought of Bligh will appear in the sequel to be whollygratuitous, and yet he might naturally enough have concluded that solong and unrestrained an intercourse with a people among whom every manhad his _tayo_ or friend; among whom every man was free to indulge everywish of his heart; where, from the moment he set his foot on shore, hefound himself surrounded by female allurements in the midst of ease andindolence, and living in a state of luxury without submitting to anykind of labour--such enticements to a common sailor might naturallyenough be supposed to create a desire for a longer residence in such acountry; but this supposition is not borne out by subsequent events. Thedamage done to the cable was, in all probability, owing to its chafingover the rocky bottom.The _Bounty_ arrived on the 26th October, 1788, and remained till the4th April, 1789. On the 31st March, the Commander says, 'To-day, all theplants were on board, being in seven hundred and seventy-four pots,thirty-nine tubs, and twenty-four boxes. The number of bread-fruitplants were one thousand and fifteen; besides which, we had collected anumber of other plants: the _avee_, which is one of the finest flavouredfruits in the world; the _ayyah_, which is a fruit not so rich, but of afine flavour and very refreshing; the _rattah_, not much unlike achestnut, which grows on a large tree in great quantities; they aresingly in large pods, from one to two inches broad, and may be eatenraw, or boiled in the same manner as Windsor beans, and so dressed areequally good; the _orai-ab_, which is a very superior kind of plantain.All these I was particularly recommended to collect, by my worthy friendSir Joseph Banks.'While these active preparations for departure were going on, the goodchief Tinah, on bringing a present for King George, could not refrainfrom shedding tears. During the remainder of their stay, there appearedamong the natives an evident degree of sorrow that they were so soon toleave them, which they showed by a more than usual degree of kindnessand attention. The above-mentioned excellent chief, with his wife,brothers, and sister, requested permission to remain on board for thenight previous to the sailing of the _Bounty_. The ship was crowded thewhole day with the natives, and she was loaded with presents ofcocoa-nuts, plantains, bread-fruits, hogs, and goats. Contrary to whathad been the usual practice, there was this evening no dancing or mirthon the beach, such as they had long been accustomed to, but all wassilent.At sunset, the boat returned from landing Tinah and his wife, and theship made sail, bidding farewell to Otaheite, where, Bligh observes,'for twenty-three weeks we had been treated with the utmost affectionand regard, and which seemed to increase in proportion to our stay. Thatwe were not insensible to their kindness, the events which followed morethan sufficiently prove; for to the friendly and endearing behaviour ofthese people, may be ascribed the motives for that event which effectedthe ruin of an expedition, that there was every reason to hope wouldhave been completed in the most fortunate manner.'The morning after their departure, they got sight of Huaheine; and adouble canoe soon coming alongside, containing ten natives, among themwas a young man who recollected Captain Bligh, and called him by name;having known him when here in the year 1780, with Captain Cook in the_Resolution_. Several other canoes arrived with hogs, yams, and otherprovisions, which they purchased. This person confirmed, the accountthat had already been received of Omai, and said that, of all theanimals which had been left with Omai, the mare only remained alive;that the seeds and plants had been all destroyed, except one tree: butof what kind that was, he could not satisfactorily explain. A few daysafter sailing from this island, the weather became squally, and a thickbody of black clouds collected in the east. A water-spout was in a shorttime seen at no great distance from the ship, which appeared to greatadvantage from the darkness of the clouds behind it. The upper part isdescribed as being about two feet in diameter; and the lower about eightinches. It advanced rapidly towards the ship, when it was deemedexpedient to alter the course, and to take in all the sails, except theforesail; soon after which it passed within ten yards of the stern,making a rustling noise, but without their feeling the least effect fromits being so near. The rate at which it travelled was judged to be aboutten miles per hour, going towards the west, in the direction of thewind; and in a quarter of an hour after passing the ship, it dispersed.As they passed several low islands, the natives of one of them came outin their canoes, and it was observed that they all spoke the language ofOtaheite. Presents of iron, beads, and a looking-glass were given tothem; but it was observed that the chief, on leaving the ship, tookpossession of everything that had been distributed. One of them showedsome signs of dissatisfaction; but after a little altercation theyjoined noses and were reconciled.The _Bounty_ anchored at Anamooka on the 23rd April; and an old lameman, named Tepa, whom Bligh had known here in 1777, and immediatelyrecollected, came on board along with others from different islands inthe vicinity. This man having formerly been accustomed to the Englishmanner of speaking their language, the Commander found he could conversewith him tolerably well. He told him that the cattle which had been leftat Tongataboo had all bred, and that the old ones were yet living. Beingdesirous of seeing the ship, he and his companions were taken below, andthe bread-fruit and other plants were shown to them, on seeing whichthey were greatly surprised.'I landed,' says Bligh, 'in order to procure some bread-fruit plants tosupply the place of one that was dead, and two or three others that werea little sickly. I walked to the west part of the bay, where some plantsand seeds had been sown by Captain Cook; and had the satisfaction tosee, in a plantation close by, about twenty fine pineapple plants, butno fruit, this not being the proper season. They told me that they hadeaten many of them, that they were very fine and large, and that atTongataboo there were great numbers.'Numerous were the marks of mourning with which these people disfigurethemselves, such as bloody temples, their heads deprived of most of thehair, and, which was worse, almost all of them with the loss of some oftheir fingers. Several fine boys, not above six years of age, had lostboth their little fingers; and some of the men had parted with themiddle finger of the right hand.A brisk trade soon began to be carried on for yams; some plantains andbread-fruit were likewise brought on board, but no hogs. Some of thesailing canoes, which arrived in the course of the day, were largeenough to contain not less than ninety passengers. From these theofficers and crew purchased hogs, dogs, fowls, and shaddocks; yams, veryfine and large; one of them actually weighed above forty-five pounds.The crowd of natives had become so great the next day, Sunday 26th, thatit became impossible to do anything. The watering party were thereforeordered to go on board, and it was determined to sail; the ship wasaccordingly unmoored and got under weigh. A grapnel, however, had beenstolen, and Bligh informed the chiefs that were still on board, thatunless it was returned, they must remain in the ship, at which they weresurprised and not a little alarmed. 'I detained them,' he says, 'tillsunset, when their uneasiness and impatience increased to such adegree, that they began to beat themselves about the face and eyes, andsome of them cried bitterly. As this distress was more than the grapnelwas worth, I could not think of detaining them longer, and called theircanoes alongside. I told them they were at liberty to go, and made eachof them a present of a hatchet, a saw, with some knives, gimlets, andnails. This unexpected present, and the sudden change in theirsituation, affected them not less with joy than they had before beenwith apprehension. They were unbounded in their acknowledgements; and Ihave little doubt but that we parted better friends than if the affairhad never happened.'From this island the ship stood to the northward all night, with lightwinds; and on the next day, the 27th, at noon, they were between theislands Tofoa and Kotoo.'Thus far,' says Bligh, 'the voyage had advanced in a course ofuninterrupted prosperity, and had been attended with many circumstancesequally pleasing and satisfactory. A very different scene was now to beexperienced. A conspiracy had been formed, which was to render all ourpast labour productive only of extreme misery and distress. The meanshad been concerted and prepared with so much secrecy and circumspection,that no one circumstance appeared to occasion the smallest suspicion ofthe impending calamity, the result of an act of piracy the mostconsummate and atrocious that was probably ever committed.'How far Bligh was justified in ascribing the calamity to a conspiracywill be seen hereafter. The following chapter will detail the facts ofthe mutinous proceedings as stated by the Lieutenant, in his own words.CHAPTER IIITHE MUTINY     That,--Captain Bligh,--that is the thing;--I am in hell!--I am     in hell!--FLETCHER CHRISTIAN.     --Horror and doubt distract     His troubled thoughts, and from the bottom stir     The hell within him; for within him hell     He brings, and round about him, nor from hell     One step no more than from himself can fly     By change of place; now conscience wakes despair     That slumber'd, wakes the bitter memory     Of what he was, what is, and what must be     Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.'In the morning of the 28th April, the north-westernmost of the FriendlyIslands, called Tofoa, bearing north-east, I was steering to thewestward with a ship in most perfect order, all my plants in a mostflourishing condition, all my men and officers in good health, and inshort, everything to flatter and insure my most sanguine expectations.On leaving the deck I gave directions for the course to be steeredduring the night. The master had the first watch; the gunner, the middlewatch; and Mr. Christian, the morning watch. This was the turn of dutyfor the night.'Just before sun-rising on Tuesday the 28th, while I was yet asleep,Mr. Christian, officer of the watch, Charles Churchill, ship's corporal,John Mills, gunner's mate, and Thomas Burkitt, seaman, came into mycabin, and seizing me, tied my hands with a cord behind my back,threatening me with instant death if I spoke or made the least noise. Icalled, however, as loud as I could in hopes of assistance; but they hadalready secured the officers who were not of their party, by placingsentinels at their doors. There were three men at my cabin door, besidesthe four within; Christian had only a cutlass in his hand, the othershad muskets and bayonets. I was hauled out of bed, and forced on deck inmy shirt, suffering great pain from the tightness with which they hadtied my hands[4] [behind my back, held by Fletcher Christian, andCharles Churchill, with a bayonet at my breast, and two men, AlexanderSmith and Thomas Burkitt behind me, with loaded muskets cocked andbayonets fixed]. I demanded the reason of such violence, but received noother answer than abuse, for not holding my tongue. The master, thegunner, Mr. Elphinstone, the master's mate, and Nelson, were keptconfined below; and the fore-hatchway was guarded by sentinels. Theboatswain and carpenter, and also Mr. Samuel the clerk, were allowed tocome upon deck, where they saw me standing abaft the mizen-mast, with myhands tied behind my back, under a guard, with Christian at their head.The boatswain was ordered to hoist the launch out, with a threat, if hedid not do it instantly, to take care of himself.'When the boat was out, Mr. Hayward and Mr. Hallet, two of themidshipmen, and Mr. Samuel, were ordered into it. I demanded what theirintention Was in giving this order, and endeavoured to persuade thepeople near me not to persist in such acts of violence; but it was to noeffect--"Hold your tongue, Sir, or you are dead this instant," wasconstantly repeated to me.'The master by this time had sent to request that he might come on deck,which was permitted; but he was soon ordered back again to his cabin.'[When I exerted myself in speaking loud, to try if I could rally anywith a sense of duty in them, I was saluted with--"d--n his eyes,the----, blow his brains out"; while Christian was threatening me withinstant death, if I did not hold my tongue.]'I continued my endeavours to turn the tide of affairs, when Christianchanged the cutlass which he had in his hand for a bayonet that wasbrought to him, and holding me with a strong grip by the cord that tiedmy hands, he threatened, with many oaths, to kill me immediately, if Iwould not be quiet; the villains round me had their pieces cocked andbayonets fixed. Particular persons were called on to go into the boatand were hurried over the side; whence I concluded that with thesepeople I was to be set adrift. I therefore made another effort to bringabout a change, but with no other effect than to be threatened withhaving my brains blown out.The boatswain and seamen who were to go in the boat, were allowed tocollect twine, canvas, lines, sails, cordage, an eight-and-twenty galloncask of water; and Mr. Samuel got one hundred and fifty pounds of bread,with a small quantity of rum and wine, also a quadrant and compass; buthe was forbidden, on pain of death, to touch either map, ephemeris, bookof astronomical observations, sextant, timekeeper, or any of my surveysor drawings.'The mutineers having forced those of the seamen whom they meant to getrid of into the boat, Christian directed a dram to be served to each ofhis own crew. I then unhappily saw that nothing could be done to effectthe recovery of the ship: there was no one to assist me, and everyendeavour on my part was answered with threats of death.'The officers were next called upon deck, and forced over the side intothe boat, while I was kept apart from every one, abaft the mizen-mast;Christian, armed with a bayonet, holding me by the bandage that securedmy hands. The guard round me had their pieces cocked, but on my daringthe ungrateful wretches to fire, they uncocked them.'Isaac Martin, one of the guard over me, I saw had an inclination toassist me, and as he fed me with shaddock (my lips being quite parched)we explained our wishes to each other by our looks; but this beingobserved, Martin was removed from me. He then attempted to leave theship, for which purpose he got into the boat; but with many threats theyobliged him to return.'The armourer, Joseph Coleman, and two of the carpenters, M'Intosh andNorman, were also kept, contrary to their inclination; and they beggedof me, after I was astern in the boat, to remember that they declaredthey had no hand in the transaction. Michael Byrne, I am told, likewisewanted to leave the ship.'It is of no moment for me to recount my endeavours to bring back theoffenders to a sense of their duty; all I could do was by speaking tothem in general; but it was to no purpose, for I was kept securelybound, and no one except the guard suffered to come near me.'To Mr. Samuel (clerk) I am indebted for securing my journals andcommission, with some material ship papers. Without these I had nothingto certify what I had done, and my honour and character might have beensuspected, without my possessing a proper document to have defendedthem. All this he did with great resolution, though guarded and strictlywatched. He attempted to save the timekeeper, and a box with my surveys,drawings, and remarks, for fifteen years past, which were numerous; whenhe was hurried away with "D--n your eyes, you are well off to get whatyou have."It appeared to me that Christian was some time in doubt whether heshould keep the carpenter, or his mates; at length he determined on thelatter, and the carpenter was ordered into the boat. He was permitted,but not without some opposition, to take his tool-chest.'Much altercation took place among the mutinous crew during the wholebusiness: some swore "I'll be d---- d if he does not find his way home,if he gets anything with him"; and when the carpenter's chest wascarrying away, "D---- n my eyes, he will have a vessel built in amonth"; while others laughed at the helpless situation of the boat,being very deep, and so little room for those who were in her. As forChristian, he seemed as if meditating destruction on himself and everyone else.'I asked for arms, but they laughed at me, and said I was wellacquainted with the people among whom I was going, and therefore did notwant them; four cutlasses, however, were thrown into the boat, after wewere veered astern.'The officers and men being in the boat, they only waited for me, ofwhich the master-at-arms informed Christian; who then said--"Come,Captain Bligh, your officers and men are now in the boat, and you mustgo with them; if you attempt to make the least resistance, you willinstantly be put to death"; and without further ceremony, with a tribeof armed ruffians about me, I was forced over the side, when they untiedmy hands. Being in the boat, we were veered astern by a rope, a fewpieces of pork were thrown to us, and some clothes, also the cutlasses Ihave already mentioned; and it was then that the armourer and carpenterscalled out to me to remember that they had no hand in the transaction.After having undergone a great deal of ridicule, and been kept for sometime to make sport for these unfeeling wretches, we were at length castadrift in the open ocean.'I had with me in the boat the following persons:     Names.

In all twenty-five--and the most able of the ship's company.'Christian, the chief of the mutineers, is of a respectable family inthe North of England. This was the third voyage he had made with me; andas I found it necessary to keep my ship's company at three watches, Ihad given him an order to take charge of the third, his abilities beingthoroughly equal to the task; and by this means the master and gunnerwere not at watch and watch.'Heywood is also of a respectable family in the North of England,[5] anda young man of abilities as well as Christian. These two had beenobjects of my particular regard and attention, and I had taken greatpains to instruct them, having entertained hopes that, as professionalmen, they would have become a credit to their country.'Young was well recommended, and had the look of an able, stout seaman;he, however, fell short of what his appearance promised. [In the accountsent home he is thus described: Edward Young, midshipman, agedtwenty-two years. Dark complexion and rather a bad look--strongmade--has lost several of his fore teeth, and those that remain are allrotten.]'Stewart was a young man of creditable parents in the Orkneys; at whichplace, on the return of the _Resolution_ from the South Seas, in 1780,we received so many civilities that, on that account only, I shouldgladly have taken him with me: but, independent of this recommendation,he was a seaman, and had always borne a good character.'Notwithstanding the roughness with which I was treated, the remembranceof past kindnesses produced some signs of remorse in Christian. Whenthey were forcing me out of the ship, I asked him if this treatment wasa proper return for the many instances he had received of my friendship?he appeared disturbed at my question, and answered with much emotion,"That,--Captain Bligh,--that is the thing;--I am in hell,--I am inhell!"'As soon as I had time to reflect, I felt an inward satisfaction, whichprevented any depression of my spirits: conscious of my integrity, andanxious solicitude for the good of the service in which I had beenengaged, I found my mind wonderfully supported, and I began to conceivehopes, notwithstanding so heavy a calamity, that I should one day beable to account to my king and country for the misfortune. A few hoursbefore my situation had been peculiarly flattering. I had a ship in themost perfect order, and well stored with every necessary both forservice and health; by early attention to those particulars I had, asmuch as lay in my power, provided against any accident in case I couldnot get through Endeavour Straits, as well as against what might befallme in them; add to this, the plants had been successfully preserved inthe most flourishing state: so that, upon the whole, the voyage wastwo-thirds completed, and the remaining part, to all appearance, in avery promising way; every person on board being in perfect health, toestablish which was ever amongst the principal objects of my attention.'It will very naturally be asked, what could be the reason for such arevolt? In answer to which I can only conjecture that the mutineers hadflattered themselves with the hopes of a more happy life among theOtaheitans than they could possibly enjoy in England; and this, joinedto some female connexions, most probably occasioned the wholetransaction. The ship, indeed, while within our sight, steered to theW.N.W., but I considered this only as a feint; for when we were sentaway,--"Huzza for Otaheite!"--was frequently heard among the mutineers.'The women of Otaheite are handsome, mild, and cheerful in their mannersand conversation, possessed of great sensibility, and have sufficientdelicacy to make them admired and beloved. The chiefs were so muchattached to our people, that they rather encouraged their stay amongthem than otherwise, and even made them promises of large possessions.Under these and many other attendant circumstances, equally desirable,it is now perhaps not so much to be wondered at, though scarcelypossible to have been foreseen, that a set of sailors, most of them voidof connexions, should be led away; especially when, in addition to suchpowerful inducements, they imagined it in their power to fix themselvesin the midst of plenty, on one of the finest islands in the world, wherethey need hot labour, and where the allurements of dissipation arebeyond anything that can be conceived. The utmost, however, that anycommander could have supposed to have happened is, that some of thepeople would have been tempted to desert. But if it should be assertedthat a commander is to guard against an act of mutiny and piracy in hisown ship, more than by the common rules of service, it is as much as tosay that he must sleep locked up, and when awake, be girded withpistols.'Desertions have happened, more or less, from most of the ships thathave been at the Society Islands; but it has always been in thecommander's power to make the chiefs return their people; theknowledge, therefore, that it was unsafe to desert, perhaps first ledmine to consider with what ease so small a ship might be surprised, andthat so favourable an opportunity would never offer to them again.'The secrecy of this mutiny is beyond all conception. Thirteen of theparty, who were with me, had always lived forward among the seamen; yetneither they, nor the messmates of Christian, Stewart, Heywood, andYoung, had ever observed any circumstance that made them in the leastsuspect what was going on. To such a close-planned act of villainy, mymind being entirely free from any suspicion, it is not wonderful that Ifell a sacrifice. Perhaps, if there had been marines on board, asentinel at my cabin-door might have prevented it; for I slept with thedoor always open, that the officer of the watch might have access to meon all occasions, the possibility of such a conspiracy being ever thefarthest from my thoughts. Had their mutiny been occasioned by anygrievances, either real or imaginary, I must have discovered symptoms oftheir discontent, which would have put me on my guard; but the ease wasfar otherwise. Christian, in particular, I was on the most friendlyterms with: that very day he was engaged to have dined with me; and thepreceding night he excused himself from supping with me, on pretence ofbeing unwell; for which I felt concerned, having no suspicions of hisintegrity and honour.'Such is the story published by Lieutenant Bligh immediately on hisreturn to England, after one of the most distressing and perilouspassages over nearly four thousand miles of the wide ocean, witheighteen persons, in an open boat. The story obtained implicit credit;and though Lieutenant Bligh's character never stood high in the navy forsuavity of manners or mildness of temper, he was always considered as anexcellent seaman, and his veracity stood unimpeached. But in this age ofrefined liberality, when the most atrocious criminals find theirapologists, it is not surprising it should now be discovered, when allare dead that could either prove or disprove it, that it was the tyrannyof the commander alone, and not the wickedness of the ringleader of themutineers of the _Bounty_, that caused that event. 'We all know,' it issaid, 'that mutiny can arise but from one of these two sources,excessive folly or excessive tyranny; therefore'--the logic isadmirable--'as it is admitted that Bligh was no idiot, the inference isobvious.'[6] If this be so, it may be asked to which of the two causesmust be ascribed the mutiny at the Nore, etc.? The true answer will be,to neither. 'Not only,' continues the writer, 'was the _narrative_ whichhe published proved to be false in many material bearings, by evidencebefore a court-martial, but every act of his public life after thisevent, from his successive command of the _Director_, the _Glatton_, andthe _Warrior_, to his disgraceful expulsion from New South Wales,--wasstamped with an insolence, an inhumanity, and coarseness, which fullydeveloped his character.'There is no intention, in narrating this eventful history, to accuse ordefend either the character or the conduct of the late Admiral Bligh; itis well known his temper was irritable in the extreme; but thecircumstance of his having been the friend of Captain Cook, with whom hesailed as his master,--of his ever afterwards being patronized by SirJoseph Banks,--of the Admiralty promoting him to the rank of commander,appointing him immediately to the _Providence_, to proceed on the sameexpedition to Otaheite,--and of his returning in a very short time toEngland with complete success, and recommending all his officers forpromotion on account of their exemplary conduct;--of his holding severalsubsequent employments in the service,--of his having commanded ships ofthe line in the battles of Copenhagen and Camperdown,--and risen to therank of a flag-officer,--these may perhaps be considered to speaksomething in his favour, and be allowed to stand as some proof that,with all his failings, he had his merits. That he was a man of coarsehabits, and entertained very mistaken notions with regard to discipline,is quite true: yet he had many redeeming qualities. The accusation, bythe writer in question, of Bligh having falsified his 'narrative,' is avery heavy charge, and, it is to be feared, is not wholly withoutfoundation; though it would perhaps be more correct to say, that in theprinted narrative of his voyage, and the narrative on which themutineers were tried, there are many important omissions from hisoriginal manuscript journal, some of which it will be necessary tonotice presently.The same writer further says, 'We know that the officers fared in everyway worse than the men, and that even young Heywood was kept at the masthead no less than eight hours at one spell, in the worst weather whichthey encountered off Cape Horn.'Perhaps Heywood may himself be brought forward as authority, if not todisprove, at least to render highly improbable, his experiencing anysuch treatment on the part of his captain. This young officer, in hisdefence, says, 'Captain Bligh, in his narrative, acknowledges that hehad left some friends on board the _Bounty_, and no part of my conductcould have induced him to believe that I ought not to be reckoned of thenumber. Indeed, from his attention to, _and very kind treatment of mepersonally_, I should have been a monster of depravity to have betrayedhim. The idea alone is sufficient to disturb a mind, where humanity andgratitude have, I hope, ever been noticed as its characteristicfeatures.' Bligh, too, has declared in a letter to Heywood's uncle,Holwell, after accusing him of ingratitude, that 'he never once had anangry word from me during the whole course of the voyage, as his conductalways gave me much pleasure and satisfaction.'In looking over a manuscript journal, kept by Morrison, the boatswain'smate, who was tried and convicted as one of the mutineers, but receivedthe king's pardon, the conduct of Bligh appears in a very unfavourablepoint of view. This Morrison was a person, from talent and education,far above the situation he held in the _Bounty_; he had previouslyserved in the navy as midshipman, and, after his pardon, was appointedgunner of the _Blenheim_, in which he perished with Sir ThomasTroubridge. In comparing this journal with other documents, the datesand transactions appear to be correctly stated, though the latter mayoccasionally be somewhat too highly coloured. How he contrived topreserve this journal, in the wreck of the _Pandora_, does not appear;but there can be no doubt of its authenticity, having been kept amongthe late Captain Heywood's papers; various passages in it have beencorrected either by this officer or some other person, but withoutaltering their sense.It would appear from this important document that the seeds of discord,in the unfortunate ship _Bounty_, were sown at a very early period ofthe voyage. It happened, as was the case in all small vessels, that theduties of commander and purser were united in the person of LieutenantBligh; and it would seem that this proved the cause of very seriousdiscontent among the officers and crew; of the mischief arising out ofthis union, the following statement of Mr. Morrison may serve as aspecimen. At Teneriffe, Lieutenant Bligh ordered the cheese to behoisted up and exposed to the air; which was no sooner done, than hepretended to miss a certain quantity, and declared that it had beenstolen. The cooper, Henry Hillbrant, informed him that the cask inquestion had been opened by the orders of Mr. Samuel, his clerk, whoacted also as steward, and the cheese sent on shore to his own house,previous to the _Bounty_ leaving the river on her way to Portsmouth.Lieutenant Bligh, without making any further inquiry, immediatelyordered the allowance of that article to be stopped, both from_officers_ and _men_, until the deficiency should be made good, and toldthe cooper he would give him a d--d good flogging if he said anotherword on the subject. It can hardly be supposed that a man of Bligh'sshrewdness, if disposed to play the rogue, would have placed himself socompletely in the hands of the cooper, in a transaction which, ifrevealed, must have cost him his commission.Again, on approaching the equator, some decayed pumpkins, purchased atTeneriffe, were ordered to be issued to the crew, at the rate of _one_pound of pumpkin for _two_ pounds of biscuit. The reluctance of the mento accept this proposed substitute, _on such terms_, being reported toLieutenant Bligh, he flew upon deck in a violent rage, turned the handsup, and ordered the first man on the list of each mess to be called byname; at the same time saying, 'I'll see who will dare to refuse thepumpkin, or any thing else I may order to be served out;' to which headded, 'You d--d infernal scoundrels, I'll make you eat grass, or anything you can catch, before I have done with you.' This speech had thedesired effect, every one receiving the pumpkins, even the _officers_.Next comes a complaint respecting the mode of issuing beef and pork: butwhen a representation was made to Lieutenant Bligh in the quiet andorderly manner prescribed by the twenty-first article of war, he calledthe crew aft, told them that every thing relative to the provisions wastransacted by his orders; that it was therefore needless for them tocomplain, as they would get no redress, he being the fittest judge ofwhat was right or wrong, and that he would flog the first man who shoulddare attempt to make any complaint in future. To this imperious menacethey bowed in silence, and not another murmur was heard from them duringthe remainder of the voyage to Otaheite, it being their determination toseek legal redress on the _Bounty's_ return to England. Happy would ithave been had they kept their resolution. By so doing, if the story betrue, they would amply have been avenged, a vast number of human livesspared, and a world of misery avoided.According to this Journalist, 'the seeds of eternal discord were sownbetween Lieutenant Bligh and some of his officers,' while in AdventureBay, Van Diemen's Land; and on arriving at Matavai Bay, in Otaheite, heis accused of taking the officers' hogs and bread-fruit, and servingthem to the ship's company; and when the master remonstrated with him onthe subject, he replied that 'he would convince him that every thingbecame _his_ as soon as it was brought on board; that he would takenine-tenths of every man's property, and let him see who dared to sayanything to the contrary.' The sailors' pigs were seized withoutceremony, and it became a favour for a man to obtain an extra pound ofhis own meat.The writer then says, 'the object of our visit to the Society Islandsbeing at length accomplished, we weighed on the 4th April, 1789. Everyone seemed in high spirits, and began to talk of home, as though theyhad just left Jamaica instead of Otaheite, so far onward did theirflattering fancies waft them. On the 23rd, we anchored off Anamooka, theinhabitants of which island were very rude, and attempted to take thecasks and axes from the parties sent to fill water and cut wood. Amusket pointed at them produced no other effect than a return of thecompliment, by poising their clubs or spears with menacing looks; and,as it was Lieutenant Bligh's orders, that no person should affront themon any occasion, they were emboldened by meeting with no check to theirinsolence. They at length became so troublesome, that Mr. Christian, whocommanded the watering party, found it difficult to carry on his duty;but on acquainting Lieutenant Bligh with their behaviour, he received avolley of abuse, was d--d as a cowardly rascal, and asked if he wereafraid of naked savages whilst he had weapons in his hand? To this hereplied in a respectful manner, "The arms are of no effect, Sir, whileyour orders prohibit their use."'This happened but three days before the mutiny, and the samecircumstance is noticed, but somewhat differently, in Bligh's MS.Journal, where he says, 'the men cleared themselves, and they thereforemerit no punishment. As to the officers I have no resource, nor do Iever feel myself safe in the few instances I trust to them.' A perusalof all the documents certainly leads to the conclusion that all hisofficers were of a very inferior description; they had no proper feelingof their own situation; and this, together with the contempt in whichthey were held by Bligh, and which he could not disguise, may accountfor that perfect indifference, with regard both to the captain and theship, which was manifested on the day of the mutiny.That sad catastrophe, if the writer of the Journal be correct, washastened, if not brought about by, the following circumstance, of whichBligh takes no notice.'In the afternoon of the 27th, Lieutenant Bligh came upon deck, andmissing some of the cocoa-nuts, which had been piled up between theguns, said they had been stolen, and could not have been taken awaywithout the knowledge of the officers, all of whom were sent for andquestioned on the subject. On their declaring that they had not seen anyof the people touch them, he exclaimed, "Then you must have taken themyourselves"; and proceeded to inquire of them separately, how many theyhad purchased. On coming to Mr. Christian, that gentleman answered, "Ido not know, Sir, but I hope you do not think me so mean as to beguilty of stealing yours." Mr. Bligh replied, "Yes, you d---- d hound, Ido--you must have stolen them from me, or you would be able to give abetter account of them;" then turning to the other officers, he said,"God d---- n you, you scoundrels, you are all thieves alike, and combinewith the men to rob me: I suppose you will steal my yams next; but I'llsweat you for it, you rascals--I'll make half of you jump overboard,before you get through Endeavour Straits." This threat was followed byan order to the clerk "to stop the villains' grog, and give them buthalf a pound of yams to-morrow; if they steal them, I'll reduce them toa quarter."'It is difficult to believe that an officer in his Majesty's servicecould condescend to make use of such language to the meanest of thecrew, much less to gentlemen: it is to be feared, however, that there issufficient ground for the truth of these statements: with regard to thelast, it is borne out by the evidence of Mr. Fryer, the master, on thecourt-martial. This officer, being asked, 'what did you suppose to beMr. Christian's meaning, when he said he had been in hell for afortnight?' answered, 'From the frequent quarrels they had had, and theabuse which he had received from Mr. Bligh.'--'Had there been any veryrecent quarrel?'--'The day before Mr. Bligh challenged all the younggentlemen and people with stealing his cocoa-nuts.' It was on theevening of this day that Lieutenant Bligh, according to his printednarrative, says Christian was to have supped with him; but excusedhimself on account of being unwell; and that he was invited to dine withhim on the day of the mutiny.Every one of these circumstances, and many others, which might be statedfrom Mr. Morrison's Journal, are omitted in Bligh's published narrative;but many of them are alluded to in his original Journal, and others thatprove distinctly the constant reproofs to which his officers weresubject, and the bad terms on which they stood with their commander. Afew extracts from this Journal will sufficiently establish this point.In so early a part of the voyage as their arrival in Adventure Bay, hefound fault with his officers, and put the carpenter into confinement.Again, at Matavai Bay, on the 5th December, Bligh says, 'I ordered thecarpenter to cut a large stone that was brought off by one of thenatives, requesting me to get it made fit for them to grind theirhatchets on, but to my astonishment he refused, in direct terms, tocomply, saying, "I will not cut the stone, for it will spoil my chisel;and though there may be law to take away my clothes, there is none totake away my tools." This man having before shown his mutinous andinsolent behaviour, I was under the necessity of confining him to hiscabin.'On the 5th January three men deserted in the cutter, on which occasionBligh says, 'Had the mate of the watch been awake, no trouble of thiskind would have happened. I have therefore disrated and turned himbefore the mast; such neglectful and worthless petty officers, Ibelieve, never were in a ship as are in this. No orders for a few hourstogether are obeyed by them, and their conduct in general is so bad,that no confidence or trust can be reposed in them; in short, they havedriven me to every thing but corporal punishment, and that must followif they do not improve.'By Morrison's Journal it would appear that 'corporal punishment' was notlong delayed; for, on the very day, he says, the midshipman was put inirons, and confined from the 5th January to the 23rd March--elevenweeks!On the 17th January, orders being given to clear out the sail-room andto air the sails, many of them were found very much mildewed and rottenin many places, on which he observes, 'If I had any officers tosupersede the master and boatswain, or was capable of doing withoutthem, considering them as common seamen, they should no longer occupytheir respective stations; scarcely any neglect of duty can equal thecriminality of this.'On the 24th January, the three deserters were brought back and flogged,then put in irons for further punishment. 'As this affair,' he says,'was solely caused by the neglect of the officers who had the watch, Iwas induced to give them all a lecture on this occasion, and endeavourto show them that, however exempt they were at present from the likepunishment, yet they were equally subject, by the articles of war, to acondign one.' He then tells them, that it is only necessity that makeshim have recourse to reprimand, because there are no means of tryingthem by court-martial; and adds a remark, not very intelligible, butwhat he calls an unpleasant one, about _such_ offenders having nofeelings of honour or sense of shame.On the 7th March, a native Otaheitan, whom Bligh had confined in irons,contrived to break the lock of the bilboa-bolt and make his escape. 'Ihad given,' says Bligh, 'a written order that the mate of the watch wasto be answerable for the prisoners, and to visit and see that they weresafe in his watch, but I have such a neglectful set about me, that Ibelieve nothing but condign punishment can alter their conduct. Verbalorders, in the course of a month, were so forgotten, that they wouldimpudently assert no such thing or directions were given, and I havebeen at last under the necessity to trouble myself with writing, what,by decent young officers, would be complied with as the common rules ofthe service. Sir. Stewart was the mate of the watch.'These extracts show the terms on which Bligh was with his officers; andthese few instances, with others from Morrison's Journal, make it prettyclear, that though Christian, as fiery and passionate a youth as hiscommander could well be, and with feelings too acute to bear the fouland opprobious language constantly addressed to him, was the soleinstigator of the mutiny;--the captain had no support to expect, andcertainly received none, from the rest of his officers. That Christianwas the sole author appears still more strongly from the followingpassage in Morrison's Journal. 'When Mr. Bligh found he must go into theboat, he begged of Mr. Christian to desist, saying "I'll pawn my honour,I'll give my bond, Mr. Christian, never to think of this, if you'lldesist," and urged his wife and family; to which Mr. Christian replied,"No, Captain Bligh, if you had any honour, things had not come to this;and if you had any regard for your wife and family, you should havethought on them before, and not behaved so much like a villain."Lieutenant Bligh again attempted to speak, but was ordered to be silent.The boatswain also tried to pacify Mr. Christian, to whom he replied,"It is too late, I have been in hell for this fortnight past, and amdetermined to bear it no longer; and you know, Mr. Cole, that I havebeen used like a dog all the voyage."'It is pretty evident, therefore, that the mutiny was not, as Bligh inhis narrative states it to have been, the result of a conspiracy. Itwill be seen by the minutes of the court-martial, that the whole affairwas planned and executed between the hours of four and eight o'clock, onthe morning of the 28th April, when Christian had the watch upon deck;that Christian, unable longer to bear the abusive and insultinglanguage, had meditated his own escape from the ship the day before,choosing to trust himself to fate, rather than submit to the constantupbraiding to which he had been subject; but the unfortunate businessof the cocoa-nuts drove him to the commission of the rash and feloniousact, which ended, as such criminal acts usually do, in his owndestruction, and that of a great number of others, many of whom werewholly innocent.Lieutenant Bligh, like most passionate men, whose unruly tempers get thebetter of their reason, having vented his rage about the cocoa-nuts,became immediately calm, and by inviting Christian to sup with him thesame evening, evidently wished to renew their friendly intercourse; andhappy would it have been for all parties had he accepted the invitation.On the same night, towards ten o'clock, when the master had the watch,Bligh came on deck, as was his custom, before retiring to sleep. It wasone of those calm and beautiful nights, so frequent in tropical regions,whose soothing influence can be appreciated only by those who have feltit, when, after a scorching day, the air breathes a most refreshingcoolness,--it was an evening of this sort, when Bligh for the last timecame upon deck, in the capacity of commander; a gentle breeze scarcelyrippled the water, and the moon, then in its first quarter, shed itssoft light along the surface of the sea. The short and quietconversation that took place between Bligh and the master on thisevening, after the irritation of the morning had subsided, only to burstforth again in all the horrors of mutiny and piracy, recalls to one'srecollection that beautiful passage of Shakespeare, where, on theevening of the murder, Duncan, on approaching the castle of Macbeth,observes to Banquo--     --'The air     Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself     Unto our gentle senses,' etc.--a passage which Sir Joshua Reynolds considers as a striking instance ofwhat in painting is termed _repose_. 'The subject,' he says, 'of thisquiet and easy conversation, gives that repose so necessary to the mind,after the tumultuous bustle of the preceding scenes, and beautifullycontrasts the scene of terror that immediately succeeds.' While, on thislovely night, Bligh and his master were congratulating themselves on thepleasing prospect of fine weather and a full moon, to light them throughEndeavour's dangerous straits, the unhappy and deluded Christian was, inall probability, brooding over his wrongs, and meditating on thecriminal act he was to perpetrate the following morning; for he hashimself stated, that he had just fallen asleep about half after three inthe morning, and was much out of order.The evidence on the court-martial is sufficiently explicit as to themode in which this act of piracy was committed. By the Journal of JamesMorrison, the following is the account of the transaction, as given byChristian himself to the two midshipmen, Heywood and Stewart (both ofwhom had been kept below), the moment they were allowed to come upondeck, after the boat, in which were Bligh and his companions, had beenturned adrift.He said, that, 'finding himself much hurt by the treatment he hadreceived from Lieutenant Bligh, he had determined to quit the ship thepreceding evening, and had informed the boatswain, carpenter, and twomidshipmen (Stewart and Hayward), of his intention to do so; that bythem he was supplied with part of a roasted pig, some nails, beads, andother articles of trade, which he put into a bag that was given him bythe last-named gentleman; that he put this bag into the clue of RobertTinkler's hammock, where it was discovered by that young gentleman whengoing to bed at night, but the business was smothered, and passed offwithout any further notice. He said he had fastened some staves to astout plank, with which he intended to make his escape; but finding hecould not effect it during the first and middle watches, as the ship hadno way through the water, and the people were all moving about, he laiddown to rest about half-past three in the morning; that when Mr. Stewartcalled him to relieve the deck at four o'clock, he had but just fallenasleep, and was much out of order; upon observing which, Mr. Stewartstrenuously advised him to abandon his intention; that as soon as he hadtaken charge of the deck, he saw Mr. Hayward, the mate of his watch, liedown on the arm-chest to take a nap; and finding that Mr. Hallet, theother midshipman, did not make his appearance, he suddenly formed theresolution of seizing the ship. Disclosing his intention to MatthewQuintal and Isaac Martin, both of whom had been flogged by LieutenantBligh, they called up Charles Churchill, who had also tasted the cat,and Matthew Thompson, both of whom readily joined in the plot. ThatAlexander Smith (_alias_ John Adams), John Williams, and William M'Koy,evinced equal willingness, and went with Churchill to the armourer, ofwhom they obtained the keys of the arm-chest, under pretence of wantinga musket to fire at a shark, then alongside; that finding Mr. Halletasleep on an arm-chest in the main-hatchway, they roused and sent him ondeck. Charles Norman, unconscious of their proceedings, had in themeantime awaked Mr. Hayward, and directed his attention to the shark,whose movements he was watching at the moment that Mr. Christian and hisconfederates came up the fore-hatchway, after having placed arms in thehands of several men who were not aware of their design. One man,Matthew Thompson, was left in charge of the chest, and he served outarms to Thomas Burkitt and Robert Lamb. Mr. Christian said he thenproceeded to secure Lieutenant Bligh, the master, gunner, and botanist.''When Mr. Christian,' observes Morrison in his Journal, 'related theabove circumstances, I recollected having seen him fasten some staves toa plank lying on the larboard gangway, as also having heard theboatswain say to the carpenter, "it will not do to-night." I likewiseremembered that; Mr. Christian had visited the fore-cockpit severaltimes that evening, although he had very seldom, if ever, frequentedthe warrant-officers' cabins before.'If this be a correct statement, and the greater part of it is borne outby evidence on the court-martial, it removes every doubt of Christianbeing the sole instigator of the mutiny, and that no conspiracy norpre-concerted measures had any existence, but that it was suddenlyconceived by a hot-headed young man, in a state of great excitement ofmind, amounting to a temporary aberration of intellect, caused by thefrequent abusive and insulting language of his commanding officer.Waking out of a short half hour's disturbed sleep, to take the commandof the deck--finding the two mates of the watch, Hayward and Hallet,asleep (for which they ought to have been dismissed the service insteadof being, as they were, promoted)--the opportunity tempting, and theship completely in his power, with a momentary impulse he darted downthe fore-hatchway, got possession of the keys of the arm-chest, and madethe hazardous experiment of arming such of the men as he thought hecould trust, and effected his purpose.There is a passage in Captain Beechey's account of Pitcairn Island,which, if correct, would cast a stain on the memory of the unfortunateStewart--who, if there was one innocent man in the ship, was that man.Captain Beechey says (speaking of Christian), 'His plan, strange as itmust appear for a young officer to adopt, who was fairly advanced in anhonourable profession, was to set himself adrift upon a raft, and makehis way to the island (Tofoa) then in sight. As quick in the executionas in the design, the raft was soon constructed, various useful articleswere got together, and he was on the point of launching it, when a youngofficer, _who afterwards perished in the Pandora_, to whom Christiancommunicated his intention, recommended him, rather than risk his lifeon so hazardous an expedition, _to endeavour to take possession of theship_, which he thought would not be very difficult, as many of theship's company were not well disposed towards the commander, and wouldall be very glad to return to Otaheite, and reside among their friendsin that island. This daring proposition is even more extraordinary thanthe premeditated scheme of his companion, and, if true, certainlyrelieves Christian from part of the odium which has hitherto attached tohim as the sole instigator of the mutiny.' Relieve him?--not a jot--buton the best authority it may boldly be stated, that it is _not_true--the authority of Stewart's friend and messmate, the late CaptainHeywood.Captain Beechey, desirous of being correct in his statement, veryproperly sent his chapter on Pitcairn's Island for any observationsCaptain Heywood might have to make on what was said therein regardingthe mutiny; observing in his note which accompanied it, that thisaccount, received from Adams, differed materially from a footnote inMarshall's _Naval Biography_; to which Captain Heywood returned thefollowing reply.     '_5th April_, 1830.     'DEAR SIR,--I have perused the account you received from Adams     of the mutiny in the _Bounty_, which does indeed differ very     materially from a footnote in Marshall's _Naval Biography_, by     the editor, to whom I verbally detailed the facts, which are     strictly true.     'That Christian informed the boatswain and the carpenter,     Messrs. Hayward and Stewart, of his determination to leave the     ship upon a raft, on the night preceding the mutiny, is     certain; but that any one of them (Stewart in particular)     should have "recommended, rather than risk his life on so     hazardous an expedition, that he should try the expedient of     taking the ship from the captain, etc.," is entirely at     variance with the whole character and conduct of the latter,     both before and after the mutiny; as well as with the     assurance of Christian himself, the very night he quitted     Taheite, that the idea of attempting to take the ship had     never entered his distracted mind, until the moment he     relieved the deck, and found his mate and midshipman     asleep.[7]     'At that last interview with Christian he also communicated to     me, for the satisfaction of his relations, other circumstances     connected with that unfortunate disaster, which, after their     deaths, may or may not be laid before the public. And although     they can implicate none but himself, either living or dead,     they may extenuate but will contain not a word of his in     defence of the crime he committed against the laws of his     country.--I am, etc.,     'P. HEYWOOD.'Captain Beechey stated only what he had heard from old Adams, who wasnot always correct in the information he gave to the visitors of hisisland; but this part of his statement gave great pain to Heywood, whoadverted to it on his death-bed, wishing, out of regard for Stewart'smemory and his surviving friends, that it should be publiclycontradicted; and with this view the above reply of Captain Heywood ishere inserted.The temptations, therefore, which it was supposed Otaheite held out tothe deluded men of the _Bounty_, had no more share in the transactionthan the supposed conspiracy; it does not appear, indeed, that the cryof 'Huzza for Otaheite!' was ever uttered; if this island had been theobject of either Christian or the crew, they would not have left itthree hundred miles behind them, before they perpetrated the act ofpiracy; but after the deed had been committed, it would be naturalenough that they should turn their minds to the lovely island and itsfascinating inhabitants, which they had but just quitted, and that inthe moment of excitement some of them should have so called out; butBligh is the only person who has said they did so.If, however, the recollection of the 'sunny isle' and its 'smilingwomen' had really tempted the men to mutiny, Bligh would himself not befree from blame, for having allowed them to indulge for six wholemonths among this voluptuous and fascinating people; for though he wasone of the most active and anxious commanders of his time, 'theservice,' as is observed by a naval officer, 'was carried on in thosedays in a very different spirit from that which regulates its movementsnow, otherwise the _Bounty_ would never have passed six whole months atone island "stowing away the fruit," during which time the officers andseamen had free access to the shore. Under similar circumstancesnowadays, if the fruit happened not to be ready, the ship would havebeen off, after ten days' relaxation, to survey other islands, orspeculate on coral reefs, or make astronomical observations; in short,to do something or other to keep the devil out of the heads of thecrew.'[8] Bligh would appear to have been sensible of this on his nextexpedition in the _Providence_, for on that occasion he collected morebread-fruit plants than on the former, and spent only half the time indoing so.Be that as it may, Bligh might naturally enough conclude that the seamenwere casting 'a lingering look behind' towards Otaheite. 'If,' saysForster (who accompanied Cook), 'we fairly consider the differentsituations of a common sailor on board the _Resolution_, and of aTaheitan on his island, we cannot blame the former if he attempt to ridhimself of the numberless discomforts of a voyage round the world, andprefer an easy life, free from cares, in the happiest climate of theworld, to the frequent vicissitudes which are entailed upon themariner. The most favourable prospects of future success in England,which he might form in idea, could never be so flattering to his sensesas the lowly hope of living like the meanest Taheitan. And supposing himto escape the misfortunes incident to seamen, still he must earn hissubsistence in England at the expense of labour, and "in the sweat ofhis brow," when this oldest curse on mankind is scarcely felt atTaheite. Two or three bread-fruit trees, which grow almost without anyculture, and which flourish as long as he himself can expect to live,supply him with abundant food during three-fourths of the year. Thecloth-trees and eddo-roots are cultivated with much less trouble thanour cabbages and kitchen-herbs. The banana, the royal palm, the goldenapple, all thrive with such luxuriance, and require so little trouble,that I may venture to call them spontaneous. Most of their days aretherefore spent in a round of various enjoyments, where Nature haslavished many a pleasing landscape; where the temperature of the air iswarm, but continually refreshed by a wholesome breeze from the sea; andwhere the sky is almost constantly serene. A kind of happy uniformityruns through the whole life of the Taheitans. They rise with the sun,and hasten to rivers and fountains to perform an ablution equallyreviving and cleanly. They pass the morning at work, or walk about tillthe heat of the day increases, when they retreat to their dwellings, orrepose under some tufted tree. There they amuse themselves withsmoothing their hair, and anoint it with fragrant oils; or they blow theflute, and sing to it, or listen to the songs of the birds. At the hourof noon, or a little later, they go to dinner. After their meals theyresume their domestic amusements, during which the flame of mutualaffection spreads in every heart, and unites the rising generation withnew and tender ties. The lively jest, without any ill-nature, theartless tale, the jocund dance and frugal supper, bring on the evening;and another visit to the river concludes the actions of the day. Thuscontented with their simple way of life, and placed in a delightfulcountry, they are free from cares, and happy in their ignorance.'Such is the picture drawn of the happy people of Otaheite by a cold,philosophical, German doctor, and such, with very little change, Blighfound them. As far, however, as the mutiny of his people was concerned,we must wholly discard the idea thrown out by him, that the seductionsof Otaheite had any share in producing it. It could not have escaped aperson of Christian's sagacity, that certain interrogatories wouldunquestionably be put by the natives of Otaheite, on finding the shipreturn so soon without her commander, without the bread-fruit plants,and with only about half her crew; questions he knew to which nosatisfactory answer could be made; and though, at subsequent periods, hetwice visited that island, it was some time afterwards, and not fromchoice but necessity; his object was to find a place of concealment,where he might pass the remainder of his days, unheard of and unknown,and where it is to be hoped he had time for sincere repentance, the onlyatonement he could make for the commission of a crime, which involved somany human beings in misery, and brought others to an untimely end--butof this hereafter.CHAPTER IVTHE OPEN-BOAT NAVIGATION     The boat is lower'd with all the haste of hate,     With its slight plank between thee and thy fate;     Her only cargo such a scant supply     As promises the death their hands deny;     And just enough of water and of bread     To keep, some days, the dying from the dead:     Some cordage, canvas, sails, and lines, and twine.     But treasures all to hermits of the brine,     Were added after, to the earnest prayer     Of those who saw no hope save sea and air;     And last, that trembling vassal of the Pole,     The feeling compass, Navigation's soul.            *       *       *       *       *     The launch is crowded with the faithful few     Who wait their Chief--a melancholy crew:     But some remained reluctant on the deck     Of that proud vessel, now a moral wreck--And     view'd their Captain's fate with piteous eyes;     While others scoff'd his augur'd miseries,     Sneer'd at the prospect of his pigmy sail,     And the slight bark so laden and so frail.Christian had intended to send away his captain and associates in thecutter, and ordered that it should be hoisted out for that purpose,which was done--a small wretched boat, that could hold but eight or tenmen at the most, with a very small additional weight; and, what wasstill worse, she was so worm-eaten and decayed, especially in the bottomplanks, that the probability was, she would have gone down before shehad proceeded a mile from the ship. In this 'rotten carcass of a boat,'not unlike that into which Prospero and his lovely daughter were'hoist,'                                 not rigg'd,     Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats     Instinctively had quit it,did Christian intend to cast adrift his late commander and his eighteeninnocent companions, or as many of them as she would stow, to find, asthey inevitably must have found, a watery grave. But the remonstrancesof the master, boatswain, and carpenter prevailed on him to let thoseunfortunate men have the launch, into which nineteen persons werethrust, whose weight, together with that of the few articles they werepermitted to take, brought down the boat so near to the water, as toendanger her sinking with but a moderate swell of the sea--and to allhuman appearance, in no state to survive the length of voyage they weredestined to perform over the wide ocean, but which they did mostmiraculously survive.The first consideration of Lieutenant Bligh and his eighteen unfortunatecompanions, on being cast adrift in their open boat, was to examine thestate of their resources. The quantity of provisions which they found tohave been thrown into the boat, by some few kind-hearted messmates,amounted to one hundred and fifty pounds of bread, sixteen pieces ofpork, each weighing two pounds, six quarts of rum, six bottles of wine,with twenty-eight gallons of water, and four empty barricoes. Being sonear to the island of Tofoa, it was resolved to seek there a supply ofbread-fruit and water, to preserve if possible the above-mentioned stockentire; but after rowing along the coast, they discovered only somecocoa-nut trees, on the top of high precipices, from which, with muchdanger owing to the surf, and great difficulty in climbing the cliffs,they succeeded in obtaining about twenty nuts. The second day they madeexcursions into the island, but without success. They met however with afew natives, who came down with them to the cove where the boat waslying; and others presently followed. They made inquiries after theship, and Bligh unfortunately advised they should say that the ship hadoverset and sunk, and that they only were saved. The story might beinnocent, but it was certainly indiscreet to put the people inpossession of their defenceless situation; however, they brought insmall quantities of bread-fruit, plantains, and cocoa-nuts, but littleor no water could be procured. These supplies, scanty as they were,served to keep up the spirits of the men; 'They no longer, says Bligh,'regarded me with those anxious looks, which had constantly beendirected towards me, since we lost sight of the ship: every countenanceappeared to have a degree of cheerfulness, and they all seemeddetermined to do their best.'The numbers of the natives having so much increased as to line the wholebeach, they began knocking stones together, which was known to be thepreparatory signal for an attack. With some difficulty on account of thesurf, our seamen succeeded in getting the things that were on shore intothe boat, together with all the men, except John Norton, quarter-master,who was casting off the stern-fast. The natives immediately rushed uponthis poor man, and actually stoned him to death. A volley of stones wasalso discharged at the boat, and every one in it was more or less hurt.This induced the people to push out to sea with all the speed they wereable to give to the launch, but to their surprise and alarm, severalcanoes, filled with stones, followed close after them and renewed theattack; against which, the only return the unfortunate men in the boatcould make, was with the stones of the assailants that lodged in her, aspecies of warfare in which they were very inferior to the Indians. Theonly expedient left was to tempt the enemy to desist from the pursuit,by throwing overboard some clothes, which fortunately induced the canoesto stop and pick them up; and night coming on, they returned to theshore, leaving the party in the boat to reflect on their unhappysituation.The men now intreated their commander to take them towards home; and onbeing told that no hope of relief could be entertained till theyreached Timor, a distance of full twelve hundred leagues, they allreadily agreed to be content with an allowance, which, on calculation oftheir resources, the commander informed them would not exceed one ounceof bread, and a quarter of a pint of water, per day. Recommending them,therefore, in the most solemn manner, not to depart from their promisein this respect, 'we bore away,' says Bligh, 'across a sea where thenavigation is but little known, in a small boat twenty-three feet longfrom stem to stern, deeply laden with eighteen men. I was happy,however, to see that every one seemed better satisfied with oursituation than myself. It was about eight o'clock at night on the 2ndMay, when we bore away under a reefed lug-foresail; and having dividedthe people into watches, and got the boat into a little order, wereturned thanks to God for our miraculous preservation, and, in fullconfidence of His gracious support, I found my mind more at ease than ithad been for some time past.'At day-break on the 3rd, the forlorn and almost hopeless navigators sawwith alarm the sun to rise fiery and red,--a sure indication of a severegale of wind; and accordingly, at eight o'clock it blew a violent storm,and the sea ran so very high, that the sail was becalmed when betweenthe seas, and too much to have set when on the top of the sea; yet it isstated that they could not venture to take it in, as they were in veryimminent danger and distress, the sea curling over the stern of theboat, and obliging them to bale with all their might. 'A situation,'observes the commander, 'more distressing has, perhaps, seldom beenexperienced.'The bread, being in bags, was in the greatest danger of being spoiled bythe wet, the consequence of which, if not prevented, must have beenfatal, as the whole party would inevitably be starved to death, if theyshould fortunately escape the fury of the waves. It was determined,therefore, that all superfluous clothes, with some rope and spare sails,should be thrown overboard, by which the boat was considerablylightened. The carpenter's tool-chest was cleared, and the tools stowedin the bottom of the boat, and the bread secured in the chest. All thepeople being thoroughly wet and cold, a teaspoonful of rum was servedout to each person, with a quarter of a bread-fruit, which is stated tohave been scarcely eatable, for dinner; Bligh having determined topreserve sacredly, and at the peril of his life, the engagement theyentered into, and to make their small stock of provisions last eightweeks, let the dally proportion be ever so small.The sea continuing to run even higher than in the morning, the fatigueof baling became very great; the boat was necessarily kept before thesea. The men were constantly wet, the night very cold, and at daylighttheir limbs were so benumbed, that they could scarcely find the use ofthem. At this time a teaspoonful of rum served out to each person wasfound of great benefit to all. Five small cocoa-nuts were distributedfor dinner, and every one was satisfied; and in the evening, a fewbroken pieces of bread-fruit were served for supper, after which prayerswere performed.On the night of the 4th and morning of the 5th, the gale had abated; thefirst step to be taken was to examine the state of the bread, a greatpart of which was found to be damaged and rotten--but even this wascarefully preserved for use. The boat was now running among someislands, but after their reception at Tofoa, they did not venture toland. On the 6th, they still continued to see islands at a distance; andthis day, for the first time, they hooked a fish, to their great joy;'but,' says the commander, 'we were miserably disappointed by its beinglost in trying to get it into the boat.' In the evening, each person hadan ounce of the damaged bread, and a quarter of a pint of water forsupper.Lieutenant Bligh observes, 'it will readily be supposed our lodgingswere very miserable, and confined for want of room'; but he endeavouredto remedy the latter defect, by putting themselves at watch and watch;so that one half always sat up, while the other lay down on the boat'sbottom, or upon a chest, but with nothing to cover them except theheavens. Their limbs, he says, were dreadfully cramped, for they couldnot stretch them out; and the nights were so cold, and they were soconstantly wet, that, after a few hours' sleep, they were scarcely ableto move. At dawn of day on the 7th, being very wet and cold, he says, 'Iserved a spoonful of rum and a morsel of bread for breakfast.'In the course of this day they passed close to some rocky isles, fromwhich two large sailing-canoes came swiftly after them, but in theafternoon gave over the chase. They were of the same construction asthose of the Friendly Islands, and the land seen for the last two dayswas supposed to be the Fiji Islands. But being constantly wet, Blighsays, 'it is with the utmost difficulty I can open a book to write, andI feel truly sensible I can do no more than point out where these landsare to be found, and give some idea of their extent.' Heavy rain came onin the afternoon, when every person in the boat did his utmost to catchsome water, and thus succeeded in increasing their stock to thirty-fourgallons, besides quenching their thirst for the first time they had beenable to do so since they had been at sea: but it seems an attendantconsequence of the heavy rain caused them to pass the night verymiserably; for being extremely wet, and having no dry things to shift orcover themselves, they experienced cold and shiverings scarcely to beconceived.On the 8th, the allowance issued was an ounce and a half of pork, ateaspoonful of rum, half a pint of cocoa-nut milk, and an ounce ofbread. The rum, though so small in quantity, is stated to have been ofthe greatest service. In the afternoon they were employed in cleaningout the boat, which occupied them until sunset before they got everything dry and in order. 'Hitherto,' Bligh says, 'I had issued theallowance by guess, but I now made a pair of scales with two cocoa-nutshells; and having accidentally some pistol-balls in the boat,twenty-five of which weighed one pound or sixteen ounces, I adopted oneof these balls as the proportion of weight that each person shouldreceive of bread at the times I served it. I also amused all hands withdescribing the situations of New Guinea and New Holland, and gave themevery information in my power, that in case any accident should happento me, those who survived might have some idea of what they were about,and be able to find their way to Timor, which at present they knewnothing of more than the name, and some not even that. At night I serveda quarter of a pint of water and half an ounce of bread for supper.On the morning of the 9th, a quarter of a pint of cocoa-nut milk andsome of the decayed bread were served for breakfast; and for dinner, thekernels of four cocoa-nuts, with the remainder of the rotten bread,which, he says, was eatable only by such distressed people asthemselves. A storm of thunder and lightning gave them about twentygallons of water. 'Being miserably wet and cold, I served to the peoplea teaspoonful of rum each, to enable them to bear with their distressingsituation. The weather continued extremely bad, and the wind increased;we spent a very miserable night, without sleep, except such as could begot in the midst of rain.'The following day, the 10th, brought no relief, except that of itslight. The sea broke over the boat so much, that two men were keptconstantly baling; and it was necessary to keep the boat before thewaves for fear of its filling. The allowance now served regularly toeach person was one twenty-fifth part of a pound of bread and a quarterof a pint of water, at eight in the morning, at noon, and at sunset.To-day was added about half an ounce of pork for dinner, which, thoughany moderate person would have considered only as a mouthful, wasdivided into three or four.The morning of the 11th did not improve. 'At day-break I served to everyperson a teaspoonful of rum, our limbs being so much cramped that wecould scarcely move them. Our situation was now extremely dangerous, thesea frequently running over our stern, which kept us baling with all ourstrength. At noon the sun appeared, which gave us as much pleasure as isfelt when it shows itself on a winter's day in England.'In the evening of the 12th it still rained hard, and we againexperienced a dreadful night. At length the day came, and showed amiserable set of beings, full of wants, without any thing to relievethem. Some complained of great pain in their bowels, and every one ofhaving almost lost the use of his limbs. The little sleep we got was inno way refreshing, as we were constantly covered with the sea and rain.The weather continuing, and no sun affording the least prospect ofgetting our clothes dried, I recommended to every one to strip and wringthem through the sea-water, by which means they received a warmth that,while wet with rain-water, they could not have.' The shipping of seasand constant baling continued; and though the men were shivering withwet and cold, the commander was under the necessity of informing them,that he could no longer afford them the comfort they had derived fromthe teaspoonful of rum.On the 13th and 14th the stormy weather and heavy sea continuedunabated, and on these days they saw distant land, and passed severalislands. The sight of these islands, it may well be supposed, servedonly to increase the misery of their situation. They were as men verylittle better than starving with plenty in their view; yet, to attemptprocuring any relief was considered to be attended with so much danger,that the prolongation of life, even in the midst of misery, was thoughtpreferable, while there remained hopes of being able to surmount theirhardships.The whole day and night of the 15th were still rainy; the latter wasdark, not a star to be seen by which the steerage could be directed, andthe sea was continually breaking over the boat. On the next day, the16th, was issued for dinner an ounce of salt pork, in addition to theirmiserable allowance of one twenty-fifth part of a pound of bread. Thenight was again truly horrible, with storms of thunder, lightning, andrain; not a star visible, so that the steerage was quite uncertain.On the morning of the 17th, at dawn of day, 'I found,' says thecommander, 'every person complaining, and some of them solicited extraallowance, which I positively refused. Our situation was miserable;always wet, and suffering extreme cold in the night, without the leastshelter from the weather. The little rum we had was of the greatestservice: when our nights were particularly distressing, I generallyserved a teaspoonful or two to each person, and it was always joyfultidings when they heard of my intentions. The night was again a dark anddismal one, the sea constantly breaking over us, and nothing but thewind and waves to direct our steerage. It was my intention, if possible,to make the coast of New Holland to the southward of Endeavour Straits,being sensible that it was necessary to preserve such a situation aswould make a southerly wind a fair one; that we might range along thereefs till an opening should be found into smooth water, and we thesooner be able to pick up some refreshments.'On the 18th the rain abated, when, at their commander's recommendation,they all stripped and wrung their clothes through the sea-water, fromwhich, as usual, they derived much warmth and refreshment; but every onecomplained of violent pains in their bones. At night the heavy rainrecommenced, with severe lightning, which obliged them to keep balingwithout intermission. The same weather continued through the 19th and20th; the rain constant--at times a deluge--the men always baling; thecommander, too, found it necessary to issue for dinner only half anounce of pork.At dawn of day, Lieutenant Bligh states, that some of his people seemedhalf dead; that their appearances were horrible; 'and I could look,'says he, 'no way, but I caught the eye of some one in distress. Extremehunger was now too evident, but no one suffered from thirst, nor had wemuch inclination to drink, that desire perhaps being satisfied throughthe skin. The little sleep we got was in the midst of water, and weconstantly awoke with severe cramps and pains in our bones. At noon thesun broke out and revived every one.'During the whole of the afternoon of the 21st we were so covered withrain and salt water, that we could scarcely see. We suffered extremecold, and every one dreaded the approach of night. Sleep, though welonged for it, afforded no comfort; for my own part, I almost livedwithout it. On the 22nd, our situation was extremely calamitous. We wereobliged to take the course of the sea, running right before it, andwatching with the utmost care, as the least error in the helm would in amoment have been our destruction. It continued through the day to blowhard, and the foam of the sea kept running over our stern and quarters.'The misery we suffered this night exceeded the preceding. The sea flewover us with great force, and kept us baling with horror and anxiety. Atdawn of day I found every one in a most distressed condition, and Ibegan to fear that another such night would put an end to the lives ofseveral, who seemed no longer able to support their sufferings. I servedan allowance of _two_ teaspoonfuls of rum; after drinking which, andhaving wrung our clothes and taken our breakfast of bread and water, webecame a little refreshed.On the evening of the 24th, the wind moderated and the weather lookedmuch better, which rejoiced all hands, so that they ate their scantyallowance with more satisfaction than for some time past. The night alsowas fair; but being always wet with the sea, we suffered much from thecold. I had the pleasure to see a fine morning produce some cheerfulcountenances; and for the first time, during the last fifteen days, weexperienced comfort from the warmth of the sun. We stripped and hung upour clothes to dry, which were by this time become so thread-bare, thatthey could not keep out either wet or cold. In the afternoon we had manybirds about us, which are never seen far from land, such as boobies andnoddies.'As the sea now began to run fair, and the boat shipped but little water,Lieutenant Bligh took the opportunity to examine into the state of theirbread; and it was found that, according to the present mode of living,there was a sufficient quantity remaining for twenty-nine days'allowance, by which time there was every reason to expect they would beable to reach Timor. But as this was still uncertain, and it waspossible that, after all, they might be obliged to go to Java, it wasdetermined to proportion the allowance, so as to make the stock hold outsix weeks. 'I was apprehensive,' he says, 'that this would be illreceived, and that it would require my utmost resolution to enforce it;for, small as the quantity was which I intended to take away for ourfuture good, yet it might appear to my people like robbing them of life;and some who were less patient than their companions, I expected wouldvery ill brook it. However, on my representing the necessity of guardingagainst delays that might be occasioned by contrary winds, or othercauses, and promising to enlarge upon the allowance as we got on, theycheerfully agreed to my proposal.' It was accordingly settled that everyperson should receive one twenty-fifth part of a pound of bread forbreakfast, and the same quantity for dinner as usual, but that theproportion for supper should be discontinued; this arrangement left themforty-three days' consumption.On the 25th about noon, some noddies came so near to the boat, that oneof them was caught by hand. This bird was about the size of a smallpigeon. 'I divided it,' says Bligh, 'with its entrails, into eighteenportions, and by a well-known method at sea, of "_Who shall havethis?_"[9] it was distributed, with the allowance of bread and water fordinner, and eaten up, bones and all, with salt water for sauce. In theevening, several boobies flying very near to us, we had the goodfortune to catch one of them. This bird is as large as a duck. They arethe most presumptive proof of being near land, of any sea-fowl we areacquainted with. I directed the bird to be killed for supper, and theblood to be given to three of the people who were the most distressedfor want of food. The body, with the entrails, beak, and feet, I dividedinto eighteen shares, and with the allowance of bread, which I made amerit of granting, we made a good supper compared with our usual fare.'On the next day, the 26th, we caught another booby, so that Providenceappeared to be relieving our wants in an extraordinary manner. Thepeople were overjoyed at this addition to their dinner, which wasdistributed in the same manner as on the preceding evening; giving theblood to those who were the most in want of food. To make the bread alittle savoury, most of the men frequently dipped it in salt water, butI generally broke mine into small pieces, and ate it in my allowance ofwater, out of a cocoa-nut shell, with a spoon; economically avoiding totake too large a piece at a time, so that I was as long at dinner as ifit had been a much more plentiful meal.'The weather was now serene, which, nevertheless, was not without itsinconveniences, for, it appears, they began to feel distress of adifferent kind from that which they had hitherto been accustomed tosuffer. The heat of the sun was now so powerful, that several of thepeople were seized with a languor and faintness, which made lifeindifferent. But the little circumstance of catching two boobies in theevening, trifling as it may appear, had the effect of raising theirspirits. The stomachs of these birds contained several flying-fish, andsmall cuttle-fish, all of which were carefully saved to be divided fordinner the next day; which were accordingly divided with their entrails,and the contents of their maws, into eighteen portions, and, as theprize was a very valuable one, it was distributed as before, by callingout, '_Who shall have this?_'--'so that to-day,' says the lieutenant,'with the usual allowance of bread at breakfast and at dinner, I washappy to see that every person thought he had feasted.' From theappearance of the clouds in the evening, Mr. Bligh had no doubt theywere then near the land, and the people amused themselves withconversing on the probability of what they would meet with on it.Accordingly, at one in the morning of the 28th, the person at the helmheard the sound of breakers. It was the 'barrier reef' which runs alongthe eastern coast of New Holland, through which it now became theanxious object to discover a passage; Mr. Bligh says this was now becomeabsolutely necessary, without a moment's loss of time. The idea ofgetting
