e by that name since he asked me to marry him--'you know,dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be nosecret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try tothink of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if itwas all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brainfever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want toknow it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.' For, mydear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities arecomplete. 'Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here isthe book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let meknow; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back tothe bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.' He fellback exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. Ihave asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be thisafternoon, and am waiting her reply....       *       *       *       *       *"She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English missionchurch has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soonafter as Jonathan awakes....       *       *       *       *       *"Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, veryhappy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and hesat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his 'I will' firmlyand strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even thosewords seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, Ishall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilitiesI have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When thechaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, itis the first time I have written the words 'my husband'--left me alonewith my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped itup in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbonwhich was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed itto my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it wouldbe an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted eachother; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sakeor for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,Lucy, it was the first time he took _his wife's_ hand, and said that itwas the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would gothrough all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant tohave said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and Ishall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but theyear."Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was thehappiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give himexcept myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my loveand duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemnpledge between us...."Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only becauseit is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear tome. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came fromthe schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so thatin your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear,please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day ofsunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I mustnot wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be_always_ as happy as I am _now_. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this atonce, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathanis waking--I must attend to my husband!"Your ever-loving"MINA HARKER."_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker._"_Whitby, 30 August._"My dearest Mina,--"Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your ownhome with your husband. I wish you could be coming home soon enough tostay with us here. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it hasquite restored me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full oflife, and sleep well. You will be glad to know that I have quite givenup walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for aweek, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I am gettingfat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We have suchwalks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishingtogether; and I love him more than ever. He _tells_ me that he loves memore, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn't love memore than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me.So no more just at present from your loving"LUCY."P. S.--Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear. "P. P.S.--We are to be married on 28 September."_Dr. Seward's Diary.__20 August._--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He hasnow so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then onenight, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring tohimself: "Now I can wait; now I can wait." The attendant came to tellme, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in thestrait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gonefrom his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I mightalmost say, "cringing"--softness. I was satisfied with his presentcondition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strangething that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while lookingfurtively at them:--"They think I could hurt you! Fancy _me_ hurting _you_! The fools!"It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociatedeven in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same Ido not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything incommon with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or hashe to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needfulto him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even theoffer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He willonly say: "I don't take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,and I can wait; I can wait."After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quietuntil just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and atlength violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhaustedhim so that he swooned into a sort of coma.       *       *       *       *       *... Three nights has the same thing happened--violent all day then quietfrom moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. Itwould almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.Happy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. Heescaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. Weshall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case theyare required....       *       *       *       *       *_23 August._--"The unexpected always happens." How well Disraeli knewlife. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all oursubtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved onething; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall infuture be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have givenorders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul'sbody will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark!The unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until theattendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past himand flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow.Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found himin the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw mehe became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, hewould have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thinghappened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grewcalm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caughtthe patient's eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it lookedinto the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent andghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this oneseemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or hadsome intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, andpresently said:--"You needn't tie me; I shall go quietly!" Without trouble we came backto the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shallnot forget this night...._Lucy Westenra's Diary__Hillingham, 24 August._--I must imitate Mina, and keep writing thingsdown. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it willbe. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night Iseemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is thechange of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me,for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel soweak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grievedwhen he saw me, and I hadn't the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonderif I could sleep in mother's room to-night. I shall make an excuse andtry.       *       *       *       *       *_25 August._--Another bad night. Mother did not seem to take to myproposal. She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears toworry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when theclock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been fallingasleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but Idid not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then havefallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. Thismorning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat painsme. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don't seem ever toget air enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else Iknow he will be miserable to see me so._Letter, Arthur Holmwood to Dr. Seward._"_Albemarle Hotel, 31 August._"My dear Jack,--"I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill; that is, she has no specialdisease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. I haveasked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for todisturb the poor lady's mind about her daughter in her present state ofhealth would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom isspoken--disease of the heart--though poor Lucy does not know it yet. Iam sure that there is something preying on my dear girl's mind. I amalmost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a pang. Itold her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred atfirst--I know why, old fellow--she finally consented. It will be apainful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for _her_ sake, andI must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch atHillingham to-morrow, two o'clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion inMrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of beingalone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; Iam filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as Ican after you have seen her. Do not fail!"ARTHUR."_Telegram, Arthur Holmwood to Seward._"_1 September._"Am summoned to see my father, who is worse. Am writing. Write me fullyby to-night's post to Ring. Wire me if necessary."_Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood._"_2 September._"My dear old fellow,--"With regard to Miss Westenra's health I hasten to let you know at oncethat in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any maladythat I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied withher appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I sawher last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have fullopportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendshipmakes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom canbridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you todraw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I havedone and propose doing."I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knewto mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have nodoubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, wegot, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulnessamongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left withme. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chairwith a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that herhigh spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction tomake a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--"'I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.' I reminded herthat a doctor's confidence was sacred, but that you were grievouslyanxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled thatmatter in a word. 'Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care formyself, but all for him!' So I am quite free."I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not seethe usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test thequality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cordgave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was aslight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secureda few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitativeanalysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, initself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quitesatisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be acause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be somethingmental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily attimes, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, butregarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child sheused to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, whereMiss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has notreturned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; Ihave written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, ofAmsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in theworld. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all thingswere to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and yourrelations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience toyour wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can forher. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personalreason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept hiswishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knowswhat he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopherand a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an ironnerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and thekindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for thenoble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory andpractice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. Itell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence inhim. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenrato-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may notalarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call."Yours always,"JOHN SEWARD."_Letter, Abraham Van Helsing, M. D., D. Ph., D. Lit., etc., etc., to Dr.Seward._"_2 September._"My good Friend,--"When I have received your letter I am already coming to you. By goodfortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who havetrusted me. Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who havetrusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holdsdear. Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound soswiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our otherfriend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants myaids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do. But itis pleasure added to do for him, your friend; it is to you that I come.Have then rooms for me at the Great Eastern Hotel, so that I may be nearto hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not toolate on to-morrow, for it is likely that I may have to return here thatnight. But if need be I shall come again in three days, and stay longerif it must. Till then good-bye, my friend John. "VAN HELSING."_Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._"_3 September._"My dear Art,--"Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, andfound that, by Lucy's discretion, her mother was lunching out, so thatwe were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination ofthe patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for ofcourse I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how youtrust to me in the matter, he said: 'You must tell him all you think.Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am notjesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.' I askedwhat he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we hadcome back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on hisreturn to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must notbe angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all hisbrains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when thetime comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account ofour visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for_The Daily Telegraph_. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that thesmuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was astudent here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly makeit. In any case I am to have a letter."Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I firstsaw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of theghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She wasvery sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make himfeel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hardstruggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quicklook under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat ofall things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinitegeniality that I could see poor Lucy's pretense of animation merge intoreality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversationgently round to his visit, and suavely said:--"'My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are somuch beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do notsee. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of aghastly pale. To them I say: "Pouf!"' And he snapped his fingers at meand went on: 'But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How canhe'--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that withwhich once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, aparticular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--'know anythingof a young ladies? He has his madams to play with, and to bring themback to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But theyoung ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tellthemselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so manysorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away tosmoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk allto ourselves.' I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently theprofessor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, butsaid: 'I have made careful examination, but there is no functionalcause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it hasbeen, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I haveasked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must goback home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and ifthere be cause I shall come again. The disease--for not to be all wellis a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest metoo. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.'"As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trustyour poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, mydear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people whoare both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, andyou are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word tocome at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear fromme."_Dr. Seward's Diary.__4 September._--Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Justbefore the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knewthe symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at arun, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became soviolent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about fiveminutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sankinto a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. Theattendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were reallyappalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of theother patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quiteunderstand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I wassome distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, andas yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to showsomething directly. I cannot quite understand it.       *       *       *       *       *_Later._--Another change in my patient. At five o'clock I looked in onhim, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. Hewas catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his captureby making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges ofpadding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his badconduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back tohis own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well tohumour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has thesugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite aharvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into abox, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to finda spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for anyclue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would notrise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort offar-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--"All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I doit for myself!" Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:"Doctor, won't you be very good to me and let me have a little moresugar? I think it would be good for me.""And the flies?" I said."Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I likeit." And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen donot argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a manas, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.       *       *       *       *       *_Midnight._--Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra,whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at ourown gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. Ashis room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than inthe morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smokybeauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadowsand all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foulwater, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stonebuilding, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heartto endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and fromhis window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and lessfrenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, aninert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectualrecuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood upquite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not tohold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straightover to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took hisfly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shutthe window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprisedme, so I asked him: "Are you not going to keep flies any more?""No," said he; "I am sick of all that rubbish!" He certainly is awonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of hismind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clueafter all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noonand at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun atperiods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others?We shall see._Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._"_4 September._--Patient still better to-day."_Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._"_5 September._--Patient greatly improved.

Arthur Holmwood._"_6 September._"My dear Art,--"My news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted meprofessionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and toldher that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming tostay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly withmyself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for ashock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy's weakcondition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in withdifficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shallcome through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if youdo not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting fornews. In hasteYours ever,"JOHN SEWARD."_Dr. Seward's Diary.__7 September._--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met atLiverpool Street was:--"Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?""No," I said. "I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. Iwrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as MissWestenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.""Right, my friend," he said, "quite right! Better he not know as yet;perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then heshall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You dealwith the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuchas you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God's madmen,too--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor whyyou do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledgein its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around itand breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here." Hetouched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himselfthe same way. "I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shallunfold to you.""Why not now?" I asked. "It may do some good; we may arrive at somedecision." He stopped and looked at me, and said:--"My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it hasripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshinehas not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull theear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,and say to you: 'Look! he's good corn; he will make good crop when thetime comes.'" I did not see the application, and told him so. For replyhe reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, ashe used long ago to do at lectures, and said: "The good husbandman tellyou so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find thegood husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is forthe children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as ofthe work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,there's some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell." He brokeoff, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and verygravely:--"You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever morefull than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, andI trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, thatknowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that thiscase of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of suchinterest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick thebeam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is toosmall. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. Welearn from failure, not from success!"When I described Lucy's symptoms--the same as before, but infinitelymore marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him abag in which were many instruments and drugs, "the ghastly paraphernaliaof our beneficial trade," as he once called, in one of his lectures, theequipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as Iexpected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordainedthat even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a casewhere any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from somecause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in herdaughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It issomething like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body anenvelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil thatwhich it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an orderedselfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the viceof egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we haveknowledge of.I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid downa rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illnessmore than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily thatI saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I wereshown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, Iwas horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; thered seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones ofher face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see orhear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows convergedtill they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did notseem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. ThenVan Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. Theinstant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage tothe next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him andclosed the door. "My God!" he said; "this is dreadful. There is no timeto be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart'saction as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Isit you or me?""I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.""Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared."I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock atthe hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened thedoor, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying inan eager whisper:--"Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, andhave been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see formyself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,sir, for coming." When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him he hadbeen angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took inhis stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood whichseemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said tohim gravely as he held out his hand:--"Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She isbad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that." For hesuddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. "You are tohelp her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is yourbest help.""What can I do?" asked Arthur hoarsely. "Tell me, and I shall do it. Mylife is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body forher." The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from oldknowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--"My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!""What shall I do?" There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostrilquivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. "Come!"he said. "You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better thanme, better than my friend John." Arthur looked bewildered, and theProfessor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--"Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must haveor die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to performwhat we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one tothe empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he isthe more young and strong than me"--here Arthur took my hand and wrungit hard in silence--"but, now you are here, you are more good than us,old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are notso calm and our blood not so bright than yours!" Arthur turned to himand said:--"If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you wouldunderstand----"He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice."Good boy!" said Van Helsing. "In the not-so-far-off you will be happythat you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. Youshall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and youmust leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is withher! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!"We all went up to Lucy's room. Arthur by direction remained outside.Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was notasleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoketo us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laidthem on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, andcoming over to the bed, said cheerily:--"Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a goodchild. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes." She had madethe effort with success.It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, markedthe extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began toflicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifestits potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor wassatisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off hiscoat. Then he added: "You may take that one little kiss whiles I bringover the table. Friend John, help to me!" So neither of us looked whilsthe bent over her.Van Helsing turning to me, said:"He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need notdefibrinate it."Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed theoperation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to comeback to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joyof his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to growanxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as hewas. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy's system musthave undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand and withhis eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my ownheart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: "Do not stir an instant.It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her." When all was over Icould see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took hisarm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--theman seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--"The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall havepresently." And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted thepillow to the patient's head. As he did so the narrow black velvet bandwhich she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an olddiamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but Icould hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing'sways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned tome, saying: "Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the portwine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleepmuch and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given tohis love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all waysthe operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and youcan go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tellher all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what youhave done. Good-bye."When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as herbreast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in awhisper:--"What do you make of that mark on her throat?""What do you make of it?""I have not examined it yet," I answered, and then and there proceededto loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were twopunctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign ofdisease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by sometrituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever itwas, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandonedthe idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bedwould have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl musthave lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion."Well?" said Van Helsing."Well," said I, "I can make nothing of it." The Professor stood up. "Imust go back to Amsterdam to-night," he said. "There are books andthings there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and youmust not let your sight pass from her.""Shall I have a nurse?" I asked."We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see thatshe is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep allthe night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon aspossible. And then we may begin.""May begin?" I said. "What on earth do you mean?""We shall see!" he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a momentlater and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger heldup:--"Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, youshall not sleep easy hereafter!"_Dr. Seward's Diary--continued.__8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itselfoff towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different beingfrom what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of theabsolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenrathat Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her shealmost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewedstrength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and madepreparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for thenight I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat bythe bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at megratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemedsinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself togetherand shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effortand with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that shedid not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--"You do not want to go to sleep?""No; I am afraid.""Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.""Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!""A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?""I don't know; oh, I don't know. And that is what is so terrible. Allthis weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought.""But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, andI can promise that nothing will happen.""Ah, I can trust you!" I seized the opportunity, and said: "I promiseyou that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once.""You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I willsleep!" And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sankback, asleep.All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and onin a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips wereslightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of apendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no baddreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and tookmyself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a shortwire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent resultof the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me allday to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about myzoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for thepast day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilstI was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, asit might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by thenight mail and would join me early in the morning.       *       *       *       *       *_9 September_.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got toHillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and mybrain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebralexhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook handswith me she looked sharply in my face and said:--"No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite wellagain; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I whowill sit up with you." I would not argue the point, but went and had mysupper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, Imade an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more thanexcellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room nexther own, where a cozy fire was burning. "Now," she said, "you must stayhere. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on thesofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go tobed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything Ishall call out, and you can come to me at once." I could not butacquiesce, for I was "dog-tired," and could not have sat up had I tried.So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything,I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything._Lucy Westenra's Diary.__9 September._--I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak,that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine aftera long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very,very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I supposeit is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our innereyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Loverein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I knowwhere my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your earsmust tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest oflast night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand andwithin call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God!Good-night, Arthur._Dr. Seward's Diary.__10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor's hand on my head, andstarted awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learnin an asylum, at any rate."And how is our patient?""Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me," I answered."Come, let us see," he said. And together we went into the room.The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst VanHelsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, Iheard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, adeadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, andhis exclamation of horror, "Gott in Himmel!" needed no enforcement fromhis agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and hisiron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horriblywhite and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gumsseemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in acorpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stampin anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habitstood to him, and he put it down again softly. "Quick!" he said. "Bringthe brandy." I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm andwrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonisingsuspense said:--"It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work isundone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I haveto call on you yourself this time, friend John." As he spoke, he wasdipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; Ihad taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was nopossibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,without a moment's delay, we began the operation. After a time--it didnot seem a short time either, for the draining away of one's blood, nomatter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsingheld up a warning finger. "Do not stir," he said, "but I fear that withgrowing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so muchdanger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injectionof morphia." He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out hisintent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to mergesubtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pridethat I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallidcheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is tofeel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.The Professor watched me critically. "That will do," he said. "Already?"I remonstrated. "You took a great deal more from Art." To which hesmiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--"He is her lover, her _fiancé_. You have work, much work, to do for herand for others; and the present will suffice."When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applieddigital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited hisleisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-byhe bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine formyself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and halfwhispered:--"Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn upunexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him andenjealous him, too. There must be none. So!"When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--"You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, andrest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me."I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. Ihad done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. Ifelt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement atwhat had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering overand over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and howshe could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere toshow for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the littlepunctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of theiredges--tiny though they were.Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well andstrong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsinghad seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strictinjunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear hisvoice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anythinghad happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mothercame up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, butsaid to me gratefully:--"We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you reallymust now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking paleyourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that youdo!" As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonteddrain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turnedimploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on mylips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:"Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. Istay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You andI must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have gravereasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to thinkeven the most not-probable. Good-night."In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either ofthem might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; andwhen I said it was Dr. Van Helsing's wish that either he or I should situp, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the "foreigngentleman." I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is becauseI am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's account, thattheir devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seensimilar instances of woman's kindness. I got back here in time for alate dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waitingfor sleep. It is coming.       *       *       *       *       *_11 September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found VanHelsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I hadarrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened itwith much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle ofwhite flowers."These are for you, Miss Lucy," he said."For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!""Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines." HereLucy made a wry face. "Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction orin nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shallpoint out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeingso much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, butyou do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, andhang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like thelotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the watersof Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores soughtfor in the Floridas, and find him all too late."Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smellingthem. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, andhalf-disgust:--"Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,these flowers are only common garlic."To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, hisiron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--"No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake ofothers if not for your own." Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she mightwell be, he went on more gently: "Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fearme. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those socommon flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself thewreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make soinquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that waitfor you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shallhelp me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here."We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor'sactions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeiathat I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched themsecurely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all overthe sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might getin would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbedall over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and roundthe fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, andpresently I said:--"Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, butthis certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or hewould say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.""Perhaps I am!" he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath whichLucy was to wear round her neck.We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when shewas in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round herneck. The last words he said to her were:--"Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, donot to-night open the window or the door.""I promise," said Lucy, "and thank you both a thousand times for allyour kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with suchfriends?"As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--"To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel,much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning earlyyou call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so muchmore strong for my 'spell' which I have work. Ho! ho!"He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nightsbefore and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It musthave been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, butI felt it all the more, like unshed tears.CHAPTER XI_Lucy Westenra's Diary.__12 September._--How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. Hepositively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have beenright, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dreadbeing alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall notmind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that Ihave had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it hasfor me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, nodreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and bringsnothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,and lying like Ophelia in the play, with "virgin crants and maidenstrewments." I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night,everybody._Dr. Seward's Diary.__13 September._--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. TheProfessor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham ateight o'clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all thefresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature'sannual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we metMrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an earlyriser. She greeted us warmly and said:--"You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is stillasleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest Ishould disturb her." The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. Herubbed his hands together, and said:--"Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working," towhich she answered:--"You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy's state thismorning is due in part to me.""How you do mean, ma'am?" asked the Professor."Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went intoher room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming didnot wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of thosehorrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actuallya bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would betoo much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all awayand opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will bepleased with her, I am sure."She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. Asshe had spoken, I watched the Professor's face, and saw it turn ashengrey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor ladywas present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass intoher room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly andforcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. Heraised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beathis palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobsthat seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raisedhis arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. "God! God!God!" he said. "What have we done, what has this poor thing done, thatwe are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from thepagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poormother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does suchthing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, wemust not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we arebeset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!" Suddenly hejumped to his feet. "Come," he said, "come, we must see and act. Devilsor no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight himall the same." He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together wewent up to Lucy's room.Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the sameawful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness andinfinite pity."As I expected," he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his whichmeant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and thenbegan to set out on the little table the instruments for yet anotheroperation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised thenecessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with awarning hand. "No!" he said. "To-day you must operate. I shall provide.You are weakened already." As he spoke he took off his coat and rolledup his shirt-sleeve.Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour tothe ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time Iwatched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she mustnot remove anything from Lucy's room without consulting him; that theflowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odourwas a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the casehimself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and wouldsend me word when to come.After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright andseemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of lifeamongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain._Lucy Westenra's Diary.__17 September._--Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strongagain that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through somelong nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine andfeel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dimhalf-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darknessin which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distressmore poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back tolife as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seemsto have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of mywits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemedso close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where andcommanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed nowwithout any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grownquite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day fromHaarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for aday in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be leftalone. Thank God for mother's sake, and dear Arthur's, and for all ourfriends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, forlast night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I foundhim asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily againstthe window-panes._"The Pall Mall Gazette," 18 September._                           THE ESCAPED WOLF.         PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.         _Interview with the Keeper in the Zoölogical Gardens._After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually usingthe words "Pall Mall Gazette" as a sort of talisman, I managed to findthe keeper of the section of the Zoölogical Gardens in which the wolfdepartment is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages inthe enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down tohis tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of theirhospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be prettycomfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called "business"until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when thetable was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--"Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You'll excoose merefoosin' to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives thewolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea aforeI begins to arsk them questions.""How do you mean, ask them questions?" I queried, wishful to get himinto a talkative humour."'Ittin' of them over the 'ead with a pole is one way; scratchin' oftheir hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orfto their gals. I don't so much mind the fust--the 'ittin' with a poleafore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they've 'ad theirsherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with theear-scratchin'. Mind you," he added philosophically, "there's a deal ofthe same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here's you a-comin' andarskin' of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like thatonly for your bloomin' 'arf-quid I'd 'a' seen you blowed fust 'fore I'danswer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I'd like you toarsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offencedid I tell yer to go to 'ell?""You did.""An' when you said you'd report me for usin' of obscene language thatwas 'ittin' me over the 'ead; but the 'arf-quid made that all right. Iweren't a-goin' to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my 'owlas the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor' love yer 'art, nowthat the old 'ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an' rinsedme out with her bloomin' old teapot, and I've lit hup, you may scratchmy ears for all you're worth, and won't git even a growl out of me.Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin' at, that 'ereescaped wolf.""Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how ithappened; and when I know the facts I'll get you to say what youconsider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair willend.""All right, guv'nor. This 'ere is about the 'ole story. That 'ere wolfwhat we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came fromNorway to Jamrach's, which we bought off him four years ago. He was anice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I'm moresurprised at 'im for wantin' to get out nor any other animile in theplace. But, there, you can't trust wolves no more nor women.""Don't you mind him, sir!" broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. "'E'sgot mindin' the animiles so long that blest if he ain't like a old wolf'isself! But there ain't no 'arm in 'im.""Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin' yesterday when I firsthear my disturbance. I was makin' up a litter in the monkey-house for ayoung puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin' and 'owlin' I kemaway straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin' like a mad thing at thebars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn't much people about thatday, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a 'ooknose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin' through it. Hehad a 'ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,for it seemed as if it was 'im as they was hirritated at. He 'ad whitekid gloves on 'is 'ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:'Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.'"'Maybe it's you,' says I, for I did not like the airs as he give'isself. He didn't git angry, as I 'oped he would, but he smiled a kindof insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. 'Oh no, theywouldn't like me,' 'e says."'Ow yes, they would,' says I, a-imitatin' of him. 'They always likes abone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you 'as abagful.'"Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin' theylay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his earssame as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn't putin his hand and stroke the old wolf's ears too!"'Tyke care,' says I. 'Bersicker is quick.'"'Never mind,' he says. 'I'm used to 'em!'"'Are you in the business yourself?' I says, tyking off my 'at, for aman what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers."'No' says he, 'not exactly in the business, but I 'ave made pets ofseveral.' And with that he lifts his 'at as perlite as a lord, and walksaway. Old Bersicker kep' a-lookin' arter 'im till 'e was out of sight,and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn't come hout the 'olehevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolveshere all began a-'owling. There warn't nothing for them to 'owl at.There warn't no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin' adog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twiceI went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the 'owlingstopped. Just before twelve o'clock I just took a look round aforeturnin' in, an', bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker'scage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. Andthat's all I know for certing.""Did any one else see anything?""One of our gard'ners was a-comin' 'ome about that time from a 'armony,when he sees a big grey dog comin' out through the garding 'edges. Atleast, so he says, but I don't give much for it myself, for if he did 'enever said a word about it to his missis when 'e got 'ome, and it wasonly after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up allnight-a-huntin' of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein'anything. My own belief was that the 'armony 'ad got into his 'ead.""Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of thewolf?""Well, sir," he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, "I think I can;but I don't know as 'ow you'd be satisfied with the theory.""Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals fromexperience, can't hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?""Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that 'erewolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out."From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke Icould see that it had done service before, and that the wholeexplanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn't cope in badinagewith the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,so I said:--"Now, Mr. Bilder, we'll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you've told mewhat you think will happen.""Right y'are, sir," he said briskly. "Ye'll excoose me, I know, fora-chaffin' of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as muchas telling me to go on.""Well, I never!" said the old lady."My opinion is this: that 'ere wolf is a-'idin' of, somewheres. Thegard'ner wot didn't remember said he was a-gallopin' northward fasterthan a horse could go; but I don't believe him, for, yer see, sir,wolves don't gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein' built thatway. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they getsin packs and does be chivyin' somethin' that's more afeared than they isthey can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,Lor' bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half soclever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in'im. This one ain't been used to fightin' or even to providin' forhisself, and more like he's somewhere round the Park a-'idin' an'a-shiverin' of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin' where he is to gethis breakfast from; or maybe he's got down some area and is in acoal-cellar. My eye, won't some cook get a rum start when she sees hisgreen eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can't get food he'sbound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher'sshop in time. If he doesn't, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin' orf witha soldier, leavin' of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then Ishouldn't be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That'sall."I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing upagainst the window, and Mr. Bilder's face doubled its natural lengthwith surprise."God bless me!" he said. "If there ain't old Bersicker come back by'isself!"He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding itseemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks sowell as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; apersonal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder norhis wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animalitself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of allpicture-wolves--Red Riding Hood's quondam friend, whilst moving herconfidence in masquerade.The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. Thewicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all thechildren in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort ofpenitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpineprodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tendersolicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--"There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;didn't I say it all along? Here's his head all cut and full of brokenglass. 'E's been a-gettin' over some bloomin' wall or other. It's ashyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.This 'ere's what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker."He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat thatsatisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of thefatted calf, and went off to report.I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is givento-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo._Dr. Seward's Diary.__17 September._--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up mybooks, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and inrushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I wasthunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accordinto the Superintendent's study is almost unknown. Without an instant'spause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He wastoo quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get mybalance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he wassprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite alittle pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was notintent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When theattendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employmentpositively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor lickingup, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He waseasily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quiteplacidly, simply repeating over and over again: "The blood is the life!The blood is the life!"I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much oflate for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy'sillness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited andweary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summonedme, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do withoutit._Telegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax._(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late bytwenty-two hours.)"_17 September._--Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night. If notwatching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are asplaced; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon aspossible after arrival."_Dr. Seward's Diary.__18 September._--Just off for train to London. The arrival of VanHelsing's telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I knowby bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it ispossible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened? Surelythere is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accidentshould thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder withme, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy's phonograph._Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra.__17 September. Night._--I write this and leave it to be seen, so that noone may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exactrecord of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, andhave barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in thedoing.I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after thatsleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now Iknow so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was inthe next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might havecalled him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to methe old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleepwould try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to bealone, I opened my door and called out: "Is there anybody there?" Therewas no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog's, butmore fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but couldsee nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting itswings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determinednot to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. Shesaid to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--"I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were allright."I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come inand sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she didnot take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a whileand then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I inhers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She wasstartled and a little frightened, and cried out: "What is that?" I triedto pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I couldhear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there wasthe low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was acrash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in theaperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt greywolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sittingposture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongstother things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsinginsisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For asecond or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strangeand horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struckwith lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for amoment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept myeyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a wholemyriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the brokenwindow, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust thattravellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried tostir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother's poor body,which seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased tobeat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recoveredconsciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; thedogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed andstupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of thenightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfortme. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could heartheir bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and theycame in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that layover me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through thebroken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of mydear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after Ihad got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed themto go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flewopen for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then wentin a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dearmother's breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsinghad told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and, besides, I wouldhave some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised thatthe maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I wentto the dining-room to look for them.My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helplesson the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the tablehalf full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on thesideboard, I found that the bottle which mother's doctor uses forher--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am backin the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save forthe sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! Idare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through thebroken window.The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught fromthe window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? Godshield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mothergone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should notsurvive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!CHAPTER XIIDR. SEWARD'S DIARY_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gentlyand rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or hermother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursedthe laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such anhour--for it was now ten o'clock--and so rang and knocked again, butmore impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed onlythe servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was thisdesolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawingtight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, toolate? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours ofdanger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entryanywhere.I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened andlocked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard therapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet. They stopped at thegate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.When he saw me, he gasped out:--"Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did younot get my telegram?"I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got histelegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused andraised his hat as he said solemnly:--"Then I fear we are too late. God's will be done!" With his usualrecuperative energy, he went on: "Come. If there be no way open to getin, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now."We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchenwindow. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, andhanding it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. Iattacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Thenwith a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes andopened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. Therewas no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close athand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found fourservant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in theroom left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked ateach other, and as we moved away he said: "We can attend to them later."Then we ascended to Lucy's room. For an instant or two we paused at thedoor to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With whitefaces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered theroom.How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and hermother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a whitesheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through thebroken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terrorfixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still moredrawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon hermother's bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little woundswhich we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touchingpoor Lucy's breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one wholistens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--"It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!"I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and tasteit, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I foundon the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and Ifancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on anotheroccasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of herhands. He said to me:--"I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make themget heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold asthat beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anythingmore."I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of thewomen. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidentlyaffected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let hersleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back tothem they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern withthem, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one lifewas bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrificeMiss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half cladas they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen andboiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. Wegot a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilstwe were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. Oneof the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Thenshe returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had comewith a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that hemust wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadlyearnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did notunderstand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--"If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fadeaway into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon." He wenton with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning tobe of some effect. Lucy's heart beat a trifle more audibly to thestethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing'sface almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her ina hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--"The first gain is ours! Check to the King!"We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laidher in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticedthat Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She wasstill unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we hadever seen her.Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with herand not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned meout of the room."We must consult as to what is to be done," he said as we descended thestairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, heclosing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, butthe blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette ofdeath which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidlyobserves. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, lightenough for our purposes. Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relievedby a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind aboutsomething, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--"What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must haveanother transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl's lifewon't be worth an hour's purchase. You are exhausted already; I amexhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would havecourage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open hisveins for her?""What's the matter with me, anyhow?"The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones broughtrelief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. VanHelsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and aglad look came into his eyes as I cried out: "Quincey Morris!" andrushed towards him with outstretched hands."What brought you here?" I cried as our hands met."I guess Art is the cause."He handed me a telegram:--"Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.Do not delay.--HOLMWOOD.""I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tellme what to do."Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight inthe eyes as he said:--"A brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is introuble. You're a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work againstus for all he's worth, but God sends us men when we want them."Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heartto go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and ittold on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into herveins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the otheroccasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to seeand hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and VanHelsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and withgood effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watchedwhilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maidsto pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying downafter having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a goodbreakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room whereLucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet ortwo of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and wasthinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a lookof grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.He handed me the paper saying only: "It dropped from Lucy's breast whenwe carried her to the bath."When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pauseasked him: "In God's name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?" I was so bewildered that Idid not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took thepaper, saying:--"Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall knowand understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now whatis it that you came to me to say?" This brought me back to fact, and Iwas all myself again."I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not actproperly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would haveto be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if wehad it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and youknow, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenrahad disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let usfill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to theregistrar and go on to the undertaker.""Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she besad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends thatlove her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one oldman. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all themore for it! Now go."In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling himthat Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was nowgoing on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told himwhere I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--"When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all toourselves?" I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty aboutthe registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up inthe evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see himas soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was stillsleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at herside. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that heexpected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, wherethe blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, orrather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he saidto me:--"Jack Seward, I don't want to shove myself in anywhere where I've noright to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girland wanted to marry her; but, although that's all past and gone, I can'thelp feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that's wrongwith her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can seethat--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a manmust not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this isno common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not thatso?""That's so," I said, and he went on:--"I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I didto-day. Is not that so?""That's so.""And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at hisown place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quicksince I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grassall in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got ather in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein l
