 of Felicien de Hautecoeur, in the triumphantpeal of bells ringing for her splendid nuptials.The union of the two branches, the legitimate and the illegitimate,took place then, Marthe Rougon espousing her cousin Francois Mouret,a peaceful household slowly disunited, ending in the direstcatastrophes--a sad and gentle woman taken, made use of, and crushed inthe vast machine of war erected for the conquest of a city; her threechildren torn from her, she herself leaving her heart in the rude graspof the Abbe Faujas. And the Rougons saved Plassans a second time, whileshe was dying in the glare of the conflagration in which her husband wasbeing consumed, mad with long pent-up rage and the desire for revenge.Of the three children, Octave Mouret was the audacious conqueror, theclear intellect, resolved to demand from the women the sovereignty ofParis, fallen at his _debut_ into the midst of a corrupt _bourgeois_society, acquiring there a terrible sentimental education, passing fromthe capricious refusal of one woman to the unresisting abandonmentof another, remaining, fortunately, active, laborious, and combative,gradually emerging, and improved even, from the low plotting, theceaseless ferment of a rotten society that could be heard alreadycracking to its foundations. And Octave Mouret, victorious,revolutionized commerce; swallowed up the cautious little shops thatcarried on business in the old-fashioned way; established in the midstof feverish Paris the colossal palace of temptation, blazing withlights, overflowing with velvets, silks, and laces; won fortunesexploiting woman; lived in smiling scorn of woman until the day whena little girl, the avenger of her sex, the innocent and wise Denise,vanquished him and held him captive at her feet, groaning with anguish,until she did him the favor, she who was so poor, to marry him in themidst of the apotheosis of his Louvre, under the golden shower of hisreceipts.There remained the two other children, Serge Mouret and Desiree Mouret,the latter innocent and healthy, like some happy young animal; theformer refined and mystical, who was thrown into the priesthood by anervous malady hereditary in his family, and who lived again the storyof Adam, in the Eden of Le Paradou. He was born again to love Albine,and to lose her, in the bosom of sublime nature, their accomplice; to berecovered, afterward by the Church, to war eternally with life, strivingto kill his manhood, throwing on the body of the dead Albine the handfulof earth, as officiating priest, at the very time when Desiree, thesister and friend of animals, was rejoicing in the midst of the swarminglife of her poultry yard.Further on there opened a calm glimpse of gentle and tragic life, HeleneMouret living peacefully with her little girl, Jeanne, on the heights ofPassy, overlooking Paris, the bottomless, boundless human sea, in faceof which was unrolled this page of love: the sudden passion of Helenefor a stranger, a physician, brought one night by chance to the bedsideof her daughter; the morbid jealousy of Jeanne--the instinctive jealousyof a loving girl--disputing her mother with love, her mother alreadyso wasted by her unhappy passion that the daughter died because ofher fault; terrible price of one hour of desire in the entire cold anddiscreet life of a woman, poor dead child, lying alone in the silentcemetery, in face of eternal Paris.With Lisa Macquart began the illegitimate branch; appearing fresh andstrong in her, as she displayed her portly, prosperous figure, sittingat the door of her pork shop in a light colored apron, watching thecentral market, where the hunger of a people muttered, the age-longbattle of the Fat and the Lean, the lean Florent, her brother-in-law,execrated, and set upon by the fat fishwomen and the fat shopwomen, andwhom even the fat pork-seller herself, honest, but unforgiving, causedto be arrested as a republican who had broken his ban, convinced thatshe was laboring for the good digestion of all honest people.From this mother sprang the sanest, the most human of girls, PaulineQuenu, the well-balanced, the reasonable, the virgin; who, knowingeverything, accepted the joy of living in so ardent a love for othersthat, in spite of the revolt of her youthful heart, she resigned to herfriend her cousin and betrothed, Lazare, and afterward saved the childof the disunited household, becoming its true mother; always triumphant,always gay, notwithstanding her sacrificed and ruined life, in hermonotonous solitude, facing the great sea, in the midst of a littleworld of sufferers groaning with pain, but who did not wish to die.Then came Gervaise Macquart with her four children: bandy-legged,pretty, and industrious Gervaise, whom her lover Lantier turned intothe street in the faubourg, where she met the zinc worker Coupeau, theskilful, steady workman whom she married, and with whom she livedso happily at first, having three women working in her laundry,but afterward sinking with her husband, as was inevitable, to thedegradation of her surroundings. He, gradually conquered by alcohol,brought by it to madness and death; she herself perverted, become aslattern, her moral ruin completed by the return of Lantier, livingin the tranquil ignominy of a household of three, thenceforward thewretched victim of want, her accomplice, to which she at last succumbed,dying one night of starvation.Her eldest son, Claude, had the unhappy genius of a great painter struckwith madness, the impotent madness of feeling within him the masterpieceto which his fingers refused to give shape; a giant wrestler alwaysdefeated, a crucified martyr to his work, adoring woman, sacrificing hiswife Christine, so loving and for a time so beloved, to the increate,divine woman of his visions, but whom his pencil was unable to delineatein her nude perfection, possessed by a devouring passion for producing,an insatiable longing to create, a longing so torturing when it couldnot be satisfied, that he ended it by hanging himself.Jacques brought crime, the hereditary taint being transmuted in him intoan instinctive appetite for blood, the young and fresh blood from thegashed throat of a woman, the first comer, the passer-by in the street:a horrible malady against which he struggled, but which took possessionof him again in the course of his _amour_ with the submissive andsensual Severine, whom a tragic story of assassination caused to live inconstant terror, and whom he stabbed one evening in an excess of frenzy,maddened by the sight of her white throat. Then this savage human beastrushed among the trains filing past swiftly, and mounted the snortingengine of which he was the engineer, the beloved engine which was oneday to crush him to atoms, and then, left without a guide, to rushfuriously off into space braving unknown disasters.Etienne, in his turn driven out, arrived in the black country on afreezing night in March, descended into the voracious pit, fell in lovewith the melancholy Catherine, of whom a ruffian robbed him; lived withthe miners their gloomy life of misery and base promiscuousness, untilone day when hunger, prompting rebellion, sent across the barren plain ahowling mob of wretches who demanded bread, tearing down and burningas they went, under the menace of the guns of the band that went off ofthemselves, a terrible convulsion announcing the end of the world. Theavenging blood of the Maheus was to rise up later; of Alzire dead ofstarvation, Maheu killed by a bullet, Zacharie killed by an explosion offire-damp, Catherine under the ground. La Maheude alone survived to weepher dead, descending again into the mine to earn her thirty sons, whileEtienne, the beaten chief of the band, haunted by the dread of futuredemands, went away on a warm April morning, listening to the secretgrowth of the new world whose germination was soon to dazzle the earth.Nana then became the avenger; the girl born among the social filth ofthe faubourgs; the golden fly sprung from the rottenness below, thatwas tolerated and concealed, carrying in the fluttering of its wingsthe ferment of destruction, rising and contaminating the aristocracy,poisoning men only by alighting upon them, in the palaces through whosewindows it entered; the unconscious instrument of ruin and death--fierceflame of Vandeuvres, the melancholy fate of Foucarmont, lost in theChinese waters, the disaster of Steiner, reduced to live as an honestman, the imbecility of La Faloise and the tragic ruin of the Muffats,and the white corpse of Georges, watched by Philippe, come out of prisonthe day before, when the air of the epoch was so contaminated that sheherself was infected, and died of malignant smallpox, caught at thedeath-bed of her son Louiset, while Paris passed beneath her windows,intoxicated, possessed by the frenzy of war, rushing to general ruin.Lastly comes Jean Macquart, the workman and soldier become again apeasant, fighting with the hard earth, which exacts that every grain ofcorn shall be purchased with a drop of sweat, fighting, above all, withthe country people, whom covetousness and the long and difficult battlewith the soil cause to burn with the desire, incessantly stimulated, ofpossession. Witness the Fouans, grown old, parting with their fields asif they were parting with their flesh; the Buteaus in their eager greedcommitting parricide, to hasten the inheritance of a field of lucern;the stubborn Francoise dying from the stroke of a scythe, withoutspeaking, rather than that a sod should go out of the family--all thisdrama of simple natures governed by instinct, scarcely emerged fromprimitive barbarism--all this human filth on the great earth, whichalone remains immortal, the mother from whom they issue and to whom theyreturn again, she whom they love even to crime, who continually remakeslife, for its unknown end, even with the misery and the abomination ofthe beings she nourishes. And it was Jean, too, who, become a widowerand having enlisted again at the first rumor of war, brought theinexhaustible reserve, the stock of eternal rejuvenation which the earthkeeps; Jean, the humblest, the staunchest soldier at the final downfall,swept along in the terrible and fatal storm which, from the frontierto Sedan, in sweeping away the Empire, threatened to sweep away thecountry; always wise, circumspect, firm in his hope, loving withfraternal affection his comrade Maurice, the demented child of thepeople, the holocaust doomed to expiation, weeping tears of blood wheninexorable destiny chose himself to hew off this rotten limb, and afterall had ended--the continual defeats, the frightful civil war, the lostprovinces, the thousands of millions of francs to pay--taking up themarch again, notwithstanding, returning to the land which awaited him,to the great and difficult task of making a new France.Pascal paused; Clotilde had handed him all the packages, one by one,and he had gone over them all, laid bare the contents of all, classifiedthem anew, and placed them again on the top shelf of the press. He wasout of breath, exhausted by his swift course through all this humanity,while, without voice, without movement, the young girl, stunned bythis overflowing torrent of life, waited still, incapable of thoughtor judgment. The rain still beat furiously upon the dark fields. Thelightning had just struck a tree in the neighborhood, that had splitwith a terrible crash. The candles flared up in the wind that came infrom the open window."Ah!" he resumed, pointing to the papers again, "there is a world initself, a society, a civilization, the whole of life is there, with itsmanifestations, good and bad, in the heat and labor of the forge whichshapes everything. Yes, our family of itself would suffice as an exampleto science, which will perhaps one day establish with mathematicalexactness the laws governing the diseases of the blood and nervesthat show themselves in a race, after a first organic lesion, andthat determine, according to environment, the sentiments, desires, andpassions of each individual of that race, all the human, natural andinstinctive manifestations which take the names of virtues and vices.And it is also a historical document, it relates the story of the SecondEmpire, from the _coup d'etat_ to Sedan; for our family spring fromthe people, they spread themselves through the whole of contemporarysociety, invaded every place, impelled by their unbridled appetites, bythat impulse, essentially modern, that eager desire that urges the lowerclasses to enjoyment, in their ascent through the social strata. Westarted, as I have said, from Plassans, and here we are now arrived oncemore at Plassans."He paused again, and then resumed in a low, dreamy voice:"What an appalling mass stirred up! how many passions, how many joys,how many sufferings crammed into this colossal heap of facts! There ispure history: the Empire founded in blood, at first pleasure-lovingand despotic, conquering rebellious cities, then gliding to a slowdisintegration, dissolving in blood--in such a sea of blood that theentire nation came near being swamped in it. There are social studies:wholesale and retail trade, prostitution, crime, land, money, the_bourgeoisie_, the people--that people who rot in the sewer ofthe faubourgs, who rebel in the great industrial centers, all thatever-increasing growth of mighty socialism, big with the new century.There are simple human studies: domestic pages, love stories, thestruggle of minds and hearts against unjust nature, the destructionof those who cry out under their too difficult task, the cry of virtueimmolating itself, victorious over pain, There are fancies, flightsof the imagination beyond the real: vast gardens always in bloom,cathedrals with slender, exquisitely wrought spires, marvelous talescome down from paradise, ideal affections remounting to heaven in akiss. There is everything: the good and the bad, the vulgar and thesublime, flowers, mud, blood, laughter, the torrent of life itself,bearing humanity endlessly on!"He took up again the genealogical tree which had remained neglectedon the table, spread it out and began to go over it once more with hisfinger, enumerating now the members of the family who were still living:Eugene Rougon, a fallen majesty, who remained in the Chamber, thewitness, the impassible defender of the old world swept away at thedownfall of the Empire. Aristide Saccard, who, after having changed hisprinciples, had fallen upon his feet a republican, the editor of a greatjournal, on the way to make new millions, while his natural son Victor,who had never reappeared, was living still in the shade, since he wasnot in the galleys, cast forth by the world into the future, into theunknown, like a human beast foaming with the hereditary virus, who mustcommunicate his malady with every bite he gives. Sidonie Rougon, whohad for a time disappeared, weary of disreputable affairs, had latelyretired to a sort of religious house, where she was living in monasticausterity, the treasurer of the Marriage Fund, for aiding in themarriage of girls who were mothers. Octave Mouret, proprietor of thegreat establishment _Au Bonheur des Dames_, whose colossal fortune stillcontinued increasing, had had, toward the end of the winter, a thirdchild by his wife Denise Baudu, whom he adored, although his mind wasbeginning to be deranged again. The Abbe Mouret, cure at St. Eutrope, inthe heart of a marshy gorge, lived there in great retirement, and verymodestly, with his sister Desiree, refusing all advancement from hisbishop, and waiting for death like a holy man, rejecting all medicines,although he was already suffering from consumption in its first stage.Helene Mouret was living very happily in seclusion with her secondhusband, M. Rambaud, on the little estate which they owned nearMarseilles, on the seashore; she had had no child by her second husband.Pauline Quenu was still at Bonneville at the other extremity of France,in face of the vast ocean, alone with little Paul, since the deathof Uncle Chanteau, having resolved never to marry, in order to devoteherself entirely to the son of her cousin Lazare, who had become awidower and had gone to America to make a fortune. Etienne Lantier,returning to Paris after the strike at Montsou, had compromised himselflater in the insurrection of the Commune, whose principles he haddefended with ardor; he had been condemned to death, but his sentencebeing commuted was transported and was now at Noumea. It was even saidthat he had married immediately on his arrival there, and that he hadhad a child, the sex of which, however, was not known with certainty.Finally, Jean Macquart, who had received his discharge after the BloodyWeek, had settled at Valqueyras, near Plassans, where he had had thegood fortune to marry a healthy girl, Melanie Vial, the daughter of awell-to-do peasant, whose lands he farmed, and his wife had borne him ason in May."Yes, it is true," he resumed, in a low voice; "races degenerate. Thereis here a veritable exhaustion, rapid deterioration, as if our family,in their fury of enjoyment, in the gluttonous satisfaction of theirappetites, had consumed themselves too quickly. Louiset, dead ininfancy; Jacques Louis, a half imbecile, carried off by a nervousdisease; Victor returned to the savage state, wandering about in whoknows what dark places; our poor Charles, so beautiful and so frail;these are the latest branches of the tree, the last pale offshoots intowhich the puissant sap of the larger branches seems to have been unableto mount. The worm was in the trunk, it has ascended into the fruit, andis devouring it. But one must never despair; families are a continualgrowth. They go back beyond the common ancestor, into the unfathomablestrata of the races that have lived, to the first being; and theywill put forth new shoots without end, they will spread and ramify toinfinity, through future ages. Look at our tree; it counts only fivegenerations. It has not so much importance as a blade of grass, even,in the human forest, vast and dark, of which the peoples are the greatsecular oaks. Think only of the immense roots which spread through thesoil; think of the continual putting forth of new leaves above, whichmingle with other leaves of the ever-rolling sea of treetops, at thefructifying, eternal breath of life. Well, hope lies there, in the dailyreconstruction of the race by the new blood which comes from without.Each marriage brings other elements, good or bad, of which the effectis, however, to prevent certain and progressive regeneration.Breaches are repaired, faults effaced, an equilibrium is inevitablyre-established at the end of a few generations, and it is the averageman that always results; vague humanity, obstinately pursuing itsmysterious labor, marching toward its unknown end."He paused, and heaved a deep sigh."Ah! our family, what is it going to become; in what being will itfinally end?"He continued, not now taking into account the survivors whom he had justnamed; having classified these, he knew what they were capable of, buthe was full of keen curiosity regarding the children who werestill infants. He had written to a _confrere_ in Noumea for preciseinformation regarding the wife whom Etienne had lately married there,and the child which she had had, but he had heard nothing, and he fearedgreatly that on that side the tree would remain incomplete. He was morefully furnished with documents regarding the two children of OctaveMouret, with whom he continued to correspond; the little girl wasgrowing up puny and delicate, while the little boy, who stronglyresembled his mother, had developed superbly, and was perfectly healthy.His strongest hope, besides these, was in Jean's children, the eldest ofwhom was a magnificent boy, full of the youthful vigor of the races thatgo back to the soil to regenerate themselves. Pascal occasionally wentto Valqueyras, and he returned happy from that fertile spot, where thefather, quiet and rational, was always at his plow, the mother cheerfuland simple, with her vigorous frame, capable of bearing a world. Whoknew what sound branch was to spring from that side? Perhaps the wiseand puissant of the future were to germinate there. The worst of it, forthe beauty of his tree, was that all these little boys and girls werestill so young that he could not classify them. And his voice grewtender as he spoke of this hope of the future, these fair-hairedchildren, in the unavowed regret for his celibacy.Still contemplating the tree spread out before him, he cried:"And yet it is complete, it is decisive. Look! I repeat to you that allhereditary cases are to be found there. To establish my theory, Ihad only to base it on the collection of these facts. And indeed, themarvelous thing is that there you can put your finger on the causewhy creatures born of the same stock can appear radically different,although they are only logical modifications of common ancestors. Thetrunk explains the branches, and these explain the leaves. In yourfather Saccard and your Uncle Eugene Rougon, so different in theirtemperaments and their lives, it is the same impulse which made theinordinate appetites of the one and the towering ambition of the other.Angelique, that pure lily, is born from the disreputable Sidonie, in therapture which makes mystics or lovers, according to the environment. Thethree children of the Mourets are born of the same breath which makes ofthe clever Octave the dry goods merchant, a millionaire; of the devoutSerge, a poor country priest; of the imbecile Desiree, a beautiful andhappy girl. But the example is still more striking in the children ofGervaise; the neurosis passes down, and Nana sells herself; Etienne isa rebel; Jacques, a murderer; Claude, a genius; while Pauline, theircousin german, near by, is victorious virtue--virtue which strugglesand immolates itself. It is heredity, life itself which makes imbeciles,madmen, criminals and great men. Cells abort, others take their place,and we have a scoundrel or a madman instead of a man of genius, orsimply an honest man. And humanity rolls on, bearing everything on itstide."Then in a new shifting of his thought, growing still more animated, hecontinued:"And animals--the beast that suffers and that loves, which is the roughsketch, as it were, of man--all the animals our brothers, that live ourlife, yes, I would have put them in the ark, I would give them a placeamong our family, show them continually mingling with us, completing ourexistence. I have known cats whose presence was the mysterious charm ofthe household; dogs that were adored, whose death was mourned, and leftin the heart an inconsolable grief. I have known goats, cows, and assesof very great importance, and whose personality played such a part thattheir history ought to be written. And there is our Bonhomme, our poorold horse, that has served us for a quarter of a century. Do you notthink that he has mingled his life with ours, and that henceforth heis one of the family? We have modified him, as he has influenced us alittle; we shall end by being made in the same image, and this is sotrue that now, when I see him, half blind, with wandering gaze, his legsstiff with rheumatism, I kiss him on both cheeks as if he were a poorold relation who had fallen to my charge. Ah, animals, all creeping andcrawling things, all creatures that lament, below man, how large a placein our sympathies it would be necessary to give them in a history oflife!"This was a last cry in which Pascal gave utterance to his passionatetenderness for all created beings. He had gradually become more and moreexcited, and had so come to make this confession of his faith in thecontinuous and victorious work of animated nature. And Clotilde, whothus far had not spoken, pale from the catastrophe in which her planshad ended, at last opened her lips to ask:"Well, master, and what am I here?"She placed one of her slender fingers on the leaf of the tree onwhich she saw her name written. He had always passed this leaf by. Sheinsisted."Yes, I; what am I? Why have you not read me my envelope?"For a moment he remained silent, as if surprised at the question."Why? For no reason. It is true, I have nothing to conceal from you.You see what is written here? 'Clotilde, born in 1847. Selection of themother. Reversional heredity, with moral and physical predominanceof the maternal grandfather.' Nothing can be clearer. Your mother haspredominated in you; you have her fine intelligence, and you havealso something of her coquetry, at times of her indolence and of hersubmissiveness. Yes, you are very feminine, like her. Without your beingaware of it, I would say that you love to be loved. Besides, your motherwas a great novel reader, an imaginative being who loved to spend wholedays dreaming over a book; she doted on nursery tales, had her fortunetold by cards, consulted clairvoyants; and I have always thought thatyour concern about spiritual matters, your anxiety about the unknown,came from that source. But what completed your character by giving you adual nature, was the influence of your grandfather, Commandant Sicardot.I knew him; he was not a genius, but he had at least a great dealof uprightness and energy. Frankly, if it were not for him, I do notbelieve that you would be worth much, for the other influencesare hardly good. He has given you the best part of your nature,combativeness, pride, and frankness."She had listened to him with attention. She nodded slightly, to signifythat it was indeed so, that she was not offended, although her lipstrembled visibly at these new details regarding her people and hermother."Well," she resumed, "and you, master?"This time he did not hesitate."Oh, I!" he cried, "what is the use of speaking of me? I do not belongto the family. You see what is written here. 'Pascal, born in 1813.Individual variation. Combination in which the physical and moralcharacters of the parents are blended, without any of their traitsseeming to appear in the new being.' My mother has told me often enoughthat I did not belong to it, that in truth she did not know where Icould have come from."Those words came from him like a cry of relief, of involuntary joy."And the people make no mistake in the matter. Have you ever heardme called Pascal Rougon in the town? No; people always say simply Dr.Pascal. It is because I stand apart. And it may not be very affectionateto feel so, but I am delighted at it, for there are in truthinheritances too heavy to bear. It is of no use that I love them all.My heart beats none the less joyously when I feel myself another being,different from them, without any community with them. Not to be of them,my God! not to be of them! It is a breath of pure air; it is whatgives me the courage to have them all here, to put them, in all theirnakedness, in their envelopes, and still to find the courage to live!"He stopped, and there was silence for a time. The rain had ceased, thestorm was passing away, the thunderclaps sounded more and more distant,while from the refreshed fields, still dark, there came in through theopen window a delicious odor of moist earth. In the calm air the candleswere burning out with a tall, tranquil flame."Ah!" said Clotilde simply, with a gesture of discouragement, "what arewe to become finally?"She had declared it to herself one night, in the threshing yard; lifewas horrible, how could one live peaceful and happy? It was a terriblelight that science threw on the world. Analysis searched every woundof humanity, in order to expose its horror. And now he had spoken stillmore bluntly; he had increased the disgust which she had for persons andthings, pitilessly dissecting her family. The muddy torrent had rolledon before her for nearly three hours, and she had heard the mostdreadful revelations, the harsh and terrible truth about her people, herpeople who were so dear to her, whom it was her duty to love; her fathergrown powerful through pecuniary crimes; her brother dissolute; hergrandmother unscrupulous, covered with the blood of the just; theothers almost all tainted, drunkards, ruffians, murderers, the monstrousblossoming of the human tree.The blow had been so rude that she could not yet recover from it,stunned as she was by the revelation of her whole family history,made to her in this way at a stroke. And yet the lesson was renderedinnocuous, so to say, by something great and good, a breath of profoundhumanity which had borne her through it. Nothing bad had come to herfrom it. She felt herself beaten by a sharp sea wind, the storm windwhich strengthens and expands the lungs. He had revealed everything,speaking freely even of his mother, without judging her, continuing topreserve toward her his deferential attitude, as a scientist who doesnot judge events. To tell everything in order to know everything, inorder to remedy everything, was not this the cry which he had uttered onthat beautiful summer night?And by the very excess of what he had just revealed to her, she remainedshaken, blinded by this too strong light, but understanding him at last,and confessing to herself that he was attempting in this an immensework. In spite of everything, it was a cry of health, of hope in thefuture. He spoke as a benefactor who, since heredity made the world,wished to fix its laws, in order to control it, and to make a new andhappy world. Was there then only mud in this overflowing stream, whosesluices he had opened? How much gold had passed, mingled with the grassand the flowers on its borders? Hundreds of beings were still flyingswiftly before her, and she was haunted by good and charming faces,delicate girlish profiles, by the serene beauty of women. All passionbled there, hearts swelled with every tender rapture. They werenumerous, the Jeannes, the Angeliques, the Paulines, the Marthes, theGervaises, the Helenes. They and others, even those who were least good,even terrible men, the worst of the band, showed a brotherhood withhumanity.And it was precisely this breath which she had felt pass, this broadcurrent of sympathy, that he had introduced naturally into his exactscientific lesson. He did not seem to be moved; he preserved theimpersonal and correct attitude of the demonstrator, but within himwhat tender suffering, what a fever of devotion, what a giving up ofhis whole being to the happiness of others? His entire work, constructedwith such mathematical precision, was steeped in this fraternalsuffering, even in its most cruel ironies. Had he not just spoken ofthe animals, like an elder brother of the wretched living beings thatsuffer? Suffering exasperated him; his wrath was because of histoo lofty dream, and he had become harsh only in his hatred of thefactitious and the transitory; dreaming of working, not for the politesociety of a time, but for all humanity in the gravest hours of itshistory. Perhaps, even, it was this revolt against the vulgarity of thetime which had made him throw himself, in bold defiance, into theoriesand their application. And the work remained human, overflowing as itwas with an infinite pity for beings and things.Besides, was it not life? There is no absolute evil. Most often a virtuepresents itself side by side with a defect. No man is bad to every one,each man makes the happiness of some one; so that, when one does notview things from a single standpoint only, one recognizes in the endthe utility of every human being. Those who believe in God should sayto themselves that if their God does not strike the wicked dead, it isbecause he sees his work in its totality, and that he cannot descendto the individual. Labor ends to begin anew; the living, as a whole,continue, in spite of everything, admirable in their courage and theirindustry; and love of life prevails over all.This giant labor of men, this obstinacy in living, is their excuse,is redemption. And then, from a great height the eye saw only thiscontinual struggle, and a great deal of good, in spite of everything,even though there might be a great deal of evil. One shared the generalindulgence, one pardoned, one had only an infinite pity and an ardentcharity. The haven was surely there, waiting those who have lost faithin dogmas, who wish to understand the meaning of their lives, in themidst of the apparent iniquity of the world. One must live for theeffort of living, for the stone to be carried to the distant and unknownwork, and the only possible peace in the world is in the joy of makingthis effort.Another hour passed; the entire night had flown by in this terriblelesson of life, without either Pascal or Clotilde being conscious ofwhere they were, or of the flight of time. And he, overworked for sometime past, and worn out by the life of suspicion and sadness which hehad been leading, started nervously, as if he had suddenly awakened."Come, you know all; do you feel your heart strong, tempered by thetruth, full of pardon and of hope? Are you with me?"But, still stunned by the frightful moral shock which she had received,she too, started, bewildered. Her old beliefs had been so completelyoverthrown, so many new ideas were awakening within her, that she didnot dare to question herself, in order to find an answer. She feltherself seized and carried away by the omnipotence of truth. She enduredit without being convinced."Master," she stammered, "master--"And they remained for a moment face to face, looking at each other. Daywas breaking, a dawn of exquisite purity, far off in the vast, clearsky, washed by the storm. Not a cloud now stained the pale azure tingedwith rose color. All the cheerful sounds of awakening life in therain-drenched fields came in through the window, while the candles,burned down to the socket, paled in the growing light."Answer; are you with me, altogether with me?"For a moment he thought she was going to throw herself on his neck andburst into tears. A sudden impulse seemed to impel her. But they saweach other in their semi-nudity. She, who had not noticed it before, wasnow conscious that she was only half dressed, that her arms were bare,her shoulders bare, covered only by the scattered locks of her unboundhair, and on her right shoulder, near the armpit, on lowering her eyes,she perceived again the few drops of blood of the bruise which he hadgiven her, when he had grasped her roughly, in struggling to master her.Then an extraordinary confusion took possession of her, a certainty thatshe was going to be vanquished, as if by this grasp he had become hermaster, and forever. This sensation was prolonged; she was seized anddrawn on, without the consent of her will, by an irresistible impulse tosubmit.Abruptly Clotilde straightened herself, struggling with herself, wishingto reflect and to recover herself. She pressed her bare arms againsther naked throat. All the blood in her body rushed to her skin in a rosyblush of shame. Then, in her divine and slender grace, she turned toflee."Master, master, let me go--I will see--"With the swiftness of alarmed maidenhood, she took refuge in herchamber, as she had done once before. He heard her lock the doorhastily, with a double turn of the key. He remained alone, and he askedhimself suddenly, seized by infinite discouragement and sadness, if hehad done right in speaking, if the truth would germinate in this dearand adored creature, and bear one day a harvest of happiness.VI.The days wore on. October began with magnificent weather--a sultryautumn in which the fervid heat of summer was prolonged, with acloudless sky. Then the weather changed, fierce winds began to blow, anda last storm channeled gullies in the hillsides. And to the melancholyhousehold at La Souleiade the approach of winter seemed to have broughtan infinite sadness.It was a new hell. There were no more violent quarrels between Pascaland Clotilde. The doors were no longer slammed. Voices raised in disputeno longer obliged Martine to go continually upstairs to listen outsidethe door. They scarcely spoke to each other now; and not a single wordhad been exchanged between them regarding the midnight scene, althoughweeks had passed since it had taken place. He, through an inexplicablescruple, a strange delicacy of which he was not himself conscious, didnot wish to renew the conversation, and to demand the answer which heexpected--a promise of faith in him and of submission. She, after thegreat moral shock which had completely transformed her, still reflected,hesitated, struggled, fighting against herself, putting off her decisionin order not to surrender, in her instinctive rebelliousness. And themisunderstanding continued, in the midst of the mournful silence of themiserable house, where there was no longer any happiness.During all this time Pascal suffered terribly, without making anycomplaint. He had sunk into a dull distrust, imagining that he was stillbeing watched, and that if they seemed to leave him at peace it wasonly in order to concoct in secret the darkest plots. His uneasinessincreased, even, and he expected every day some catastrophe tohappen--the earth suddenly to open and swallow up his papers, LaSouleiade itself to be razed to the ground, carried away bodily,scattered to the winds.The persecution against his thought, against his moral and intellectuallife, in thus hiding itself, and so rendering him helpless to defendhimself, became so intolerable to him that he went to bed every night ina fever. He would often start and turn round suddenly, thinking hewas going to surprise the enemy behind him engaged in some piece oftreachery, to find nothing there but the shadow of his own fears. Atother times, seized by some suspicion, he would remain on the watchfor hours together, hidden, behind his blinds, or lying in wait ina passage; but not a soul stirred, he heard nothing but the violentbeating of his heart. His fears kept him in a state of constantagitation; he never went to bed at night without visiting every room;he no longer slept, or, if he did, he would waken with a start at theslightest noise, ready to defend himself.And what still further aggravated Pascal's sufferings was the constant,the ever more bitter thought that the wound was inflicted upon him bythe only creature he loved in the world, the adored Clotilde, whom fortwenty years he had seen grow in beauty and in grace, whose life hadhitherto bloomed like a beautiful flower, perfuming his. She, great God!for whom his heart was full of affection, whom he had never analyzed,she, who had become his joy, his courage, his hope, in whose young lifehe lived over again. When she passed by, with her delicate neck, soround, so fresh, he was invigorated, bathed in health and joy, as at thecoming of spring.His whole life, besides, explained this invasion, this subjugation ofhis being by the young girl who had entered into his heart while shewas still a little child, and who, as she grew up, had gradually takenpossession of the whole place. Since he had settled at Plassans, he hadled a blest existence, wrapped up in his books, far from women. The onlypassion he was ever known to have had, was his love for the lady who haddied, whose finger tips he had never kissed. He had not lived; he hadwithin him a reserve of youthfulness, of vigor, whose surging flood nowclamored rebelliously at the menace of approaching age. He would havebecome attached to an animal, a stray dog that he had chanced to pick upin the street, and that had licked his hand. And it was this child whomhe loved, all at once become an adorable woman, who now distracted him,who tortured him by her hostility.Pascal, so gay, so kind, now became insupportably gloomy and harsh. Hegrew angry at the slightest word; he would push aside the astonishedMartine, who would look up at him with the submissive eyes of a beatenanimal. From morning till night he went about the gloomy house, carryinghis misery about with him, with so forbidding a countenance that no oneventured to speak to him.He never took Clotilde with him now on his visits, but went alone. Andthus it was that he returned home one afternoon, his mind distractedbecause of an accident which had happened; having on his conscience, asa physician, the death of a man.He had gone to give a hypodermic injection to Lafouasse, the tavernkeeper, whose ataxia had within a short time made such rapid progressthat he regarded him as doomed. But, notwithstanding, Pascal stillfought obstinately against the disease, continuing the treatment, and asill luck would have it, on this day the little syringe had caught up atthe bottom of the vial an impure particle, which had escaped the filter.Immediately a drop of blood appeared; to complete his misfortune, he hadpunctured a vein. He was at once alarmed, seeing the tavern keeper turnpale and gasp for breath, while large drops of cold perspiration brokeout upon his face. Then he understood; death came as if by a stroke oflightning, the lips turning blue, the face black. It was an embolism;he had nothing to blame but the insufficiency of his preparations, hisstill rude method. No doubt Lafouasse had been doomed. He couldnot, perhaps, have lived six months longer, and that in the midst ofatrocious sufferings, but the brutal fact of this terrible death wasnone the less there, and what despairing regret, what rage againstimpotent and murderous science, and what a shock to his faith! Hereturned home, livid, and did not make his appearance again until thefollowing day, after having remained sixteen hours shut up in his room,lying in a semi-stupor on the bed, across which he had thrown himself,dressed as he was.On the afternoon of this day Clotilde, who was sitting beside him in thestudy, sewing, ventured to break the oppressive silence. She looked up,and saw him turning over the leaves of a book wearily, searching forsome information which he was unable to find."Master, are you ill? Why do you not tell me, if you are. I would takecare of you."He kept his eyes bent upon the book, and muttered:"What does it matter to you whether I am ill or not? I need no one totake care of me."She resumed, in a conciliating voice:"If you have troubles, and can tell them to me, it would perhaps be arelief to you to do so. Yesterday you came in looking so sad. You mustnot allow yourself to be cast down in that way. I have spent a veryanxious night. I came to your door three times to listen, tormented bythe idea that you were suffering."Gently as she spoke, her words were like the cut of a whip. In his weakand nervous condition a sudden access of rage made him push away thebook and rise up trembling."So you spy upon me, then. I cannot even retire to my room withoutpeople coming to glue their ears to the walls. Yes, you listen even tothe beatings of my heart. You watch for my death, to pillage and burneverything here."His voice rose and all his unjust suffering vented itself in complaintsand threats."I forbid you to occupy yourself about me. Is there nothing else thatyou have to say to me? Have you reflected? Can you put your hand in mineloyally, and say to me that we are in accord?"She did not answer. She only continued to look at him with her largeclear eyes, frankly declaring that she would not surrender yet, whilehe, exasperated more and more by this attitude, lost all self-control."Go away, go away," he stammered, pointing to the door. "I do not wishyou to remain near me. I do not wish to have enemies near me. I do notwish you to remain near me to drive me mad!"She rose, very pale, and went at once out of the room, without lookingbehind, carrying her work with her.During the month which followed, Pascal took refuge in furious andincessant work. He now remained obstinately, for whole days at a time,alone in the study, sometimes passing even the nights there, going overold documents, to revise all his works on heredity. It seemed as if asort of frenzy had seized him to assure himself of the legitimacy of hishopes, to force science to give him the certainty that humanity could beremade--made a higher, a healthy humanity. He no longer left the house,he abandoned his patients even, and lived among his papers, without airor exercise. And after a month of this overwork, which exhausted himwithout appeasing his domestic torments, he fell into such a state ofnervous exhaustion that illness, for some time latent, declared itselfat last with alarming violence.Pascal, when he rose in the morning, felt worn out with fatigue, wearierand less refreshed than he had been on going to bed the night before. Heconstantly had pains all over his body; his limbs failed him, afterfive minutes' walk; the slightest exertion tired him; the least movementcaused him intense pain. At times the floor seemed suddenly to swaybeneath his feet. He had a constant buzzing in his ears, flashes oflight dazzled his eyes. He took a loathing for wine, he had no longerany appetite, and his digestion was seriously impaired. Then, in themidst of the apathy of his constantly increasing idleness he would havesudden fits of aimless activity. The equilibrium was destroyed, hehad at times outbreaks of nervous irritability, without any cause. Theslightest emotion brought tears to his eyes. Finally, he would shuthimself up in his room, and give way to paroxysms of despair so violentthat he would sob for hours at a time, without any immediate cause ofgrief, overwhelmed simply by the immense sadness of things.In the early part of December Pascal had a severe attack of neuralgia.Violent pains in the bones of the skull made him feel at times as if hishead must split. Old Mme. Rougon, who had been informed of his illness,came to inquire after her son. But she went straight to the kitchen,wishing to have a talk with Martine first. The latter, with aheart-broken and terrified air, said to her that monsieur must certainlybe going mad; and she told her of his singular behavior, the continualtramping about in his room, the locking of all the drawers, the roundswhich he made from the top to the bottom of the house, until two o'clockin the morning. Tears filled her eyes and she at last hazarded theopinion that monsieur must be possessed with a devil, and that it wouldbe well to notify the cure of St. Saturnin."So good a man," she said, "a man for whom one would let one's self becut in pieces! How unfortunate it is that one cannot get him to go tochurch, for that would certainly cure him at once."Clotilde, who had heard her grandmother's voice, entered at this moment.She, too, wandered through the empty rooms, spending most of her time inthe deserted apartment on the ground floor. She did not speak, however,but only listened with her thoughtful and expectant air."Ah, goodday! It is you, my dear. Martine tells me that Pascal ispossessed with a devil. That is indeed my opinion also; only the devilis called pride. He thinks that he knows everything. He is Pope andEmperor in one, and naturally it exasperates him when people don't agreewith him."She shrugged her shoulders with supreme disdain."As for me, all that would only make me laugh if it were not so sad. Afellow who knows nothing about anything; who has always been wrapped upin his books; who has not lived. Put him in a drawing-room, and he wouldknow as little how to act as a new-born babe. And as for women, he doesnot even know what they are."Forgetting to whom she was speaking, a young girl and a servant, shelowered her voice, and said confidentially:"Well, one pays for being too sensible, too. Neither a wife nor asweetheart nor anything. That is what has finally turned his brain."Clotilde did not move. She only lowered her eyelids slowly over herlarge thoughtful eyes; then she raised them again, maintaining herimpenetrable countenance, unwilling, unable, perhaps, to give expressionto what was passing within her. This was no doubt all still confused, acomplete evolution, a great change which was taking place, and which sheherself did not clearly understand."He is upstairs, is he not?" resumed Felicite. "I have come to see him,for this must end; it is too stupid."And she went upstairs, while Martine returned to her saucepans, andClotilde went to wander again through the empty house.Upstairs in the study Pascal sat seemingly in a stupor, his face bentover a large open book. He could no longer read, the words danced beforehis eyes, conveying no meaning to his mind. But he persisted, for itwas death to him to lose his faculty for work, hitherto so powerful.His mother at once began to scold him, snatching the book from him,and flinging it upon a distant table, crying that when one was sick oneshould take care of one's self. He rose with a quick, angry movement,about to order her away as he had ordered Clotilde. Then, by a lasteffort of the will, he became again deferential."Mother, you know that I have never wished to dispute with you. Leaveme, I beg of you."She did not heed him, but began instead to take him to task about hiscontinual distrust. It was he himself who had given himself a fever,always fancying that he was surrounded by enemies who were setting trapsfor him, and watching him to rob him. Was there any common sense inimagining that people were persecuting him in that way? And then sheaccused him of allowing his head to be turned by his discovery, hisfamous remedy for curing every disease. That was as much as to thinkhimself equal to the good God; which only made it all the more cruelwhen he found out how mistaken he was. And she mentioned Lafouasse, theman whom he had killed--naturally, she could understand that that hadnot been very pleasant for him; indeed there was cause enough in it tomake him take to his bed.Pascal, still controlling himself, very pale and with eyes cast on theground, contented himself with repeating:"Mother, leave me, I beg of you.""No, I won't leave you," she cried with the impetuosity which wasnatural to her, and which her great age had in no wise diminished. "Ihave come precisely to stir you up a little, to rid you of this feverwhich is consuming you. No, this cannot continue. I don't wish that weshould again become the talk of the whole town on your account. I wishyou to take care of yourself."He shrugged his shoulders, and said in a low voice, as if speaking tohimself, with an uneasy look, half of conviction, half of doubt:"I am not ill."But Felicite, beside herself, burst out, gesticulating violently:"Not ill! not ill! Truly, there is no one like a physician for not beingable to see himself. Why, my poor boy, every one that comes near you isshocked by your appearance. You are becoming insane through pride andfear!"This time Pascal raised his head quickly, and looked her straight in theeyes, while she continued:"This is what I had to tell you, since it seems that no one else wouldundertake the task. You are old enough to know what you ought to do.You should make an effort to shake off all this; you should think ofsomething else; you should not let a fixed idea take possession of you,especially when you belong to a family like ours. You know it; havesense, and take care of yourself."He grew paler than before, looking fixedly at her still, as if he weresounding her, to know what there was of her in him. And he contentedhimself with answering:"You are right, mother. I thank you."When he was again alone, he dropped into his seat before the table, andtried once more to read his book. But he could not succeed, any morethan before, in fixing his attention sufficiently to understand thewords, whose letters mingled confusedly together before his eyes. Andhis mother's words buzzed in his ears; a vague terror, which had sometime before sprung up within him, grew and took shape, haunting him nowas an immediate and clearly defined danger. He who two months beforehad boasted triumphantly of not belonging to the family, was he aboutto receive the most terrible of contradictions? Ah, this egotistic joy,this intense joy of not belonging to it, was it to give place tothe terrible anguish of being struck in his turn? Was he to have thehumiliation of seeing the taint revive in him? Was he to be draggeddown to the horror of feeling himself in the clutches of the monsterof heredity? The sublime idea, the lofty certitude which he had ofabolishing suffering, of strengthening man's will, of making a new and ahigher humanity, a healthy humanity, was assuredly only the beginning ofthe monomania of vanity. And in his bitter complaint of being watched,in his desire to watch the enemies who, he thought, were obstinatelybent on his destruction, were easily to be recognized the symptoms ofthe monomania of suspicion. So then all the diseases of the race wereto end in this terrible case--madness within a brief space, then generalparalysis, and a dreadful death.From this day forth Pascal was as if possessed. The state of nervousexhaustion into which overwork and anxiety had thrown him left him anunresisting prey to this haunting fear of madness and death. All themorbid sensations which he felt, his excessive fatigue on rising, thebuzzing in his ears, the flashes of light before his eyes, evenhis attacks of indigestion and his paroxysms of tears, were so manyinfallible symptoms of the near insanity with which he believed himselfthreatened. He had completely lost, in his own case, the keen powerof diagnosis of the observant physician, and if he still continued toreason about it, it was only to confound and pervert symptoms, under theinfluence of the moral and physical depression into which he had fallen.He was no longer master of himself; he was mad, so to say, to convincehimself hour by hour that he must become so.All the days of this pale December were spent by him in going deeperand deeper into his malady. Every morning he tried to escape from thehaunting subject, but he invariably ended by shutting himself in thestudy to take up again, in spite of himself, the tangled skein of theday before.The long study which he had made of heredity, his important researches,his works, completed the poisoning of his peace, furnishing him withever renewed causes of disquietude. To the question which he put tohimself continually as to his own hereditary case, the documents werethere to answer it by all possible combinations. They were so numerousthat he lost himself among them now. If he had deceived himself, if hecould not set himself apart, as a remarkable case of variation, shouldhe place himself under the head of reversional heredity, passingover one, two, or even three generations? Or was his case rather amanifestation of larvated heredity, which would bring anew proof to thesupport of his theory of the germ plasm, or was it simply a singularcase of hereditary resemblance, the sudden apparition of some unknownancestor at the very decline of life?From this moment he never rested, giving himself up completely to theinvestigation of his case, searching his notes, rereading his books. Andhe studied himself, watching the least of his sensations, to deduce fromthem the facts on which he might judge himself. On the days when hismind was most sluggish, or when he thought he experienced particularphenomena of vision, he inclined to a predominance of the originalnervous lesion; while, if he felt that his limbs were affected, his feetheavy and painful, he imagined he was suffering the indirect influenceof some ancestor come from outside. Everything became confused, until atlast he could recognize himself no longer, in the midst of the imaginarytroubles which agitated his disturbed organism. And every evening theconclusion was the same, the same knell sounded in his brain--heredity,appalling heredity, the fear of becoming mad.In the early part of January Clotilde was an involuntary spectator of ascene which wrung her heart. She was sitting before one of the windowsof the study, reading, concealed by the high back of her chair, whenshe saw Pascal, who had been shut up in his room since the day before,entering. He held open before his eyes with both hands a sheet ofyellow paper, in which she recognized the genealogical tree. He was socompletely absorbed, his gaze was so fixed, that she might have comeforward without his observing her. He spread the tree upon the table,continuing to look at it for a long time, with the terrified expressionof interrogation which had become habitual to him, which graduallychanged to one of supplication, the tears coursing down his cheeks.Why, great God! would not the tree answer him, and tell him whatancestor he resembled, in order that he might inscribe his case on hisown leaf, beside the others? If he was to become mad, why did not thetree tell him so clearly, which would have calmed him, for he believedthat his suffering came only from his uncertainty? Tears clouded hisvision, yet still he looked, he exhausted himself in this longing toknow, in which his reason must finally give way.Clotilde hastily concealed herself as she saw him walk over to thepress, which he opened wide. He seized the envelopes, threw them onthe table, and searched among them feverishly. It was the scene of theterrible night of the storm that was beginning over again, the gallopof nightmares, the procession of phantoms, rising at his call from thisheap of old papers. As they passed by, he addressed to each of them aquestion, an ardent prayer, demanding the origin of his malady, hopingfor a word, a whisper which should set his doubts at rest. First, it wasonly an indistinct murmur, then came words and fragments of phrases."Is it you--is it you--is it you--oh, old mother, the mother of usall--who are to give me your madness? Is it you, inebriate uncle, oldscoundrel of an uncle, whose drunkenness I am to pay for? Is it you,ataxic nephew, or you, mystic nephew, or yet you, idiot niece, who areto reveal to me the truth, showing me one of the forms of the lesionfrom which I suffer? Or is it rather you, second cousin, who hangedyourself; or you, second cousin, who committed murder; or you, secondcousin, who died of rottenness, whose tragic ends announce to memine--death in a cell, the horrible decomposition of being?"And the gallop continued, they rose and passed by with the speed of thewind. The papers became animate, incarnate, they jostled one another,they trampled on one another, in a wild rush of suffering humanity."Ah, who will tell me, who will tell me, who will tell me?--Is it hewho died mad? he who was carried off by phthisis? he who was killedby paralysis? she whose constitutional feebleness caused her to diein early youth?--Whose is the poison of which I am to die? What is it,hysteria, alcoholism, tuberculosis, scrofula? And what is it going tomake of me, an ataxic or a madman? A madman. Who was it said a madman?They all say it--a madman, a madman, a madman!"Sobs choked Pascal. He let his dejected head fall among the papers, hewept endlessly, shaken by shuddering sobs. And Clotilde, seized by asort of awe, feeling the presence of the fate which rules over races,left the room softly, holding her breath; for she knew that it wouldmortify him exceedingly if he knew that she had been present.Long periods of prostration followed. January was very cold. But the skyremained wonderfully clear, a brilliant sun shone in the limpid blue;and at La Souleiade, the windows of the study facing south formed a sortof hothouse, preserving there a delightfully mild temperature. They didnot even light a fire, for the room was always filled with a flood ofsunshine, in which the flies that had survived the winter flew aboutlazily. The only sound to be heard was the buzzing of their wings. Itwas a close and drowsy warmth, like a breath of spring that had lingeredin the old house baked by the heat of summer.Pascal, still gloomy, dragged through the days there, and it was there,too, that he overheard one day the closing words of a conversationwhich aggravated his suffering. As he never left his room now beforebreakfast, Clotilde had received Dr. Ramond this morning in the study,and they were talking there together in an undertone, sitting besideeach other in the bright sunshine.It was the third visit which Ramond had made during the last week.Personal reasons, the necessity, especially, of establishing definitelyhis position as a physician at Plassans, made it expedient for him notto defer his marriage much longer: and he wished to obtain from Clotildea decisive answer. On each of his former visits the presence of a thirdperson had prevented him from speaking. As he desired to receive heranswer from herself directly he had resolved to declare himself to herin a frank conversation. Their intimate friendship, and the discretionand good sense of both, justified him in taking this step. And he ended,smiling, looking into her eyes:"I assure you, Clotilde, that it is the most reasonable of_denouements_. You know that I have loved you for a long time. I have aprofound affection and esteem for you. That alone might perhaps not besufficient, but, in addition, we understand each other perfectly, and weshould be very happy together, I am convinced of it."She did not cast down her eyes; she, too, looked at him frankly, with afriendly smile. He was, in truth, very handsome, in his vigorous youngmanhood."Why do you not marry Mlle. Leveque, the lawyer's daughter?" she asked."She is prettier and richer than I am, and I know that she would gladlyaccept you. My dear friend, I fear that you are committing a folly inchoosing me."He did not grow impatient, seeming still convinced of the wisdom of hisdetermination."But I do not love Mlle. Leveque, and I do love you. Besides, I haveconsidered everything, and I repeat that I know very well what I amabout. Say yes; you can take no better course."Then she grew very serious, and a shadow passed over her face, theshadow of those reflections, of those almost unconscious inwardstruggles, which kept her silent for days at a time. She did not seeclearly yet, she still struggled against herself, and she wished towait."Well, my friend, since you are really serious, do not ask me to giveyou an answer to-day; grant me a few weeks longer. Master is indeed veryill. I am greatly troubled about him; and you would not like to owe myconsent to a hasty impulse. I assure you, for my part, that I have agreat deal of affection for you, but it would be wrong to decide at thismoment; the house is too unhappy. It is agreed, is it not? I will notmake you wait long."And to change the conversation she added:"Yes, I am uneasy about master. I wished to see you, in order to tellyou so. The other day I surprised him weeping violently, and I amcertain the fear of becoming mad haunts him. The day before yesterday,when you were talking to him, I saw that you were examining him. Tell mefrankly, what do you think of his condition? Is he in any danger?""Not the slightest!" exclaimed Dr. Ramond. "His system is a little outof order, that is all. How can a man of his ability, who has made soclose a study of nervous diseases, deceive himself to such an extent? Itis discouraging, indeed, if the clearest and most vigorous minds can goso far astray. In his case his own discovery of hypodermic injectionswould be excellent. Why does he not use them with himself?"And as the young girl replied, with a despairing gesture, that he wouldnot listen to her, that he would not even allow her to speak to him now,Ramond said:"Well, then, I will speak to him."It was at this moment that Pascal came out of his room, attracted bythe sound of voices. But on seeing them both so close to each other,so animated, so youthful, and so handsome in the sunshine--clothed withsunshine, as it were--he stood still in the doorway. He looked fixedlyat them, and his pale face altered.Ramond had a moment before taken Clotilde's hand, and he was holding itin his."It is a promise, is it not? I should like the marriage to take placethis summer. You know how much I love you, and I shall eagerly awaityour answer.""Very well," she answered. "Before a month all will be settled."A sudden giddiness made Pascal stagger. Here now was this boy, hisfriend, his pupil, who had introduced himself into his house to rob himof his treasure! He ought to have expected this _denouement_, yet thesudden news of a possible marriage surprised him, overwhelmed him likean unforeseen catastrophe that had forever ruined his life. This girlwhom he had fashioned, whom he had believed his own, she would leavehim, then, without regret, she would leave him to die alone in hissolitude. Only the day before she had made him suffer so intensely thathe had asked himself whether he should not part from her and send her toher brother, who was always writing for her. For an instant he had evendecided on this separation, for the good of both. Yet to find her heresuddenly, with this man, to hear her promise to give him an answer, tothink that she would marry, that she would soon leave him, this stabbedhim to the heart.At the sound of his heavy step as he came forward, the two young peopleturned round in some embarrassment."Why, master, we were just talking about you," said Ramond gaily. "Yes,to be frank with you, we were conspiring. Come, why do you not take careof yourself? There is nothing serious the matter with you; you would beon your feet again in a fortnight if you did."Pascal, who had dropped into a chair, continued to look at them. He hadstill the power to control himself, and his countenance gave no evidenceof the wound which he had just received. He would assuredly die of it,and no one would suspect the malady which had carried him off. But itwas a relief to him to be able to give vent to his feelings, and hedeclared violently that he would not take even so much as a glass oftisane."Take care of myself!" he cried; "what for? Is it not all over with myold carcass?"Ramond insisted, with a good-tempered smile."You are sounder than any of us. This is a trifling disturbance, andyou know that you have the remedy in your own hands. Use your hypodermicinjection."Pascal did not allow him to finish. This filled the measure of his rage.He angrily asked if they wished him to kill himself, as he had killedLafouasse. His injections! A pretty invention, of which he had goodreason to be proud. He abjured medicine, and he swore that he wouldnever again go near a patient. When people were no longer good foranything they ought to die; that would be the best thing for everybody.And that was what he was going to try to do, so as to have done with itall."Bah! bah!" said Ramond at last, resolving to take his leave, throughfear of exciting him still further; "I will leave you with Clotilde; Iam not at all uneasy, Clotilde will take care of you."But Pascal had on this morning received the final blow. He took to hisbed toward evening, and remained for two whole days without openingthe door of his room. It was in vain that Clotilde, at last becomingalarmed, knocked loudly at the door. There was no answer. Martine wentin her turn and begged monsieur, through the keyhole, at least to tellher if he needed anything. A deathlike silence reigned; the room seemedto be empty.Then, on the morning of the third day, as the young girl by chanceturned the knob, the door yielded; perhaps it had been unlocked forhours. And she might enter freely this room in which she had never setfoot: a large room, rendered cold by its northern exposure, in which shesaw a small iron bed without curtains, a shower bath in a corner, a longblack wooden table, a few chairs, and on the table, on the floor, alongthe walls, an array of chemical apparatus, mortars, furnaces, machines,instrument cases. Pascal, up and dressed, was sitting on the edge of hisbed, in trying to arrange which he had exhausted himself."Don't you want me to nurse you, then?" she asked with anxioustenderness, without venturing to advance into the room."Oh, you can come in," he said with a dejected gesture. "I won't beatyou. I have not the strength to do that now."And from this day on he tolerated her about him, and allowed her to waiton him. But he had caprices still. He would not let her enter the roomwhen he was in bed, possessed by a sort of morbid shame; then he madeher send him Martine. But he seldom remained in bed, dragging himselfabout from chair to chair, in his utter inability to do any kind ofwork. His malady continued to grow worse, until at last he was reducedto utter despair, tortured by sick headaches, and without the strength,as he said, to put one foot before the other, convinced every morningthat he would spend the night at the Tulettes, a raving maniac. He grewthin; his face, under its crown of white hair--which he still caredfor through a last remnant of vanity--acquired a look of suffering,of tragic beauty. And although he allowed himself to be waited on, herefused roughly all remedies, in the distrust of medicine into which hehad fallen.Clotilde now devoted herself to him entirely. She gave up everythingelse; at first she attended low mass, then she left off going to churchaltogether. In her impatience for some certain happiness, she felt as ifshe were taking a step toward that end by thus devoting all her momentsto the service of a beloved being whom she wished to see once more welland happy. She made a complete sacrifice of herself, she sought tofind happiness in the happiness of another; and all this unconsciously,solely at the impulse of her woman's heart, in the midst of the crisisthrough which she was still passing, and which was modifying hercharacter profoundly, without her knowledge. She remained silentregarding the disagreement which separated them. The idea did not againoccur to her to throw herself on his neck, crying that she was his, thathe might return to life, since she gave herself to him. In her thoughtsshe grieved to see him suffer; she was only an affectionate girl,who took care of him, as any female relative would have done. Andher attentions were very pure, very delicate, occupying her life socompletely that her days now passed swiftly, exempt from tormentingthoughts of the Beyond, filled with the one wish of curing him.But where she had a hard battle to fight was in prevailing upon himto use his hypodermic injections upon himself. He flew into a passion,disowned his discovery, and called himself an imbecile. She too criedout. It was she now who had faith in science, who grew indignant atseeing him doubt his own genius. He resisted for a long time; thenyielding to the empire which she had acquired over him, he consented,simply to avoid the affectionate dispute which she renewed with himevery morning. From the very first he experienced great relief fromthe injections, although he refused to acknowledge it. His mind becameclearer, and he gradually gained strength. Then she was exultant, filledwith enthusiastic pride in him. She vaunted his treatment, and becameindignant because he did not admire himself, as an example of themiracles which he was able to work. He smiled; he was now beginning tosee clearly into his own condition. Ramond had spoken truly, his illnesshad been nothing but nervous exhaustion. Perhaps he would get over itafter all."Ah, it is you who are curing me, little girl," he would say, notwishing to confess his hopes. "Medicines, you see, act according to thehand that gives them."The convalescence was slow, lasting through the whole of February. Theweather remained clear and cold; there was not a single day in whichthe study was not flooded with warm, pale sunshine. There were hoursof relapse, however, hours of the blackest melancholy, in which all thepatient's terrors returned; when his guardian, disconsolate, was obligedto sit at the other end of the room, in order not to irritate him stillmore. He despaired anew of his recovery. He became again bitter andaggressively ironical.It was on one of those bad days that Pascal, approaching a window, sawhis neighbor, M. Bellombre, the retired professor, making the round ofhis garden to see if his fruit trees were well covered with blossoms.The sight of the old man, so neat and so erect, with the fine placidityof the egoist, on whom illness had apparently never laid hold, suddenlyput Pascal beside himself."Ah!" he growled, "there is one who will never overwork himself, whowill never endanger his health by worrying!"And he launched forth into an ironical eulogy on selfishness. To bealone in the world, not to have a friend, to have neither wife norchild, what happiness! That hard-hearted miser, who for forty yearshad had only other people's children to cuff, who lived aloof from theworld, without even a dog, with a deaf and dumb gardener older thanhimself, was he not an example of the greatest happiness possible onearth? Without a responsibility, without a duty, without an anxiety,other than that of taking care of his dear health! He was a wise man, hewould live a hundred years."Ah, the fear of life! that is cowardice which is truly the best wisdom.To think that I should ever have regretted not having a child of my own!Has any one a right to bring miserable creatures into the world? Badheredity should be ended, life should be ended. The only honest man isthat old coward there!"M. Bellombre continued peacefully making the round of his pear trees inthe March sunshine. He did not risk a too hasty movement; he economizedhis fresh old age. If he met a stone in his path, he pushed it asidewith the end of his cane, and then walked tranquilly on."Look at him! Is he not well preserved; is he not handsome? Have not allthe blessings of heaven been showered down upon him? He is the happiestman I know."Clotilde, who had listened in silence, suffered from the irony ofPascal, the full bitterness of which she divined. She, who usually tookM. Bellombre's part, felt a protest rise up within her. Tears came toher eyes, and she answered simply in a low voice:"Yes; but he is not loved."These words put a sudden end to the painful scene. Pascal, as if he hadreceived an electric shock, turned and looked at her. A sudden rush oftenderness brought tears to his eyes also, and he left the room to keepfrom weeping.The days wore on in the midst of these alternations of good and badhours. He recovered his strength but slowly, and what put him in despairwas that whenever he attempted to work he was seized by a profuseperspiration. If he had persisted, he would assuredly have fainted. Solong as he did not work he felt that his convalescence was making littleprogress. He began to take an interest again, however, in his accustomedinvestigations. He read over again the last pages that he had written,and, with this reawakening of the scientist in him, his former anxietiesreturned. At one time he fell into a state of such depression, that thehouse and all it contained ceased to exist for him. He might have beenrobbed, everything he possessed might have been taken and destroyed,without his even being conscious of the disaster. Now he became againwatchful, from time to time he would feel his pocket, to assure himselfthat the key of the press was there.But one morning when he had overslept himself, and did not leavehis room until eleven o'clock, he saw Clotilde in the study, quietlyoccupied in copying with great exactness in pastel a branch of floweringalmond. She looked up, smiling; and taking a key that was lying besideher on the desk, she offered it to him, saying:"Here, master."Surprised, not yet comprehending, he looked at the object which she heldtoward him."What is that?" he asked."It is the key of the press, which you must have dropped from yourpocket yesterday, and which I picked up here this morning."Pascal took it with extraordinary emotion. He looked at it, and then atClotilde. Was it ended, then? She would persecute him no more. She wasno longer eager to rob everything, to burn everything. And seeing herstill smiling, she also looking moved, an immense joy filled his heart.He caught her in his arms, crying:"Ah, little girl, if we might only not be too unhappy!"Then he opened a drawer of his table and threw the key into it, as heused to do formerly.From this time on he gained strength, and his convalescence progressedmore rapidly. Relapses were still possible, for he was still very weak.But he was able to write, and this made the days less heavy. The sun,too, shone more brightly, the study being so warm at times that itbecame necessary to half close the shutters. He refused to see visitors,barely tolerated Martine, and had his mother told that he was sleeping,when she came at long intervals to inquire for him. He was happy only inthis delightful solitude, nursed by the rebel, the enemy of yesterday,the docile pupil of to-day. They would often sit together in silencefor a long time, without feeling any constraint. They meditated, or lostthemselves in infinitely sweet reveries.One day, however, Pascal seemed very grave. He was now convincedthat his illness had resulted from purely accidental causes, and thatheredity had had no part in it. But this filled him none the less withhumility."My God!" he murmured, "how insignificant we are! I who thought myselfso strong, who was so proud of my sane reason! And here have I barelyescaped being made insane by a little trouble and overwork!"He was silent, and sank again into thought. After a time his eyesbrightened, he had conquered himself. And in a moment of reason andcourage, he came to a resolution."If I am getting better," he said, "it is especially for your sake thatI am glad."Clotilde, not understanding, looked up and said:"How is that?""Yes, on account of your marriage. Now you will be able to fix the day."She still seemed surprised."Ah, true--my marriage!""Shall we decide at once upon the second week in June?""Yes, the second week in June; that will do very well."They spoke no more; she fixed her eyes again on the piece of sewing onwhich she was engaged, while he, motionless, and with a grave face, satlooking into space.VII.On this day, on arriving at La Souleiade, old Mme. Rougon perceivedMartine in the kitchen garden, engaged in planting leeks; and, as shesometimes did, she went over to the servant to have a chat with her, andfind out from her how things were going on, before entering the house.For some time past she had been in despair about what she calledClotilde's desertion. She felt truly that she would now never obtainthe documents through her. The girl was behaving disgracefully, she wassiding with Pascal, after all she had done for her; and she was becomingperverted to such a degree that for a month past she had not been seenin Church. Thus she returned to her first idea, to get Clotilde away andwin her son over when, left alone, he should be weakened by solitude.Since she had not been able to persuade the girl to go live with herbrother, she eagerly desired the marriage. She would like to throw herinto Dr. Ramond's arms to-morrow, in her impatience at so many delays.And she had come this afternoon with a feverish desire to hurry onmatters."Good-day, Martine. How is every one here?"The servant, kneeling down, her hands full of clay, lifted up her paleface, protected against the sun by a handkerchief tied over her cap."As usual, madame, pretty well."They went on talking, Felicite treating her as a confidante, as adevoted daughter, one of the family, to whom she could tell everything.She began by questioning her; she wished to know if Dr. Ramond had comethat morning. He had come, but they had talked only about indifferentmatters. This put her in despair, for she had seen the doctor on theprevious day, and he had unbosomed himself to her, chagrined at nothaving yet received a decisive answer, and eager now to obtain at leastClotilde's promise. Things could not go on in this way, the young girlmust be compelled to engage herself to him."He has too much delicacy," she cried. "I have told him so. I knew verywell that this morning, even, he would not venture to demand a positiveanswer. And I have come to interfere in the matter. We shall see if Icannot oblige her to come to a decision."Then, more calmly:"My son is on his feet now; he does not need her."Martine, who was again stooping over the bed, planting her leeks,straightened herself quickly."Ah, that for sure!"And a flush passed over her face, worn by thirty years of service. For awound bled within her; for some time past the master scarcely toleratedher about him. During the whole time of his illness he had kept her ata distance, accepting her services less and less every day, and finallyclosing altogether to her the door of his room and of the workroom.She had a vague consciousness of what was taking place, an instinctivejealousy tortured her, in her adoration of the master, whose chattel shehad been satisfied to be for so many years."For sure, we have no need of mademoiselle. I am quite able to take careof monsieur."Then she, who was so discreet, spoke of her labors in the garden, sayingthat she made time to cultivate the vegetables, so as to save a fewdays' wages of a man. True, the house was large, but when one was notafraid of work, one could manage to do all there was to be done. Andthen, when mademoiselle should have left them, that would be always oneless to wait upon. And her eyes brightened unconsciously at the thoughtof the great solitude, of the happy peace in which they should liveafter this departure."It would give me pain," she said, lowering her voice, "for it wouldcertainly give monsieur a great deal. I would never have believed thatI could be brought to wish for such a separation. Only, madame, I agreewith you that it is necessary, for I am greatly afraid that mademoisellewill end by going to ruin here, and that there will be another soullost to the good God. Ah, it is very sad; my heart is so heavy about itsometimes that it is ready to burst.""They are both upstairs, are they not?" said Felicite. "I will go up andsee them, and I will undertake to oblige them to end the matter."An hour later, when she came down again, she found Martine still onher knees on the soft earth, finishing her planting. Upstairs, from herfirst words, when she said that she had been talking with Dr. Ramond,and that he had shown himself anxious to know his fate quickly, she sawthat Dr. Pascal approved--he looked grave, he nodded his head as ifto say that this wish seemed to him very natural. Clotilde, herself,ceasing to smile, seemed to listen to him with deference. But shemanifested some surprise. Why did they press her? Master had fixed themarriage for the second week in June; she had, then, two full monthsbefore her. Very soon she would speak about it with Ramond. Marriage wasso serious a matter that they might very well give her time to reflect,and let her wait until the last moment to engage herself. And she saidall this with her air of good sense, like a person resolved on coming toa decision. And Felicite was obliged to content herself with the evidentdesire that both had that matters should have the most reasonableconclusion."Indeed I believe that it is settled," ended Felicite. "He seems toplace no obstacle in the way, and she seems only to wish not to acthastily, like a girl who desires to examine her heart closely, beforeengaging herself for life. I will give her a week more for reflection."Martine, sitting on her heels, was looking fixedly on the ground with aclouded face."Yes, yes," she murmured, in a low voice, "mademoiselle has beenreflecting a great deal of late. I am always meeting her in some corner.You speak to her, and she does not answer you. That is the way peopleare when they are breeding a disease, or when they have a secret ontheir mind. There is something going on; she is no longer the same, nolonger the same."And she took the dibble again and planted a leek, in her rage for work;while old Mme. Rougon went away, somewhat tranquillized; certain, shesaid, that the marriage would take place.Pascal, in effect, seemed to accept Clotilde's marriage as a thingsettled, inevitable. He had not spoken with her about it again, therare allusions which they made to it between themselves, in their hourlyconversations, left them undisturbed; and it was simply as if the twomonths which they still had to live together were to be without end, aneternity stretching beyond their view.She, especially, would look at him smiling, putting off to a futureday troubles and decisions with a pretty vague gesture, as if to leaveeverything to beneficent life. He, now well and gaining strength daily,grew melancholy only when he returned to the solitude of his chamberat night, after she had retired. He shuddered and turned cold at thethought that a time would come when he would be always alone. Was it thebeginning of old age that made him shiver in this way? He seemed tosee it stretching before him, like a shadowy region in which he alreadybegan to feel all his energy melting away. And then the regret of havingneither wife nor child filled him with rebelliousness, and wrung hisheart with intolerable anguish.Ah, why had he not lived! There were times when he cursed science,accusing it of having taken from him the best part of his manhood.He had let himself be devoured by work; work had consumed his brain,consumed his heart, consumed his flesh. All this solitary, passionatelabor had produced only books, blackened paper, that would be scatteredto the winds, whose cold leaves chilled his hands as he turned themover. And no living woman's breast to lean upon, no child's warm locksto kiss! He had lived the cold, solitary life of a selfish scientist,and he would die in cold solitude. Was he indeed going to die thus?Would he never taste the happiness enjoyed by even the common porters,by the carters who cracked their whips, passing by under his windows?But he must hasten, if he would; soon, no doubt, it would be too late.All his unemployed youth, all his pent-up desires, surged tumultuouslythrough his veins. He swore that he would yet love, that he would livea new life, that he would drain the cup of every passion that he had notyet tasted, before he should be an old man. He would knock at the doors,he would stop the passers-by, he would scour the fields and town.On the following day, when he had taken his shower bath and left hisroom, all his fever was calmed, the burning pictures had faded away,and he fell back into his natural timidity. Then, on the next night, thefear of solitude drove sleep away as before, his blood kindled again,and the same despair, the same rebelliousness, the same longing not todie without having known family joys returned. He suffered a great dealin this crisis.During these feverish nights, with eyes wide open in the darkness, hedreamed always, over and over again the same dream. A girl would comealong the road, a girl of twenty, marvelously beautiful; and she wouldenter and kneel down before him in an attitude of submissive adoration,and he would marry her. She was one of those pilgrims of love such aswe find in ancient story, who have followed a star to come and restorehealth and strength to some aged king, powerful and covered with glory.He was the aged king, and she adored him, she wrought the miracle, withher twenty years, of bestowing on him a part of her youth. In her lovehe recovered his courage and his faith in life.Ah, youth! he hungered fiercely for it. In his declining days thispassionate longing for youth was like a revolt against approaching age,a desperate desire to turn back, to be young again, to begin life overagain. And in this longing to begin life over again, there was not onlyregret for the vanished joys of youth, the inestimable treasure of deadhours, to which memory lent its charm; there was also the determinedwill to enjoy, now, his health and strength, to lose nothing of the joyof loving! Ah, youth! how eagerly he would taste of its every pleasure,how eagerly he would drain every cup, before his teeth should fall out,before his limbs should grow feeble, before the blood should be chilledin his veins. A pang pierced his heart when he remembered himself, aslender youth of twenty, running and leaping agilely, vigorous and hardyas a young oak, his teeth glistening, his hair black and luxuriant. Howhe would cherish them, these gifts scorned before, if a miracle couldrestore them to him!And youthful womanhood, a young girl who might chance to pass by,disturbed him, causing him profound emotion. This was often evenaltogether apart from the individual: the image, merely, of youth, theperfume and the dazzling freshness which emanated from it, bright eyes,healthy lips, blooming cheeks, a delicate neck, above all, roundedand satin-smooth, shaded on the back with down; and youthful womanhoodalways presented itself to him tall and slight, divinely slender in itschaste nudeness. His eyes, gazing into vacancy, followed the vision,his heart was steeped in infinite longing. There was nothing good ordesirable but youth; it was the flower of the world, the only beauty,the only joy, the only true good, with health, which nature could bestowon man. Ah, to begin life over again, to be young again, to clasp in hisembrace youthful womanhood!Pascal and Clotilde, now that the fine April days had come, covering thefruit trees with blossoms, resumed their morning walks in La Souleiade.It was the first time that he had gone out since his illness, and sheled him to the threshing yard, along the paths in the pine wood, andback again to the terrace crossed by the two bars of shadows thrown bythe secular cypresses. The sun had already warmed the old flagstonesthere, and the wide horizon stretched out under a dazzling sky.One morning when Clotilde had been running, she returned to the house insuch exuberant spirits and so full of pleasant excitement that she wentup to the workroom without taking off either her garden hat or the lacescarf which she had tied around her neck."Oh," she said, "I am so warm! And how stupid I am, not to have takenoff my things downstairs. I will go down again at once."She had thrown the scarf on a chair on entering.But her feverish fingers became impatient when she tried to untie thestrings of her large straw hat."There, now! I have fastened the knot. I cannot undo it, and you mustcome to my assistance."Pascal, happy and excited too by the pleasure of the walk, rejoiced tosee her so beautiful and so merry. He went over and stood in front ofher."Wait; hold up your chin. Oh, if you keep moving like that, how do yousuppose I can do it?"She laughed aloud. He could see the laughter swelling her throat, likea wave of sound. His fingers became entangled under her chin, thatdelicious part of the throat whose warm satin he involuntarily touched.She had on a gown cut sloping in the neck, and through the opening heinhaled all the living perfume of the woman, the pure fragrance of heryouth, warmed by the sunshine. All at once a vertigo seized him and hethought he was going to faint."No, no! I cannot do it," he said, "unless you keep still!"The blood throbbed in his temples, and his fingers trembled, while sheleaned further back, unconsciously offering the temptation of her freshgirlish beauty. It was the vision of royal youth, the bright eyes,the healthy lips, the blooming cheeks, above all, the delicate neck,satin-smooth and round, shaded on the back by down. And she seemedto him so delicately graceful, with her slender throat, in her divinebloom!"There, it is done!" she cried.Without knowing how, he had untied the strings. The room whirled round,and then he saw her again, bareheaded now, with her starlike face,shaking back her golden curls laughingly. Then he was seized with a fearthat he would catch her in his arms and press mad kisses on her bareneck, and arms, and throat. And he fled from the room, taking with himthe hat, which he had kept in his hand, saying:"I will hang it in the hall. Wait for me; I want to speak to Martine."Once downstairs, he hurried to the abandoned room and locked himselfinto it, trembling lest she should become uneasy and come down hereto seek him. He looked wild and haggard, as if he had just committeda crime. He spoke aloud, and he trembled as he gave utterance for thefirst time to the cry that he had always loved her madly, passionately.Yes, ever since she had grown into womanhood he had adored her. Andhe saw her clearly before him, as if a curtain had been suddenly tornaside, as she was when, from an awkward girl, she became a charming andlovely creature, with her long tapering limbs, her strong slender body,with its round throat, round neck, and round and supple arms. And it wasmonstrous, but it was true--he hungered for all this with a devouringhunger, for this youth, this fresh, blooming, fragrant flesh.Then Pascal, dropping into a rickety chair, hid his face in his hands,as if to shut out the light of day, and burst into great sobs. Good God!what was to become of him? A girl whom his brother had confided tohim, whom he had brought up like a good father, and who was now--thistemptress of twenty-five--a woman in her supreme omnipotence! He felthimself more defenseless, weaker than a child.And above this physical desire, he loved her also with an immensetenderness, enamored of her moral and intellectual being, of herright-mindedness, of her fine intelligence, so fearless and so clear.Even their discord, the disquietude about spiritual things by which shewas tortured, made her only all the more precious to him, as if shewere a being different from himself, in whom he found a little of theinfinity of things. She pleased him in her rebellions, when she held herground against him,--she was his companion and pupil; he saw her suchas he had made her, with her great heart, her passionate frankness,her triumphant reason. And she was always present with him; he didnot believe that he could exist where she was not; he had need of herbreath; of the flutter of her skirts near him; of her thoughtfulness andaffection, by which he felt himself constantly surrounded; of her looks;of her smile; of her whole daily woman's life, which she had given him,which she would not have the cruelty to take back from him again. At thethought that she was going away, that she would not be always here, itseemed to him as if the heavens were about to fall and crush him; as ifthe end of all things had come; as if he were about to be plunged inicy darkness. She alone existed in the world, she alone was lofty andvirtuous, intelligent and beautiful, with a miraculous beauty. Why,then, since he adored her and since he was her master, did he not goupstairs and take her in his arms and kiss her like an idol? They wereboth free, she was ignorant of nothing, she was a woman in age. Thiswould be happiness.Pascal, who had ceased to weep, rose, and would have walked to the door.But suddenly he dropped again into his chair, bursting into a freshpassion of sobs. No, no, it was abominable, it could not be! He felt onhis head the frost of his white hair; and he had a horror of his age,of his fifty-nine years, when he thought of her twenty-five years. Hisformer chill fear again took possession of him, the certainty thatshe had subjugated him, that he would be powerless against the dailytemptation. And he saw her giving him the strings of her hat to untie;compelling him to lean over her to make some correction in her work; andhe saw himself, too, blind, mad, devouring her neck with ardent kisses.His indignation against himself at this was so great that he arose,now courageously, and had the strength to go upstairs to the workroom,determined to conquer himself.Upstairs Clotilde had tranquilly resumed her drawing. She did not evenlook around at his entrance, but contented herself with saying:"How long you have been! I was beginning to think that Martine must havemade a mistake of at least ten sous in her accounts."This customary jest about the servant's miserliness made him laugh.And he went and sat down quietly at his table. They did not speak againuntil breakfast time. A great sweetness bathed him and calmed him, nowthat he was near her. He ventured to look at her, and he was touched byher delicate profile, by her serious, womanly air of application. Hadhe been the prey of a nightmare, downstairs, then? Would he be able toconquer himself so easily?"Ah!" he cried, when Martine called them, "how hungry I am! You shallsee how I am going to make new muscle!"She went over to him, and took him by the arm, saying:"That's right, master; you must be gay and strong!"But that night, when he was in his own room, the agony began again. Atthe thought of losing her he was obliged to bury his face in the pillowto stifle his cries. He pictured her to himself in the arms of another,and all the tortures of jealousy racked his soul. Never could he findthe courage to consent to such a sacrifice. All sorts of plans claspedtogether in his seething brain; he would turn her from the marriage, andkeep her with him, without ever allowing her to suspect his passion;he would take her away, and they would go from city to city,occupying their minds with endless studies, in order to keep up theircompanionship as master and pupil; or even, if it should be necessary,he would send her to her brother to nurse him, he would lose her foreverrather than give her to a husband. And at each of these resolutions hefelt his heart, torn asunder, cry out with anguish in the imperiousneed of possessing her entirely. He was no longer satisfied with herpresence, he wished to keep her for himself, with himself, as sheappeared to him in her radiant beauty, in the darkness of his chamber,with her unbound hair falling around her.His arms clasped the empty air, and he sprang out of bed, staggeringlike a drunken man; and it was only in the darkness and silence of theworkroom that he awoke from this sudden fit of madness. Where, then,was he going, great God? To knock at the door of this sleeping child?to break it in, perhaps, with a blow of his shoulder? The soft, purerespiration, which he fancied he heard like a sacred wind in the midstof the profound silence, struck him on the face and turned him back. Andhe returned to his room and threw himself on his bed, in a passion ofshame and wild despair.On the following day when he arose, Pascal, worn out by want of sleep,had come to a decision. He took his daily shower bath, and he felthimself stronger and saner. The resolution to which he had come was tocompel Clotilde to give her word. When she should have formally promisedto marry Ramond, it seemed to him that this final solution would calmhim, would forbid his indulging in any false hopes. This would be abarrier the more, an insurmountable barrier between her and him. Hewould be from that moment armed against his desire, and if he stillsuffered, it would be suffering only, without the horrible fear ofbecoming a dishonorable man.On this morning, when he told the young girl that she ought to delayno longer, that she owed a decisive answer to the worthy fellow who hadbeen awaiting it so long, she seemed at first astonished. She lookedstraight into his eyes, but he had sufficient command over himself notto show confusion; he insisted merely, with a slightly grieved air, asif it distressed him to have to say these things to her. Finally, shesmiled faintly and turned her head aside, saying:"Then, master, you wish me to leave you?""My dear," he answered evasively, "I assure you that this is becomingridiculous. Ramond will have the right to be angry."She went over to her desk, to arrange some papers which were on it.Then, after a moment's silence, she said:"It is odd; now you are siding with grandmother and Martine. They, too,are persecuting me to end this matter. I thought I had a few days more.But, in truth, if you all three urge me--"She did not finish, and he did not press her to explain herself moreclearly."When do you wish me to tell Ramond to come, then?""Why, he may come whenever he wishes; it does not displease me to seehim. But don't trouble yourself. I will let him know that we will expecthim one of these afternoons."On the following day the same scene began over again. Clotilde had takenno step yet, and Pascal was now angry. He suffered martyrdom; he hadcrises of anguish and rebelliousness when she was not present to calmhim by her smiling freshness. And he insisted, in emphatic language,that she should behave seriously and not trifle any longer with anhonorable man who loved her."The devil! Since the thing is decided, let us be done with it. I warnyou that I will send word to Ramond, and that he will be here to-morrowat three o'clock."She listened in silence, her eyes fixed on the ground. Neither seemedto wish to touch upon the question as to whether the marriage had reallybeen decided on or not, and they took the standpoint that there had beena previous decision, which was irrevocable. When she looked up again hetrembled, for he felt a breath pass by; he thought she was on the pointof saying that she had questioned herself, and that she refused thismarriage. What would he have done, what would have become of him, goodGod! Already he was filled with an immense joy and a wild terror. Butshe looked at him with the discreet and affectionate smile which nevernow left her lips, and she answered with a submissive air:"As you please, master. Send him word to be here to-morrow at threeo'clock."Pascal spent so dreadful a night that he rose late, saying, as anexcuse, that he had one of his old headaches. He found relief only underthe icy deluge of the shower bath. At ten o'clock he left the house,saying he would go himself to see Ramond; but he had another objectin going out--he had seen at a show in Plassans a corsage of old pointd'Alencon; a marvel of beauty which lay there awaiting some lover'sgenerous folly, and the thought had come to him in the midst of thetortures of the night, to make a present of it to Clotilde, to adorn herwedding gown. This bitter idea of himself adorning her, of making herbeautiful and fair for the gift of herself, touched his heart, exhaustedby sacrifice. She knew the corsage, she had admired it with him one daywonderingly, wishing for it only to place it on the shoulders of theVirgin at St. Saturnin, an antique Virgin adored by the faithful. Theshopkeeper gave it to him in a little box which he could conceal,and which he hid, on his return to the house, in the bottom of hiswriting-desk.At three o'clock Dr. Ramond presented himself, and he found Pascal andClotilde in the parlor, where they had been awaiting him with secretexcitement and a somewhat forced gaiety, avoiding any further allusionto his visit. They received him smilingly with exaggerated cordiality."Why, you are perfectly well again, master!" said the young man. "Younever looked so strong."Pascal shook his head."Oh, oh, strong, perhaps! only the heart is no longer here."This involuntary avowal made Clotilde start, and she looked from one tothe other, as if, by the force of circumstances, she compared them witheach other--Ramond, with his smiling and superb face--the face of thehandsome physician adored by the women--his luxuriant black hair andbeard, in all the splendor of his young manhood; and Pascal, with hiswhite hair and his white beard. This fleece of snow, still so abundant,retained the tragic beauty of the six months of torture that he hadjust passed through. His sorrowful face had aged a little, only his eyesremained still youthful; brown eyes, brilliant and limpid. But at thismoment all his features expressed so much gentleness, such exaltedgoodness, that Clotilde ended by letting her gaze rest upon him withprofound tenderness. There was silence for a moment and each heartthrilled."Well, my children," resumed Pascal heroically, "I think you havesomething to say to each other. I have something to do, too, downstairs.I will come up again presently."And he left the room, smiling back at them.And soon as they were alone, Clotilde went frankly straight over toRamond, with both hands outstretched. Taking his hands in hers, she heldthem as she spoke."Listen, my dear friend; I am going to give you a great grief. You mustnot be too angry with me, for I assure you that I have a very profoundfriendship for you."He understood at once, and he turned very pale."Clotilde give me no answer now, I beg of you; take more time, if youwish to reflect further.""It is useless, my dear friend, my decision is made."She looked at him with her fine, loyal look. She had not released hishands, in order that he might know that she was not excited, and thatshe was his friend. And it was he who resumed, in a low voice:"Then you say no?""I say no, and I assure you that it pains me greatly to say it. Ask menothing; you will no doubt know later on."He sat down, crushed by the emotion which he repressed like a strong andself-contained man, whose mental balance the greatest sufferings cannotdisturb. Never before had any grief agitated him like this. He remainedmute, while she, standing, continued:"And above all, my friend, do not believe that I have played thecoquette with you. If I have allowed you to hope, if I have made youwait so long for my answer, it was because I did not in very truth seeclearly myself. You cannot imagine through what a crisis I have justpassed--a veritable tempest of emotions, surrounded by darkness from outof which I have but just found my way."He spoke at last."Since it is your wish, I will ask you nothing. Besides, it issufficient for you to answer one question. You do not love me,Clotilde?"She did not hesitate, but said gravely, with an emotion which softenedthe frankness of her answer:"It is true, I do not love you; I have only a very sincere affection foryou."He rose, and stopped by a gesture the kind words which she would haveadded."It is ended; let us never speak of it again. I wished you to be happy.Do not grieve for me. At this moment I feel as if the house had justfallen about me in ruins. But I must only extricate myself as best Ican."A wave of color passed over his pale face, he gasped for air, he crossedover to the window, then he walked back with a heavy step, seekingto recover his self-possession. He drew a long breath. In the painfulsilence which had fallen they heard Pascal coming upstairs noisily, toannounce his return."I entreat you," murmured Clotilde hurriedly, "to say nothing to master.He does not know my decision, and I wish to break it to him myself, forhe was bent upon this marriage."Pascal stood still in the doorway. He was trembling and breathless, asif he had come upstairs too quickly. He still found strength to smile atthem, saying:"Well, children, have you come to an understanding?""Yes, undoubtedly," responded Ramond, as agitated as himself."Then it is all settled?""Quite," said Clotilde, who had been seized by a faintness.Pascal walked over to his work-table, supporting himself by thefurniture, and dropped into the chair beside it."Ah, ah! you see the legs are not so strong after all. It is this oldcarcass of a body. But the heart is strong. And I am very happy, mychildren, your happiness will make me well again."But when Ramond, after a few minutes' further conversation, had goneaway, he seemed troubled at finding himself alone with the young girl,and he again asked her:"It is settled, quite settled; you swear it to me?""Entirely settled."After this he did not speak again. He nodded his head, as if to repeatthat he was delighted; that nothing could be better; that at last theywere all going to live in peace. He closed his eyes, feigning todrop asleep, as he sometimes did in the afternoon. But his heart beatviolently, and his closely shut eyelids held back the tears.That evening, at about ten o'clock, when Clotilde went downstairs for amoment to give an order to Martine before she should have gone to bed,Pascal profited by the opportunity of being left alone, to go and laythe little box containing the lace corsage on the young girl's bed. Shecame upstairs again, wished him the accustomed good-night, and he hadbeen for at least twenty minutes in his own room, and was already in hisshirt sleeves, when a burst of gaiety sounded outside his door. A littlehand tapped, and a fresh voice cried, laughing:"Come, come and look!"He opened the door, unable to resist this appeal of youth, conquered byhis joy."Oh, come, come and see what a beautiful little bird has put on my bed!"And she drew him to her room, taking no refusal. She had lighted the twocandles in it, and the antique, pleasant chamber, with its hangings offaded rose color, seemed transformed into a chapel; and on the bed, likea sacred cloth offered to the adoration of the faithful, she had spreadthe corsage of old point d'Alencon."You would not believe it! Imagine, I did not see the box at first. Iset things in order a little, as I do every evening. I undressed, andit was only when I was getting into bed that I noticed your present. Ah,what a surprise! I was overwhelmed by it! I felt that I could never waitfor the morning, and I put on a skirt and ran to look for you."It was not until then that he perceived that she was only half dressed,as on the night of the storm, when he had surprised her stealing hispapers. And she seemed divine, with her tall, girlish form, her taperinglimbs, her supple arms, her slender body, with its small, firm throat.She took his hands and pressed them caressingly in her little ones."How good you are; how I thank you! Such a marvel of beauty, so lovelya present for me, who am nobody! And you remember that I had admiredit, this antique relic of art. I said to you that only the Virgin of St.Saturnin was worthy of wearing it on her shoulders. I am so happy!oh, so happy! For it is true, I love beautiful things; I love them sopassionately that at times I wish for impossibilities, gowns woven ofsunbeams, impalpable veils made of the blue of heaven. How beautiful Iam going to look! how beautiful I am going to look!"Radiant in her ecstatic gratitude, she drew close to him, still lookingat the corsage, and compelling him to admire it with her. Then a suddencuriosity seized her."But why did you make me this royal present?"Ever since she had come to seek him in her joyful excitement, Pascalhad been walking in a dream. He was moved to tears by this affectionategratitude; he stood there, not feeling the terror which he had dreaded,but seeming, on the contrary, to be filled with joy, as at the approachof a great and miraculous happiness. This chamber, which he neverentered, had the religious sweetness of holy places that satisfy alllongings for the unattainable.His countenance, however, expressed surprise. And he answered:"Why, this present, my dear, is for your wedding gown."She, in her turn, looked for a moment surprised as if she had notunderstood him. Then, with the sweet and singular smile which she hadworn of late she said gayly:"Ah, true, my marriage!"Then she grew serious again, and said:"Then you want to get rid of me? It was in order to have me here nolonger that you were so bent upon marrying me. Do you still think meyour enemy, then?"He felt his tortures return, and he looked away from her, wishing toretain his courage."My enemy, yes. Are you not so? We have suffered so much through eachother these last days. It is better in truth that we should separate.And then I do not know what your thoughts are; you have never given methe answer I have been waiting for."She tried in vain to catch his glance, which he still kept turned away.She began to talk of the terrible night on which they had gone togetherthrough the papers. It was true, in the shock which her whole being hadsuffered, she had not yet told him whether she was with him or againsthim. He had a right to demand an answer.She again took his hands in hers, and forced him to look at her."And it is because I am your enemy that you are sending me away? I amnot your enemy. I am your servant, your chattel, your property. Do youhear? I am with you and for you, for you alone!"His face grew radiant; an intense joy shone within his eyes."Yes, I will wear this lace. It is for my wedding day, for I wish to bebeautiful, very beautiful for you. But do you not understand me, then?You are my master; it is you I love.""No, no! be silent; you will make me mad! You are betrothed to another.You have given your word. All this madness is happily impossible.""The other! I have compared him with you, and I have chosen you. I havedismissed him. He has gone away, and he will never return. There areonly we two now, and it is you I love, and you love me. I know it, and Igive myself to you."He trembled violently. He had ceased to struggle, vanquished by thelonging of eternal love.The spacious chamber, with its antique furniture, warmed by youth, wasas if filled with light. There was no longer either fear or suffering;they were free. She gave herself to him knowingly, willingly, and heaccepted the supreme gift like a priceless treasure which the strengthof his love had won. Suddenly she murmured in his ear, in a caressingvoice, lingering tenderly on the words:"Master, oh, master, master!"And this word, which she used formerly as a matter of habit, at thishour acquired a profound significance, lengthening out and prolongingitself, as if it expressed the gift of her whole being. She utteredit with grateful fervor, like a woman who accepts, and who surrendersherself. Was not the mystic vanquished, the real acknowledged, lifeglorified with love at last confessed and shared."Master, master, this comes from far back. I must tell you; I must makemy confession. It is true that I went to church in order to be happy.But I could not believe. I wished to understand too much; my reasonrebelled against their dogmas; their paradise appeared to me anincredible puerility. But I believed that the world does not stop atsensation; that there is a whole unknown world, which must be takeninto account; and this, master, I believe still. It is the idea of theBeyond, which not even happiness, found at last upon your neck, willefface. But this longing for happiness, this longing to be happy atonce, to have some certainty--how I have suffered from it. If I went tochurch, it was because I missed something, and I went there to seek it.My anguish consisted in this irresistible need to satisfy my longing.You remember what you used to call my eternal thirst for illusion andfalsehood. One night, in the threshing yard, under the great starrysky, do you remember? I burst out against your science, I was indignantbecause of the ruins with which it strews the earth, I turned my eyesaway from the dreadful wounds which it exposes. And I wished, master,to take you to a solitude where we might both live in God, far from theworld, forgotten by it. Ah, what torture, to long, to struggle, and notto be satisfied!"Softly, without speaking, he kissed her on both eyes."Then, master, do you remember again, there was the great moral shock onthe night of the storm, when you gave me that terrible lesson of life,emptying out your envelopes before me. You had said to me already: 'Knowlife, love it, live it as it ought to be lived.' But what a vast, whata frightful flood, rolling ever onward toward a human sea, swelling itunceasingly for the unknown future! And, master, the silent work withinme began then. There was born, in my heart and in my flesh, the bitterstrength of the real. At first I was as if crushed, the blow was sorude. I could not recover myself. I kept silent, because I did not knowclearly what to say. Then, gradually, the evolution was effected. Istill had struggles, I still rebelled against confessing my defeat. Butevery day after this the truth grew clearer within me, I knew well thatyou were my master, and that there was no happiness for me outside ofyou, of your science and your goodness. You were life itself, broad andtolerant life; saying all, accepting all, solely through the love ofenergy and effort, believing in the work of the world, placing themeaning of destiny in the labor which we all accomplish with love, inour desperate eagerness to live, to love, to live anew, to live always,in spite of all the abominations and miseries of life. Oh, to live, tolive! This is the great task, the work that always goes on, and thatwill doubtless one day be completed!"Silent still, he smiled radiantly, and kissed her on the mouth."And, master, though I have always loved you, even from my earliestyouth, it was, I believe, on that terrible night that you marked me for,and made me your own. You remember how you crushed me in your grasp. Itleft a bruise, and a few drops of blood on my shoulder. Then your beingentered, as it were into mine. We struggled; you were the stronger, andfrom that time I have felt the need of a support. At first I thoughtmyself humiliated; then I saw that it was but an infinitely sweetsubmission. I always felt your power within me. A gesture of your handin the distance thrilled me as though it had touched me. I would havewished that you had seized me again in your grasp, that you had crushedme in it, until my being had mingled with yours forever. And I wasnot blind; I knew well that your wish was the same as mine, that theviolence which had made me yours had made you mine; that you struggledwith yourself not to seize me and hold me as I passed by you. To nurseyou when you were ill was some slight satisfaction. From that time,light began to break upon me, and I at last understood. I went no moreto church, I began to be happy near you, you had become certainty andhappiness. Do you remember that I cried to you, in the threshing yard,that something was wanting in our affection. There was a void in itwhich I longed to fill. What could be wanting to us unless it were God?And it was God--love, and life."VIII.Then came a period of idyllic happiness. Clotilde was the spring, thetardy rejuvenation that came to Pascal in his declining years. She came,bringing to him, with her love, sunshine and flowers. Their rapturelifted them above the earth; and all this youth she bestowed on himafter his thirty years of toil, when he was already weary and wornprobing the frightful wounds of humanity. He revived in the light of hergreat shining eyes, in the fragrance of her pure breath. He had faithagain in life, in health, in strength, in the eternal renewal of nature.On the morning after her avowal it was ten o'clock before Clotilde lefther room. In the middle of the workroom she suddenly came upon Martineand, in her radiant happiness, with a burst of joy that carriedeverything before it, she rushed toward her, crying:"Martine, I am not going away! Master and I--we love each other."The old servant staggered under the blow. Her poor worn face, nunlikeunder its white cap and with its look of renunciation, grew white in thekeenness of her anguish. Without a word, she turned and fled for refugeto her kitchen, where, leaning her elbows on her chopping-table, andburying her face in her clasped hands, she burst into a passion of sobs.Clotilde, grieved and uneasy, followed her. And she tried to comprehendand to console her."Come, come, how foolish you are! What possesses you? Master and I willlove you all the same; we will always keep you with us. You are notgoing to be unhappy because we love each other. On the contrary, thehouse is going to be gay now from morning till night."But Martine only sobbed all the more desperately."Answer me, at least. Tell me why you are angry and why you cry. Doesit not please you then to know that master is so happy, so happy! See, Iwill call master and he will make you answer."At this threat the old servant suddenly rose and rushed into her ownroom, which opened out of the kitchen, slamming the door behind her. Invain the young girl called and knocked until she was tired; shecould obtain no answer. At last Pascal, attracted by the noise, camedownstairs, saying:"Why, what is the matter?""Oh, it is that obstinate Martine! Only fancy, she began to cry when sheknew that we loved each other. And she has barricaded herself in there,and she will not stir."She did not stir, in fact. Pascal, in his turn, called and knocked. Hescolded; he entreated. Then, one after the other, they began all overagain. Still there was no answer. A deathlike silence reigned inthe little room. And he pictured it to himself, this little room,religiously clean, with its walnut bureau, and its monastic bedfurnished with white hangings. No doubt the servant had thrown herselfacross this bed, in which she had slept alone all her woman's life, andwas burying her face in the bolster to stifle her sobs."Ah, so much the worse for her?" said Clotilde at last, in the egotismof her joy, "let her sulk!"Then throwing her arms around Pascal, and raising to his her charmingface, still glowing with the ardor of self-surrender, she said:"Master, I will be your servant to-day."He kissed her on the eyes with grateful emotion; and she at once setabout preparing the breakfast, turning the kitchen upside down. Shehad put on an enormous white apron, and she looked charming, with hersleeves rolled up, showing her delicate arms, as if for some greatundertaking. There chanced to be some cutlets in the kitchen which shecooked to a turn. She added some scrambled eggs, and she even succeededin frying some potatoes. And they had a delicious breakfast, twentytimes interrupted by her getting up in her eager zeal, to run for thebread, the water, a forgotten fork. If he had allowed her, she wouldhave waited upon him on her knees. Ah! to be alone, to be only they twoin this large friendly house, and to be free to laugh and to love eachother in peace.They spent the whole afternoon in sweeping and putting things in order.He insisted upon helping her. It was a play; they amused themselves liketwo merry children. From time to time, however, they went back to knockat Martine's door to remonstrate with her. Come, this was foolish, shewas not going to let herself starve! Was there ever seen such a mule,when no one had said or done anything to her! But only the echo of theirknocks came back mournfully from the silent room. Not the slightestsound, not a breath responded. Night fell, and they were obliged to makethe dinner also, which they ate, sitting beside each other, from thesame plate. Before going to bed, they made a last attempt, threateningto break open the door, but their ears, glued to the wood, could notcatch the slightest sound. And on the following day, when they wentdownstairs and found the door still hermetically closed, they began tobe seriously uneasy. For twenty-four hours the servant had given no signof life.Then, on returning to the kitchen after a moment's absence, Clotilde andPascal were stupefied to see Martine sitting at her table, picking somesorrel for the breakfast. She had silently resumed her place as servant."But what was the matter with you?" cried Clotilde. "Will you speaknow?"She lifted up her sad face, stained by tears. It was very calm, however,and it expressed now only the resigned melancholy of old age. She lookedat the young girl with an air of infinite reproach; then she bent herhead again without speaking."Are you angry with us, then?"And as she still remained silent, Pascal interposed:"Are you angry with us, my good Martine?"Then the old servant looked up at him with her former look of adoration,as if she loved him sufficiently to endure all and to remain in spite ofall. At last she spoke."No, I am angry with no one. The master is free. It is all right, if heis satisfied."A new life began from this time. Clotilde, who in spite of hertwenty-five years had still remained childlike, now, under the influenceof love, suddenly bloomed into exquisite womanhood. Since her heart hadawakened, the serious and intelligent boy that she had looked like,with her round head covered with its short curls, had given place to anadorable woman, altogether womanly, submissive and tender, loving to beloved. Her great charm, notwithstanding her learning picked up at randomfrom her reading and her work, was her virginal _naivete_, as if herunconscious awaiting of love had made her reserve the gift of her wholebeing to be utterly absorbed in the man whom she should love. No doubtshe had given her love as much through gratitude and admiration asthrough tenderness; happy to make him happy; experiencing a profound joyin being no longer only a little girl to be petted, but something of hisvery own which he adored, a precious possession, a thing of grace andjoy, which he worshiped on bended knees. She still had the religioussubmissiveness of the former devotee, in the hands of a master matureand strong, from whom she derived consolation and support, retaining,above and beyond affection, the sacred awe of the believer in thespiritual which she still was. But more than all, this woman, sointoxicated with love, was a delightful personification of health andgaiety; eating with a hearty appetite; having something of the valorof her grandfather the soldier; filling the house with her swift andgraceful movements, with the bloom of her satin skin, the slender graceof her neck, of all her young form, divinely fresh.And Pascal, too, had grown handsome again under the influence oflove, with the serene beauty of a man who had retained his vigor,notwithstanding his white hairs. His countenance had no longer thesorrowful expression which it had worn during the months of grief andsuffering through which he had lately passed; his eyes, youthful still,had recovered their brightness, his features their smiling grace; whilehis white hair and beard grew thicker, in a leonine abundance whichlent him a youthful air. He had kept himself, in his solitary life as apassionate worker, so free from vice and dissipation that he found nowwithin him a reserve of life and vigor eager to expend itself at last.There awoke within him new energy, a youthful impetuosity that brokeforth in gestures and exclamations, in a continual need of expansion, ofliving. Everything wore a new and enchanting aspect to him; the smallestglimpse of sky moved him to wonder; the perfume of a simple flower threwhim into an ecstasy; an everyday expression of affection, worn by use,touched him to tears, as if it had sprung fresh from the heart and hadnot been hackneyed by millions of lips. Clotilde's "I love you," wasan infinite caress, whose celestial sweetness no human being had everbefore known. And with health and beauty he recovered also his gaiety,that tranquil gaiety which had formerly been inspired by his love oflife, and which now threw sunshine over his love, over everything thatmade life worth living.They two, blooming youth and vigorous maturity, so healthy, so gay,so happy, made a radiant couple. For a whole month they remained inseclusion, not once leaving La Souleiade. The place where both now likedto be was the spacious workroom, so intimately associated with theirhabits and their past affection. They would spend whole days there,scarcely working at all, however. The large carved oak press remainedwith closed doors; so, too, did the bookcases. Books and papers layundisturbed upon the tables. Like a young married couple they wereabsorbed in their one passion, oblivious of their former occupations,oblivious of life. The hours seemed all too short to enjoy the charm ofbeing together, often seated in the same large antique easy-chair, happyin the depths of this solitude in which they secluded themselves, inthe tranquillity of this lofty room, in this domain which was altogethertheirs, without luxury and without order, full of familiar objects,brightened from morning till night by the returning gaiety of the Aprilsunshine. When, seized with remorse, he would talk about working, shewould link her supple arms through his and laughingly hold him prisoner,so that he should not make himself ill again with overwork. Anddownstairs, they loved, too, the dining-room, so gay with its lightpanels relieved by blue bands, its antique mahogany furniture, its largeflower pastels, its brass hanging lamp, always shining. They ate in itwith a hearty appetite and they left it, after each meal, only to goupstairs again to their dear solitude.Then when the house seemed too small, they had the garden, all LaSouleiade. Spring advanced with the advancing sun, and at the end ofApril the roses were beginning to bloom. And what a joy was this domain,walled around, where nothing from the outside world could troublethem! Hours flew by unnoted, as they sat on the terrace facing thevast horizon and the shady banks of the Viorne, and the slopes ofSainte-Marthe, from the rocky bars of the Seille to the valley ofPlassans in the dusty distance. There was no shade on the terrace butthat of the two secular cypresses planted at its two extremities, liketwo enormous green tapers, which could be seen three leagues away. Attimes they descended the slope for the pleasure of ascending the giantsteps, and climbing the low walls of uncemented stones which supportedthe plantations, to see if the stunted olive trees and the puny almondswere budding. More often there were delightful walks under the delicateneedles of the pine wood, steeped in sunshine and exhaling a strong odorof resin; endless walks along the wall of inclosure, from behind whichthe only sound they could hear was, at rare intervals, the grating noiseof some cart jolting along the narrow road to Les Fenouilleres; and theyspent delightful hours in the old threshing yard, where they could seethe whole horizon, and where they loved to stretch themselves, tenderlyremembering their former tears, when, loving each other unconsciouslyto themselves, they had quarreled under the stars. But their favoriteretreat, where they always ended by losing themselves, was the quincunxof tall plane trees, whose branches, now of a tender green, looked likelacework. Below, the enormous box trees, the old borders of the Frenchgarden, of which now scarcely a trace remained, formed a sort oflabyrinth of which they could never find the end. And the slender streamof the fountain, with its eternal crystalline murmur, seemed to singwithin their hearts. They would sit hand in hand beside the mossy basin,while the twilight fell around them, their forms gradually fading intothe shadow of the trees, while the water which they could no longer see,sang its flutelike song.Up to the middle of May Pascal and Clotilde secluded themselves in thisway, without even crossing the threshold of their retreat. One morninghe disappeared and returned an hour later, bringing her a pair ofdiamond earrings which he had hurried out to buy, remembering this washer birthday. She adored jewels, and the gift astonished and delightedher. From this time not a week passed in which he did not go out once ortwice in this way to bring her back some present. The slightest excusewas sufficient for him--a _fete_, a wish, a simple pleasure. He broughther rings, bracelets, a necklace, a slender diadem. He would take outthe other jewels and please himself by putting them all upon her inthe midst of their laughter. She was like an idol, seated on her chair,covered with gold,--a band of gold on her hair, gold on her bare armsand on her bare throat, all shining with gold and precious stones. Herwoman's vanity was delightfully gratified by this. She allowed herselfto be adored thus, to be adored on bended knees, like a divinity,knowing well that this was only an exalted form of love. She began atlast to scold a little, however; to make prudent remonstrances; for, intruth, it was an absurdity to bring her all these gifts which she mustafterward shut up in a drawer, without ever wearing them, as she wentnowhere.They were forgotten after the hour of joy and gratitude which they gaveher in their novelty was over. But he would not listen to her, carriedaway by a veritable mania for giving; unable, from the moment the ideaof giving her an article took possession of him, to resist the desireof buying it. It was a munificence of the heart; an imperious desire toprove to her that he thought of her always; a pride in seeing her themost magnificent, the happiest, the most envied of women; a generositymore profound even, which impelled him to despoil himself of everything,of his money, of his life. And then, what a delight, when he saw he hadgiven her a real pleasure, and she threw herself on his neck, blushing,thanking him with kisses. After the jewels, it was gowns, articles ofdress, toilet articles. Her room was littered, the drawers were filledto overflowing.One morning she could not help getting angry. He had brought her anotherring."Why, I never wear them! And if I did, my fingers would be covered tothe tips. Be reasonable, I beg of you.""Then I have not given you pleasure?" he said with confusion.She threw her arms about his neck, and assured him with tears in hereyes that she was very happy. He was so good to her! He was so unweariedin his devotion to her! And when, later in the morning, he ventured tospeak of making some changes in her room, of covering the walls withtapestry, of putting down a carpet, she again remonstrated."Oh! no, no! I beg of you. Do not touch my old room, so full ofmemories, where I have grown up, where I told you I loved you. I shouldno longer feel myself at home in it."Downstairs, Martine's obstinate silence condemned still more stronglythese excessive and useless expenses. She had adopted a less familiarattitude, as if, in the new situation, she had fallen from her roleof housekeeper and friend to her former station of servant. TowardClotilde, especially, she changed, treating her like a young lady, likea mistress to whom she was less affectionate but more obedient thanformerly. Two or three times, however, she had appeared in the morningwith her face discolored and her eyes sunken with weeping, answeringevasively when questioned, saying that nothing was the matter, that shehad taken cold. And she never made any remark about the gifts with whichthe drawers were filled. She did not even seem to see them, arrangingthem without a word either of praise or dispraise. But her whole naturerebelled against this extravagant generosity, of which she could neverhave conceived the possibility. She protested in her own fashion;exaggerating her economy and reducing still further the expenses ofthe housekeeping, which she now conducted on so narrow a scale that sheretrenched even in the smallest expenses. For instance, she took onlytwo-thirds of the milk which she had been in the habit of taking, andshe served sweet dishes only on Sundays. Pascal and Clotilde, withoutventuring to complain, laughed between themselves at this parsimony,repeating the jests which had amused them for ten years past, sayingthat after dressing the vegetables she strained them in the colander, inorder to save the butter for future use.But this quarter she insisted upon rendering an account. She was in thehabit of going every three months to Master Grandguillot, the notary,to receive the fifteen hundred francs income, of which she disposedafterward according to her judgment, entering the expenses in a bookwhich the doctor had years ago ceased to verify. She brought it to himnow and insisted upon his looking over it. He excused himself, sayingthat it was all right."The thing is, monsieur," she said, "that this time I have been able toput some money aside. Yes, three hundred francs. Here they are."He looked at her in amazement. Generally she just made both ends meet.By what miracle of stinginess had she been able to save such a sum?"Ah! my poor Martine," he said at last, laughing, "that is the reason,then, that we have been eating so many potatoes of late. You are a pearlof economy, but indeed you must treat us a little better in the future."This discreet reproach wounded her so profoundly that she allowedherself at last to say:"Well, monsieur, when there is so much extravagance on the one hand, itis well to be prudent on the other."He understood the allusion, but instead of being angry, he was amused bythe lesson."Ah, ah! it is you who are examining my accounts! But you know verywell, Martine, that I, too, have my savings laid by."He alluded to the money which he still received occasionally from hispatients, and which he threw into a drawer of his writing-desk. For morethan sixteen years past he had put into this drawer every year aboutfour thousand francs, which would have amounted to a little fortuneif he had not taken from it, from day to day, without counting them,considerable sums for his experiments and his whims. All the money forthe presents came out of this drawer, which he now opened continually.He thought that it would never be empty; he had been so accustomed totake from it whatever he required that it had never occurred to him tofear that he would ever come to the bottom of it."One may very well have a little enjoyment out of one's savings," hesaid gayly. "Since it is you who go to the notary's, Martine, you arenot ignorant that I have my income apart."Then she said, with the colorless voice of the miser who is haunted bythe dread of an impending disaster:"And what would you do if you hadn't it?"Pascal looked at her in astonishment, and contented himself withanswering with a shrug, for the possibility of such a misfortune hadnever even entered his mind. He fancied that avarice was turning herbrain, and he laughed over the incident that evening with Clotilde.In Plassans, too, the presents were the cause of endless gossip. Therumor of what was going on at La Souleiade, this strange and suddenpassion, had spread, no one could tell how, by that force of expansionwhich sustains curiosity, always on the alert in small towns. Theservant certainly had not spoken, but her air was perhaps sufficient;words perhaps had dropped from her involuntarily; the lovers might havebeen watched over the walls. And then came the buying of the presents,confirming the reports and exaggerating them. When the doctor, in theearly morning, scoured the streets and visited the jeweler's and thedressmaker's, eyes spied him from the windows, his smallest purchaseswere watched, all the town knew in the evening that he had given her asilk bonnet, a bracelet set with sapphires. And all this was turned intoa scandal. This uncle in love with his niece, committing a young man'sfollies for her, adorning her like a holy Virgin. The most extraordinarystories began to circulate, and people pointed to La Souleiade as theypassed by.But old Mme. Rougon was, of all persons, the most bitterly indignant.She had ceased going to her son's house when she learned that Clotilde'smarriage with Dr. Ramond had been broken off. They had made sport ofher. They did nothing to please her, and she wished to show how deep herdispleasure was. Then a full month after the rupture, during which shehad understood nothing of the pitying looks, the discreet condolences,the vague smiles which met her everywhere, she learned everything with asuddenness that stunned her. She, who, at the time of Pascal's illness,in her mortification at the idea of again becoming the talk of the townthrough that ugly story, had raised such a storm! It was far worsethis time; the height of scandal, a love affair for people to regalethemselves with. The Rougon legend was again in peril; her unhappy sonwas decidedly doing his best to find some way to destroy the familyglory won with so much difficulty. So that in her anger she, who hadmade herself the guardian of this glory, resolving to purify the legendby every means in her power, put on her hat one morning and hurried toLa Souleiade with the youthful vivacity of her eighty years.Pascal, whom the rupture with his mother enchanted, was fortunatelynot at home, having gone out an hour before to look for a silver bucklewhich he had thought of for a belt. And Felicite fell upon Clotildeas the latter was finishing her toilet, her arms bare, her hair loose,looking as fresh and smiling as a rose.The first shock was rude. The old lady unburdened her mind, grewindignant, spoke of the scandal they were giving. Suddenly her angervanished. She looked at the young girl, and she thought her adorable. Inher heart she was not surprised at what was going on. She laughed at it,all she desired was that it should end in a correct fashion, so as tosilence evil tongues. And she cried with a conciliating air:"Get married then! Why do you not get married?"Clotilde remained silent for a moment, surprised. She had not thought ofmarriage. Then she smiled again."No doubt we will get married, grandmother. But later on, there is nohurry."Old Mme. Rougon went away, obliged to be satisfied with this vaguepromise.It was at this time that Pascal and Clotilde ceased to secludethemselves. Not through any spirit of bravado, not because they wishedto answer ugly rumors by making a display of their happiness, but as anatural amplification of their joy; their love had slowly acquired theneed of expansion and of space, at first beyond the house, then beyondthe garden, into the town, as far as the whole vast horizon. It filledeverything; it took in the whole world.The doctor then tranquilly resumed his visits, and he took the younggirl with him. They walked together along the promenades, along thestreets, she on his arm, in a light gown, with flowers in her hat, hebuttoned up in his coat with his broad-brimmed hat. He was all white;she all blond. They walked with their heads high, erect and smiling,radiating such happiness that they seemed to walk in a halo. At firstthe excitement was extraordinary. The shopkeepers came and stood attheir doors, the women leaned out of the windows, the passers-by stoppedto look after them. People whispered and laughed and pointed to them.Then they were so handsome; he superb and triumphant, she so youthful,so submissive, and so proud, that an involuntary indulgence graduallygained on every one. People could not help defending them and lovingthem, and they ended by smiling on them in a delightful contagion oftenderness. A charm emanated from them which brought back all hearts tothem. The new town, with its _bourgeois_ population of functionariesand townspeople who had grown wealthy, was the last conquest. But theQuartier St. Marc, in spite of its austerity, showed itself at once kindand discreetly tolerant when they walked along its deserted grass-wornsidewalks, beside the antique houses, now closed and silent, whichexhaled the evaporated perfume of the loves of other days. But it wasthe old quarter, more especially, that promptly received them withcordiality, this quarter of which the common people, instinctivelytouched, felt the grace of the legend, the profound myth of the couple,the beautiful young girl supporting the royal and rejuvenated master.The doctor was adored here for his goodness, and his companion quicklybecame popular, and was greeted with tokens of admiration and approvalas soon as she appeared. They, meantime, if they had seemed ignorantof the former hostility, now divined easily the forgiveness and theindulgent tenderness which surrounded them, and this made them morebeautiful; their happiness charmed the entire town.One afternoon, as Pascal and Clotilde turned the corner of the Rue de laBanne, they perceived Dr. Ramond on the opposite side of the street. Ithad chanced that they had learned the day before that he had asked andhad obtained the hand of Mlle. Leveque, the advocate's daughter. It wascertainly the most sensible course he could have taken, for his businessinterests made it advisable that he should marry, and the young girl,who was very pretty and very rich, loved him. He, too, would certainlylove her in time. Therefore Clotilde joyfully smiled her congratulationsto him as a sincere friend. Pascal saluted him with an affectionategesture. For a moment Ramond, a little moved by the meeting, stoodperplexed. His first impulse seemed to have been to cross over to them.But a feeling of delicacy must have prevented him, the thought that itwould be brutal to interrupt their dream, to break in upon this solitude_a deux_, in which they moved, even amid the elbowings of the street.And he contented himself with a friendly salutation, a smile in which heforgave them their happiness. This was very pleasant for all three.At this time Clotilde amused herself for several days by paintinga large pastel representing the tender scene of old King David andAbishag, the young Shunammite. It was a dream picture, one of thosefantastic compositions into which her other self, her romantic self, puther love of the mysterious. Against a background of flowers thrown onthe canvas, flowers that looked like a shower of stars, of barbaricrichness, the old king stood facing the spectator, his hand resting onthe bare shoulder of Abishag. He was attired sumptuously in a robe heavywith precious stones, that fell in straight folds, and he wore the royalfillet on his snowy locks. But she was more sumptuous still, with onlythe lilylike satin of her skin, her tall, slender figure, her round,slender throat, her supple arms, divinely graceful. He reigned over, heleaned, as a powerful and beloved master, on this subject, chosen fromamong all others, so proud of having been chosen, so rejoiced to give toher king the rejuvenating gift of her youth. All her pure and triumphantbeauty expressed the serenity of her submission, the tranquillity withwhich she gave herself, before the assembled people, in the full lightof day. And he was very great and she was very fair, and there radiatedfrom both a starry radiance.Up to the last moment Clotilde had left the faces of the two figuresvaguely outlined in a sort of mist. Pascal, standing behind her, jestedwith her to hide his emotion, for he fancied he divined her intention.And it was as he thought; she finished the faces with a few strokes ofthe crayon--old King David was he, and she was Abishag, the Shunammite.But they were enveloped in a dreamlike brightness, it was themselvesdeified; the one with hair all white, the other with hair all blond,covering them like an imperial mantle, with features lengthened byecstasy, exalted to the bliss of angels, with the glance and the smileof immortal youth."Ah, dear!" he cried, "you have made us too beautiful; you have wanderedoff again to dreamland--yes, as in the days, do you remember, when Iused to scold you for putting there all the fantastic flowers of theUnknown?"And he pointed to the walls, on which bloomed the fantastic _parterre_of the old pastels, flowers not of the earth, grown in the soil ofparadise.But she protested gayly."Too beautiful? We could not be too beautiful! I assure you it is thusthat I picture us to myself, thus that I see us; and thus it is that weare. There! see if it is not the pure reality."She took the old fifteenth century Bible which was beside her, andshowed him the simple wood engraving."You see it is exactly the same."He smiled gently at this tranquil and extraordinary affirmation."Oh, you laugh, you look only at the details of the picture. It isthe spirit which it is necessary to penetrate. And look at the otherengravings, it is the same theme in all--Abraham and Hagar, Ruth andBoaz. And you see they are all handsome and happy."Then they ceased to laugh, leaning over the old Bible whose pages sheturned with her white fingers, he standing behind her, his white beardmingling with her blond, youthful tresses.Suddenly he whispered to her softly:"But you, so young, do you never regret that you have chosen me--me, whoam so old, as old as the world?"She gave a start of surprise, and turning round looked at him."You old! No, you are young, younger than I!"And she laughed so joyously that he, too, could not help smiling. But heinsisted a little tremulously:"You do not answer me. Do you not sometimes desire a younger lover, youwho are so youthful?"She put up her lips and kissed him, saying in a low voice:"I have but one desire, to be loved--loved as you love me, above andbeyond everything."The day on which Martine saw the pastel nailed to the wall, she lookedat it a moment in silence, then she made the sign of the cross, butwhether it was because she had seen God or the devil, no one couldsay. A few days before Easter she had asked Clotilde if she wouldnot accompany her to church, and the latter having made a sign in thenegative, she departed for an instant from the deferential silence whichshe now habitually maintained. Of all the new things whichastonished her in the house, what most astonished her was the suddenirreligiousness of her young mistress. So she allowed herself to resumeher former tone of remonstrance, and to scold her as she used to do whenshe was a little girl and refused to say her prayers. "Had she no longerthe fear of the Lord before her, then? Did she no longer tremble at theidea of going to hell, to burn there forever?"Clotilde could not suppress a smile."Oh, hell! you know that it has never troubled me a great deal. But youare mistaken if you think I am no longer religious. If I have left offgoing to church it is because I perform my devotions elsewhere, that isall."Martine looked at her, open-mouthed, not comprehending her. It was allover; mademoiselle was indeed lost. And she never again asked her toaccompany her to St. Saturnin. But her own devotion increased until itat last became a mania. She was no longer to be met, as before, with theeternal stocking in her hand which she knitted even when walking, whennot occupied in her household duties. Whenever she had a moment tospare, she ran to church and remained there, repeating endless prayers.One day when old Mme. Rougon, always on the alert, found her behind apillar, an hour after she had seen her there before, Martine excusedherself, blushing like a servant who had been caught idling, saying:"I was praying for monsieur."Meanwhile Pascal and Clotilde enlarged still more their domain, takinglonger and longer walks every day, extending them now outside thetown into the open country. One afternoon, as they were going to LaSeguiranne, they were deeply moved, passing by the melancholy fieldswhere the enchanted gardens of Le Paradou had formerly extended. Thevision of Albine rose before them. Pascal saw her again blooming likethe spring, in the rejuvenation which this living flower had broughthim too, feeling the pressure of this pure arm against his heart. Nevercould he have believed, he who had already thought himself very old whenhe used to enter this garden to give a smile to the little fairy within,that she would have been dead for years when life, the good mother,should bestow upon him the gift of so fresh a spring, sweetening hisdeclining years. And Clotilde, having felt the vision rise before them,lifted up her face to his in a renewed longing for tenderness. She wasAlbine, the eternal lover. He kissed her on the lips, and though no wordhad been uttered, the level fields sown with corn and oats, where LeParadou had once rolled its billows of luxuriant verdure, thrilled insympathy.Pascal and Clotilde were now walking along the dusty road, through thebare and arid country. They loved this sun-scorched land, these fieldsthinly planted with puny almond trees and dwarf olives, these stretchesof bare hills dotted with country houses, that showed on them like palepatches accentuated by the dark bars of the secular cypresses. It waslike an antique landscape, one of those classic landscapes representedin the paintings of the old schools, with harsh coloring and wellbalanced and majestic lines. All the ardent sunshine of successivesummers that had parched this land flowed through their veins, and lentthem a new beauty and animation, as they walked under the sky foreverblue, glowing with the clear flame of eternal love. She, protected fromthe sun by her straw hat, bloomed and luxuriated in this bath of lightlike a tropical flower, while he, in his renewed youth, felt the burningsap of the soil ascend into his veins in a flood of virile joy.This walk to La Seguiranne had been an idea of the doctor's, who hadlearned through Aunt Dieudonne of the approaching marriage of Sophie toa young miller of the neighborhood; and he desired to see if everyone was well and happy in this retired corner. All at once they wererefreshed by a delightful coolness as they entered the avenue of tallgreen oaks. On either side the springs, the mothers of these giant shadetrees, flowed on in their eternal course. And when they reached thehouse of the shrew they came, as chance would have it, upon the twolovers, Sophie and her miller, kissing each other beside the well; forthe girl's aunt had just gone down to the lavatory behind the willowsof the Viorne. Confused, the couple stood in blushing silence. But thedoctor and his companion laughed indulgently, and the lovers, reassured,told them that the marriage was set for St. John's Day, which was a longway off, to be sure, but which would come all the same. Sophie, savedfrom the hereditary malady, had improved in health and beauty, and wasgrowing as strong as one of the trees that stood with their feet in themoist grass beside the springs, and their heads bare to the sunshine.Ah, the vast, glowing sky, what life it breathed into all createdthings! She had but one grief, and tears came to her eyes when she spokeof her brother Valentin, who perhaps would not live through the week.She had had news of him the day before; he was past hope. And the doctorwas obliged to prevaricate a little to console her, for he himselfexpected hourly the inevitable termination. When he and his companionleft La Seguiranne they returned slowly to Plassans, touched by thishappy, healthy love saddened by the chill of death.In the old quarter a woman whom Pascal was attending informed him thatValentin had just died. Two of the neighbors were obliged to take awayLa Guiraude, who, half-crazed, clung, shrieking, to her son's body. Thedoctor entered the house, leaving Clotilde outside. At last, they againtook their way to La Souleiade in silence. Since Pascal had resumedhis visits he seemed to make them only through professional duty; he nolonger became enthusiastic about the miracles wrought by his treatment.But as far as Valentin's death was concerned, he was surprised thatit had not occurred before; he was convinced that he had prolongedthe patient's life for at least a year. In spite of the extraordinaryresults which he had obtained at first, he knew well that death was theinevitable end. That he had held it in check for months ought then tohave consoled him and soothed his remorse, still unassuaged, for havinginvoluntarily caused the death of Lafouasse, a few weeks sooner than itwould otherwise have occurred. But this did not seem to be the case,and his brow was knitted in a frown as they returned to their belovedsolitude. But there a new emotion awaited him; sitting under the planetrees, whither Martine had sent him, he saw Sarteur, the hatter,the inmate of the Tulettes whom he had been so long treating by hishypodermic injections, and the experiment so zealously continued seemedto have succeeded. The injections of nerve substance had evidently givenstrength to his will, since the madman was here, having left the asylumthat morning, declaring that he no longer had any attacks, that he wasentirely cured of the homicidal mania that impelled him to throw himselfupon any passer-by to strangle him. The doctor looked at him as hespoke. He was a small dark man, with a retreating forehead and aquilinefeatures, with one cheek perceptibly larger than the other. He wasperfectly quiet and rational, and filled with so lively a gratitude thathe kissed his saviour's hands. The doctor could not help being greatlyaffected by all this, and he dismissed the man kindly, advising him toreturn to his life of labor, which was the best hygiene, physical andmoral. Then he recovered his calmness and sat down to table, talkinggaily of other matters.Clotilde looked at him with astonishment and even with a littleindignation."What is the matter, master?" she said. "You are no longer satisfiedwith yourself.""Oh, with myself I am never satisfied!" he answered jestingly. "And withmedicine, you know--it is according to the day."It was on this night that they had their first quarrel. She was angrywith him because he no longer had any pride in his profession. Shereturned to her complaint of the afternoon, reproaching him for nottaking more credit to himself for the cure of Sarteur, and even for theprolongation of Valentin's life. It was she who now had a passion forhis fame. She reminded him of his cures; had he not cured himself? Couldhe deny the efficacy of his treatment? A thrill ran through him ashe recalled the great dream which he had once cherished--to combatdebility, the sole cause of disease; to cure suffering humanity; to makea higher, and healthy humanity; to hasten the coming of happiness, thefuture kingdom of perfection and felicity, by intervening and givinghealth to all! And he possessed the liquor of life, the universalpanacea which opened up this immense hope!Pascal was silent for a moment. Then he murmured:"It is true. I cured myself, I have cured others, and I still think thatmy injections are efficacious in many cases. I do not deny medicine.Remorse for a deplorable accident, like that of Lafouasse, does notrender me unjust. Besides, work has been my passion, it is in work thatI have up to this time spent my energies; it was in wishing to prove tomyself the possibility of making decrepit humanity one day strong andintelligent that I came near dying lately. Yes, a dream, a beautifuldream!""No, no! a reality, the reality of your genius, master."Then, lowering his voice almost to a whisper, he breathed thisconfession:"Listen, I am going to say to you what I would say to no one else inthe world, what I would not say to myself aloud. To correct nature, tointerfere, in order to modify it and thwart it in its purpose, is thisa laudable task? To cure the individual, to retard his death, for hispersonal pleasure, to prolong his existence, doubtless to the injury ofthe species, is not this to defeat the aims of nature? And have we theright to desire a stronger, a healthier humanity, modeled after our ideaof health and strength? What have we to do in the matter? Why should weinterfere in this work of life, neither the means nor the end of whichare known to us? Perhaps everything is as it ought to be. Perhaps weshould risk killing love, genius, life itself. Remember, I make theconfession to you alone; but doubt has taken possession of me, I trembleat the thought of my twentieth century alchemy. I have come to believethat it is greater and wiser to allow evolution to take its course."He paused; then he added so softly that she could scarcely hear him:"Do you know that instead of nerve-substance I often use only water withmy patients. You no longer hear me grinding for days at a time. I toldyou that I had some of the liquor in reserve. Water soothes them,this is no doubt simply a mechanical effect. Ah! to soothe, to preventsuffering--that indeed I still desire! It is perhaps my greatestweakness, but I cannot bear to see any one suffer. Suffering puts mebeside myself, it seems a monstrous and useless cruelty of nature. Ipractise now only to prevent suffering.""Then, master," she asked, in the same indistinct murmur, "if you nolonger desire to cure, do you still think everything must be told? Forthe frightful necessity of displaying the wounds of humanity had noother excuse than the hope of curing them.""Yes, yes, it is necessary to know, in every case, and to concealnothing; to tell everything regarding things and individuals. Happinessis no longer possible in ignorance; certainty alone makes life tranquil.When people know more they will doubtless accept everything. Do you notcomprehend that to desire to cure everything, to regenerate everythingis a false ambition inspired by our egotism, a revolt against life,which we declare to be bad, because we judge it from the point of viewof self-interest? I know that I am more tranquil, that my intellect hasbroadened and deepened ever since I have held evolution in respect. Itis my love of life which triumphs, even to the extent of not questioningits purpose, to the extent of confiding absolutely in it, of losingmyself in it, without wishing to remake it according to my ownconception of good and evil. Life alone is sovereign, life alone knowsits aim and its end. I can only try to know it in order to live it as itshould be lived. And this I have understood only since I have possessedyour love. Before I possessed it I sought the truth elsewhere, Istruggled with the fixed idea of saving the world. You have come, andlife is full; the world is saved every hour by love, by the immense andincessant labor of all that live and love throughout space. Impeccablelife, omnipotent life, immortal life!"They continued to talk together in low tones for some time longer,planning an idyllic life, a calm and healthful existence in the country.It was in this simple prescription of an invigorating environment thatthe experiments of the physician ended. He exclaimed against cities.People could be well and happy only in the country, in the sunshine, onthe condition of renouncing money, ambition, even the proud excesses ofintellectual labor. They should do nothing but live and love, cultivatethe soil, and bring up their children.IX.Dr. Pascal then resumed his professional visits in the town and thesurrounding country. And he was generally accompanied by Clotilde,who went with him into the houses of the poor, where she, too, broughthealth and cheerfulness.But, as he had one night confessed to her in secret, his visits were nowonly visits of relief and consolation. If he had before practised withrepugnance it was because he had felt how vain was medical science.Empiricism disheartened him. From the moment that medicine ceased to bean experimental science and became an art, he was filled with disquietat the thought of the infinite variety of diseases and of theirremedies, according to the constitution of the patient. Treatmentchanged with every new hypothesis; how many people, then, must themethods now abandoned have killed! The perspicacity of the physicianbecame everything, the healer was only a happily endowed diviner,himself groping in the dark and effecting cures through his fortunateendowment. And this explained why he had given up his patients almostaltogether, after a dozen years of practise, to devote himself entirelyto study. Then, when his great labors on heredity had restored to himfor a time the hope of intervening and curing disease by his hypodermicinjections, he had become again enthusiastic, until the day when hisfaith in life, after having impelled him, to aid its action in this way,by restoring the vital forces, became still broader and gave him thehigher conviction that life was self-sufficing, that it was the onlygiver of health and strength, in spite of everything. And he continuedto visit, with his tranquil smile, only those of his patients whoclamored for him loudly, and who found themselves miraculously relievedwhen he injected into them only pure water.Clotilde now sometimes allowed herself to jest about these hypodermicinjections. She was still at heart, however, a fervent worshiper of hisskill; and she said jestingly that if he performed miracles as he did itwas because he had in himself the godlike power to do so. Then he wouldreply jestingly, attributing to her the efficacy of their common visits,saying that he cured no one now when she was absent, that it was shewho brought the breath of life, the unknown and necessary force from theBeyond. So that the rich people, the _bourgeois_, whose houses she didnot enter, continued to groan without his being able to relieve them.And this affectionate dispute diverted them; they set out each time asif for new discoveries, they exchanged glances of kindly intelligencewith the sick. Ah, this wretched suffering which revolted them, andwhich was now all they went to combat; how happy they were when theythought it vanquished! They were divinely recompensed when they saw thecold sweats disappear, the moaning lips become stilled, the deathlikefaces recover animation. It was assuredly the love which they brought tothis humble, suffering humanity that produced the alleviation."To die is nothing; that is in the natural order of things," Pascalwould often say. "But why suffer? It is cruel and unnecessary!"One afternoon the doctor was going with the young girl to the littlevillage of Sainte-Marthe to see a patient, and at the station, for theywere going by train, so as to spare Bonhomme, they had a reencounter.The train which they were waiting for was from the Tulettes.Sainte-Marthe was the first station in the opposite direction, going toMarseilles. When the train arrived, they hurried on board and, openingthe door of a compartment which they thought empty, they saw old Mme.Rougon about to leave it. She did not speak to them, but passing themby, sprang down quickly in spite of her age, and walked away with astiff and haughty air."It is the 1st of July," said Clotilde when the train had started."Grandmother is returning from the Tulettes, after making her monthlyvisit to Aunt Dide. Did you see the glance she cast at me?"Pascal was at heart glad of the quarrel with his mother, which freed himfrom the continual annoyance of her visits."Bah!" he said simply, "when people cannot agree it is better for themnot to see each other."But the young girl remained troubled and thoughtful. After a few momentsshe said in an undertone:"I thought her changed--looking paler. And did you notice? she who isusually so carefully dressed had only one glove on--a yellow glove, onthe right hand. I don't know why it was, but she made me feel sick atheart."Pascal, who was also disturbed, made a vague gesture. His mother wouldno doubt grow old at last, like everybody else. But she was very active,very full of fire still. She was thinking, he said, of bequeathingher fortune to the town of Plassans, to build a house of refuge, whichshould bear the name of Rougon. Both had recovered their gaiety when hecried suddenly:"Why, it is to-morrow that you and I are to go to the Tulettes to seeour patients. And you know that I promised to take Charles to UncleMacquart's."Felicite was in fact returning from the Tulettes, where she wentregularly on the first of every month to inquire after Aunt Dide. Formany years past she had taken a keen interest in the madwoman's health,amazed to see her lasting so long, and furious with her for persistingin living so far beyond the common term of life, until she had become avery prodigy of longevity. What a relief, the fine morning on whichthey should put under ground this troublesome witness of the past, thisspecter of expiation and of waiting, who brought living before her theabominations of the family! When so many others had been taken she, whowas demented and who had only a spark of life left in her eyes, seemedforgotten. On this day she had found her as usual, skeleton-like, stiffand erect in her armchair. As the keeper said, there was now no reasonwhy she should ever die. She was a hundred and five years old.When she left the asylum Felicite was furious. She thought of UncleMacquart. Another who troubled her, who persisted in living withexasperating obstinacy! Although he was only eighty-four years old,three years older than herself, she thought him ridiculously aged, pastthe allotted term of life. And a man who led so dissipated a life, whohad gone to bed dead drunk every night for the last sixty years!The good and the sober were taken away; he flourished in spite ofeverything, blooming with health and gaiety. In days past, just afterhe had settled at the Tulettes, she had made him presents of wines,liqueurs and brandy, in the unavowed hope of ridding the family of afellow who was really disreputable, and from whom they had nothing toexpect but annoyance and shame. But she had soon perceived that all thisliquor served, on the contrary, to keep up his health and spirits andhis sarcastic humor, and she had left off making him presents, seeingthat he throve on what she had hoped would prove a poison to him. Shehad cherished a deadly hatred toward him since then. She would havekilled him if she had dared, every time she saw him, standing firmly onhis drunken legs, and laughing at her to her face, knowing well that shewas watching for his death, and triumphant because he did not give herthe pleasure of burying with him all the old dirty linen of the family,the blood and mud of the two conquests of Plassans."You see, Felicite," he would often say to her with his air of wickedmockery, "I am here to take care of the old mother, and the day onwhich we both make up our minds to die it would be through complimentto you--yes, simply to spare you the trouble of running to see us sogood-naturedly, in this way, every month."Generally she did not now give herself the disappointment of going toMacquart's, but inquired for him at the asylum. But on this occasion,having learned there that he was passing through an extraordinary attackof drunkenness, not having drawn a sober breath for a fortnight, andso intoxicated that he was probably unable to leave the house, she wasseized with the curiosity to learn for herself what his condition reallywas. And as she was going back to the station, she went out of her wayin order to stop at Macquart's house.The day was superb--a warm and brilliant summer day. On either side ofthe path which she had taken, she saw the fields that she had given himin former days--all this fertile land, the price of his secrecy and hisgood behavior. Before her appeared the house, with its pink tiles andits bright yellow walls, looking gay in the sunshine. Under the ancientmulberry trees on the terrace she enjoyed the delightful coolness andthe beautiful view. What a pleasant and safe retreat, what a happysolitude was this for an old man to end in joy and peace a long andwell-spent life!But she did not see him, she did not hear him. The silence was profound.The only sound to be heard was the humming of the bees circling aroundthe tall marshmallows. And on the terrace there was nothing to be seenbut a little yellow dog, stretched at full length on the bare ground,seeking the coolness of the shade. He raised his head growling, about tobark, but, recognizing the visitor, he lay down again quietly.Then, in this peaceful and sunny solitude she was seized with a strangechill, and she called:"Macquart! Macquart!"The door of the house under the mulberry trees stood wide open. But shedid not dare to go in; this empty house with its wide open door gave hera vague uneasiness. And she called again:"Macquart! Macquart!"Not a sound, not a breath. Profound silence reigned again, but thehumming of the bees circling around the tall marshmallows sounded louderthan before.At last Felicite, ashamed of her fears, summoned courage to enter. Thedoor on the left of the hall, opening into the kitchen, where UncleMacquart generally sat, was closed. She pushed it open, but she coulddistinguish nothing at first, as the blinds had been closed, probablyin order to shut out the heat. Her first sensation was one of choking,caused by an overpowering odor of alcohol which filled the room; everyarticle of furniture seemed to exude this odor, the whole house wasimpregnated with it. At last, when her eyes had become accustomed to thesemi-obscurity, she perceived Macquart. He was seated at the table,on which were a glass and a bottle of spirits of thirty-six degrees,completely empty. Settled in his chair, he was sleeping profoundly, deaddrunk. This spectacle revived her anger and contempt."Come, Macquart," she cried, "is it not vile and senseless to put one'sself in such a state! Wake up, I say, this is shameful!"His sleep was so profound that she could not even hear him breathing. Invain she raised her voice, and slapped him smartly on the hands."Macquart! Macquart! Macquart! Ah, faugh! You are disgusting, my dear!"Then she left him, troubling herself no further about him, and walkedaround the room, evidently seeking something. Coming down the dusky roadfrom the asylum she had been seized with a consuming thirst, and shewished to get a glass of water. Her gloves embarrassed her, and she tookthem off and put them on a corner of the table. Then she succeeded infinding the jug, and she washed a glass and filled it to the brim, andwas about to empty it when she saw an extraordinary sight--a sight whichagitated her so greatly that she set the glass down again beside hergloves, without drinking.By degrees she had begun to see objects more clearly in the room, whichwas lighted dimly by a few stray sunbeams that filtered through thecracks of the old shutters. She now saw Uncle Macquart distinctly,neatly dressed in a blue cloth suit, as usual, and on his head theeternal fur cap which he wore from one year's end to the other. He hadgrown stout during the last five or six years, and he looked like averitable mountain of flesh overlaid with rolls of fat. And she noticedthat he must have fallen asleep while smoking, for his pipe--a shortblack pipe--had fallen into his lap. Then she stood still, stupefiedwith amazement--the burning tobacco had been scattered in the fall, andthe cloth of the trousers had caught fire, and through a hole in thestuff, as large already as a hundred-sous piece, she saw the bare thigh,whence issued a little blue flame.At first Felicite had thought that it was linen--the drawers or theshirt--that was burning. But soon doubt was no longer possible, she sawdistinctly the bare flesh and the little blue flame issuing from it,lightly dancing, like a flame wandering over the surface of a vessel oflighted alcohol. It was as yet scarcely higher than the flame of a nightlight, pale and soft, and so unstable that the slightest breath of aircaused it to change its place. But it increased and spread rapidly, andthe skin cracked and the fat began to melt.An involuntary cry escaped from Felicite's throat."Macquart! Macquart!"But still he did not stir. His insensibility must have been complete;intoxication must have produced a sort of coma, in which there was anabsolute paralysis of sensation, for he was living, his breast could beseen rising and falling, in slow and even respiration."Macquart! Macquart!"Now the fat was running through the cracks of the skin, feeding theflame, which was invading the abdomen. And Felicite comprehended vaguelythat Uncle Macquart was burning before her like a sponge soaked withbrandy. He had, indeed, been saturated with it for years past, andof the strongest and most inflammable kind. He would no doubt soon beblazing from head to foot, like a bowl of punch.Then she ceased to try to awaken him, since he was sleeping so soundly.For a full minute she had the courage to look at him, awe-stricken,but gradually coming to a determination. Her hands, however, beganto tremble, with a little shiver which she could not control. She waschoking, and taking up the glass of water again with both hands, sheemptied it at a draught. And she was going away on tiptoe, when sheremembered her gloves. She went back, groped for them anxiously on thetable and, as she thought, picked them both up. Then she left the room,closing the door behind her carefully, and as gently as if she wereafraid of disturbing some one.When she found herself once more on the terrace, in the cheerfulsunshine and the pure air, in face of the vast horizon bathed in light,she heaved a sigh of relief. The country was deserted; no one could haveseen her entering or leaving the house. Only the yellow dog was stillstretched there, and he did not even deign to look up. And she wentaway with her quick, short step, her youthful figure lightly swaying. Ahundred steps away, an irresistible impulse compelled her to turn roundto give a last look at the house, so tranquil and so cheerful on thehillside, in the declining light of the beautiful day.Only when she was in the train and went to put on her gloves did sheperceive that one of them was missing. But she supposed that it hadfallen on the platform at the station as she was getting into the car.She believed herself to be quite calm, but she remained with one handgloved and one hand bare, which, with her, could only be the result ofgreat agitation.On the following day Pascal and Clotilde took the three o'clock train togo to the Tulettes. The mother of Charles, the harness-maker's wife,had brought the boy to them, as they had offered to take him to UncleMacquart's, where he was to remain for the rest of the week. Freshquarrels had disturbed the peace of the household, the husband havingresolved to tolerate no longer in his house another man's child, thatdo-nothing, imbecile prince's son. As it was Grandmother Rougon who haddressed him, he was, indeed, dressed on this day, again, in black velvettrimmed with gold braid, like a young lord, a page of former times goingto court. And during the quarter of an hour which the journey lasted,Clotilde amused herself in the compartment, in which they were alone,by taking off his cap and smoothing his beautiful blond locks, hisroyal hair that fell in curls over his shoulders. She had a ring on herfinger, and as she passed her hand over his neck she was startled toperceive that her caress had left behind it a trace of blood. Onecould not touch the boy's skin without the red dew exuding from it;the tissues had become so lax through extreme degeneration that theslightest scratch brought on a hemorrhage. The doctor became at onceuneasy, and asked him if he still bled at the nose as frequently asformerly. Charles hardly knew what to answer; first saying no, then,recollecting himself, he said that he had bled a great deal the otherday. He seemed, indeed, weaker; he grew more childish as he grew older;his intelligence, which had never developed, had become clouded. Thistall boy of fifteen, so beautiful, so girlish-looking, with the color ofa flower that had grown in the shade, did not look ten.At the Tulettes Pascal decided that they would first take the boy toUncle Macquart's. They ascended the steep road. In the distance thelittle house looked gay in the sunshine, as it had looked on the daybefore, with its yellow walls and its green mulberry trees extendingtheir twisted branches and covering the terrace with a thick, leafyroof. A delightful sense of peace pervaded this solitary spot, thissage's retreat, where the only sound to be heard was the humming of thebees, circling round the tall marshmallows."Ah, that rascal of an uncle!" said Pascal, smiling, "how I envy him!"But he was surprised not to have already seen him standing at the edgeof the terrace. And as Charles had run off dragging Clotilde with him tosee the rabbits, as he said, the doctor continued the ascent alone, andwas astonished when he reached the top to see no one. The blinds wereclosed, the hill door yawned wide open. Only the yellow dog was at thethreshold, his legs stiff, his hair bristling, howling with a low andcontinuous moan. When he saw the visitor, whom he no doubt recognized,approaching, he stopped howling for an instant and went and stoodfurther off, then he began again to whine softly.Pascal, filled with apprehension, could not keep back the uneasy crythat rose to his lips:"Macquart! Macquart!"No one answered; a deathlike silence reigned over the house, with itsdoor yawning wide open, like the mouth of a cavern. The dog continued tohowl.Then Pascal grew impatient, and cried more loudly."Macquart! Macquart!"There was not a stir; the bees hummed, the sky looked down serenely onthe peaceful scene. Then he hesitated no longer. Perhaps Macquart wasasleep. But the instant he pushed open the door of the kitchen on theleft of the hall, a horrible odor escaped from it, an odor of burnedflesh and bones. When he entered the room he could hardly breathe, sofilled was it by a thick vapor, a stagnant and nauseous cloud, whichchoked and blinded him. The sunbeams that filtered through the cracksmade only a dim light. He hurried to the fireplace, thinking thatperhaps there had been a fire, but the fireplace was empty, and thearticles of furniture around appeared to be uninjured. Bewildered, andfeeling himself growing faint in the poisoned atmosphere, he ran to thewindow and threw the shutters wide open. A flood of light entered.Then the scene presented to the doctor's view filled him with amazement.Everything was in its place; the glass and the empty bottle of spiritswere on the table; only the chair in which Uncle Macquart must have beensitting bore traces of fire, the front legs were blackened and the strawwas partially consumed. What had become of Macquart? Where could hehave disappeared? In front of the chair, on the brick floor, which wassaturated with grease, there was a little heap of ashes, beside whichlay the pipe--a black pipe, which had not even broken in falling. All ofUncle Macquart was there, in this handful of fine ashes; and he was inthe red cloud, also, which floated through the open window; in the layerof soot which carpeted the entire kitchen; the horrible grease of burntflesh, enveloping everything, sticky and foul to the touch.It was the finest case of spontaneous combustion physician had everseen. The doctor had, indeed, read in medical papers of surprisingcases, among others that of a shoemaker's wife, a drunken woman who hadfallen asleep over her foot warmer, and of whom they had found onlya hand and foot. He had, until now, put little faith in these cases,unwilling to admit, like the ancients, that a body impregnatedwith alcohol could disengage an unknown gas, capable of taking firespontaneously and consuming the flesh and the bones. But he denied thetruth of them no longer; besides, everything became clear to him ashe reconstructed the scene--the coma of drunkenness producing absoluteinsensibility; the pipe falling on the clothes, which had taken fire;the flesh, saturated with liquor, burning and cracking; the fat melting,part of it running over the ground and part of it aiding the combustion,and all, at last--muscles, organs, and bones--consumed in a generalblaze. Uncle Macquart was all there, with his blue cloth suit, and hisfur cap, which he wore from one year's end to the other. Doubtless, assoon as he had begun to burn like a bonfire he had fallen forward, whichwould account for the chair being only blackened; and nothing of him wasleft, not a bone, not a tooth, not a nail, nothing but this little heapof gray dust which the draught of air from the door threatened at everymoment to sweep away.Clotilde had meanwhile entered, Charles remaining outside, his attentionattracted by the continued howling of the dog."Good Heavens, what a smell!" she cried. "What is the matter?"When Pascal explained to her the extraordinary catastrophe that hadtaken place, she shuddered. She took up the bottle to examine it, butshe put it down again with horror, feeling it moist and sticky withUncle Macquart's flesh. Nothing could be touched, the smallest objectswere coated, as it were, with this yellowish grease which stuck to thehands.A shudder of mingled awe and disgust passed through her, and she burstinto tears, faltering:"What a sad death! What a horrible death!"Pascal had recovered from his first shock, and he was almost smiling."Why horrible? He was eighty-four years old; he did not suffer. As forme, I think it a superb death for that old rascal of an uncle, who, itmay be now said, did not lead a very exemplary life. You remember hisenvelope; he had some very terrible and vile things upon his conscience,which did not prevent him, however, from settling down later and growingold, surrounded by every comfort, like an old humbug, receiving therecompense of virtues which he did not possess. And here he lies likethe prince of drunkards, burning up of himself, consumed on the burningfuneral pile of his own body!"And the doctor waved his hand in admiration."Just think of it. To be drunk to the point of not feeling that one ison fire; to set one's self aflame, like a bonfire on St. John's day; todisappear in smoke to the last bone. Think of Uncle Macquart startingon his journey through space; first diffused through the four corners ofthe room, dissolved in air and floating about, bathing all that belongedto him; then escaping in a cloud of dust through the window, when Iopened it for him, soaring up into the sky, filling the horizon. Why,that is an admirable death! To disappear, to leave nothing of himselfbehind but a little heap of ashes and a pipe beside it!"And he picked up the pipe to keep it, as he said, as a relic of UncleMacquart; while Clotilde, who thought she perceived a touch of bittermockery in his eulogistic rhapsody, shuddered anew with horror anddisgust. But suddenly she perceived something under the table--part ofthe remains, perhaps."Look at that fragment there."He stooped down and picked up with surprise a woman's glove, a yellowglove."Why!" she cried, "it is grandmother's glove; the glove that was missinglast evening."They looked at each other; by a common impulse the same explanationrose to their lips, Felicite was certainly there yesterday; and a suddenconviction forced itself on the doctor's mind--the conviction that hismother had seen Uncle Macquart burning and that she had not quenchedhim. Various indications pointed to this--the state of complete coolnessin which he found the room, the number of hours which he calculated tohave been necessary for the combustion of the body. He saw clearly thesame thought dawning in the terrified eyes of his companion. But as itseemed impossible that they should ever know the truth, he fabricatedaloud the simplest explanation:"No doubt your grandmother came in yesterday on her way back fromthe asylum, to say good day to Uncle Macquart, before he had begundrinking.""Let us go away! let us go away!" cried Clotilde. "I am stifling here; Icannot remain here!"Pascal, too, wished to go and give information of the death. He went outafter her, shut up the house, and put the key in his pocket. Outside,they heard the little yellow dog still howling. He had taken refugebetween Charles' legs, and the boy amused himself pushing him with hisfoot and listening to him whining, without comprehending.The doctor went at once to the house of M. Maurin, the notary at theTulettes, who was also mayor of the commune. A widower for ten yearspast, and living with his daughter, who was a childless widow, he hadmaintained neighborly relations with old Macquart, and had occasionallykept little Charles with him for several days at a time, his daughterhaving become interested in the boy who was so handsome and so muchto be pitied. M. Maurin, horrified at the news, went at once with thedoctor to draw up a statement of the accident, and promised to make outthe death certificate in due form. As for religious ceremonies, funeralobsequies, they seemed scarcely possible. When they entered the kitchenthe draught from the door scattered the ashes about, and when theypiously attempted to collect them again they succeeded only in gatheringtogether the scrapings of the flags, a collection of accumulated dirt,in which there could be but little of Uncle Macquart. What, then,could they bury? It was better to give up the idea. So they gave itup. Besides, Uncle Macquart had been hardly a devout Catholic, and thefamily contented themselves with causing masses to be said later on forthe repose of his soul.The notary, meantime, had immediately declared that there existed awill, which had been deposited with him, and he asked Pascal to meet himat his house on the next day but one for the reading; for he thought hemight tell the doctor at once that Uncle Macquart had chosen him ashis executor. And he ended by offering, like a kindhearted man, to keepCharles with him until then, comprehending how greatly the boy, who wasso unwelcome at his mother's, would be in the way in the midst of allthese occurrences. Charles seemed enchanted, and he remained at theTulettes.It was not until very late, until seven o'clock, that Clotilde andPascal were able to take the train to return to Plassans, after thedoctor had at last visited the two patients whom he had to see. Butwhen they returned together to the notary's on the day appointed for themeeting, they had the disagreeable surprise of finding old Mme. Rougoninstalled there. She had naturally learned of Macquart's death, and hadhurried there on the following day, full of excitement, and making agreat show of grief; and she had just made her appearance again to-day,having heard the famous testament spoken of. The reading of the will,however, was a simple matter, unmarked by any incident. Macquarthad left all the fortune that he could dispose of for the purpose oferecting a superb marble monument to himself, with two angels withfolded wings, weeping. It was his own idea, a reminiscence of a similartomb which he had seen abroad--in Germany, perhaps--when he was asoldier. And he had charged his nephew Pascal to superintend theerection of the monument, as he was the only one of the family, he said,who had any taste.During the reading of the will Clotilde had remained in the notary'sgarden, sitting on a bench under the shade of an ancient chestnut tree.When Pascal and Felicite again appeared, there was a moment of greatembarrassment, for they had not spoken to one another for some monthspast. The old lady, however, affected to be perfectly at her ease,making no allusion whatever to the new situation, and giving it to beunderstood that they might very well meet and appear united before theworld, without for that reason entering into an explanation or becomingreconciled. But she committed the mistake of laying too much stresson the great grief which Macquart's death had caused her. Pascal, whosuspected the overflowing joy, the unbounded delight which it gave herto think that this family ulcer was to be at last healed, that thisabominable uncle was at last out of the way, became gradually possessedby an impatience, an indignation, which he could not control. His eyesfastened themselves involuntarily on his mother's gloves, which wereblack.Just then she was expressing her grief in lowered tones:"But how imprudent it was, at his age, to persist in living alone--likea wolf in his lair! If he had only had a servant in the house with him!"Then the doctor, hardly conscious of what he was saying, terrified athearing himself say the words, but impelled by an irresistible force,said:"But, mother, since you were there, why did you not quench him?"Old Mme. Rougon turned frightfully pale. How could her son have known?She looked at him for an instant in open-mouthed amazement; whileClotilde grew as pale as she, in the certainty of the crime, which wasnow evident. It was an avowal, this terrified silence which had fallenbetween the mother, the son, and the granddaughter--the shudderingsilence in which families bury their domestic tragedies. The doctor, indespair at having spoken, he who avoided so carefully all disagreeableand useless explanations, was trying desperately to retract his words,when a new catastrophe extricated him from his terrible embarrassment.Felicite desired to take Charles away with her, in order not to trespasson the notary's kind hospitality; and as the latter had sent the boyafter breakfast to spend an hour or two with Aunt Dide, he had sent themaid servant to the asylum with orders to bring him back immediately. Itwas at this juncture that the servant, whom they were waiting for in thegarden, made her appearance, covered with perspiration, out of breath,and greatly excited, crying from a distance:"My God! My God! come quickly. Master Charles is bathed in blood."Filled with consternation, all three set off for the asylum. This daychanced to be one of Aunt Dide's good days; very calm and gentle she saterect in the armchair in which she had spent the hours, the long hoursfor twenty-two years past, looking straight before her into vacancy. Sheseemed to have grown still thinner, all the flesh had disappeared, herlimbs were now only bones covered with parchment-like skin; and herkeeper, the stout fair-haired girl, carried her, fed her, took herup and laid her down as if she had been a bundle. The ancestress, theforgotten one, tall, bony, ghastly, remained motionless, her eyes, onlyseeming to have life, her eyes shining clear as spring water in her thinwithered face. But on this morning, again a sudden rush of tears hadstreamed down her cheeks, and she had begun to stammer words withoutany connection; which seemed to prove that in the midst of her senileexhaustion and the incurable torpor of madness, the slow induration ofthe brain and the limbs was not yet complete; there still were memoriesstored away, gleams of intelligence still were possible. Then her facehad resumed its vacant expression. She seemed indifferent to every oneand everything, laughing, sometimes, at an accident, at a fall, but mostoften seeing nothing and hearing nothing, gazing fixedly into vacancy.When Charles had been brought to her the keeper had immediatelyinstalled him before the little table, in front of hisgreat-great-grandmother. The girl kept a package of pictures forhim--soldiers, captains, kings clad in purple and gold, and she gavethem to him with a pair of scissors, saying:"There, amuse yourself quietly, and behave well. You see that to-daygrandmother is very good. You must be good, too."The boy raised his eyes to the madwoman's face, and both looked at eachother. At this moment the resemblance between them was extraordinary.Their eyes, especially, their vacant and limpid eyes, seemed to losethemselves in one another, to be identical. Then it was the physiognomy,the whole face, the worn features of the centenarian, that passed overthree generations to this delicate child's face, it, too, worn already,as it were, and aged by the wear of the race. Neither smiled, theyregarded each other intently, with an air of grave imbecility."Well!" continued the keeper, who had acquired the habit of talking toherself to cheer herself when with her mad charge, "you cannot deny eachother. The same hand made you both. You are the very spit-down ofeach other. Come, laugh a bit, amuse yourselves, since you like to betogether."But to fix his attention for any length of time fatigued Charles, andhe was the first to lower his eyes; he seemed to be interested in hispictures, while Aunt Dide, who had an astonishing power of fixing herattention, as if she had been turned into stone, continued to look athim fixedly, without even winking an eyelid.The keeper busied herself for a few moments in the little sunny room,made gay by its light, blue-flowered paper. She made the bed which shehad been airing, she arranged the linen on the shelves of the press.But she generally profited by the presence of the boy to take a littlerelaxation. She had orders never to leave her charge alone, and now thathe was here she ventured to trust her with him."Listen to me well," she went on, "I have to go out for a little, and ifshe stirs, if she should need me, ring for me, call me at once; do youhear? You understand, you are a big enough boy to be able to call one."He had looked up again, and made a sign that he had understood and thathe would call her. And when he found himself alone with Aunt Dide hereturned to his pictures quietly. This lasted for a quarter of an houramid the profound silence of the asylum, broken only at intervals bysome prison sound--a stealthy step, the jingling of a bunch of keys,and occasionally a loud cry, immediately silenced. But the boy must havebeen tired by the excessive heat of the day, for sleep gradually stoleover him. Soon his head, fair as a lily, drooped, and as if weighed downby the too heavy casque of his royal locks, he let it sink gently on thepictures and fell asleep, with his cheek resting on the gold and purplekings. The lashes of his closed eyelids cast a shadow on his delicateskin, with its small blue veins, through which life pulsed feebly. Hewas beautiful as an angel, but with the indefinable corruption of awhole race spread over his countenance. And Aunt Dide looked at him withher vacant stare in which there was neither pleasure nor pain, the stareof eternity contemplating things earthly.At the end of a few moments, however, an expression of interest seemedto dawn in the clear eyes. Something had just happened, a drop of bloodwas forming on the edge of the left nostril of the boy. This drop felland another formed and followed it. It was the blood, the dew of blood,exuding this time, without a scratch, without a bruise, which issuedand flowed of itself in the laxity of the degenerate tissues. The dropsbecame a slender thread which flowed over the gold of the pictures. Alittle pool covered them, and made its way to a corner of the table;then the drops began again, splashing dully one by one upon the floor.And he still slept, with the divinely calm look of a cherub, not evenconscious of the life that was escaping from him; and the madwomancontinued to look at him, with an air of increasing interest, butwithout terror, amused, rather, her attention engaged by this, as by theflight of the big flies, which her gaze often followed for hours.Several minutes more passed, the slender thread had grown larger, thedrops followed one another more rapidly, falling on the floor with amonotonous and persistent drip. And Charles, at one moment, stirred,opened his eyes, and perceived that he was covered with blood. Buthe was not frightened; he was accustomed to this bloody spring, whichissued from him at the slightest cause. He merely gave a sigh ofweariness. Instinct, however, must have warned him, for he moaned moreloudly than before, and called confusedly in stammering accents:"Mamma! mamma!"His weakness was no doubt already excessive, for an irresistible stuporonce more took possession of him, his head dropped, his eyes closed, andhe seemed to fall asleep again, continuing his plaint, as if in a dream,moaning in fainter and fainter accents:"Mamma! mamma!"Now the pictures were inundated; the black velvet jacket and trousers,braided with gold, were stained with long streaks of blood, and thelittle red stream began again to flow persistently from his leftnostril, without stopping, crossed the red pool on the table and fellupon the ground, where it at last formed a veritable lake. A loud cryfrom the madwoman, a terrified call would have sufficed. But she didnot cry, she did not call; motionless, rigid, emaciated, sitting thereforgotten of the world, she gazed with the fixed look of the ancestresswho sees the destinies of her race being accomplished. She sat there asif dried up, bound; her limbs and her tongue tied by her hundred years,her brain ossified by madness, incapable of willing or of acting. Andyet the sight of the little red stream began to stir some feeling inher. A tremor passed over her deathlike countenance, a flush mounted toher cheeks. Finally, a last plaint roused her completely:"Mamma! mamma!"Then it was evident that a terrible struggle was taking place in AuntDide. She carried her skeleton-like hand to her forehead as if she felther brain bursting. Her mouth was wide open, but no sound issuedfrom it; the dreadful tumult that had arisen within her had no doubtparalyzed her tongue. She tried to rise, to run, but she had no longerany muscles; she remained fastened to her seat. All her poor bodytrembled in the superhuman effort which she was making to cry for help,without being able to break the bonds of old age and madness whichheld her prisoner. Her face was distorted with terror; memory graduallyawakening, she must have comprehended everything.And it was a slow and gentle agony, of which the spectacle lasted forseveral minutes more. Charles, silent now, as if he had again fallenasleep, was losing the last drops of blood that had remained in hisveins, which were emptying themselves softly. His lily-like whitenessincreased until it became a deathlike pallor. His lips lost their rosycolor, became a pale pink, then white. And, as he was about to expire,he opened his large eyes and fixed them on his great-great-grandmother,who watched the light dying in them. All the waxen face was alreadydead, the eyes only were still living. They still kept their limpidity,their brightness. All at once they became vacant, the light in them wasextinguished. This was the end--the death of the eyes, and Charles haddied, without a struggle, exhausted, like a fountain from which allthe water has run out. Life no longer pulsed through the veins of hisdelicate skin, there was now only the shadow of its wings on his whiteface. But he remained divinely beautiful, his face lying in blood,surrounded by his royal blond locks, like one of those little bloodlessdauphins who, unable to bear the execrable heritage of their race, dieof decrepitude and imbecility at sixteen.The boy exhaled his latest breath as Dr. Pascal entered the room,followed by Felicite and Clotilde. And when he saw the quantity of bloodthat inundated the floor, he cried:"Ah, my God! it is as I feared, a hemorrhage from the nose! The poordarling, no one was with him, and it is all over!"But all three were struck with terror at the extraordinary spectaclethat now met their gaze. Aunt Dide, who seemed to have grown taller, inthe superhuman effort she was making, had almost succeeded in raisingherself up, and her eyes, fixed on the dead boy, so fair and so gentle,and on the red sea of blood, beginning to congeal, that was lying aroundhim, kindled with a thought, after a long sleep of twenty-two years.This final lesion of madness, this irremediable darkness of the mind,was evidently not so complete but that some memory of the past, lyinghidden there, might awaken suddenly under the terrible blow which hadstruck her. And the ancestress, the forgotten one, lived again, emergedfrom her oblivion, rigid and wasted, like a specter of terror and grief.For an instant she remained panting. Then with a shudder, which made herteeth chatter, she stammered a single phrase:"The _gendarme_! the _gendarme_!"Pascal and Felicite and Clotilde understood. They looked at one anotherinvoluntarily, turning very pale. The whole dreadful history of the oldmother--of the mother of them all--rose before them, the ardent loveof her youth, the long suffering of her mature age. Already two moralshocks had shaken her terribly--the first, when she was in her ardentprime, when a _gendarme_ shot down her lover Macquart, the smuggler,like a dog; the second, years ago, when another _gendarme_ shatteredwith a pistol shot the skull of her grandson Silvere, the insurgent, thevictim of the hatred and the sanguinary strife of the family. Bloodhad always bespattered her. And a third moral shock finished her; bloodbespattered her again, the impoverished blood of her race, which shehad just beheld flowing slowly, and which lay upon the ground, while thefair royal child, his veins and his heart empty, slept.Three times--face to face with her past life, her life red with passionand suffering, haunted by the image of expiation--she stammered:"The _gendarme_! the _gendarme_! the _gendarme_!"Then she sank back into her armchair. They thought she was dead, killedby the shock.But the keeper at this moment at last appeared, endeavoring to excuseherself, fearing that she would be dismissed. When, aided by her, Dr.Pascal had placed Aunt Dide on the bed, he found that the old mother wasstill alive. She was not to die until the following day, at the age ofone hundred and five years, three months, and seven days, of congestionof the brain, caused by the last shock she had received.Pascal, turning to his mother, said:"She will not live twenty-four hours; to-morrow she will be dead. Ah!Uncle Macquart, then she, and this poor boy, one after another. How muchmisery and grief!"He paused and added in a lower tone:"The family is thinning out; the old trees fall and the young diestanding."Felicite must have thought this another allusion. She was sincerelyshocked by the tragic death of little Charles. But, notwithstanding,above the horror which she felt there arose a sense of immense relief.Next week, when they should have ceased to weep, what a rest to be ableto say to herself that all this abomination of the Tulettes was at anend, that the family might at last rise, and shine in history!Then she remembered that she had not answered the involuntary accusationmade against her by her son at the notary's; and she spoke again ofMacquart, through bravado:"You see now that servants are of no use. There was one here, and yetshe prevented nothing; it would have been useless for Uncle Macquartto have had one to take care of him; he would be in ashes now, all thesame."She sighed, and then continued in a broken voice:"Well, well, neither our own fate nor that of others is in our hands;things happen as they will. These are great blows that have fallen uponus. We must only trust to God for the preservation and the prosperity ofour family."Dr. Pascal bowed with his habitual air of deference and said:"You are right, mother."Clotilde knelt down. Her former fervent Catholic faith had revived inthis chamber of blood, of madness, and of death. Tears streamed down hercheeks, and with clasped hands she was praying fervently for the dearones who were no more. She prayed that God would grant that theirsufferings might indeed be ended, their faults pardoned, and that theymight live again in another life, a life of unending happiness. And sheprayed with the utmost fervor, in her terror of a hell, which after thismiserable life would make suffering eternal.From this day Pascal and Clotilde went to visit their sick side by side,filled with greater pity than ever. Perhaps, with Pascal, the feelingof his powerlessness against inevitable disease was even stronger thanbefore. The only wisdom was to let nature take its course, to eliminatedangerous elements, and to labor only in the supreme work of givinghealth and strength. But the suffering and the death of those who aredear to us awaken in us a hatred of disease, an irresistible desire tocombat and to vanquish it. And the doctor never tasted so great a joyas when he succeeded, with his hypodermic injections, in soothing aparoxysm of pain, in seeing the groaning patient grow tranquil and fallasleep. Clotilde, in return, adored him, proud of their love, as if itwere a consolation which they carried, like the viaticum, to the poor.X.Martine one morning obtained from Dr. Pascal, as she did every threemonths, his receipt for fifteen hundred francs, to take it to the notaryGrandguillot, to get from him what she called their "income." The doctorseemed surprised that the payment should have fallen due again so soon;he had never been so indifferent as he was now about money matters,leaving to Martine the care of settling everything. And he and Clotildewere under the plane trees, absorbed in the joy that filled their life,lulled by the ceaseless song of the fountain, when the servant returnedwith a frightened face, and in a state of extraordinary agitation. Shewas so breathless with excitement that for a moment she could not speak."Oh, my God! Oh, my God!" she cried at last. "M. Grandguillot has goneaway!"Pascal did not at first comprehend."Well, my girl, there is no hurry," he said; "you can go back anotherday.""No, no! He has gone away; don't you hear? He has gone away forever--"And as the waters rush forth in the bursting of a dam, her emotionvented itself in a torrent of words."I reached the street, and I saw from a distance a crowd gatheredbefore the door. A chill ran through me; I felt that some misfortunehad happened. The door closed, and not a blind open, as if there wassomebody dead in the house. They told me when I got there that he hadrun away; that he had not left a sou behind him; that many familieswould be ruined."She laid the receipt on the stone table."There! There is your paper! It is all over with us, we have not a souleft, we are going to die of starvation!" And she sobbed aloud in theanguish of her miserly heart, distracted by this loss of a fortune, andtrembling at the prospect of impending want.Clotilde sat stunned and speechless, her eyes fixed on Pascal, whosepredominating feeling at first seemed to be one of incredulity. Heendeavored to calm Martine. Why! why! it would not do to give up inthis way. If all she knew of the affair was what she had heard from thepeople in the street, it might be only gossip, after all, which alwaysexaggerates everything. M. Grandguillot a fugitive; M. Grandguillot athief; that was monstrous, impossible! A man of such probity, a houseliked and respected by all Plassans for more than a century past. Whypeople thought money safer there than in the Bank of France."Consider, Martine, this would not have come all of a sudden, like athunderclap; there would have been some rumors of it beforehand. Thedeuce! an old reputation does not fall to pieces in that way, in anight."At this she made a gesture of despair."Ah, monsieur, that is what most afflicts me, because, you see, itthrows some of the responsibility on me. For weeks past I have beenhearing stories on all sides. As for you two, naturally you hearnothing; you don't even know whether you are alive or dead."Neither Pascal nor Clotilde could refrain from smiling; for it wasindeed true that their love lifted them so far above the earth that noneof the common sounds of existence reached them."But the stories I heard were so ugly that I didn't like to worry youwith them. I thought they were lies."She was silent for a moment, and then added that while some peoplemerely accused M. Grandguillot of having speculated on the Bourse, therewere others who accused him of still worse practises. And she burst intofresh sobs."My God! My God! what is going to become of us? We are all going to dieof starvation!"Shaken, then, moved by seeing Clotilde's eyes, too, filled with tears,Pascal made an effort to remember, to see clearly into the past. Yearsago, when he had been practising in Plassans, he had deposited atdifferent times, with M. Grandguillot, the twenty thousand francs on theinterest of which he had lived comfortably for the past sixteen years,and on each occasion the notary had given him a receipt for the sumdeposited. This would no doubt enable him to establish his position asa personal creditor. Then a vague recollection awoke in his memory; heremembered, without being able to fix the date, that at the request ofthe notary, and in consequence of certain representations made by him,which Pascal had forgotten, he had given the lawyer a power of attorneyfor the purpose of investing the whole or a part of his money, inmortgages, and he was even certain that in this power the name of theattorney had been left in blank. But he was ignorant as to whether thisdocument had ever been used or not; he had never taken the trouble toinquire how his money had been invested. A fresh pang of miserly anguishmade Martine cry out:"Ah, monsieur, you are well punished for your sin. Was that a way toabandon one's money? For my part, I know almost to a sou how my accountstands every quarter; I have every figure and every document at myfingers' ends."In the midst of her distress an unconscious smile broke over her face,lighting it all up. Her long cherished passion had been gratified; herfour hundred francs wages, saved almost intact, put out at interest forthirty years, at last amounted to the enormous sum of twenty thousandfrancs. And this treasure was put away in a safe place which no oneknew. She beamed with delight at the recollection, and she said no more."But who says that our money is lost?" cried Pascal."M. Grandguillot had a private fortune; he has not taken away with himhis house and his lands, I suppose. They will look into the affair; theywill make an investigation. I cannot make up my mind to believe him acommon thief. The only trouble is the delay: a liquidation drags on solong."He spoke in this way in order to reassure Clotilde, whose growinganxiety he observed. She looked at him, and she looked around her at LaSouleiade; her only care his happiness; her most ardent desire to livehere always, as she had lived in the past, to love him always in thisbeloved solitude. And he, wishing to tranquilize her, recovered his fineindifference; never having lived for money, he did not imagine that onecould suffer from the want of it."But I have some money!" he cried, at last. "What does Martine meanby saying that we have not a sou left, and that we are going to die ofstarvation!"And he rose gaily, and made them both follow him saying:"Come, come, I am going to show you some money. And I will give some ofit to Martine that she may make us a good dinner this evening."Upstairs in his room he triumphantly opened his desk before them. Itwas in a drawer of this desk that for years past he had thrown the moneywhich his later patients had brought him of their own accord, for he hadnever sent them an account. Nor had he ever known the exact amount ofhis little treasure, of the gold and bank bills mingled together inconfusion, from which he took the sums he required for his pocket money,his experiments, his presents, and his alms. During the last few monthshe had made frequent visits to his desk, making deep inroads intoits contents. But he had been so accustomed to find there the sums herequired, after years of economy during which he had spent scarcelyanything, that he had come to believe his savings inexhaustible.He gave a satisfied laugh, then, as he opened the drawer, crying:"Now you shall see! Now you shall see!"And he was confounded, when, after searching among the heap of notes andbills, he succeeded in collecting only a sum of 615 francs--two notes of100 francs each, 400 francs in gold, and 15 francs in change. He shookout the papers, he felt in every corner of the drawer, crying:"But it cannot be! There was always money here before, there was a heapof money here a few days ago. It must have been all those old bills thatmisled me. I assure you that last week I saw a great deal of money. Ihad it in my hand."He spoke with such amusing good faith, his childlike surprise was sosincere, that Clotilde could not keep from smiling. Ah, the poor master,what a wretched business man he was! Then, as she observed Martine'slook of anguish, her utter despair at sight of this insignificant sum,which was now all there was for the maintenance of all three, she wasseized with a feeling of despair; her eyes filled with tears, and shemurmured:"My God, it is for me that you have spent everything; if we have nothingnow, if we are ruined, it is I who am the cause of it!"Pascal had already forgotten the money he had taken for the presents.Evidently that was where it had gone. The explanation tranquilized him.And as she began to speak in her grief of returning everything to thedealers, he grew angry."Give back what I have given you! You would give a piece of my heartwith it, then! No, I would rather die of hunger, I tell you!"Then his confidence already restored, seeing a future of unlimitedpossibilities opening out before him, he said:"Besides, we are not going to die of hunger to-night, are we, Martine?There is enough here to keep us for a long time."Martine shook her head. She would undertake to manage with it fortwo months, for two and a half, perhaps, if people had sense, but notlonger. Formerly the drawer was replenished; there was always some moneycoming in; but now that monsieur had given up his patients, they hadabsolutely no income. They must not count on any help from outside,then. And she ended by saying:"Give me the two one-hundred-franc bills. I'll try and make them lastfor a month. Then we shall see. But be very prudent; don't touch thefour hundred francs in gold; lock the drawer and don't open it again.""Oh, as to that," cried the doctor, "you may make your mind easy. Iwould rather cut off my right hand."And thus it was settled. Martine was to have entire control of thislast purse; and they might trust to her economy, they were sure that shewould save the centimes. As for Clotilde, who had never had a privatepurse, she would not even feel the want of money. Pascal only wouldsuffer from no longer having his inexhaustible treasure to draw upon,but he had given his promise to allow the servant to buy everything."There! That is a good piece of work!" he said, relieved, as happy asif he had just settled some important affair which would assure them aliving for a long time to come.A week passed during which nothing seemed to have changed at LaSouleiade. In the midst of their tender raptures neither Pascal norClotilde thought any more of the want which was impending. And onemorning during the absence of the latter, who had gone with Martine tomarket, the doctor received a visit which filled him at first with asort of terror. It was from the woman who had sold him the beautifulcorsage of old point d'Alencon, his first present to Clotilde. He felthimself so weak against a possible temptation that he trembled. Evenbefore the woman had uttered a word he had already begun to defendhimself--no, no, he neither could nor would buy anything. And withoutstretched hands he prevented her from taking anything out of herlittle bag, declaring to himself that he would look at nothing. Thedealer, however, a fat, amiable woman, smiled, certain of victory. In aninsinuating voice she began to tell him a long story of how a lady, whomshe was not at liberty to name, one of the most distinguished ladiesin Plassans, who had suddenly met with a reverse of fortune, had beenobliged to part with one of her jewels; and she then enlarged on thesplendid chance--a piece of jewelry that had cost twelve hundred francs,and she was willing to let it go for five hundred. She opened her bagslowly, in spite of the terrified and ever-louder protestations of thedoctor, and took from it a slender gold necklace set simply with sevenpearls in front; but the pearls were of wonderful brilliancy--flawless,and perfect in shape. The ornament was simple, chaste, and of exquisitedelicacy. And instantly he saw in fancy the necklace on Clotilde'sbeautiful neck, as its natural adornment. Any other jewel would havebeen a useless ornament, these pearls would be the fitting symbol of heryouth. And he took the necklace in his trembling fingers, experiencinga mortal anguish at the idea of returning it. He defended himself still,however; he declared that he had not five hundred francs, while thedealer continued, in her smooth voice, to push the advantage she hadgained. After another quarter an hour, when she thought she had himsecure, she suddenly offered him the necklace for three hundred francs,and he yielded; his mania for giving, his desire to please his idol, toadorn her, conquered. When he went to the desk to take the fifteengold pieces to count them out to the dealer, he felt convinced that thenotary's affairs would be arranged, and that they would soon have plentyof money.When Pascal found himself once more alone, with the ornament in hispocket, he was seized with a childish delight, and he planned his littlesurprise, while waiting, excited and impatient, for Clotilde's return.The moment she made her appearance his heart began to beat violently.She was very warm, for an August sun was blazing in the sky, and shelaid aside her things quickly, pleased with her walk, telling him,laughing, of the good bargain Martine had made--two pigeons for eighteensous. While she was speaking he pretended to notice something on herneck."Why, what have you on your neck? Let me see."He had the necklace in his hand, and he succeeded in putting it aroundher neck, while feigning to pass his fingers over it, to assure himselfthat there was nothing there. But she resisted, saying gaily:"Don't! There is nothing on my neck. Here, what are you doing? What haveyou in your hand that is tickling me?"He caught hold of her, and drew her before the long mirror, in which shehad a full view of herself. On her neck the slender chain showed like athread of gold, and the seven pearls, like seven milky stars, shone withsoft luster against her satin skin. She looked charmingly childlike.Suddenly she gave a delighted laugh, like the cooing of a dove swellingout its throat proudly."Oh, master, master, how good you are! Do you think of nothing but me,then? How happy you make me!"And the joy which shone in her eyes, the joy of the woman and the lover,happy to be beautiful and to be adored, recompensed him divinely for hisfolly.She drew back her head, radiant, and held up her mouth to him. He bentover and kissed her."Are you happy?""Oh, yes, master, happy, happy! Pearls are so sweet, so pure! And theseare so becoming to me!"For an instant longer she admired herself in the glass, innocently vainof her fair flower-like skin, under the nacre drops of the pearls. Then,yielding to a desire to show herself, hearing the servant moving aboutoutside, she ran out, crying:"Martine, Martine! See what master has just given me! Say, am I notbeautiful!"But all at once, seeing the old maid's severe face, that had suddenlyturned an ashen hue, she became confused, and all her pleasure wasspoiled. Perhaps she had a consciousness of the jealous pang whichher brilliant youth caused this poor creature, worn out in the dumbresignation of her servitude, in adoration of her master. This, however,was only a momentary feeling, unconscious in the one, hardly suspectedby the other, and what remained was the evident disapprobation of theeconomical servant, condemning the present with her sidelong glance.Clotilde was seized with a little chill."Only," she murmured, "master has rummaged his desk again. Pearls arevery dear, are they not?"Pascal, embarrassed, too, protested volubly, telling them of thesplendid opportunity presented by the dealer's visit. An incredibly goodstroke of business--it was impossible to avoid buying the necklace."How much?" asked the young girl with real anxiety."Three hundred francs."Martine, who had not yet opened her lips, but who looked terrible in hersilence, could not restrain a cry."Good God! enough to live upon for six weeks, and we have not bread!"Large tears welled from Clotilde's eyes. She would have torn thenecklace from her neck if Pascal had not prevented her. She wished togive it to him on the instant, and she faltered in heart-broken tones:"It is true, Martine is right. Master is mad, and I am mad, too, to keepthis for an instant, in the situation in which we are. It would burn myflesh. Let me take it back, I beg of you."Never would he consent to this, he said. Now his eyes, too, were moist,he joined in their grief, crying that he was incorrigible, that theyought to have taken all the money away from him. And running to the deskhe took the hundred francs that were left, and forced Martine to takethem, saying:"I tell you that I will not keep another sou. I should spend this, too.Take it, Martine; you are the only one of us who has any sense. You willmake the money last, I am very certain, until our affairs are settled.And you, dear, keep that; do not grieve me."Nothing more was said about this incident. But Clotilde kept thenecklace, wearing it under her gown; and there was a sort of delightfulmystery in feeling on her neck, unknown to every one, this simple,pretty ornament. Sometimes, when they were alone, she would smile atPascal and draw the pearls from her dress quickly, and show them to himwithout a word; and as quickly she would replace them again on her warmneck, filled with delightful emotion. It was their fond folly which shethus recalled to him, with a confused gratitude, a vivid and radiantjoy--a joy which nevermore left her.A straitened existence, sweet in spite of everything, now began forthem. Martine made an exact inventory of the resources of the house, andit was not reassuring. The provision of potatoes only promised to beof any importance. As ill luck would have it, the jar of oil was almostout, and the last cask of wine was also nearly empty. La Souleiade,having neither vines nor olive trees, produced only a few vegetables andsome fruits--pears, not yet ripe, and trellis grapes, which were to betheir only delicacies. And meat and bread had to be bought every day. Sothat from the first day the servant put Pascal and Clotilde on rations,suppressing the former sweets, creams, and pastry, and reducing the foodto the quantity barely necessary to sustain life. She resumed allher former authority, treating them like children who were not to beconsulted, even with regard to their wishes or their tastes. It wasshe who arranged the menus, who knew better than themselves what theywanted; but all this like a mother, surrounding them with unceasingcare, performing the miracle of enabling them to live still with comforton their scanty resources; occasionally severe with them, for their owngood, as one is severe with a child when it refuses to eat its food. Andit seemed as if this maternal care, this last immolation, the illusorypeace with which she surrounded their love, gave her, too, a littlehappiness, and drew her out of the dumb despair into which she hadfallen. Since she had thus watched over them she had begun to look likeher old self, with her little white face, the face of a nun vowed tochastity; her calm ash-colored eyes, which expressed the resignation ofher thirty years of servitude. When, after the eternal potatoes and thelittle cutlet at four sous, undistinguishable among the vegetables, shewas able, on certain days, without compromising her budget, to give thempancakes, she was triumphant, she laughed to see them laugh.Pascal and Clotilde thought everything she did was right, which did notprevent them, however, from jesting about her when she was not present.The old jests about her avarice were repeated over and over again. Theysaid that she counted the grains of pepper, so many grains for eachdish, in her passion for economy. When the potatoes had too little oil,when the cutlets were reduced to a mouthful, they would exchange a quickglance, stifling their laughter in their napkins, until she had leftthe room. Everything was a source of amusement to them, and they laughedinnocently at their misery.At the end of the first month Pascal thought of Martine's wages. Usuallyshe took her forty francs herself from the common purse which she kept."My poor girl," he said to her one evening, "what are you going to dofor your wages, now that we have no more money?"She remained for a moment with her eyes fixed on the ground, with an airof consternation, then she said:"Well, monsieur, I must only wait."But he saw that she had not said all that was in her mind, that she hadthought of some arrangement which she did not know how to propose tohim, so he encouraged her."Well, then, if monsieur would consent to it, I should like monsieur tosign me a paper.""How, a paper?""Yes, a paper, in which monsieur should say, every month, that he owesme forty francs."Pascal at once made out the paper for her, and this made her quitehappy. She put it away as carefully as if it had been real money.This evidently tranquilized her. But the paper became a new subject ofwondering amusement to the doctor and his companion. In what did theextraordinary power consist which money has on certain natures? Thisold maid, who would serve him on bended knees, who adored him aboveeverything, to the extent of having devoted to him her whole life, toask for this silly guarantee, this scrap of paper which was of no value,if he should be unable to pay her.So far neither Pascal nor Clotilde had any great merit in preservingtheir serenity in misfortune, for they did not feel it. They lived highabove it, in the rich and happy realm of their love. At table they didnot know what they were eating; they might fancy they were partaking ofa princely banquet, served on silver dishes. They were unconscious ofthe increasing destitution around them, of the hunger of the servantwho lived upon the crumbs from their table; and they walked through theempty house as through a palace hung with silk and filled with riches.This was undoubtedly the happiest period of their love. The workroom hadpleasant memories of the past, and they spent whole days there, wrappedluxuriously in the joy of having lived so long in it together. Then, outof doors, in every corner of La Souleiade, royal summer had set up hisblue tent, dazzling with gold. In the morning, in the embalsamed walkson the pine grove; at noon under the dark shadow of the plane trees,lulled by the murmur of the fountain; in the evening on the coolterrace, or in the still warm threshing yard bathed in the faint blueradiance of the first stars, they lived with rapture their straitenedlife, their only ambition to live always together, indifferent to allelse. The earth was theirs, with all its riches, its pomps, and itsdominions, since they loved each other.Toward the end of August however, matters grew bad again. At times theyhad rude awakenings, in the midst of this life without ties, withoutduties, without work; this life which was so sweet, but which it wouldbe impossible, hurtful, they knew, to lead always. One evening Martinetold them that she had only fifty francs left, and that they would havedifficulty in managing for two weeks longer, even giving up wine. Inaddition to this the news was very serious; the notary Grandguillot wasbeyond a doubt insolvent, so that not even the personal creditors wouldreceive anything. In the beginning they had relied on the house and thetwo farms which the fugitive notary had left perforce behind him, but itwas now certain that this property was in his wife's name and, whilehe was enjoying in Switzerland, as it was said, the beauty of themountains, she lived on one of the farms, which she cultivatedquietly, away from the annoyances of the liquidation. In short, it wasinfamous--a hundred families ruined; left without bread. An assignee hadindeed been appointed, but he had served only to confirm the disaster,since not a centime of assets had been discovered. And Pascal, with hisusual indifference, neglected even to go and see him to speak to himabout his own case, thinking that he already knew all that there wasto be known about it, and that it was useless to stir up this uglybusiness, since there was neither honor nor profit to be derived fromit.Then, indeed, the future looked threatening at La Souleiade. Black wantstared them in the face. And Clotilde, who, in reality, had a greatdeal of good sense, was the first to take alarm. She maintained hercheerfulness while Pascal was present, but, more prescient than he, inher womanly tenderness, she fell into a state of absolute terror if heleft her for an instant, asking herself what was to become of him athis age with so heavy a burden upon his shoulders. For several days shecherished in secret a project--to work and earn money, a great deal ofmoney, with her pastels. People had so often praised her extraordinaryand original talent that, taking Martine into her confidence, she senther one fine morning to offer some of her fantastic bouquets to thecolor dealer of the Cours Sauvaire, who was a relation, it was said, ofa Parisian artist. It was with the express condition that nothing was tobe exhibited in Plassans, that everything was to be sent to a distance.But the result was disastrous; the merchant was frightened by thestrangeness of the design, and by the fantastic boldness of theexecution, and he declared that they would never sell. This threw herinto despair; great tears welled her eyes. Of what use was she? It wasa grief and a humiliation to be good for nothing. And the servant wasobliged to console her, saying that no doubt all women were not born forwork; that some grew like the flowers in the gardens, for the sakeof their fragrance; while others were the wheat of the fields that isground up and used for food.Martine, meantime, cherished another project; it was to urge the doctorto resume his practise. At last she mentioned it to Clotilde, who atonce pointed out to her the difficulty, the impossibility almost, ofsuch an attempt. She and Pascal had been talking about his doing so onlythe day before. He, too, was anxious, and had thought of work as theonly chance of salvation. The idea of opening an office again wasnaturally the first that had presented itself to him. But he had beenfor so long a time the physician of the poor! How could he venture nowto ask payment when it was so many years since he had left off doing so?Besides, was it not too late, at his age, to recommence a career? not tospeak of the absurd rumors that had been circulating about him, the namewhich they had given him of a crack-brained genius. He would not find asingle patient now, it would be a useless cruelty to force him to makean attempt which would assuredly result only in a lacerated heart andempty hands. Clotilde, on the contrary, had used all her influence toturn him from the idea. Martine comprehended the reasonableness of theseobjections, and she too declared that he must be prevented from runningthe risk of so great a chagrin. But while she was speaking a new ideaoccurred to her, as she suddenly remembered an old register, which shehad met with in a press, and in which she had in former times enteredthe doctor's visits. For a long time it was she who had kept theaccounts. There were so many patients who had never paid that a listof them filled three of the large pages of the register. Why, then, nowthat they had fallen into misfortune, should they not ask from thesepeople the money which they justly owed? It might be done without sayinganything to monsieur, who had never been willing to appeal to thelaw. And this time Clotilde approved of her idea. It was a perfectconspiracy. Clotilde consulted the register, and made out the bills, andthe servant presented them. But nowhere did she receive a sou; they toldher at every door that they would look over the account; that they wouldstop in and see the doctor himself. Ten days passed, no one came, andthere were now only six francs in the house, barely enough to live uponfor two or three days longer.Martine, when she returned with empty hands on the following day from anew application to an old patient, took Clotilde aside and told her thatshe had just been talking with Mme. Felicite at the corner of the Rue dela Banne. The latter had undoubtedly been watching for her. She hadnot again set foot in La Souleiade. Not even the misfortune which hadbefallen her son--the sudden loss of his money, of which the wholetown was talking--had brought her to him; she still continued stern andindignant. But she waited in trembling excitement, she maintained herattitude as an offended mother only in the certainty that she would atlast have Pascal at her feet, shrewdly calculating that he would sooneror later be compelled to appeal to her for assistance. When he had not asou left, when he knocked at her door, then she would dictate herterms; he should marry Clotilde, or, better still, she would demand thedeparture of the latter. But the days passed, and he did not come. Andthis was why she had stopped Martine, assuming a pitying air, askingwhat news there was, and seeming to be surprised that they had not hadrecourse to her purse, while giving it to be understood that her dignityforbade her to take the first step."You should speak to monsieur, and persuade him," ended the servant. Andindeed, why should he not appeal to his mother? That would be entirelynatural."Oh! never would I undertake such a commission," cried Clotilde."Master would be angry, and with reason. I truly believe he would die ofstarvation before he would eat grandmother's bread."But on the evening of the second day after this, at dinner, as Martinewas putting on the table a piece of boiled beef left over from the daybefore, she gave them notice."I have no more money, monsieur, and to-morrow there will be onlypotatoes, without oil or butter. It is three weeks now that you have hadonly water to drink; now you will have to do without meat."They were still cheerful, they could still jest."Have you salt, my good girl?""Oh, that; yes, monsieur, there is still a little left.""Well, potatoes and salt are very good when one is hungry."That night, however, Pascal noticed that Clotilde was feverish; this wasthe hour in which they exchanged confidences, and she ventured to tellhim of her anxiety on his account, on her own, on that of the wholehouse. What was going to become of them when all their resources shouldbe exhausted? For a moment she thought of speaking to him of his mother.But she was afraid, and she contented herself with confessing to himwhat she and Martine had done--the old register examined, the bills madeout and sent, the money asked everywhere in vain. In other circumstanceshe would have been greatly annoyed and very angry at this confession;offended that they should have acted without his knowledge, and contraryto the attitude he had maintained during his whole professional life. Heremained for a long tine silent, strongly agitated, and this would havesufficed to prove how great must be his secret anguish at times, underhis apparent indifference to poverty. Then he forgave Clotilde, claspingher wildly to his breast, and finally he said that she had done right,that they could not continue to live much longer as they were living,in a destitution which increased every day. Then they fell into silence,each trying to think of a means of procuring the money necessary fortheir daily wants, each suffering keenly; she, desperate at the thoughtof the tortures that awaited him; he unable to accustom himself to theidea of seeing her wanting bread. Was their happiness forever ended,then? Was poverty going to blight their spring with its chill breath?At breakfast, on the following day, they ate only fruit. The doctor wasvery silent during the morning, a prey to a visible struggle. And it wasnot until three o'clock that he took a resolution."Come, we must stir ourselves," he said to his companion. "I do notwish you to fast this evening again; so put on your hat, we will go outtogether."She looked at him, waiting for an explanation."Yes, since they owe us money, and have refused to give it to you, Iwill see whether they will also refuse to give it to me."His hands trembled; the thought of demanding payment in this way, afterso many years, evidently made him suffer terribly; but he forceda smile, he affected to be very brave. And she, who knew from thetrembling of his voice the extent of his sacrifice, had tears in hereyes."No, no, master; don't go if it makes you suffer so much. Martine can goagain."But the servant, who was present, approved highly of monsieur'sintention."And why should not monsieur go? There's no shame in asking what is owedto one, is there? Every one should have his own; for my part, I think itquite right that monsieur should show at last that he is a man."Then, as before, in their hours of happiness, old King David, as Pascaljestingly called himself, left the house, leaning on Abishag's arm.Neither of them was yet in rags; he still wore his tightly buttonedovercoat; she had on her pretty linen gown with red spots, but doubtlessthe consciousness of their poverty lowered them in their own estimation,making them feel that they were now only two poor people who occupieda very insignificant place in the world, for they walked along by thehouses, shunning observation. The sunny streets were almost deserted. Afew curious glances embarrassed them. They did not hasten their steps,however; only their hearts were oppressed at the thought of the visitsthey were about to make.Pascal resolved to begin with an old magistrate whom he had treatedfor an affection of the liver. He entered the house, leaving Clotildesitting on the bench in the Cours Sauvaire. But he was greatly relievedwhen the magistrate, anticipating his demand, told him that he did notreceive his rents until October, and that he would pay him then. Atthe house of an old lady of seventy, a paralytic, the rebuff was of adifferent kind. She was offended because her account had been sent toher through a servant who had been impolite; so that he hastened tooffer her his excuses, giving her all the time she desired. Then heclimbed up three flights of stairs to the apartment of a clerk in thetax collector's office, whom he found still ill, and so poor that he didnot even venture to make his demand. Then followed a mercer, a lawyer'swife, an oil merchant, a baker--all well-to-do people; and all turnedhim away, some with excuses, others by denying him admittance; a feweven pretended not to know what he meant. There remained the Marquisede Valqueyras, the sole representative of a very ancient family, a widowwith a girl of ten, who was very rich, and whose avarice was notorious.He had left her for the last, for he was greatly afraid of her. Finallyhe knocked at the door of her ancient mansion, at the foot of the CoursSauvaire, a massive structure of the time of Mazarin. He remained solong in the house that Clotilde, who was walking under the trees, atlast became uneasy.When he finally made his appearance, at the end of a full half hour, shesaid jestingly, greatly relieved:"Why, what was the matter? Had she no money?"But here, too, he had been unsuccessful; she complained that her tenantsdid not pay her."Imagine," he continued, in explanation of his long absence, "the littlegirl is ill. I am afraid that it is the beginning of a gastric fever. Soshe wished me to see the child, and I examined her."A smile which she could not suppress came to Clotilde's lips."And you prescribed for her?""Of course; could I do otherwise?"She took his arm again, deeply affected, and he felt her press itagainst her heart. For a time they walked on aimlessly. It was all over;they had knocked at every debtor's door, and nothing now remained forthem to do but to return home with empty hands. But this Pascal refusedto do, determined that Clotilde should have something more than thepotatoes and water which awaited them. When they ascended the CoursSauvaire, they turned to the left, to the new town; drifting now whithercruel fate led them."Listen," said Pascal at last; "I have an idea. If I were to speak toRamond he would willingly lend us a thousand francs, which we couldreturn to him when our affairs are arranged."She did not answer at once. Ramond, whom she had rejected, who was nowmarried and settled in a house in the new town, in a fair way to becomethe fashionable physician of the place, and to make a fortune! She knew,indeed, that he had a magnanimous soul and a kind heart. If he had notvisited them again it had been undoubtedly through delicacy. Wheneverthey chanced to meet, he saluted them with so admiring an air, he seemedso pleased to see their happiness."Would that be disagreeable to you?" asked Pascal ingenuously. For hispart, he would have thrown open to the young physician his house, hispurse, and his heart."No, no," she answered quickly. "There has never been anything betweenus but affection and frankness. I think I gave him a great deal of pain,but he has forgiven me. You are right; we have no other friend. It is toRamond that we must apply."Ill luck pursued them, however. Ramond was absent from home, attending aconsultation at Marseilles, and he would not be back until the followingevening. And it young Mme. Ramond, an old friend of Clotilde's,some three years her junior, who received them. She seemed a littleembarrassed, but she was very amiable, notwithstanding. But the doctor,naturally, did not prefer his request, and contented himself withsaying, in explanation of his visit, that he had missed Ramond. Whenthey were in the street again, Pascal and Clotilde felt themselves oncemore abandoned and alone. Where now should they turn? What new effortshould they make? And they walked on again aimlessly."I did not tell you, master," Clotilde at last ventured to murmur, "butit seems that Martine met grandmother the other day. Yes, grandmotherhas been uneasy about us. She asked Martine why we did not go to her, ifwe were in want. And see, here is her house."They were in fact, in the Rue de la Banne. They could see the corner ofthe Place de la Sous-Prefecture. But he at once silenced her."Never, do you hear! Nor shall you go either. You say that because itgrieves you to see me in this poverty. My heart, too, is heavy, to thinkthat you also are in want, that you also suffer. But it is better tosuffer than to do a thing that would leave one an eternal remorse. Iwill not. I cannot."They emerged from the Rue de la Banne, and entered the old quarter."I would a thousand times rather apply to a stranger. Perhaps we stillhave friends, even if they are only among the poor."And resolved to beg, David continued his walk, leaning on the arm ofAbishag; the old mendicant king went from door to door, leaning on theshoulder of the loving subject whose youth was now his only support.It was almost six o'clock; the heat had abated; the narrow streets werefilling with people; and in this populous quarter where they were loved,they were everywhere greeted with smiles. Something of pity was mingledwith the admiration they awakened, for every one knew of their ruin. Butthey seemed of a nobler beauty than before, he all white, she all blond,pressing close to each other in their misfortune. They seemed moreunited, more one with each other than ever; holding their heads erect,proud of their glorious love, though touched by misfortune; he shaken,while she, with a courageous heart, sustained him. And in spite of thepoverty that had so suddenly overtaken them they walked without shame,very poor and very great, with the sorrowful smile under which theyconcealed the desolation of their souls. Workmen in dirty blouses passedthem by, who had more money in their pockets than they. No one venturedto offer them the sou which is not refused to those who are hungry. Atthe Rue Canoquin they stopped at the house of Gulraude. She had diedthe week before. Two other attempts which they made failed. They werereduced now to consider where they could borrow ten francs. They hadbeen walking about the town for three hours, but they could not resolveto go home empty-handed.Ah, this Plassans, with its Cours Sauvaire, its Rue de Rome, and its Ruede la Banne, dividing it into three quarters; this Plassans; with itswindows always closed, this sun-baked town, dead in appearance, butwhich concealed under this sleeping surface a whole nocturnal life ofthe clubhouse and the gaming table. They walked through it three timesmore with slackened pace, on this clear, calm close of a glowing Augustday. In the yard of the coach office a few old stage-coaches, whichstill plied between the town and the mountain villages, were standingunharnessed; and under the thick shade of the plane trees at the doorsof the cafes, the customers, who were to be seen from seven o'clockin the morning, looked after them smiling. In the new town, too, theservants came and stood at the doors of the wealthy houses; they metwith less sympathy here than in the deserted streets of the Quartier St.Marc, whose antique houses maintained a friendly silence. They returnedto the heart of the old quarter where they were most liked; they went asfar as St. Saturnin, the cathedral, whose apse was shaded by the gardenof the chapter, a sweet and peaceful solitude, from which a beggar drovethem by himself asking an alms from them. They were building rapidly inthe neighborhood of the railway station; a new quarter was growing upthere, and they bent their steps in that direction. Then they returned alast time to the Place de la Sous-Prefecture, with a sudden reawakeningof hope, thinking that they might meet some one who would offer themmoney. But they were followed only by the indulgent smile of the town,at seeing them so united and so beautiful. Only one woman had tears inher eyes, foreseeing, perhaps, the sufferings that awaited them. Thestones of the Viorne, the little sharp paving stones, wounded theirfeet. And they had at last to return to La Souleiade, without havingsucceeded in obtaining anything, the old mendicant king and hissubmissive subject; Abishag, in the flower of her youth, leading backDavid, old and despoiled of his wealth, and weary from having walked thestreets in vain.It was eight o'clock, and Martine, who was waiting for them,comprehended that she would have no cooking to do this evening. Shepretended that she had dined, and as she looked ill Pascal sent her atonce to bed."We do not need you," said Clotilde. "As the potatoes are on the fire wecan take them up very well ourselves."The servant, who was feverish and out of humor, yielded. She mutteredsome indistinct words--when people had eaten up everything what was theuse of sitting down to table? Then, before shutting herself into herroom, she added:"Monsieur, there is no more hay for Bonhomme. I thought he was lookingbadly a little while ago; monsieur ought to go and see him."Pascal and Clotilde, filled with uneasiness, went to the stable. The oldhorse was, in fact, lying on the straw in the somnolence of expiring oldage. They had not taken him out for six months past, for his legs, stiffwith rheumatism, refused to support him, and he had become completelyblind. No one could understand why the doctor kept the old beast.Even Martine had at last said that he ought to be slaughtered, if onlythrough pity. But Pascal and Clotilde cried out at this, as much excitedas if it had been proposed to them to put an end to some aged relativewho was not dying fast enough. No, no, he had served them for more thana quarter of a century; he should die comfortably with them, like theworthy fellow he had always been. And to-night the doctor did not scornto examine him, as if he had never attended any other patients thananimals. He lifted up his hoofs, looked at his gums, and listened to thebeating of his heart."No, there is nothing the matter with him," he said at last. "It issimply old age. Ah, my poor old fellow, I think, indeed, we shall neveragain travel the roads together."The idea that there was no more hay distressed Clotilde. But Pascalreassured her--an animal of that age, that no longer moved about, neededso little. She stooped down and took a few handfuls of grass from a heapwhich the servant had left there, and both were rejoiced when Bonhommedeigned, solely and simply through friendship, as it seemed, to eat thegrass out of her hand."Oh," she said, laughing, "so you still have an appetite! You cannot bevery sick, then; you must not try to work upon our feelings. Good night,and sleep well."And they left him to his slumbers after having each given him, as usual,a hearty kiss on either side of his nose.Night fell, and an idea occurred to them, in order not to remaindownstairs in the empty house--to close up everything and eat theirdinner upstairs. Clotilde quickly took up the dish of potatoes, thesalt-cellar, and a fine decanter of water; while Pascal took charge ofa basket of grapes, the first which they had yet gathered from an earlyvine at the foot of the terrace. They closed the door, and laid thecloth on a little table, putting the potatoes in the middle between thesalt-cellar and the decanter, and the basket of grapes on a chair besidethem. And it was a wonderful feast, which reminded them of the deliciousbreakfast they had made on the morning on which Martine had obstinatelyshut herself up in her room, and refused to answer them. Theyexperienced the same delight as then at being alone, at waiting uponthemselves, at eating from the same plate, sitting close beside eachother. This evening, which they had anticipated with so much dread, hadin store for them the most delightful hours of their existence. As soonas they found themselves at home in the large friendly room, as farremoved from the town which they had just been scouring as if they hadbeen a hundred leagues away from it, all uneasiness and all sadnessvanished--even to the recollection of the wretched afternoon wasted inuseless wanderings. They were once more indifferent to all that wasnot their affection; they no longer remembered that they had lost theirfortune; that they might have to hunt up a friend on the morrow in orderto be able to dine in the evening. Why torture themselves with fearsof coming want, when all they required to enjoy the greatest possiblehappiness was to be together?But Pascal felt a sudden terror."My God! and we dreaded this evening so greatly! Is it wise to be happyin this way? Who knows what to-morrow may have in store for us?"But she put her little hand over his mouth; she desired that he shouldhave one more evening of perfect happiness."No, no; to-morrow we shall love each other as we love each otherto-day. Love me with all your strength, as I love you."And never had they eaten with more relish. She displayed the appetite ofa healthy young girl with a good digestion; she ate the potatoes with ahearty appetite, laughing, thinking them delicious, better than themost vaunted delicacies. He, too, recovered the appetite of his youthfuldays. They drank with delight deep draughts of pure water. Then thegrapes for dessert filled them with admiration; these grapes so fresh,this blood of the earth which the sun had touched with gold. They ateto excess; they became drunk on water and fruit, and more than all ongaiety. They did not remember ever before to have enjoyed such a feasttogether; even the famous breakfast they had made, with its luxuries ofcutlets and bread and wine, had not given them this intoxication, thisjoy in living, when to be together was happiness enough, changing thechina to dishes of gold, and the miserable food to celestial fare suchas not even the gods enjoyed.It was now quite dark, but they did not light the lamp. Through thewide open windows they could see the vast summer sky. The night breezeentered, still warm and laden with a faint odor of lavender. The moonhad just risen above the horizon, large and round, flooding the roomwith a silvery light, in which they saw each other as in a dream lightinfinitely bright and sweet.XI.But on the following day their disquietude all returned. They were nowobliged to go in debt. Martine obtained on credit bread, wine, anda little meat, much to her shame, be it said, forced as she was tomaneuver and tell lies, for no one was ignorant of the ruin that hadovertaken the house. The doctor had indeed thought of mortgaging LaSouleiade, but only as a last resource. All he now possessed was thisproperty, which was worth twenty thousand francs, but for which he wouldperhaps not get fifteen thousand, if he should sell it; and when theseshould be spent black want would be before them, the street, withouteven a stone of their own on which to lay their heads. Clotildetherefore begged Pascal to wait and not to take any irrevocable step solong as things were not utterly desperate.Three or four days passed. It was the beginning of September, andthe weather unfortunately changed; terrible storms ravaged the entirecountry; a part of the garden wall was blown down, and as Pascal wasunable to rebuild it, the yawning breach remained. Already they werebeginning to be rude at the baker's. And one morning the old servantcame home with the meat from the butcher's in tears, saying that he hadgiven her the refuse. A few days more and they would be unable to obtainanything on credit. It had become absolutely necessary to consider howthey should find the money for their small daily expenses.One Monday morning, the beginning of another week of torture, Clotildewas very restless. A struggle seemed to be going on within her, and itwas only when she saw Pascal refuse at breakfast his share of a piece ofbeef which had been left over from the day before that she at last cameto a decision. Then with a calm and resolute air, she went out afterbreakfast with Martine, after quietly putting into the basket of thelatter a little package--some articles of dress which she was givingher, she said.When she returned two hours later she was very pale. But her large eyes,so clear and frank, were shining. She went up to the doctor at once andmade her confession."I must ask your forgiveness, master, for I have just been disobeyingyou, and I know that I am going to pain you greatly.""Why, what have you been doing?" he asked uneasily, not understandingwhat she meant.Slowly, without removing her eyes from him, she drew from her pocketan envelope, from which she took some bank-notes. A sudden intuitionenlightened him, and he cried:"Ah, my God! the jewels, the presents I gave you!"And he, who was usually so good-tempered and gentle, was convulsed withgrief and anger. He seized her hands in his, crushing with almost brutalforce the fingers which held the notes."My God! what have you done, unhappy girl? It is my heart that you havesold, both our hearts, that had entered into those jewels, whichyou have given with them for money! The jewels which I gave you, thesouvenirs of our divinest hours, your property, yours only, how canyou wish me to take them back, to turn them to my profit? Can it bepossible--have you thought of the anguish that this would give me?""And you, master," she answered gently, "do you think that I couldconsent to our remaining in the unhappy situation in which we are, inwant of everything, while I had these rings and necklaces and earringslaid away in the bottom of a drawer? Why, my whole being would rise inprotest. I should think myself a miser, a selfish wretch, if I hadkept them any longer. And, although it was a grief for me to part withthem--ah, yes, I confess it, so great a grief that I could hardly findthe courage to do it--I am certain that I have only done what I ought tohave done as an obedient and loving woman."And as he still grasped her hands, tears came to her eyes, and she addedin the same gentle voice and with a faint smile:"Don't press so hard; you hurt me."Then repentant and deeply moved, Pascal, too, wept."I am a brute to get angry in this way. You acted rightly; you couldnot do otherwise. But forgive me; it was hard for me to see you despoilyourself. Give me your hands, your poor hands, and let me kiss away themarks of my stupid violence."He took her hands again in his tenderly; he covered them with kisses; hethought them inestimably precious, so delicate and bare, thusstripped of their rings. Consoled now, and joyous, she told him of herescapade--how she had taken Martine into her confidence, and how bothhad gone to the dealer who had sold him the corsage of point d'Alencon,and how after interminable examining and bargaining the woman had givensix thousand francs for all the jewels. Again he repressed a gestureof despair--six thousand francs! when the jewels had cost him more thanthree times that amount--twenty thousand francs at the very least."Listen," he said to her at last; "I will take this money, since, inthe goodness of your heart, you have brought it to me. But it is clearlyunderstood that it is yours. I swear to you that I will, for the future,be more miserly than Martine herself. I will give her only the few sousthat are absolutely necessary for our maintenance, and you will find inthe desk all that may be left of this sum, if I should never be able tocomplete it and give it back to you entire."He clasped her in an embrace that still trembled with emotion.Presently, lowering his voice to a whisper, he said:"And did you sell everything, absolutely everything?"Without speaking, she disengaged herself a little from his embrace,and put her fingers to her throat, with her pretty gesture, smiling andblushing. Finally, she drew out the slender chain on which shone theseven pearls, like milky stars. Then she put it back again out of sight.He, too, blushed, and a great joy filled his heart. He embraced herpassionately."Ah!" he cried, "how good you are, and how I love you!"But from this time forth the recollection of the jewels which had beensold rested like a weight upon his heart; and he could not look atthe money in his desk without pain. He was haunted by the thoughtof approaching want, inevitable want, and by a still more bitterthought--the thought of his age, of his sixty years which rendered himuseless, incapable of earning a comfortable living for a wife; he hadbeen suddenly and rudely awakened from his illusory dream of eternallove to the disquieting reality. He had fallen unexpectedly intopoverty, and he felt himself very old--this terrified him and filled himwith a sort of remorse, of desperate rage against himself, as if he hadbeen guilty of a crime. And this embittered his every hour; if throughmomentary forgetfulness he permitted himself to indulge in a littlegaiety his distress soon returned with greater poignancy than ever,bringing with it a sudden and inexplicable sadness. He did not dare toquestion himself, and his dissatisfaction with himself and his sufferingincreased every day.Then a frightful revelation came to him. One morning, when he was alone,he received a letter bearing the Plassans postmark, the superscriptionon which he examined with surprise, not recognizing the writing. Thisletter was not signed; and after reading a few lines he made anangry movement as if to tear it up and throw it away; but he sat downtrembling instead, and read it to the end. The style was perfectlycourteous; the long phrases rolled on, measured and carefully worded,like diplomatic phrases, whose only aim is to convince. It wasdemonstrated to him with a superabundance of arguments that the scandalof La Souleiade had lasted too long already. If passion, up to a certainpoint, explained the fault, yet a man of his age and in his situationwas rendering himself contemptible by persisting in wrecking thehappiness of the young relative whose trustfulness he abused. No onewas ignorant of the ascendency which he had acquired over her; it wasadmitted that she gloried in sacrificing herself for him; but ought henot, on his side, to comprehend that it was impossible that she shouldlove an old man, that what she felt was merely pity and gratitude, andthat it was high time to deliver her from this senile love, which wouldfinally leave her with a dishonored name! Since he could not even assureher a small fortune, the writer hoped he would act like an honorableman, and have the strength to separate from her, through considerationfor her happiness, if it were not yet too late. And the letter concludedwith the reflection that evil conduct was always punished in the end.From the first sentence Pascal felt that this anonymous letter came fromhis mother. Old Mme. Rougon must have dictated it; he could hear in itthe very inflections of her voice. But after having begun the letterangry and indignant, he finished it pale and trembling, seized by theshiver which now passed through him continually and without apparentcause. The letter was right, it enlightened him cruelly regarding thesource of his mental distress, showing him that it was remorse forkeeping Clotilde with him, old and poor as he was. He got up and walkedover to a mirror, before which he stood for a long time, his eyesgradually filling with tears of despair at sight of his wrinkles and hiswhite beard. The feeling of terror which arose within him, the mortalchill which invaded his heart, was caused by the thought that separationhad become necessary, inevitable. He repelled the thought, he feltthat he would never have the strength for a separation, but it stillreturned; he would never now pass a single day without being assailed byit, without being torn by the struggle between his love and his reasonuntil the terrible day when he should become resigned, his strength andhis tears exhausted. In his present weakness, he trembled merely at thethought of one day having this courage. And all was indeed over, theirrevocable had begun; he was filled with fear for Clotilde, so youngand so beautiful, and all there was left him now was the duty of savingher from himself.Then, haunted by every word, by every phrase of the letter, he torturedhimself at first by trying to persuade himself that she did not lovehim, that all she felt for him was pity and gratitude. It would make therupture more easy to him, he thought, if he were once convinced that shesacrificed herself, and that in keeping her with him longer he was onlygratifying his monstrous selfishness. But it was in vain that he studiedher, that he subjected her to proofs, she remained as tender and devotedas ever, making the dreaded decision still more difficult. Then hepondered over all the causes that vaguely, but ceaselessly urged theirseparation. The life which they had been leading for months past, thislife without ties or duties, without work of any sort, was not good. Hethought no longer of himself, he considered himself good for nothing nowbut to go away and bury himself out of sight in some remote corner; butfor her was it not an injurious life, a life which would deteriorateher character and weaken her will? And suddenly he saw himself in fancydying, leaving her alone to perish of hunger in the streets. No, no!this would be a crime; he could not, for the sake of the happinessof his few remaining days, bequeath to her this heritage of shame andmisery.One morning Clotilde went for a walk in the neighborhood, from which shereturned greatly agitated, pale and trembling, and as soon as shewas upstairs in the workroom, she almost fainted in Pascal's arms,faltering:"Oh, my God! oh, my God! those women!"Terrified, he pressed her with questions."Come, tell me! What has happened?"A flush mounted to her face. She flung her arms around his neck and hidher head on his shoulder."It was those women! Reaching a shady spot, I was closing my parasol,and I had the misfortune to throw down a child. And they all roseagainst me, crying out such things, oh, such things--things that Icannot repeat, that I could not understand!"She burst into sobs. He was livid; he could find nothing to say to her;he kissed her wildly, weeping like herself. He pictured to himselfthe whole scene; he saw her pursued, hooted at, reviled. Presently hefaltered:"It is my fault, it is through me you suffer. Listen, we will go awayfrom here, far, far away, where we shall not be known, where you will behonored, where you will be happy."But seeing him weep, she recovered her calmness by a violent effort. Anddrying her tears, she said:"Ah! I have behaved like a coward in telling you all this. Afterpromising myself that I would say nothing of it to you. But when I foundmyself at home again, my anguish was so great that it all came out. Butyou see now it is all over, don't grieve about it. I love you."She smiled, and putting her arms about him she kissed him in her turn,trying to soothe his despair."I love you. I love you so dearly that it will console me foreverything. There is only you in the world, what matters anything thatis not you? You are so good; you make me so happy!"But he continued to weep, and she, too, began to weep again, and therewas a moment of infinite sadness, of anguish, in which they mingledtheir kisses and their tears.Pascal, when she left him alone for an instant, thought himself awretch. He could no longer be the cause of misfortune to this child,whom he adored. And on the evening of the same day an event took placewhich brought about the solution hitherto sought in vain, with the fearof finding it. After dinner Martine beckoned him aside, and gave him aletter, with all sorts of precautions, saying:"I met Mme. Felicite, and she charged me to give you this letter,monsieur, and she told me to tell you that she would have brought itto you herself, only that regard for her reputation prevented herfrom returning here. She begs you to send her back M. Maxime's letter,letting her know mademoiselle's answer."It was, in fact, a letter from Maxime, and Mme. Felicite, glad to havereceived it, used it as a new means of conquering her son, after havingwaited in vain for misery to deliver him up to her, repentant andimploring. As neither Pascal nor Clotilde had come to demand aid orsuccor from her, she had once more changed her plan, returning to herold idea of separating them; and, this time, the opportunity seemedto her decisive. Maxime's letter was a pressing one; he urged hisgrandmother to plead his cause with his sister. Ataxia had declareditself; he was able to walk now only leaning on his servant's arm. Hissolitude terrified him, and he urgently entreated his sister to come tohim. He wished to have her with him as a rampart against his father'sabominable designs; as a sweet and upright woman after all, who wouldtake care of him. The letter gave it to be understood that if sheconducted herself well toward him she would have no reason to repent it;and ended by reminding the young girl of the promise she had made him,at the time of his visit to Plassans, to come to him, if the day everarrived when he really needed her.Pascal turned cold. He read the four pages over again. Here anopportunity to separate presented itself, acceptable to him andadvantageous for Clotilde, so easy and so natural that they ought toaccept it at once; yet, in spite of all his reasoning he felt so weak,so irresolute still that his limbs trembled under him, and he wasobliged to sit down for a moment. But he wished to be heroic, andcontrolling himself, he called to his companion."Here!" he said, "read this letter which your grandmother has sent me."Clotilde read the letter attentively to the end without a word, withouta sign. Then she said simply:"Well, you are going to answer it, are you not? I refuse."He was obliged to exercise a strong effort of self-control to avoiduttering a great cry of joy, as he pressed her to his heart. As if itwere another person who spoke, he heard himself saying quietly:"You refuse--impossible! You must reflect. Let us wait till to-morrow togive an answer; and let us talk it over, shall we?"Surprised, she cried excitedly:"Part from each other! and why? And would you really consent to it? Whatfolly! we love each other, and you would have me leave you and go awaywhere no one cares for me! How could you think of such a thing? It wouldbe stupid."He avoided touching on this side of the question, and hastened to speakof promises made--of duty."Remember, my dear, how greatly affected you were when I told you thatMaxime was in danger. And think of him now, struck down by disease,helpless and alone, calling you to his side. Can you abandon him in thatsituation? You have a duty to fulfil toward him.""A duty?" she cried. "Have I any duties toward a brother who has neveroccupied himself with me? My only duty is where my heart is.""But you have promised. I have promised for you. I have said that youwere rational, and you are not going to belie my words.""Rational? It is you who are not rational. It is not rational toseparate when to do so would make us both die of grief."And with an angry gesture she closed the discussion, saying:"Besides, what is the use of talking about it? There is nothing simpler;it is only necessary to say a single word. Answer me. Are you tired ofme? Do you wish to send me away?"He uttered a cry."Send you away! I! Great God!""Then it is all settled. If you do not send me away I shall remain."She laughed now, and, running to her desk, wrote in red pencil acrossher brother's letter two words--"I refuse;" then she called Martine andinsisted upon her taking the letter back at once. Pascal was radiant;a wave of happiness so intense inundated his being that he let her haveher way. The joy of keeping her with him deprived him even of his powerof reasoning.But that very night, what remorse did he not feel for having been socowardly! He had again yielded to his longing for happiness. A deathlikesweat broke out upon him when he saw her in imagination far away;himself alone, without her, without that caressing and subtle essencethat pervaded the atmosphere when she was near; her breath, herbrightness, her courageous rectitude, and the dear presence, physicaland mental, which had now become as necessary to his life as the lightof day itself. She must leave him, and he must find the strength todie of it. He despised himself for his want of courage, he judged thesituation with terrible clear-sightedness. All was ended. An honorableexistence and a fortune awaited her with her brother; he could not carryhis senile selfishness so far as to keep her any longer in the misery inwhich he was, to be scorned and despised. And fainting at the thought ofall he was losing, he swore to himself that he would be strong, that hewould not accept the sacrifice of this child, that he would restore herto happiness and to life, in her own despite.And now the struggle of self-abnegation began. Some days passed; hehad demonstrated to her so clearly the rudeness of her "I refuse," onMaxime's letter, that she had written a long letter to her grandmother,explaining to her the reasons for her refusal. But still she would notleave La Souleiade. As Pascal had grown extremely parsimonious, in hisdesire to trench as little as possible on the money obtained by the saleof the jewels, she surpassed herself, eating her dry bread with merrylaughter. One morning he surprised her giving lessons of economy toMartine. Twenty times a day she would look at him intently and thenthrow herself on his neck and cover his face with kisses, to combat thedreadful idea of a separation, which she saw always in his eyes. Thenshe had another argument. One evening after dinner he was seized with apalpitation of the heart, and almost fainted. This surprised him; he hadnever suffered from the heart, and he believed it to be simply a returnof his old nervous trouble. Since his great happiness he had felt lessstrong, with an odd sensation, as if some delicate hidden spring hadsnapped within him. Greatly alarmed, she hurried to his assistance.Well! now he would no doubt never speak again of her going away. Whenone loved people, and they were ill, one stayed with them to take careof them.The struggle thus became a daily, an hourly one. It was a continualassault made by affection, by devotion, by self-abnegation, in the onedesire for another's happiness. But while her kindness and tendernessmade the thought of her departure only the more cruel for Pascal,he felt every day more and more strongly the necessity for it. Hisresolution was now taken. But he remained at bay, trembling andhesitating as to the means of persuading her. He pictured to himself herdespair, her tears; what should he do? how should he tell her? how couldthey bring themselves to give each other a last embrace, never to seeeach other again? And the days passed, and he could think of nothing,and he began once more to accuse himself of cowardice.Sometimes she would say jestingly, with a touch of affectionate malice:"Master, you are too kind-hearted not to keep me."But this vexed him; he grew excited, and with gloomy despair answered:"No, no! don't talk of my kindness. If I were really kind you would havebeen long ago with your brother, leading an easy and honorable life,with a bright and tranquil future before you, instead of obstinatelyremaining here, despised, poor, and without any prospect, to be the sadcompanion of an old fool like me! No, I am nothing but a coward and adishonorable man!"She hastily stopped him. And it was in truth his kindness of heart,above all, that bled, that immense kindness of heart which sprang fromhis love of life, which he diffused over persons and things, in hiscontinual care for the happiness of every one and everything. To bekind, was not this to love her, to make her happy, at the price of hisown happiness? This was the kindness which it was necessary for him toexercise, and which he felt that he would one day exercise, heroic anddecisive. But like the wretch who has resolved upon suicide, he waitedfor the opportunity, the hour, and the means, to carry out his design.Early one morning, on going into the workroom, Clotilde was surprisedto see Dr. Pascal seated at his table. It was many weeks since he hadeither opened a book or touched a pen."Why! you are working?" she said.Without raising his head he answered absently:"Yes; this is the genealogical tree that I had not even brought up todate."She stood behind him for a few moments, looking at him writing. He wascompleting the notices of Aunt Dide, of Uncle Macquart, and of littleCharles, writing the dates of their death. Then, as he did not stir,seeming not to know that she was there, waiting for the kisses and thesmiles of other mornings, she walked idly over to the window and backagain."So you are in earnest," she said, "you are really working?""Certainly; you see I ought to have noted down these deaths last month.And I have a heap of work waiting there for me."She looked at him fixedly, with that steady inquiring gaze with whichshe sought to read his thoughts."Very well, let us work. If you have papers to examine, or notes tocopy, give them to me."And from this day forth he affected to give himself up entirely to work.Besides, it was one of his theories that absolute rest was unprofitable,that it should never be prescribed, even to the overworked. As the fishlives in the water, so a man lives only in the external medium whichsurrounds him, the sensations which he receives from it transformingthemselves in him into impulses, thoughts, and acts; so that if therewere absolute rest, if he continued to receive sensations without givingthem out again, digested and transformed, an engorgement would result, a_malaise_, an inevitable loss of equilibrium. For himself he had alwaysfound work to be the best regulator of his existence. Even on themornings when he felt ill, if he set to work he recovered his equipoise.He never felt better than when he was engaged on some long work,methodically planned out beforehand, so many pages to so many hoursevery morning, and he compared this work to a balancing-pole, whichenabled him to maintain his equilibrium in the midst of daily miseries,weaknesses, and mistakes. So that he attributed entirely to the idlenessin which he had been living for some weeks past, the palpitation whichat times made him feel as if he were going to suffocate. If he wished torecover his health he had only to take up again his great work.And Pascal spent hours developing and explaining these theories toClotilde, with a feverish and exaggerated enthusiasm. He seemed to beonce more possessed by the love of knowledge and study in which, upto the time of his sudden passion for her, he had spent his lifeexclusively. He repeated to her that he could not leave his workunfinished, that he had still a great deal to do, if he desired to leavea lasting monument behind him. His anxiety about the envelopes seemedto have taken possession of him again; he opened the large press twentytimes a day, taking them down from the upper shelf and enriching themby new notes. His ideas on heredity were already undergoing atransformation; he would have liked to review the whole, to recast thewhole, to deduce from the family history, natural and social, a vastsynthesis, a resume, in broad strokes, of all humanity. Then, besides,he reviewed his method of treatment by hypodermic injections, with thepurpose of amplifying it--a confused vision of a new therapeutics;a vague and remote theory based on his convictions and his personalexperience of the beneficent dynamic influence of work.Now every morning, when he seated himself at his table, he would lament:"I shall not live long enough; life is too short."He seemed to feel that he must not lose another hour. And one morninghe looked up abruptly and said to his companion, who was copying amanuscript at his side:"Listen well, Clotilde. If I should die--""What an idea!" she protested, terrified."If I should die," he resumed, "listen to me well--close all the doorsimmediately. You are to keep the envelopes, you, you only. And when youhave collected all my other manuscripts, send them to Ramond. These aremy last wishes, do you hear?"But she refused to listen to him."No, no!" she cried hastily, "you talk nonsense!""Clotilde, swear to me that you will keep the envelopes, and that youwill send all my other papers to Ramond."At last, now very serious, and her eyes filled with tears, she gavehim the promise he desired. He caught her in his arms, he, too, deeplymoved, and lavished caresses upon her, as if his heart had all at oncereopened to her. Presently he recovered his calmness, and spoke of hisfears. Since he had been trying to work they seemed to have returned. Hekept constant watch upon the press, pretending to have observed Martineprowling about it. Might they not work upon the fanaticism of this girl,and urge her to a bad action, persuading her that she was securing hermaster's eternal welfare? He had suffered so much from suspicion! In thedread of approaching solitude his former tortures returned--the torturesof the scientist, who is menaced and persecuted by his own, at his ownfireside, in his very flesh, in the work of his brain.One evening, when he was again discussing this subject with Clotilde, hesaid unthinkingly:"You know that when you are no longer here--"She turned very pale and, as he stopped with a start, she cried:"Oh, master, master, you have not given up that dreadful idea, then?I can see in your eyes that you are hiding something from me, that youhave a thought which you no longer share with me. But if I go away andyou should die, who will be here then to protect your work?"Thinking that she had become reconciled, to the idea of her departure,he had the strength to answer gaily:"Do you suppose that I would allow myself to die without seeing you oncemore. I will write to you, of course. You must come back to close myeyes."Now she burst out sobbing, and sank into a chair."My God! Can it be! You wish that to-morrow we should be together nolonger, we who have never been separated!"From this day forth Pascal seemed more engrossed than ever in hiswork. He would sit for four or five hours at a time, whole mornings andafternoons, without once raising his head. He overacted his zeal.He would allow no one to disturb him, by so much as a word. And whenClotilde would leave the room on tiptoe to give an order downstairs orto go on some errand, he would assure himself by a furtive glance thatshe was gone, and then let his head drop on the table, with an airof profound dejection. It was a painful relief from the extraordinaryeffort which he compelled himself to make when she was present; toremain at his table, instead of going over and taking her in his armsand covering her face with sweet kisses. Ah, work! how ardently hecalled on it as his only refuge from torturing thoughts. But for themost part he was unable to work; he was obliged to feign attention,keeping his eyes fixed upon the page, his sorrowful eyes that grew dimwith tears, while his mind, confused, distracted, filled always with oneimage, suffered the pangs of death. Was he then doomed to see work failnow its effect, he who had always considered it of sovereign power,the creator and ruler of the world? Must he then throw away his pen,renounce action, and do nothing in future but exist? And tears wouldflow down his white beard; and if he heard Clotilde coming upstairsagain he would seize his pen quickly, in order that she might find himas she had left him, buried seemingly in profound meditation, when hismind was now only an aching void.It was now the middle of September; two weeks that had seemedinterminable had passed in this distressing condition of things, withoutbringing any solution, when one morning Clotilde was greatly surprisedby seeing her grandmother, Felicite, enter. Pascal had met his motherthe day before in the Rue de la Banne, and, impatient to consummate thesacrifice, and not finding in himself the strength to make the rupture,he had confided in her, in spite of his repugnance, and begged her tocome on the following day. As it happened, she had just received anotherletter from Maxime, a despairing and imploring letter.She began by explaining her presence."Yes, it is I, my dear, and you can understand that only very weightyreasons could have induced me to set my foot here again. But, indeed,you are getting crazy; I cannot allow you to ruin your life in this way,without making a last effort to open your eyes."She then read Maxime's letter in a tearful voice. He was nailed to anarmchair. It seemed he was suffering from a form of ataxia, rapid in itsprogress and very painful. Therefore he requested a decided answerfrom his sister, hoping still that she would come, and trembling at thethought of being compelled to seek another nurse. This was what he wouldbe obliged to do, however, if they abandoned him in his sad condition.And when she had finished reading the letter she hinted that it would bea great pity to let Maxime's fortune pass into the hands of strangers;but, above all, she spoke of duty; of the assistance one owed to arelation, she, too, affecting to believe that a formal promise had beengiven."Come, my dear, call upon your memory. You told him that if he shouldever need you, you would go to him; I can hear you saying it now. Was itnot so, my son?"Pascal, his face pale, his head slightly bent, had kept silence sincehis mother's entrance, leaving her to act. He answered only by anaffirmative nod.Then Felicite went over all the arguments that he himself had employedto persuade Clotilde--the dreadful scandal, to which insult was nowadded; impending want, so hard for them both; the impossibility ofcontinuing the life they were leading. What future could they hope for,now that they had been overtaken by poverty? It was stupid and cruel topersist longer in her obstinate refusal.Clotilde, standing erect and with an impenetrable countenance, remainedsilent, refusing even to discuss the question. But as her grandmothertormented her to give an answer, she said at last:"Once more, I have no duty whatever toward my brother; my duty is here.He can dispose of his fortune as he chooses; I want none of it. Whenwe are too poor, master shall send away Martine and keep me as hisservant."Old Mme. Rougon wagged her chin."Before being his servant it would be better if you had begun by beinghis wife. Why have you not got married? It would have been simpler andmore proper."And Felicite reminded her how she had come one day to urge thismarriage, in order to put an end to gossip, and how the young girl hadseemed greatly surprised, saying that neither she nor the doctor hadthought of it, but that, notwithstanding, they would get married lateron, if necessary, for there was no hurry."Get married; I am quite willing!" cried Clotilde. "You are right,grandmother."And turning to Pascal:"You have told me a hundred times that you would do whatever I wished.Marry me; do you hear? I will be your wife, and I will stay here. A wifedoes not leave her husband."But he answered only by a gesture, as if he feared that his voicewould betray him, and that he should accept, in a cry of gratitude, theeternal bond which she had proposed to him. His gesture might signify ahesitation, a refusal. What was the good of this marriage _in extremis_,when everything was falling to pieces?"Those are very fine sentiments, no doubt," returned Felicite. "You havesettled it all in your own little head. But marriage will not give youan income; and, meantime, you are a great expense to him; you are theheaviest of his burdens."The effect which these words had upon Clotilde was extraordinary. Sheturned violently to Pascal, her cheeks crimson, her eyes filled withtears."Master, master! is what grandmother has just said true? Has it come tothis, that you regret the money I cost you here?"Pascal grew still paler; he remained motionless, in an attitude of utterdejection. But in a far-away voice, as if he were talking to himself, hemurmured:"I have so much work to do! I should like to go over my envelopes, mymanuscripts, my notes, and complete the work of my life. If I werealone perhaps I might be able to arrange everything. I would sell LaSouleiade, oh! for a crust of bread, for it is not worth much. I shouldshut myself and my papers in a little room. I should work from morningtill night, and I should try not to be too unhappy."But he avoided her glance; and, agitated as she was, these painful andstammering utterances were not calculated to satisfy her. She grew everymoment more and more terrified, for she felt that the irrevocable wordwas about to be spoken."Look at me, master, look me in the face. And I conjure you, be brave,choose between your work and me, since you say, it seems, that you sendme away that you may work the better."The moment for the heroic falsehood had come. He lifted his head andlooked her bravely in the face, and with the smile of a dying man whodesires death, recovering his voice of divine goodness, he said:"How excited you get! Can you not do your duty quietly, like everybodyelse? I have a great deal of work to do, and I need to be alone; andyou, dear, you ought to go to your brother. Go then, everything isended."There was a terrible silence for the space of a few seconds. She lookedat him earnestly, hoping that he would change his mind. Was he reallyspeaking the truth? was he not sacrificing himself in order that shemight be happy? For a moment she had an intuition that this was thecase, as if some subtle breath, emanating from him, had warned her ofit."And you are sending me away forever? You will not permit me to comeback to-morrow?"But he held out bravely; with another smile he seemed to answer thatwhen one went away like this it was not to come back again on thefollowing day. She was now completely bewildered; she knew not what tothink. It might be possible that he had chosen work sincerely; that theman of science had gained the victory over the lover. She grew stillpaler, and she waited a little longer, in the terrible silence; then,slowly, with her air of tender and absolute submission, she said:"Very well, master, I will go away whenever you wish, and I will notreturn until you send for me."The die was cast. The irrevocable was accomplished. Each felt thatneither would attempt to recall the decision that had been made; and,from this instant, every minute that passed would bring nearer theseparation.Felicite, surprised at not being obliged to say more, at once desiredto fix the time for Clotilde's departure. She applauded herself for hertenacity; she thought she had gained the victory by main force. Itwas now Friday, and it was settled that Clotilde should leave on thefollowing Sunday. A despatch was even sent to Maxime.For the past three days the mistral had been blowing. But on thisevening its fury was redoubled, and Martine declared, in accordance withthe popular belief, that it would last for three days longer. The windsat the end of September, in the valley of the Viorne, are terrible. Sothat the servant took care to go into every room in the house to assureherself that the shutters were securely fastened. When the mistral blewit caught La Souleiade slantingly, above the roofs of the houses ofPlassans, on the little plateau on which the house was built. And now itraged and beat against the house, shaking it from garret to cellar, dayand night, without a moment's cessation. The tiles were blown off, thefastenings of the windows were torn away, while the wind, entering thecrevices, moaned and sobbed wildly through the house; and the doors, ifthey were left open for a moment, through forgetfulness, slammed to witha noise like the report of a cannon. They might have fancied they weresustaining a siege, so great were the noise and the discomfort.It was in this melancholy house shaken by the storm that Pascal, onthe following day, helped Clotilde to make her preparations for herdeparture. Old Mme. Rougon was not to return until Sunday, to saygood-by. When Martine was informed of the approaching separation,she stood still in dumb amazement, and a flash, quickly extinguished,lighted her eyes; and as they sent her out of the room, saying that theywould not require her assistance in packing the trunks, she returnedto the kitchen and busied herself in her usual occupations, seeming toignore the catastrophe which was about to revolutionize their householdof three. But at Pascal's slightest call she would run so promptly andwith such alacrity, her face so bright and so cheerful, in her zealto serve him, that she seemed like a young girl. Pascal did not leaveClotilde for a moment, helping her, desiring to assure himself that shewas taking with her everything she could need. Two large trunks stoodopen in the middle of the disordered room; bundles and articles ofclothing lay about everywhere; twenty times the drawers and the presseshad been visited. And in this work, this anxiety to forget nothing, thepainful sinking of the heart which they both felt was in some measurelessened. They forgot for an instant--he watching carefully to see thatno space was lost, utilizing the hat-case for the smaller articles ofclothing, slipping boxes in between the folds of the linen; while she,taking down the gowns, folded them on the bed, waiting to put themlast in the top tray. Then, when a little tired they stood up and foundthemselves again face to face, they would smile at each other at first;then choke back the sudden tears that started at the recollection of theimpending and inevitable misfortune. But though their hearts bled theyremained firm. Good God! was it then true that they were to be nolonger together? And then they heard the wind, the terrible wind, whichthreatened to blow down the house.How many times during this last day did they not go over to the window,attracted by the storm, wishing that it would sweep away the world.During these squalls the sun did not cease to shine, the sky remainedconstantly blue, but a livid blue, windswept and dusty, and the sun wasa yellow sun, pale and cold. They saw in the distance the vast whiteclouds rising from the roads, the trees bending before the blast,looking as if they were flying all in the same direction, at the samerate of speed; the whole country parched and exhausted by the unvaryingviolence of the wind that blew ceaselessly, with a roar like thunder.Branches were snapped and whirled out of sight; roofs were lifted up andcarried so far away that they were never afterward found. Why could notthe mistral take them all up together and carry them off to some unknownland, where they might be happy? The trunks were almost packed whenPascal went to open one of the shutters that the wind had blown to, butso fierce a gust swept in through the half open window that Clotilde hadto go to his assistance. Leaning with all their weight, they were ableat last to turn the catch. The articles of clothing in the room wereblown about, and they gathered up in fragments a little hand mirrorwhich had fallen from a chair. Was this a sign of approaching death, asthe women of the faubourg said?In the evening, after a mournful dinner in the bright dining-room,with its great bouquets of flowers, Pascal said he would retire early.Clotilde was to leave on the following morning by the ten o'clocktrain, and he feared for her the long journey--twenty hours of railwaytraveling. But when he had retired he was unable to sleep. At first hethought it was the wind that kept him awake. The sleeping house wasfull of cries, voices of entreaty and voices of anger, mingled together,accompanied by endless sobbing. Twice he got up and went to listen atClotilde's door, but he heard nothing. He went downstairs to close adoor that banged persistently, like misfortune knocking at the walls.Gusts blew through the dark rooms, and he went to bed again, shiveringand haunted by lugubrious visions.At six o'clock Martine, fancying she heard her master knocking for heron the floor of his room, went upstairs. She entered the room with thealert and excited expression which she had worn for the past two days;but she stood still, astonished and uneasy, when she saw him lying,half-dressed, across his bed, haggard, biting the pillow to stifle hissobs. He got out of bed and tried to finish dressing himself, but afresh attack seized him, and, his head giddy and his heart palpitatingto suffocation, recovering from a momentary faintness, he faltered inagonized tones:"No, no, I cannot; I suffer too much. I would rather die, die now--"He recognized Martine, and abandoning himself to his grief, his strengthtotally gone, he made his confession to her:"My poor girl, I suffer too much, my heart is breaking. She is takingaway my heart with her, she is taking away my whole being. I cannot livewithout her. I almost died last night. I would be glad to die before herdeparture, not to have the anguish of seeing her go away. Oh, my God!she is going away, and I shall have her no longer, and I shall be leftalone, alone, alone!"The servant, who had gone upstairs so gaily, turned as pale as wax, anda hard and bitter look came into her face. For a moment she watched himclutching the bedclothes convulsively, uttering hoarse cries of despair,his face pressed against the coverlet. Then, by a violent effort, sheseemed to make up her mind."But, monsieur, there is no sense in making trouble for yourself inthis way. It is ridiculous. Since that is how it is, and you cannot dowithout mademoiselle, I shall go and tell her what a state you have letyourself get into."At these words he got up hastily, staggering still, and, leaning forsupport on the back of a chair, he cried:"I positively forbid you to do so, Martine!""A likely thing that I should listen to you, seeing you like that! Tofind you some other time half dead, crying your eyes out! No, no! Ishall go to mademoiselle and tell her the truth, and compel her toremain with us."But he caught her angrily by the arm and held her fast."I command you to keep quiet, do you hear? Or you shall go with her!Why did you come in? It was this wind that made me ill. That concerns noone."Then, yielding to a good-natured impulse, with his usual kindness ofheart, he smiled."My poor girl, see how you vex me? Let me act as I ought, for thehappiness of others. And not another word; you would pain me greatly."Martine's eyes, too, filled with tears. It was just in time that theymade peace, for Clotilde entered almost immediately. She had risenearly, eager to see Pascal, hoping doubtless, up to the last moment,that he would keep her. Her own eyelids were heavy from want of sleep,and she looked at him steadily as she entered, with her inquiring air.But he was still so discomposed that she began to grow uneasy."No, indeed, I assure you, I would even have slept well but for themistral. I was just telling you so, Martine, was I not?"The servant confirmed his words by an affirmative nod. And Clotilde,too, submitted, saying nothing of the night of anguish and mentalconflict she had spent while he, on his side, had been suffering thepangs of death. Both of the women now docilely obeyed and aided him, inhis heroic self-abnegation."What," he continued, opening his desk, "I have something here for you.There! there are seven hundred francs in that envelope."And in spite of her exclamations and protestations he persisted inrendering her an account. Of the six thousand francs obtained by thesale of the jewels two hundred only had been spent, and he had kept onehundred to last till the end of the month, with the strict economy, thepenuriousness, which he now displayed. Afterward he would no doubt sellLa Souleiade, he would work, he would be able to extricate himself fromhis difficulties. But he would not touch the five thousand francs whichremained, for they were her property, her own, and she would find themagain in the drawer."Master, master, you are giving me a great deal of pain--""I wish it," he interrupted, "and it is you who are trying to break myheart. Come, it is half-past seven, I will go and cord your trunks sincethey are locked."When Martine and Clotilde were alone and face to face they looked ateach other for a moment in silence. Ever since the commencement of thenew situation, they had been fully conscious of their secret antagonism,the open triumph of the young mistress, the half concealed jealousy ofthe old servant about her adored master. Now it seemed that the victoryremained with the servant. But in this final moment their common emotiondrew them together."Martine, you must not let him eat like a poor man. You promise me thathe shall have wine and meat every day?""Have no fear, mademoiselle.""And the five thousand francs lying there, you know belong to him. Youare not going to let yourselves starve to death, I suppose, with thosethere. I want you to treat him very well.""I tell you that I will make it my business to do so, mademoiselle, andthat monsieur shall want for nothing."There was a moment's silence. They were still regarding each other."And watch him, to see that he does not overwork himself. I am goingaway very uneasy; he has not been well for some time past. Take goodcare of him.""Make your mind easy, mademoiselle, I will take care of him.""Well, I give him into your charge. He will have only you now; and it issome consolation to me to know that you love him dearly. Love him withall your strength. Love him for us both.""Yes, mademoiselle, as much as I can."Tears came into their eyes; Clotilde spoke again."Will you embrace me, Martine?""Oh, mademoiselle, very gladly."They were in each other's arms when Pascal reentered the room. Hepretended not to see them, doubtless afraid of giving way to hisemotion. In an unnaturally loud voice he spoke of the final preparationsfor Clotilde's departure, like a man who had a great deal on his handsand was afraid that the train might be missed. He had corded the trunks,a man had taken them away in a little wagon, and they would find them atthe station. But it was only eight o'clock, and they had still two longhours before them. Two hours of mortal anguish, spent in unoccupiedand weary waiting, during which they tasted a hundred times over thebitterness of parting. The breakfast took hardly a quarter of an hour.Then they got up, to sit down again. Their eyes never left the clock.The minutes seemed long as those of a death watch, throughout themournful house."How the wind blows!" said Clotilde, as a sudden gust made all the doorscreak.Pascal went over to the window and watched the wild flight of thestorm-blown trees."It has increased since morning," he said. "Presently I must see to theroof, for some of the tiles have been blown away."Already they had ceased to be one household. They listened in silence tothe furious wind, sweeping everything before it, carrying with it theirlife.Finally Pascal looked for a last time at the clock, and said simply:"It is time, Clotilde."She rose from the chair on which she had been sitting. She had for aninstant forgotten that she was going away, and all at once the dreadfulreality came back to her. Once more she looked at him, but he did notopen his arms to keep her. It was over; her hope was dead. And from thismoment her face was like that of one struck with death.At first they exchanged the usual commonplaces."You will write to me, will you not?""Certainly, and you must let me hear from you as often as possible.""Above all, if you should fall ill, send for me at once.""I promise you that I will do so. But there is no danger. I am verystrong."Then, when the moment came in which she was to leave this dear house,Clotilde looked around with unsteady gaze; then she threw herself onPascal's breast, she held him for an instant in her arms, faltering:"I wish to embrace you here, I wish to thank you. Master, it is you whohave made me what I am. As you have often told me, you have correctedmy heredity. What should I have become amid the surroundings in whichMaxime has grown up? Yes, if I am worth anything, it is to you aloneI owe it, you, who transplanted me into this abode of kindness andaffection, where you have brought me up worthy of you. Now, after havingtaken me and overwhelmed me with benefits, you send me away. Be it asyou will, you are my master, and I will obey you. I love you, in spiteof all, and I shall always love you."He pressed her to his heart, answering:"I desire only your good, I am completing my work."When they reached the station, Clotilde vowed to herself that she wouldone day come back. Old Mme. Rougon was there, very gay and very brisk,in spite of her eighty-and-odd years. She was triumphant now; shethought she would have her son Pascal at her mercy. When she saw themboth stupefied with grief she took charge of everything; got the ticket,registered the baggage, and installed the traveler in a compartmentin which there were only ladies. Then she spoke for a long timeabout Maxime, giving instructions and asking to be kept informed ofeverything. But the train did not start; there were still five cruelminutes during which they remained face to face, without speaking toeach other. Then came the end, there were embraces, a great noise ofwheels, and waving of handkerchiefs.Suddenly Pascal became aware that he was standing alone upon theplatform, while the train was disappearing around a bend in the road.Then, without listening to his mother, he ran furiously up the slope,sprang up the stone steps like a young man, and found himself in threeminutes on the terrace of La Souleiade. The mistral was raging there--afierce squall which bent the secular cypresses like straws. In thecolorless sky the sun seemed weary of the violence of the wind, whichfor six days had been sweeping over its face. And like the wind-blowntrees Pascal stood firm, his garments flapping like banners, his beardand hair blown about and lashed by the storm. His breath caught by thewind, his hands pressed upon his heart to quiet its throbbing, he sawthe train flying in the distance across the bare plain, a little trainwhich the mistral seemed to sweep before it like a dry branch.XII.From the day following Clotilde's departure, Pascal shut himself up inthe great empty house. He did not leave it again, ceasing entirely therare professional visits which he had still continued to make, livingthere with doors and windows closed, in absolute silence and solitude.Martine had received formal orders to admit no one under any pretextwhatever."But your mother, monsieur, Mme. Felicite?""My mother, less than any one else; I have my reasons. Tell her thatI am working, that I require to concentrate my thoughts, and that Irequest her to excuse me."Three times in succession old Mme. Rougon had presented herself. Shewould storm at the hall door. He would hear her voice rising in anger asshe tried in vain to force her way in. Then the noise would be stilled,and there would be only a whisper of complaint and plotting between herand the servant. But not once did he yield, not once did he lean overthe banisters and call to her to come up.One day Martine ventured to say to him:"It is very hard, all the same, monsieur, to refuse admittance to one'smother. The more so, as Mme. Felicite comes with good intentions, forshe knows the straits that monsieur is in, and she insists only in orderto offer her services.""Money!" he cried, exasperated. "I want no money, do you hear? Andfrom her less than anybody. I will work, I will earn my own living; whyshould I not?"The question of money, however, began to grow pressing. He obstinatelyrefused to take another sou from the five thousand francs locked upin the desk. Now that he was alone, he was completely indifferent tomaterial things; he would have been satisfied to live on bread andwater; and every time the servant asked him for money to buy wine, meat,or sweets, he shrugged his shoulders--what was the use? there remained acrust from the day before, was not that sufficient? But in her affectionfor her master, whom she felt to be suffering, the old servant washeart-broken at this miserliness which exceeded her own; this utterdestitution to which he abandoned himself and the whole house. Theworkmen of the faubourgs lived better. Thus it was that for a whole daya terrible conflict went on within her. Her doglike love struggled withher love for her money, amassed sou by sou, hidden away, "making more,"as she said. She would rather have parted with a piece of her flesh.So long as her master had not suffered alone the idea of touching hertreasure had not even occurred to her. And she displayed extraordinaryheroism the morning when, driven to extremity, seeing her stove coldand the larder empty, she disappeared for an hour and then returned withprovisions and the change of a hundred-franc note.Pascal, who just then chanced to come downstairs, asked her inastonishment where the money had come from, furious already, andprepared to throw it all into the street, imagining she had applied tohis mother."Why, no; why, no, monsieur!" she stammered, "it is not that at all."And she told him the story that she had prepared."Imagine, M. Grandguillot's affairs are going to be settled--or at leastI think so. It occurred to me this morning to go to the assignee's toinquire, and he told me that you would undoubtedly recover something,and that I might have a hundred francs now. Yes, he was even satisfiedwith a receipt from me. He knows me, and you can make it all rightafterward."Pascal seemed scarcely surprised. She had calculated correctly that hewould not go out to verify her account. She was relieved, however, tosee with what easy indifference he accepted her story."Ah, so much the better!" he said. "You see now that one must neverdespair. That will give me time to settle my affairs."His "affairs" was the sale of La Souleiade, about which he had beenthinking vaguely. But what a grief to leave this house in which Clotildehad grown up, where they had lived together for nearly eighteen years!He had taken two or three weeks already to reflect over the matter. Nowthat he had the hope of getting back a little of the money he had lostthrough the notary's failure, he ceased to think any more about it. Herelapsed into his former indifference, eating whatever Martine servedhim, not even noticing the comforts with which she once more surroundedhim, in humble adoration, heart-broken at giving her money, but veryhappy to support him now, without his suspecting that his sustenancecame from her.But Pascal rewarded her very ill. Afterward he would be sorry, andregret his outbursts. But in the state of feverish desperation in whichhe lived this did not prevent him from again flying into a passion withher, at the slightest cause of dissatisfaction. One evening, after hehad been listening to his mother talking for an interminable time withher in the kitchen, he cried in sudden fury:"Martine, I do not wish her to enter La Souleiade again, do you hear? Ifyou ever let her into the house again I will turn you out!"She listened to him in surprise. Never, during the thirty-two years inwhich she had been in his service, had he threatened to dismiss her inthis way. Big tears came to her eyes."Oh, monsieur! you would not have the courage to do it! And I would notgo. I would lie down across the threshold first."He already regretted his anger, and he said more gently:"The thing is that I know perfectly well what is going on. She comesto indoctrinate you, to put you against me, is it not so? Yes, she iswatching my papers; she wishes to steal and destroy everything up therein the press. I know her; when she wants anything, she never gives upuntil she gets it. Well, you can tell her that I am on my guard; thatwhile I am alive she shall never even come near the press. And the keyis here in my pocket."In effect, all his former terror--the terror of the scientist who feelshimself surrounded by secret enemies, had returned. Ever since hehad been living alone in the deserted house he had had a feeling ofreturning danger, of being constantly watched in secret. The circle hadnarrowed, and if he showed such anger at these attempts at invasion,if he repulsed his mother's assaults, it was because he did not deceivehimself as to her real plans, and he was afraid that he might yield. Ifshe were there she would gradually take possession of him, until she hadsubjugated him completely. Therefore his former tortures returned,and he passed the days watching; he shut up the house himself in theevening, and he would often rise during the night, to assure himselfthat the locks were not being forced. What he feared was that theservant, won over by his mother, and believing she was securing hiseternal welfare, would open the door to Mme. Felicite. In fancy he sawthe papers blazing in the fireplace; he kept constant guard over them,seized again by a morbid love, a torturing affection for this icy heapof papers, these cold pages of manuscript, to which he had sacrificedthe love of woman, and which he tried to love sufficiently to be able toforget everything else for them.Pascal, now that Clotilde was no longer there, threw himself eagerlyinto work, trying to submerge himself in it, to lose himself in it. Ifhe secluded himself, if he did not set foot even in the garden, ifhe had had the strength, one day when Martine came up to announce Dr.Ramond, to answer that he would not receive him, he had, in this bitterdesire for solitude, no other aim than to kill thought by incessantlabor. That poor Ramond, how gladly he would have embraced him! forhe divined clearly the delicacy of feeling that had made him hastento console his old master. But why lose an hour? Why risk emotions andtears which would leave him so weak? From daylight he was at his table,he spent at it his mornings and his afternoons, extended often into theevening after the lamp was lighted, and far into the night. He wishedto put his old project into execution--to revise his whole theoryof heredity, employing the documents furnished by his own family toestablish the laws according to which, in a certain group of humanbeings, life is distributed and conducted with mathematical precisionfrom one to another, taking into account the environment--a vast bible,the genesis of families, of societies, of all humanity. He hoped thatthe vastness of such a plan, the effort necessary to develop so colossalan idea, would take complete possession of him, restoring to him hishealth, his faith, his pride in the supreme joy of the accomplishedwork. But it was in vain that he threw himself passionately,persistently, without reserve, into his work; he succeeded only infatiguing his body and his mind, without even being able to fix histhoughts or to put his heart into his work, every day sicker and moredespairing. Had work, then, finally lost its power? He whose lifehad been spent in work, who had regarded it as the sole motor, thebenefactor, and the consoler, must he then conclude that to love andto be loved is beyond all else in the world? Occasionally he wouldhave great thoughts, he continued to sketch out his new theory of theequilibrium of forces, demonstrating that what man receives in sensationhe should return in action. How natural, full, and happy would lifebe if it could be lived entire, performing its functions like awell-ordered machine, giving back in power what was consumed in fuel,maintaining itself in vigor and in beauty by the simultaneous andlogical play of all its organs. He believed physical and intellectuallabor, feeling and reasoning should be in equal proportions, andnever excessive, for excess meant disturbance of the equilibrium and,consequently, disease. Yes, yes, to begin life over again and to knowhow to live it, to dig the earth, to study man, to love woman, to attainto human perfection, the future city of universal happiness, through theharmonious working of the entire being, what a beautiful legacy fora philosophical physician to leave behind him would this be! And thisdream of the future, this theory, confusedly perceived, filled him withbitterness at the thought that now his life was a force wasted and lost.At the very bottom of his grief Pascal had the dominating feeling thatfor him life was ended. Regret for Clotilde, sorrow at having her nolonger beside him, the certainty that he would never see her again,filled him with overwhelming grief. Work had lost its power, and hewould sometimes let his head drop on the page he was writing, and weepfor hours together, unable to summon courage to take up the pen again.His passion for work, his days of voluntary fatigue, led to terriblenights, nights of feverish sleeplessness, in which he would stuff thebedclothes into his mouth to keep from crying out Clotilde's name. Shewas everywhere in this mournful house in which he secluded himself.He saw her again, walking through the rooms, sitting on the chairs,standing behind the doors. Downstairs, in the dining-room, he could notsit at table, without seeing her opposite him. In the workroom upstairsshe was still his constant companion, for she, too, had lived so longsecluded in it that her image seemed reflected from everything; he felther constantly beside him, he could fancy he saw her standing before herdesk, straight and slender--her delicate face bent over a pastel. And ifhe did not leave the house to escape from the dear and torturing memoryit was because he had the certainty that he should find her everywherein the garden, too: dreaming on the terrace; walking with slow stepsthrough the alleys in the pine grove; sitting under the shade of theplane trees; lulled by the eternal song of the fountain; lying in thethreshing yard at twilight, her gaze fixed on space, waiting forthe stars to come out. But above all, there existed for him a sacredsanctuary which he could not enter without trembling--the chamber whereshe had confessed her love. He kept the key of it; he had not moveda single object from its place since the sorrowful morning of herdeparture; and a skirt which she had forgotten lay still upon herarmchair. He opened his arms wildly to clasp her shade floating in thesoft half light of the room, with its closed shutters and its walls hungwith the old faded pink calico, of a dawnlike tint.In the midst of his unremitting toil Pascal had another melancholypleasure--Clotilde's letters. She wrote to him regularly twice a week,long letters of eight or ten pages, in which she described to him allher daily life. She did not seem to lead a very happy life in Paris.Maxime, who did not now leave his sick chair, evidently tortured herwith the exactions of a spoiled child and an invalid. She spoke as ifshe lived in complete retirement, always waiting on him, so that shecould not even go over to the window to look out on the avenue, alongwhich rolled the fashionable stream of the promenaders of the Bois; andfrom certain of her expressions it could be divined that her brother,after having entreated her so urgently to go to him, suspected heralready, and had begun to regard her with hatred and distrust, as he didevery one who approached him, in his continual fear of being made use ofand robbed. He did not give her the keys, treating her like a servant towhom he found it difficult to accustom himself. Twice she had seen herfather, who was, as always, very gay, and overwhelmed with business; hehad been converted to the Republic, and was at the height of politicaland financial success. Saccard had even taken her aside, to sympathizewith her, saying that poor Maxime was really insupportable, and that shewould be truly courageous if she consented to be made his victim. As shecould not do everything, he had even had the kindness to send her,on the following day, the niece of his hairdresser, a fair-haired,innocent-looking girl of eighteen, named Rose, who was assisting hernow to take care of the invalid. But Clotilde made no complaint; sheaffected, on the contrary, to be perfectly tranquil, contented, andresigned to everything. Her letters were full of courage, showingneither anger nor sorrow at the cruel separation, making no desperateappeal to Pascal's affection to recall her. But between the lines, hecould perceive that she trembled with rebellious anger, that herwhole being yearned for him, that she was ready to commit the folly ofreturning to him immediately, at his lightest word.And this was the one word that Pascal would not write. Everything wouldbe arranged in time. Maxime would become accustomed to his sister; thesacrifice must be completed now that it had been begun. A single linewritten by him in a moment of weakness, and all the advantage of theeffort he had made would be lost, and their misery would begin again.Never had Pascal had greater need of courage than when he was answeringClotilde's letters. At night, burning with fever, he would toss about,calling on her wildly; then he would get up and write to her to comeback at once. But when day came, and he had exhausted himself withweeping, his fever abated, and his answer was always very short, almostcold. He studied every sentence, beginning the letter over again whenhe thought he had forgotten himself. But what a torture, these dreadfulletters, so short, so icy, in which he went against his heart, solelyin order to wean her from him gradually, to take upon himself all theblame, and to make her believe that she could forget him, since heforgot her. They left him covered with perspiration, and as exhausted asif he had just performed some great act of heroism.One morning toward the end of October, a month after Clotilde'sdeparture, Pascal had a sudden attack of suffocation. He had had,several times already, slight attacks, which he attributed to overwork.But this time the symptoms were so plain that he could not mistakethem--a sharp pain in the region of the heart, extending over the wholechest and along the left arm, and a dreadful sensation of oppression anddistress, while cold perspiration broke out upon him. It was an attackof angina pectoris. It lasted hardly more than a minute, and he wasat first more surprised than frightened. With that blindness whichphysicians often show where their own health is concerned, he neversuspected that his heart might be affected.As he was recovering his breath Martine came up to say that Dr. Ramondwas downstairs, and again begged the doctor to see him. And Pascal,yielding perhaps to an unconscious desire to know the truth, cried:"Well, let him come up, since he insists upon it. I will be glad to seehim."The two men embraced each other, and no other allusion was made to theabsent one, to her whose departure had left the house empty, than anenergetic and sad hand clasp."You don't know why I have come?" cried Ramond immediately. "It is abouta question of money. Yes, my father-in-law, M. Leveque, the advocate,whom you know, spoke to me yesterday again about the funds which you hadwith the notary Grandguillot. And he advises you strongly to take someaction in the matter, for some persons have succeeded, he says, inrecovering something.""Yes, I know that that business is being settled," said Pascal. "Martinehas already got two hundred francs out of it, I believe.""Martine?" said Ramond, looking greatly surprised, "how could shedo that without your intervention? However, will you authorize myfather-in-law to undertake your case? He will see the assignee, and siftthe whole affair, since you have neither the time nor the inclination toattend to it.""Certainly, I authorize M. Leveque to do so, and tell him that I thankhim a thousand times."Then this matter being settled, the young man, remarking the doctor'spallor, and questioning him as to its cause, Pascal answered with asmile:"Imagine, my friend, I have just had an attack of angina pectoris. Oh,it is not imagination, all the symptoms were there. And stay! since youare here you shall sound me."At first Ramond refused, affecting to turn the consultation into ajest. Could a raw recruit like him venture to pronounce judgment onhis general? But he examined him, notwithstanding, seeing that his facelooked drawn and pained, with a singular look of fright in the eyes. Heended by auscultating him carefully, keeping his ear pressed closely tohis chest for a considerable time. Several minutes passed in profoundsilence."Well?" asked Pascal, when the young physician stood up.The latter did not answer at once. He felt the doctor's eyes lookingstraight into his; and as the question had been put to him with quietcourage, he answered in the same way:"Well, it is true, I think there is some sclerosis.""Ah! it was kind of you not to attempt to deceive me," returned thedoctor, smiling. "I feared for an instant that you would tell me anuntruth, and that would have hurt me."Ramond, listening again, said in an undertone:"Yes, the beat is strong, the first sound is dull, while the second, onthe contrary, is sharp. It is evident that the apex has descended and isturned toward the armpit. There is some sclerosis, at least it is veryprobable. One may live twenty years with that," he ended, straighteninghimself."No doubt, sometimes," said Pascal. "At least, unless one chances to dieof a sudden attack."They talked for some time longer, discussed a remarkable case ofsclerosis of the heart, which they had seen at the hospital at Plassans.And when the young physician went away, he said that he would return assoon as he should have news of the Grandguillot liquidation.But when he was alone Pascal felt that he was lost. Everything was nowexplained: his palpitations for some weeks past, his attacks of vertigoand suffocation; above all that weakness of the organ, of his poorheart, overtasked by feeling and by work, that sense of intense fatigueand impending death, regarding which he could no longer deceive himself.It was not as yet fear that he experienced, however. His first thoughtwas that he, too, would have to pay for his heredity, that sclerosiswas the species of degeneration which was to be his share of thephysiological misery, the inevitable inheritance bequeathed him by histerrible ancestry. In others the neurosis, the original lesion, hadturned to vice or virtue, genius, crime, drunkenness, sanctity; othersagain had died of consumption, of epilepsy, of ataxia; he had livedin his feelings and he would die of an affection of the heart. Andhe trembled no longer, he rebelled no longer against this manifestheredity, fated and inevitable, no doubt. On the contrary, a feelingof humility took possession of him; the idea that all revolt againstnatural laws is bad, that wisdom does not consist in holding one's selfapart, but in resigning one's self to be only a member of the wholegreat body. Why, then, was he so unwilling to belong to his familythat it filled him with triumph, that his heart beat with joy, when hebelieved himself different from them, without any community with them?Nothing could be less philosophical. Only monsters grew apart. And tobelong to his family seemed to him in the end as good and as fine asto belong to any other family, for did not all families, in the main,resemble one another, was not humanity everywhere identical with thesame amount of good and evil? He came at last, humbly and gently, evenin the face of impending suffering and death, to accept everything lifehad to give him.From this time Pascal lived with the thought that he might die at anymoment. And this helped to perfect his character, to elevate him to acomplete forgetfulness of self. He did not cease to work, but he hadnever understood so well how much effort must seek its reward in itself,the work being always transitory, and remaining of necessity incomplete.One evening at dinner Martine informed him that Sarteur, the journeymanhatter, the former inmate of the asylum at the Tulettes, had just hangedhimself. All the evening he thought of this strange case, of this manwhom he had believed he had cured of homicidal mania by his treatment ofhypodermic injections, and who, seized by a fresh attack, had evidentlyhad sufficient lucidity to hang himself, instead of springing at thethroat of some passer-by. He again saw him, so gentle, so reasonable,kissing his hands, while he was advising him to return to his life ofhealthful labor. What then was this destructive and transforming force,the desire to murder, changing to suicide, death performing its taskin spite of everything? With the death of this man his last vestige ofpride as a healer disappeared; and each day when he returned to his workhe felt as if he were only a learner, spelling out his task, constantlyseeking the truth, which as constantly receded from him, assuming evermore formidable proportions.But in the midst of his resignation one thought still troubled him--whatwould become of Bonhomme, his old horse, if he himself should die beforehim? The poor brute, completely blind and his limbs paralyzed, didnot now leave his litter. When his master went to see him, however, heturned his head, he could feel the two hearty kisses which were pressedon his nose. All the neighbors shrugged their shoulders and joked aboutthis old relation whom the doctor would not allow to be slaughtered. Washe then to be the first to go, with the thought that the knacker wouldbe called in on the following day. But one morning, when he entered thestable, Bonhomme did not hear him, did not raise his head. He was dead;he lay there, with a peaceful expression, as if relieved that death hadcome to him so gently. His master knelt beside him and kissed him againand bade him farewell, while two big tears rolled down his cheeks.It was on this day that Pascal saw his neighbor, M. Bellombre, for thelast time. Going over to the window he perceived him in his garden, inthe pale sunshine of early November, taking his accustomed walk; and thesight of the old professor, living so completely happy in his solitude,filled him at first with astonishment. He could never have imagined sucha thing possible, as that a man of sixty-nine should live thus, withoutwife or child, or even a dog, deriving his selfish happiness fromthe joy of living outside of life. Then he recalled his fits of angeragainst this man, his sarcasms about his fear of life, the catastropheswhich he had wished might happen to him, the hope that punishment wouldcome to him, in the shape of some housekeeper, or some female relationdropping down on him unexpectedly. But no, he was still as fresh asever, and Pascal was sure that for a long time to come he would continueto grow old like this, hard, avaricious, useless, and happy. And yethe no longer execrated him; he could even have found it in his heartto pity him, so ridiculous and miserable did he think him for not beingloved. Pascal, who suffered the pangs of death because he was alone!He whose heart was breaking because he was too full of others. Rathersuffering, suffering only, than this selfishness, this death of allthere is in us of living and human!In the night which followed Pascal had another attack of anginapectoris. It lasted for five minutes, and he thought that he wouldsuffocate without having the strength to call Martine. Then when herecovered his breath, he did not disturb himself, preferring to speak tono one of this aggravation of his malady; but he had the certainty thatit was all over with him, that he might not perhaps live a month longer.His first thought was Clotilde. Should he then never see her again? andso sharp a pang seized him that he believed another attack was comingon. Why should he not write to her to come to him? He had received aletter from her the day before; he would answer it this morning. Thenthe thought of the envelopes occurred to him. If he should die suddenly,his mother would be the mistress and she would destroy them; and notonly the envelopes, but his manuscripts, all his papers, thirty years ofhis intelligence and his labor. Thus the crime which he had so greatlydreaded would be consummated, the crime of which the fear alone, duringhis nights of fever, had made him get up out of bed trembling, his earon the stretch, listening to hear if they were forcing open the press.The perspiration broke out upon him, he saw himself dispossessed,outraged, the ashes of his work thrown to the four winds. And when histhoughts reverted to Clotilde, he told himself that everything would besatisfactorily arranged, that he had only to call her back--she would behere, she would close his eyes, she would defend his memory. And he satdown to write at once to her, so that the letter might go by the morningmail.But when Pascal was seated before the white paper, with the pen betweenhis fingers, a growing doubt, a feeling of dissatisfaction with himself,took possession of him. Was not this idea of his papers, this fineproject of providing a guardian for them and saving them, a suggestionof his weakness, an excuse which he gave himself to bring back Clotilde,and see her again? Selfishness was at the bottom of it. He was thinkingof himself, not of her. He saw her returning to this poor house,condemned to nurse a sick old man; and he saw her, above all, in hergrief, in her awful agony, when he should terrify her some day bydropping down dead at her side. No, no! this was the dreadful momentwhich he must spare her, those days of cruel adieus and want afterward,a sad legacy which he could not leave her without thinking himself acriminal. Her tranquillity, her happiness only, were of any consequence,the rest did not matter. He would die in his hole, then, abandoned,happy to think her happy, to spare her the cruel blow of his death. Asfor saving his manuscripts he would perhaps find a means of doing so,he would try to have the strength to part from them and give them toRamond. But even if all his papers were to perish, this was less of asacrifice than to resign himself not to see her again, and he acceptedit, and he was willing that nothing of him should survive, not even histhoughts, provided only that nothing of him should henceforth troubleher dear existence.Pascal accordingly proceeded to write one of his usual answers,which, by a great effort, he purposely made colorless and almost cold.Clotilde, in her last letter, without complaining of Maxime, had givenit to be understood that her brother had lost his interest in her,preferring the society of Rose, the niece of Saccard's hairdresser, thefair-haired young girl with the innocent look. And he suspected stronglysome maneuver of the father: a cunning plan to obtain possession of theinheritance of the sick man, whose vices, so precocious formerly, gainednew force as his last hour approached. But in spite of his uneasiness hegave Clotilde very good advice, telling her that she must make allowancefor Maxime's sufferings, that he had undoubtedly a great deal ofaffection and gratitude for her, in short that it was her duty to devoteherself to him to the end. When he signed the letter tears dimmedhis sight. It was his death warrant--a death like that of an old andsolitary brute, a death without a kiss, without the touch of a friendlyhand--that he was signing. Never again would he embrace her. Thendoubts assailed him; was he doing right in leaving her amid such evilsurroundings, where he felt that she was in continual contact with everyspecies of wickedness?The postman brought the letters and newspapers to La Souleiade everymorning at about nine o'clock; and Pascal, when he wrote to Clotilde,was accustomed to watch for him, to give him his letter, so as tobe certain that his correspondence was not intercepted. But on thismorning, when he went downstairs to give him the letter he had justwritten, he was surprised to receive one from him from Clotilde,although it was not the usual day for her letters. He allowed his own togo, however. Then he went upstairs, resumed his seat at his table, andtore open the envelope.The letter was short, but its contents filled Pascal with a great joy.* * * * *But the sound of footsteps made him control himself. He turned round andsaw Martine, who was saying:"Dr. Ramond is downstairs.""Ah! let him come up, let him come up," he said.It was another piece of good fortune that had come to him. Ramond criedgaily from the door:"Victory, master! I have brought you your money--not all, but a goodsum."And he told the story--an unexpected piece of good luck which hisfather-in-law, M. Leveque, had brought to light. The receipts forthe hundred and twenty thousand francs, which constituted Pascal thepersonal creditor of Grandguillot, were valueless, since the latter wasinsolvent. Salvation was to come from the power of attorney which thedoctor had sent him years before, at his request, that he might investall or part of his money in mortgages. As the name of the proxy was inblank in the document, the notary, as is sometimes done, had made useof the name of one of his clerks, and eighty thousand francs, which hadbeen invested in good mortgages, had thus been recovered through theagency of a worthy man who was not in the secrets of his employer. IfPascal had taken action in the matter, if he had gone to the publicprosecutor's office and the chamber of notaries, he would havedisentangled the matter long before. However, he had recovered a sureincome of four thousand francs.He seized the young man's hands and pressed them, smiling, his eyesstill moist with tears."Ah! my friend, if you knew how happy I am! This letter of Clotilde'shas brought me a great happiness. Yes, I was going to send for her; butthe thought of my poverty, of the privations she would have to endurehere, spoiled for me the joy of her return. And now fortune has comeback, at least enough to set up my little establishment again!"In the expansion of his feelings he held out the letter to Ramond, andforced him to read it. Then when the young man gave it back to him,smiling, comprehending the doctor's emotion, and profoundly touched byit, yielding to an overpowering need of affection, he caught him inhis arms, like a comrade, a brother. The two men kissed each othervigorously on either cheek."Come, since good fortune has sent you, I am going to ask anotherservice from you. You know I distrust every one around me, even my oldhousekeeper. Will you take my despatch to the telegraph office!"He sat down again at the table, and wrote simply, "I await you; startto-night.""Let me see," he said, "to-day is the 6th of November, is it not? It isnow near ten o'clock; she will have my despatch at noon. That will giveher time enough to pack her trunks and to take the eight o'clock expressthis evening, which will bring her to Marseilles in time for breakfast.But as there is no train which connects with it, she cannot be hereuntil to-morrow, the 7th, at five o'clock."After folding the despatch he rose:"My God, at five o'clock to-morrow! How long to wait still! What shall Ido with myself until then?"Then a sudden recollection filled him with anxiety, and he became grave."Ramond, my comrade, will you give me a great proof of your friendshipby being perfectly frank with me?""How so, master?""Ah, you understand me very well. The other day you examined me. Do youthink I can live another year?"He fixed his eyes on the young man as he spoke, compelling him to lookat him. Ramond evaded a direct answer, however, with a jest--was itreally a physician who put such a question?"Let us be serious, Ramond, I beg of you."Then Ramond answered in all sincerity that, in his opinion, the doctormight very justly entertain the hope of living another year. He gave hisreasons--the comparatively slight progress which the sclerosis had made,and the absolute soundness of the other organs. Of course they mustmake allowance for what they did not and could not know, for a suddenaccident was always possible. And the two men discussed the case as ifthey been in consultation at the bedside of a patient, weighing thepros and cons, each stating his views and prognosticating a fataltermination, in accordance with the symptoms as defined by the bestauthorities.Pascal, as if it were some one else who was in question, had recoveredall his composure and his heroic self-forgetfulness."Yes," he murmured at last, "you are right; a year of life is stillpossible. Ah, my friend, how I wish I might live two years; a mad wish,no doubt, an eternity of joy. And yet, two years, that would notbe impossible. I had a very curious case once, a wheelwright ofthe faubourg, who lived for four years, giving the lie to all myprognostications. Two years, two years, I will live two years! I mustlive two years!"Ramond sat with bent head, without answering. He was beginning tobe uneasy, fearing that he had shown himself too optimistic; and thedoctor's joy disquieted and grieved him, as if this very exaltation,this disturbance of a once strong brain, warned him of a secret andimminent danger."Did you not wish to send that despatch at once?" he said."Yes, yes, go quickly, my good Ramond, and come back again to see us theday after to-morrow. She will be here then, and I want you to come andembrace us."The day was long, and the following morning, at about four o'clock,shortly after Pascal had fallen asleep, after a happy vigil filled withhopes and dreams, he was wakened by a dreadful attack. He felt as if anenormous weight, as if the whole house, had fallen down upon his chest,so that the thorax, flattened down, touched the back. He could notbreathe; the pain reached the shoulders, then the neck, and paralyzedthe left arm. But he was perfectly conscious; he had the feeling thathis heart was about to stop, that life was about to leave him, in thedreadful oppression, like that of a vise, which was suffocating him.Before the attack reached its height he had the strength to rise and toknock on the floor with a stick for Martine. Then he fell back on hisbed, unable to speak or to move, and covered with a cold sweat.Martine, fortunately, in the profound silence of the empty house, heardthe knock. She dressed herself, wrapped a shawl about her, and wentupstairs, carrying her candle. The darkness was still profound; dawnwas about to break. And when she perceived her master, whose eyes aloneseemed living, looking at her with locked jaws, speechless, his facedistorted by pain, she was awed and terrified, and she could only rushtoward the bed crying:"My God! My God! what is the matter, monsieur? Answer me, monsieur, youfrighten me!"For a full minute Pascal struggled in vain to recover his breath. Then,the viselike pressure on his chest relaxing slowly, he murmured in afaint voice:"The five thousand francs in the desk are Clotilde's. Tell her that theaffair of the notary is settled, that she will recover from it enough tolive upon."Then Martine, who had listened to him in open-mouthed wonder, confessedthe falsehood she had told him, ignorant of the good news that had beenbrought by Ramond."Monsieur, you must forgive me; I told you an untruth. But it would bewrong to deceive you longer. When I saw you alone and so unhappy, I tooksome of my own money.""My poor girl, you did that!""Oh, I had some hope that monsieur would return it to me one day."By this time the attack had passed off, and he was able to turn his headand look at her. He was amazed and moved. What was passing in the heartof this avaricious old maid, who for thirty years had been saving upher treasure painfully, who had never taken a sou from it, either forherself or for any one else? He did not yet comprehend, but he wished toshow himself kind and grateful."You are a good woman, Martine. All that will be returned to you. Itruly think I am going to die--"She did not allow him to finish, her whole being rose up in rebelliousprotest."Die; you, monsieur! Die before me! I do not wish it. I will not let youdie!"She threw herself on her knees beside the bed; she caught him wildlyin her arms, feeling him, to see if he suffered, holding him as if shethought that death would not dare to take him from her."You must tell me what is the matter with you. I will take care of you.I will save you. If it were necessary to give my life for you, I wouldgive it, monsieur. I will sit up day and night with you. I am strongstill; I will be stronger than the disease, you shall see. To die!to die! oh, no, it cannot be! The good God cannot wish so great aninjustice. I have prayed so much in my life that he ought to listen tome a little now, and he will grant my prayer, monsieur; he will saveyou."Pascal looked at her, listened to her, and a sudden light broke in uponhis mind. She loved him, this miserable woman; she had always loved him.He thought of her thirty years of blind devotion, her mute adoration,when she had waited upon him, on her knees, as it were, when shewas young; her secret jealousy of Clotilde later; what she must havesecretly suffered all that time! And she was here on her knees nowagain, beside his deathbed; her hair gray; her eyes the color of ashesin her pale nun-like face, dulled by her solitary life. And he felt thatshe was unconscious of it all; that she did not even know with what sortof love she loved him, loving him only for the happiness of loving him:of being with him, and of waiting on him.Tears rose to Pascal's eyes; a dolorous pity and an infinite humantenderness flowed from his poor, half-broken heart."My poor girl," he said, "you are the best of girls. Come, embrace me,as you love me, with all your strength."She, too, sobbed. She let her gray head, her face worn by her longservitude, fall on her master's breast. Wildly she kissed him, puttingall her life into the kiss."There, let us not give way to emotion, for you see we can do nothing;this will be the end, just the same. If you wish me to love you, obeyme. Now that I am better, that I can breathe easier, do me the favor torun to Dr. Ramond's. Waken him and bring him back with you."She was leaving the room when he called to her, seized by a sudden fear."And remember, I forbid you to go to inform my mother."She turned back, embarrassed, and in a voice of entreaty, said:"Oh, monsieur, Mme. Felicite has made me promise so often--"But he was inflexible. All his life he had treated his mother withdeference, and he thought he had acquired the right to defend himselfagainst her in the hour of his death. He would not let the servant gountil she had promised him that she would be silent. Then he smiled oncemore."Go quickly. Oh, you will see me again; it will not be yet."Day broke at last, the melancholy dawn of the pale November day. Pascalhad had the shutters opened, and when he was left alone he watched thebrightening dawn, doubtless that of his last day of life. It had rainedthe night before, and the mild sun was still veiled by clouds. From theplane trees came the morning carols of the birds, while far away in thesleeping country a locomotive whistled with a prolonged moan. And hewas alone; alone in the great melancholy house, whose emptiness he feltaround him, whose silence he heard. The light slowly increased, andhe watched the patches it made on the window-panes broadening andbrightening. Then the candle paled in the growing light, and the wholeroom became visible. And with the dawn, as he had anticipated, camerelief. The sight of the familiar objects around him brought himconsolation.But Pascal, although the attack had passed away, still sufferedhorribly. A sharp pain remained in the hollow of his chest, and his leftarm, benumbed, hung from his shoulder like lead. In his long waitingfor the help that Martine had gone to bring, he had reflected onthe suffering which made the flesh cry out. And he found that he wasresigned; he no longer felt the rebelliousness which the mere sight ofphysical pain had formerly awakened in him. It had exasperated him, asif it had been a monstrous and useless cruelty of nature. In his doubtsas a physician, he had attended his patients only to combat it, and torelieve it. If he ended by accepting it, now that he himself sufferedits horrible torture, was it that he had risen one degree higher in hisfaith of life, to that serene height whence life appeared altogethergood, even with the fatal condition of suffering attached to it;suffering which is perhaps its spring? Yes, to live all of life, to liveit and to suffer it all without rebellion, without believing that it ismade better by being made painless, this presented itself clearly tohis dying eyes, as the greatest courage and the greatest wisdom. And tocheat pain while he waited, he reviewed his latest theories; he dreamedof a means of utilizing suffering by transforming it into action, intowork. If it be true that man feels pain more acutely according as herises in the scale of civilization, it is also certain that he becomesstronger through it, better armed against it, more capable of resistingit. The organ, the brain which works, develops and grows stronger,provided the equilibrium between the sensations which it receives andthe work which it gives back be not broken. Might not one hope, then,for a humanity in which the amount of work accomplished would so exactlyequal the sum of sensations received, that suffering would be utilizedand, as it were, abolished?The sun had risen, and Pascal was confusedly revolving these distanthopes in his mind, in the drowsiness produced by his disease, when hefelt a new attack coming on. He had a moment of cruel anxiety--wasthis the end? Was he going to die alone? But at this instant hurriedfootsteps mounted the stairs, and a moment later Ramond entered,followed by Martine. And the patient had time to say before the attackbegan:"Quick! quick! a hypodermic injection of pure water."Unfortunately the doctor had to look for the little syringe and thento prepare everything. This occupied some minutes, and the attack wasterrible. He followed its progress with anxiety--the face becomingdistorted, the lips growing livid. Then when he had given the injection,he observed that the phenomena, for a moment stationary, slowlydiminished in intensity. Once more the catastrophe was averted.As soon as he recovered his breath Pascal, glancing at the clock, saidin his calm, faint voice:"My friend, it is seven o'clock--in twelve hours, at seven o'clockto-night, I shall be dead."And as the young man was about to protest, to argue the question, "No,"he resumed, "do not try to deceive me. You have witnessed the attack.You know what it means as well as I do. Everything will now proceed withmathematical exactness; and, hour by hour, I could describe to you thephases of the disease."He stopped, gasped for breath, and then added:"And then, all is well; I am content. Clotilde will be here at five; allI ask is to see her and to die in her arms."A few moments later, however, he experienced a sensible improvement. Theeffect of the injection seemed truly miraculous; and he was able to situp in bed, his back resting against the pillows. He spoke clearly, andwith more ease, and never had the lucidity of his mind appeared greater."You know, master," said, Ramond, "that I will not leave you. I havetold my wife, and we will spend the day together; and, whatever you maysay to the contrary, I am very confident that it will not be the last.You will let me make myself at home, here, will you not?"Pascal smiled, and gave orders to Martine to go and prepare breakfastfor Ramond, saying that if they needed her they would call her. And thetwo men remained alone, conversing with friendly intimacy; the one withhis white hair and long white beard, lying down, discoursing like asage, the other sitting at his bedside, listening with the respect of adisciple."In truth," murmured the master, as if he were speaking to himself, "theeffect of those injections is extraordinary."Then in a stronger voice, he said almost gaily:"My friend Ramond, it may not be a very great present that I am givingyou, but I am going to leave you my manuscripts. Yes, Clotilde hasorders to send them to you when I shall be no more. Look through them,and you will perhaps find among them things that are not so very bad. Ifyou get a good idea from them some day--well, that will be so much thebetter for the world."And then he made his scientific testament. He was clearly consciousthat he had been himself only a solitary pioneer, a precursor, planningtheories which he tried to put in practise, but which failed becauseof the imperfection of his method. He recalled his enthusiasm when hebelieved he had discovered, in his injections of nerve substance, theuniversal panacea, then his disappointments, his fits of despair, theshocking death of Lafouasse, consumption carrying off Valentin in spiteof all his efforts, madness again conquering Sarteur and causing him tohang himself. So that he would depart full of doubt, having no longerthe confidence necessary to the physician, and so enamored of life thathe had ended by putting all his faith in it, certain that it must drawfrom itself alone its health and strength. But he did not wish to closeup the future; he was glad, on the contrary, to bequeath his hypothesesto the younger generation. Every twenty years theories changed;established truths only, on which science continued to build, remainedunshaken. Even if he had only the merit of giving to science a momentaryhypothesis, his work would not be lost, for progress consisted assuredlyin the effort, in the onward march of the intellect.And then who could say that he had died in vain, troubled and weary, hishopes concerning the injections unrealized--other workers would come,young, ardent, confident, who would take up the idea, elucidate it,expand it. And perhaps a new epoch, a new world would date from this."Ah, my dear Ramond," he continued, "if one could only live life overagain. Yes, I would take up my idea again, for I have been struck latelyby the singular efficacy of injections even of pure water. It is not theliquid, then, that matters, but simply the mechanical action. During thelast month I have written a great deal on that subject. You willfind some curious notes and observations there. In short, I should beinclined to put all my faith in work, to place health in the harmoniousworking of all the organs, a sort of dynamic therapeutics, if I mayventure to use the expression."He had gradually grown excited, forgetting his approaching death in hisardent curiosity about life. And he sketched, with broad strokes, hislast theory. Man was surrounded by a medium--nature--which irritatedby perpetual contact the sensitive extremities of the nerves. Hence theaction, not only of the senses, but of the entire surface of the body,external and internal. For it was these sensations which, reverberatingin the brain, in the marrow, and in the nervous centers, were thereconverted into tonicity, movements, and thoughts; and he was convincedthat health consisted in the natural progress of this work, in receivingsensations, and in giving them back in thoughts and in actions, thehuman machine being thus fed by the regular play of the organs. Workthus became the great law, the regulator of the living universe. Henceit became necessary if the equilibrium were broken, if the externalexcitations ceased to be sufficient, for therapeutics to createartificial excitations, in order to reestablish the tonicity which isthe state of perfect health. And he dreamed of a whole new system oftreatment--suggestion, the all-powerful authority of the physician,for the senses; electricity, friction, massage for the skin and for thetendons; diet for the stomach; air cures on high plateaus for thelungs, and, finally, transfusion, injections of distilled water, for thecirculatory system. It was the undeniable and purely mechanical actionof these latter that had put him on the track; all he did now was toextend the hypothesis, impelled by his generalizing spirit; he saw theworld saved anew in this perfect equilibrium, as much work given assensation received, the balance of the world restored by unceasinglabor.Here he burst into a frank laugh."There! I have started off again. I, who was firmly convinced that theonly wisdom was not to interfere, to let nature take its course. Ah,what an incorrigible old fool I am!"Ramond caught his hands in an outburst of admiration and affection."Master, master! it is of enthusiasm, of folly like yours that genius ismade. Have no fear, I have listened to you, I will endeavor to be worthyof the heritage you leave; and I think, with you, that perhaps the greatfuture lies entirely there."In the sad and quiet room Pascal began to speak again, with thecourageous tranquillity of a dying philosopher giving his last lesson.He now reviewed his personal observations; he said that he had oftencured himself by work, regular and methodical work, not carried toexcess. Eleven o'clock struck; he urged Ramond to take his breakfast,and he continued the conversation, soaring to lofty and distant heights,while Martine served the meal. The sun had at last burst through themorning mists, a sun still half-veiled in clouds, and mild, whose goldenlight warmed the room. Presently, after taking a few sips of milk,Pascal remained silent.At this moment the young physician was eating a pear."Are you in pain again?" he asked."No, no; finish."But he could not deceive Ramond. It was an attack, and a terrible one.The suffocation came with the swiftness of a thunderbolt, and he fellback on the pillow, his face already blue. He clutched at the bedclothesto support himself, to raise the dreadful weight which oppressed hischest. Terrified, livid, he kept his wide open eyes fixed upon theclock, with a dreadful expression of despair and grief; and for tenminutes it seemed as if every moment must be his last.Ramond had immediately given him a hypodermic injection. The relief wasslow to come, the efficacy less than before.When Pascal revived, large tears stood in his eyes. He did not speaknow, he wept. Presently, looking at the clock with his darkening vision,he said:"My friend, I shall die at four o'clock; I shall not see her."And as his young colleague, in order to divert his thoughts, declared,in spite of appearances, that the end was not so near, Pascal, againbecoming enthusiastic, wished to give him a last lesson, based on directobservation. He had, as it happened, attended several cases similar tohis own, and he remembered especially to have dissected at the hospitalthe heart of a poor old man affected with sclerosis."I can see it--my heart. It is the color of a dead leaf; its fibers arebrittle, wasted, one would say, although it has augmented slightly involume. The inflammatory process has hardened it; it would be difficultto cut--"He continued in a lower voice. A little before, he had felt his heartgrowing weaker, its contractions becoming feebler and slower. Insteadof the normal jet of blood there now issued from the aorta only a redfroth. Back of it all the veins were engorged with black blood; thesuffocation increased, according as the lift and force pump, theregulator of the whole machine, moved more slowly. And after theinjection he had been able to follow in spite of his suffering thegradual reviving of the organ as the stimulus set it beating again,removing the black venous blood, and sending life into it anew, withthe red arterial blood. But the attack would return as soon as themechanical effect of the injection should cease. He could predict italmost within a few minutes. Thanks to the injections he would havethree attacks more. The third would carry him off; he would die at fouro'clock.Then, while his voice grew gradually weaker, in a last outburst ofenthusiasm, he apostrophized the courage of the heart, that persistentlife maker, working ceaselessly, even during sleep, when the otherorgans rested."Ah, brave heart! how heroically you struggle! What faithful, whatgenerous muscles, never wearied! You have loved too much, you have beattoo fast in the past months, and that is why you are breaking now,brave heart, who do not wish to die, and who strive rebelliously to beatstill!"But now the first of the attacks which had been announced came on.Pascal came out of this panting, haggard, his speech sibilant andpainful. Low moans escaped him, in spite of his courage. Good God! wouldthis torture never end? And yet his most ardent desire was to prolonghis agony, to live long enough to embrace Clotilde a last time. If hemight only be deceiving himself, as Ramond persisted in declaring. If hemight only live until five o'clock. His eyes again turned to the clock,they never now left the hands, every minute seeming an eternity. Theymarked three o'clock. Then half-past three. Ah, God! only two hours oflife, two hours more of life. The sun was already sinking toward thehorizon; a great calm descended from the pale winter sky, and he heardat intervals the whistles of the distant locomotives crossing the bareplain. The train that was passing now was the one going to the Tulettes;the other, the one coming from Marseilles, would it never arrive, then!At twenty minutes to four Pascal signed to Ramond to approach. He couldno longer speak loud enough to be heard."You see, in order that I might live until six o'clock, the pulse shouldbe stronger. I have still some hope, however, but the second movement isalmost imperceptible, the heart will soon cease to beat."And in faint, despairing accents he called on Clotilde again and again.The immeasurable grief which he felt at not being able to see her againbroke forth in this faltering and agonized appeal. Then his anxietyabout his manuscripts returned, an ardent entreaty shone in his eyes,until at last he found the strength to falter again:"Do not leave me; the key is under my pillow; tell Clotilde to take it;she has my directions."At ten minutes to four another hypodermic injection was given, butwithout effect. And just as four o'clock was striking, the second attackdeclared itself. Suddenly, after a fit of suffocation, he threw himselfout of bed; he desired to rise, to walk, in a last revival of hisstrength. A need of space, of light, of air, urged him toward the skies.Then there came to him an irresistible appeal from life, his whole life,from the adjoining workroom, where he had spent his days. And he wentthere, staggering, suffocating, bending to the left side, supportinghimself by the furniture.Dr. Ramond precipitated himself quickly toward him to stop him, crying:"Master, master! lie down again, I entreat you!"But Pascal paid no heed to him, obstinately determined to die on hisfeet. The desire to live, the heroic idea of work, alone survived inhim, carrying him onward bodily. He faltered hoarsely:"No, no--out there, out there--"His friend was obliged to support him, and he walked thus, stumbling andhaggard, to the end of the workroom, and dropped into his chair besidehis table, on which an unfinished page still lay among a confusion ofpapers and books.Here he gasped for breath and his eyes closed. After a moment he openedthem again, while his hands groped about, seeking his work, no doubt.They encountered the genealogical tree in the midst of other papersscattered about. Only two days before he had corrected some dates in it.He recognized it, and drawing it toward him, spread it out."Master, master! you will kill yourself!" cried Ramond, overcome withpity and admiration at this extraordinary spectacle.Pascal did not listen, did not hear. He felt a pencil under his fingers.He took it and bent over the tree, as if his dying eyes no longer saw.The name of Maxime arrested his attention, and he wrote: "Died of ataxiain 1873," in the certainty that his nephew would not live through theyear. Then Clotilde's name, beside it, struck him and he completed thenote thus: "Has a son, by her Uncle Pascal, in 1874." But it was his ownname that he sought wearily and confusedly. When he at last found ithis hand grew firmer, and he finished his note, in upright and boldcharacters: "Died of heart disease, November 7, 1873." This was thesupreme effort, the rattle in his throat increased, everything wasfading into nothingness, when he perceived the blank leaf aboveClotilde's name. His vision grew dark, his fingers could no longer holdthe pencil, but he was still able to add, in unsteady letters, intowhich passed the tortured tenderness, the wild disorder of his poorheart: "The unknown child, to be born in 1874. What will it be?" Then heswooned, and Martine and Ramond with difficulty carried him back to bed.The third attack came on about four o'clock. In this last access ofsuffocation Pascal's countenance expressed excruciating suffering. Deathwas to be very painful; he must endure to the end his martyrdom, as aman and a scientist. His wandering gaze still seemed to seek the clock,to ascertain the hour. And Ramond, seeing his lips move, bent down andplaced his ear to the mouth of the dying man. The latter, in effect, wasstammering some vague words, so faint that they scarcely rose above abreath:"Four o'clock--the heart is stopping; no more red blood in theaorta--the valve relaxes and bursts."A dreadful spasm shook him; his breathing grew fainter."Its progress is too rapid. Do not leave me; the key is under thepillow--Clotilde, Clotilde--"At the foot of the bed Martine was kneeling, choked with sobs. Shesaw well that monsieur was dying. She had not dared to go for a priestnotwithstanding her great desire to do so; and she was herself recitingthe prayers for the dying; she prayed ardently that God would pardonmonsieur, and that monsieur might go straight to Paradise.Pascal was dying. His face was quite blue. After a few seconds ofimmobility, he tried to breathe: he put out his lips, opened his poormouth, like a little bird opening its beak to get a last mouthful ofair. And he was dead.XIII.It was not until after breakfast, at about one o'clock, that Clotildereceived the despatch. On this day it had chanced that she had quarreledwith her brother Maxime, who, taking advantage of his privileges as aninvalid, had tormented her more and more every day by his unreasonablecaprices and his outbursts of ill temper. In short, her visit to him hadnot proved a success. He found that she was too simple and too seriousto cheer him; and he had preferred, of late, the society of Rose, thefair-haired young girl, with the innocent look, who amused him. So thatwhen his sister told him that their uncle had sent for her, and that shewas going away, he gave his approval at once, and although he asked herto return as soon as she should have settled her affairs at home, he didso only with the desire of showing himself amiable, and he did not pressthe invitation.Clotilde spent the afternoon in packing her trunks. In the feverishexcitement of so sudden a decision she had thought of nothing but thejoy of her return. But after the hurry of dinner was over, after she hadsaid good-by to her brother, after the interminable drive in a hackneycoach along the avenue of the Bois de Boulogne to the Lyons railwaystation, when she found herself in the ladies' compartment, startingon the long journey on a cold and rainy November night, already rollingaway from Paris, her excitement began to abate, and reflections forcedtheir way into her mind and began to trouble her. Why this brief andurgent despatch: "I await you; start this evening." Doubtless it was theanswer to her letter; but she knew how greatly Pascal had desired thatshe should remain in Paris, where he thought she was happy, and she wasastonished at his hasty summons. She had not expected a despatch, buta letter, arranging for her return a few weeks later. There must besomething else, then; perhaps he was ill and felt a desire, a longing tosee her again at once. And from this time forward this fear seized herwith the force of a presentiment, and grew stronger and stronger, untilit soon took complete possession of her.All night long the rain beat furiously against the windows of the trainwhile they were crossing the plains of Burgundy, and did not cease untilthey reached Macon. When they had passed Lyons the day broke. Clotildehad Pascal's letters with her, and she had waited impatiently for thedaylight that she might read again carefully these letters, thewriting of which had seemed changed to her. And noticing the unsteadycharacters, the breaks in the words, she felt a chill at her heart. Hewas ill, very ill--she had become certain of this now, by a divinationin which there was less of reasoning than of subtle prescience. And therest of the journey seemed terribly long, for her anguish increasedin proportion as she approached its termination. And worse than all,arriving at Marseilles at half-past twelve, there was no train forPlassans until twenty minutes past three. Three long hours of waiting!She breakfasted at the buffet in the railway station, eating hurriedly,as if she was afraid of missing this train; then she dragged herselfinto the dusty garden, going from bench to bench in the pale, mildsunshine, among omnibuses and hackney coaches. At last she was once morein the train, which stopped at every little way station. When they wereapproaching Plassans she put her head out of the window eagerly, longingto see the town again after her short absence of two months. It seemedto her as if she had been away for twenty years, and that everythingmust be changed. When the train was leaving the little station ofSainte-Marthe her emotion reached its height when, leaning out, shesaw in the distance La Souleiade with the two secular cypresses on theterrace, which could be seen three leagues off.It was five o'clock, and twilight was already falling. The trainstopped, and Clotilde descended. But it was a surprise and a keen griefto her not to see Pascal waiting for her on the platform. She had beensaying to herself since they had left Lyons: "If I do not see him atonce, on the arrival of the train, it will be because he is ill." Hemight be in the waiting-room, however, or with a carriage outside. Shehurried forward, but she saw no one but Father Durieu, a driver whom thedoctor was in the habit of employing. She questioned him eagerly. Theold man, a taciturn Provencal, was in no haste to answer. His wagon wasthere, and he asked her for the checks for her luggage, wishing to seeabout the trunks before anything else. In a trembling voice she repeatedher question:"Is everybody well, Father Durieu?""Yes, mademoiselle."And she was obliged to put question after question to him before shesucceeded in eliciting the information that it was Martine who had toldhim, at about six o'clock the day before, to be at the station with hiswagon, in time to meet the train. He had not seen the doctor, no one hadseen him, for two months past. It might very well be since he was nothere that he had been obliged to take to his bed, for there was a reportin the town that he was not very well."Wait until I get the luggage, mademoiselle," he ended, "there is roomfor you on the seat.""No, Father Durieu, it would be too long to wait. I will walk."She ascended the slope rapidly. Her heart was so tightened thatshe could scarcely breathe. The sun had sunk behind the hills ofSainte-Marthe, and a fine mist was falling from the chill gray Novembersky, and as she took the road to Les Fenouilleres she caught anotherglimpse of La Souleiade, which struck a chill to her heart--the frontof the house, with all its shutters closed, and wearing a look ofabandonment and desolation in the melancholy twilight.But Clotilde received the final and terrible blow when she saw Ramondstanding at the hall door, apparently waiting for her. He had indeedbeen watching for her, and had come downstairs to break the dreadfulnews gently to her. She arrived out of breath; she had crossed thequincunx of plane trees near the fountain to shorten the way, and onseeing the young man there instead of Pascal, whom she had in spite ofeverything expected to see, she had a presentiment of overwhelming ruin,of irreparable misfortune. Ramond was pale and agitated, notwithstandingthe effort he made to control his feelings. At the first moment he couldnot find a word to say, but waited to be questioned. Clotilde, who washerself suffocating, said nothing. And they entered the house thus; heled her to the dining-room, where they remained for a few seconds, faceto face, in mute anguish."He is ill, is he not?" she at last faltered."Yes," he said, "he is ill.""I knew it at once when I saw you," she replied. "I knew when he was nothere that he must be ill. He is very ill, is he not?" she persisted.As he did not answer but grew still paler, she looked at him fixedly.And on the instant she saw the shadow of death upon him; on his handsthat still trembled, that had assisted the dying man; on his sad face;in his troubled eyes, which still retained the reflection of the deathagony; in the neglected and disordered appearance of the physician who,for twelve hours, had maintained an unavailing struggle against death.She gave a loud cry:"He is dead!"She tottered, and fell fainting into the arms of Ramond, who with agreat sob pressed her in a brotherly embrace. And thus they wept on eachother's neck.When he had seated her in a chair, and she was able to speak, he said:"It was I who took the despatch you received to the telegraph officeyesterday, at half-past ten o'clock. He was so happy, so full of hope!He was forming plans for the future--a year, two years of life. And thismorning, at four o'clock, he had the first attack, and he sent for me.He saw at once that he was doomed, but he expected to last untilsix o'clock, to live long enough to see you again. But the diseaseprogressed too rapidly. He described its progress to me, minute byminute, like a professor in the dissecting room. He died with your nameupon his lips, calm, but full of anguish, like a hero."Clotilde listened, her eyes drowned in tears which flowed endlessly.Every word of the relation of this piteous and stoical death penetratedher heart and stamped itself there. She reconstructed every hour of thedreadful day. She followed to its close its grand and mournful drama.She would live it over in her thoughts forever.But her despairing grief overflowed when Martine, who had entered theroom a moment before, said in a harsh voice:"Ah, mademoiselle has good reason to cry! for if monsieur is dead,mademoiselle is to blame for it."The old servant stood apart, near the door of her kitchen, in such apassion of angry grief, because they had taken her master from her,because they had killed him, that she did not even try to find a wordof welcome or consolation for this child whom she had brought up. Andwithout calculating the consequences of her indiscretion, the grief orthe joy which she might cause, she relieved herself by telling all sheknew."Yes, if monsieur has died, it is because mademoiselle went away."From the depths of her overpowering grief Clotilde protested. She hadexpected to see Martine weeping with her, like Ramond, and she wassurprised to feel that she was an enemy."Why, it was he who would not let me stay, who insisted upon my goingaway," she said."Oh, well! mademoiselle must have been willing to go or she wouldhave been more clear-sighted. The night before your departure I foundmonsieur half-suffocated with grief; and when I wished to informmademoiselle, he himself prevented me; he had such courage. Then I couldsee it all, after mademoiselle had gone. Every night it was the samething over again, and he could hardly keep from writing to you to comeback. In short, he died of it, that is the pure truth."A great light broke in on Clotilde's mind, making her at the same timevery happy and very wretched. Good God! what she had suspected for amoment, was then true. Afterward she had been convinced, seeing Pascal'sangry persistence, that he was speaking the truth; that between her andwork he had chosen work sincerely, like a man of science with whom loveof work has gained the victory over the love of woman. And yet hehad not spoken the truth; he had carried his devotion, hisself-forgetfulness to the point of immolating himself to what hebelieved to be her happiness. And the misery of things willed that heshould have been mistaken, that he should have thus consummated theunhappiness of both.Clotilde again protested wildly:"But how could I have known? I obeyed; I put all my love in myobedience.""Ah," cried Martine again, "it seems to me that I should have guessed."Ramond interposed gently. He took Clotilde's hands once more in his, andexplained to her that grief might indeed have hastened the fatal issue,but that the master had unhappily been doomed for some time past. Theaffection of the heart from which he had suffered must have been of longstanding--a great deal of overwork, a certain part of heredity, and,finally, his late absorbing love, and the poor heart had broken."Let us go upstairs," said Clotilde simply. "I wish to see him."Upstairs in the death-chamber the blinds were closed, shutting out eventhe melancholy twilight. On a little table at the foot of the bed burnedtwo tapers in two candlesticks. And they cast a pale yellow light onPascal's form extended on the bed, the feet close together, the handsfolded on the breast. The eyes had been piously closed. The face, of abluish hue still, but already looking calm and peaceful, framed by theflowing white hair and beard, seemed asleep. He had been dead scarcelyan hour and a half, yet already infinite serenity, eternal silence,eternal repose, had begun.Seeing him thus, at the thought that he no longer heard her, that he nolonger saw her, that she was alone now, that she was to kiss him for thelast time, and then lose him forever, Clotilde, in an outburst ofgrief, threw herself upon the bed, and in broken accents of passionatetenderness cried:"Oh, master, master, master--"She pressed her lips to the dead man's forehead, and, feeling it stillwarm with life, she had a momentary illusion: she fancied that hefelt this last caress, so cruelly awaited. Did he not smile in hisimmobility, happy at last, and able to die, now that he felt her herebeside him? Then, overcome by the dreadful reality, she burst again intowild sobs.Martine entered, bringing a lamp, which she placed on a corner ofthe chimney-piece, and she heard Ramond, who was watching Clotilde,disquieted at seeing her passionate grief, say:"I shall take you away from the room if you give way like this. Considerthat you have some one else to think of now."The servant had been surprised at certain words which she had overheardby chance during the day. Suddenly she understood, and she turned palereven than before, and on her way out of the room, she stopped at thedoor to hear more."The key of the press is under his pillow," said Ramond, lowering hisvoice; "he told me repeatedly to tell you so. You know what you have todo?"Clotilde made an effort to remember and to answer."What I have to do? About the papers, is it not? Yes, yes, I remember; Iam to keep the envelopes and to give you the other manuscripts. Have nofear, I am quite calm, I will be very reasonable. But I will not leavehim; I will spend the night here very quietly, I promise you."She was so unhappy, she seemed so resolved to watch by him, to remainwith him, until he should be taken away, that the young physicianallowed her to have her way."Well, I will leave you now. They will be expecting me at home. Thenthere are all sorts of formalities to be gone through--to give noticeat the mayor's office, the funeral, of which I wish to spare you thedetails. Trouble yourself about nothing. Everything will be arrangedto-morrow when I return."He embraced her once more and then went away. And it was only then thatMartine left the room, behind him, and locking the hall door she ran outinto the darkness.Clotilde was now alone in the chamber; and all around and about her, inthe unbroken silence, she felt the emptiness of the house. Clotilde wasalone with the dead Pascal. She placed a chair at the head of the bedand sat there motionless, alone. On arriving, she had merely removed herhat: now, perceiving that she still had on her gloves, she took themoff also. But she kept on her traveling dress, crumpled and dusty, aftertwenty hours of railway travel. No doubt Father Durieu had brought thetrunks long ago, and left them downstairs. But it did not occur to her,nor had she the strength to wash herself and change her clothes, butremained sitting, overwhelmed with grief, on the chair into which shehad dropped. One regret, a great remorse, filled her to the exclusion ofall else. Why had she obeyed him? Why had she consented to leave him?If she had remained she had the ardent conviction that he would not havedied. She would have lavished so much love, so many caresses upon him,that she would have cured him. If one was anxious to keep a belovedbeing from dying one should remain with him and, if necessary, giveone's heart's blood to keep him alive. It was her own fault if she hadlost him, if she could not now with a caress awaken him from hiseternal sleep. And she thought herself imbecile not to have understood;cowardly, not to have devoted herself to him; culpable, and to beforever punished for having gone away when plain common sense, indefault of feeling, ought to have kept her here, bound, as a submissiveand affectionate subject, to the task of watching over her king.The silence had become so complete, so profound, that Clotilde liftedher eyes for a moment from Pascal's face to look around the room. Shesaw only vague shadows--the two tapers threw two yellow patches on thehigh ceiling. At this moment she remembered the letters he had writtento her, so short, so cold; and she comprehended his heroic sacrifice,the torture it had been to him to silence his heart, desiring toimmolate himself to the end. What strength must he not have requiredfor the accomplishment of the plan of happiness, sublime and disastrous,which he had formed for her. He had resolved to pass out of her life inorder to save her from his old age and his poverty; he wished her to berich and free, to enjoy her youth, far away from him; this indeed wasutter self-effacement, complete absorption in the love of another. Andshe felt a profound gratitude, a sweet solace in the thought, mingledwith a sort of angry bitterness against evil fortune. Then, suddenly,the happy years of her childhood and her long youth spent beside him whohad always been so kind and so good-humored, rose before her--how he hadgradually won her affection, how she had felt that she was his, afterthe quarrels which had separated them for a time, and with what atransport of joy she had at last given herself to him.Seven o'clock struck. Clotilde started as the clear tones broke theprofound silence. Who was it that had spoken? Then she remembered, andshe looked at the clock. And when the last sound of the seven strokes,each of which had fallen like a knell upon her heart, had died away, sheturned her eyes again on the motionless face of Pascal, and once moreshe abandoned herself to her grief.It was in the midst of this ever-increasing prostration that Clotilde, afew minutes later, heard a sudden sound of sobbing. Some one had rushedinto the room; she looked round and saw her Grandmother Felicite. Butshe did not stir, she did not speak, so benumbed was she with grief.Martine, anticipating the orders which Clotilde would undoubtedly havegiven her, had hurried to old Mme. Rougon's, to give her the dreadfulnews; and the latter, dazed at first by the suddenness of thecatastrophe, and afterward greatly agitated, had hurried to the house,overflowing with noisy grief. She burst into tears at sight of her son,and then embraced Clotilde, who returned her kiss, as in a dream. Andfrom this instant the latter, without emerging from the overwhelminggrief in which she isolated herself, felt that she was no longer alone,hearing a continual stir and bustle going on around her. It was Felicitecrying, coming in and going out on tiptoe, setting things in order,spying about, whispering, dropping into a chair, to get up again amoment afterward, after saying that she was going to die in it. At nineo'clock she made a last effort to persuade her granddaughter to eatsomething. Twice already she had lectured her in a low voice; she camenow again to whisper to her:"Clotilde, my dear, I assure you you are wrong. You must keep up yourstrength or you will never be able to hold out."But the young woman, with a shake of her head, again refused."Come, you breakfasted at the buffet at Marseilles, I suppose, but youhave eaten nothing since. Is that reasonable? I do not wish you to fallill also. Martine has some broth. I have told her to make a light soupand to roast a chicken. Go down and eat a mouthful, only a mouthful, andI will remain here."With the same patient gesture Clotilde again refused. At last shefaltered:"Do not ask me, grandmother, I entreat you. I could not; it would chokeme."She did not speak again, falling back into her former state of apathy.She did not sleep, however, her wide open eyes were fixed persistentlyon Pascal's face. For hours she sat there, motionless, erect, rigid, asif her spirit were far away with the dead. At ten o'clock she heard anoise; it was Martine bringing up the lamp. Toward eleven Felicite, whowas sitting watching in an armchair, seemed to grow restless, got up andwent out of the room, and came back again. From this forth there was acontinual coming and going as of impatient footsteps prowling aroundthe young woman, who was still awake, her large eyes fixed motionless onPascal. Twelve o'clock struck, and one persistent thought alone piercedher weary brain, like a nail, and prevented sleep--why had she obeyedhim? If she had remained she would have revived him with her youth, andhe would not have died. And it was not until a little before onethat she felt this thought, too, grow confused and lose itself in anightmare. And she fell into a heavy sleep, worn out with grief andfatigue.When Martine had announced to Mme. Rougon the unexpected death of herson Pascal, in the shock which she received there was as much of angeras of grief. What! her dying son had not wished to see her; he had madethis servant swear not to inform her of his illness! This thought sentthe blood coursing swiftly through her veins, as if the struggle betweenthem, which had lasted during his whole life, was to be continued beyondthe grave. Then, when after hastily dressing herself she had hurriedto La Souleiade, the thought of the terrible envelopes, of all themanuscripts piled up in the press, had filled her with trembling rage.Now that Uncle Macquart and Aunt Dide were dead, she no longer fearedwhat she called the abomination of the Tulettes; and even poor littleCharles, in dying, had carried with him one of the most humiliatingof the blots on the family. There remained only the envelopes, theabominable envelopes, to menace the glorious Rougon legend which she hadspent her whole life in creating, which was the sole thought of her oldage, the work to the triumph of which she had persistently devotedthe last efforts of her wily and active brain. For long years she hadwatched these envelopes, never wearying, beginning the struggle overagain, when he had thought her beaten, always alert and persistent. Ah!if she could only succeed in obtaining possession of them and destroyingthem! It would be the execrable past destroyed, effaced; it would be theglory of her family, so hardly won, at last freed from all fear, at lastshining untarnished, imposing its lie upon history. And she saw herselftraversing the three quarters of Plassans, saluted by every one, bearingherself as proudly as a queen, mourning nobly for the fallen Empire. Sothat when Martine informed her that Clotilde had come, she quickened hersteps as she approached La Souleiade, spurred by the fear of arrivingtoo late.But as soon as she was installed in the house, Felicite at once regainedher composure. There was no hurry, they had the whole night before them.She wished, however, to win over Martine without delay, and she knewwell how to influence this simple creature, bound up in the doctrines ofa narrow religion. Going down to the kitchen, then, to see the chickenroasting, she began by affecting to be heartbroken at the thought of herson dying without having made his peace with the Church. She questionedthe servant, pressing her for particulars. But the latter shook her headdisconsolately--no, no priest had come, monsieur had not even made thesign of the cross. She, only, had knelt down to say the prayers for thedying, which certainly could not be enough for the salvation of a soul.And yet with what fervor she had prayed to the good God that monsieurmight go straight to Paradise!With her eyes fixed on the chicken turning on the spit, before a brightfire, Felicite resumed in a lower voice, with an absorbed air:"Ah, my poor girl, what will most prevent him from going to Paradise arethe abominable papers which the unhappy man has left behind him up therein the press. I cannot understand why it is that lightning from heavenhas not struck those papers before this and reduced them to ashes. Ifthey are allowed to leave this house it will be ruin and disgrace andeternal perdition!"Martine listened, very pale."Then madame thinks it would be a good work to destroy them, a work thatwould assure the repose of monsieur's soul?""Great God! Do I believe it! Why, if I had those dreadful papers in myhands, I would throw every one of them into the fire. Oh, you would notneed then to put on any more sticks; with the manuscripts upstairs aloneyou would have fuel enough to roast three chickens like that."The servant took a long spoon and began to baste the fowl. She, too,seemed now to reflect."Only we haven't got them. I even overheard some words on the subject,which I may repeat to madame. It was when mademoiselle went upstairs.Dr. Raymond spoke to her about the papers, asking her if she rememberedsome orders which she had received, before she went away, no doubt; andshe answered that she remembered, that she was to keep the envelopes andto give him all the other manuscripts."Felicite trembled; she could not restrain a terrified movement. Alreadyshe saw the papers slipping out of her reach; and it was not theenvelopes only which she desired, but all the manuscripts, all thatunknown, suspicious, and secret work, from which nothing but scandalcould come, according to the obtuse and excitable mind of the proud old_bourgeoise_."But we must act!" she cried, "act immediately, this very night!To-morrow it may be too late.""I know where the key of the press is," answered Martine in a low voice."The doctor told mademoiselle."Felicite immediately pricked up her ears."The key; where is it?""Under the pillow, under monsieur's head."In spite of the bright blaze of the fire of vine branches the air seemedto grow suddenly chill, and the two old women were silent. The onlysound to be heard was the drip of the chicken juice falling into thepan.But after Mme. Rougon had eaten a hasty and solitary dinner she wentupstairs again with Martine. Without another word being spoken theyunderstood each other, it was decided that they would use all possiblemeans to obtain possession of the papers before daybreak. The simplestwas to take the key from under the pillow. Clotilde would no doubt atlast fall asleep--she seemed too exhausted not to succumb to fatigue.All they had to do was to wait. They set themselves to watch, then,going back and forth on tiptoe between the study and the bedroom,waiting for the moment when the young woman's large motionless eyesshould close in sleep. One of them would go to see, while the otherwaited impatiently in the study, where a lamp burned dully on the table.This was repeated every fifteen minutes until midnight. The fathomlesseyes, full of gloom and of an immense despair, did not close. A littlebefore midnight Felicite installed herself in an armchair at the foot ofthe bed, resolved not to leave the spot until her granddaughter shouldhave fallen asleep. From this forth she did not take her eyes offClotilde, and it filled her with a sort of fear to remark that the girlscarcely moved her eyelids, looking with that inconsolable fixity whichdefies sleep. Then she herself began to feel sleep stealing over her.Exasperated, trembling with nervous impatience, she could remain whereshe was no longer. And she went to rejoin the servant, who was watchingin the study."It is useless; she will not sleep," she said in a stifled and tremblingvoice. "We must find some other way."It had indeed occurred to her to break open the press.But the old oaken boards were strong, the old iron held firmly. Howcould they break the lock--not to speak of the noise they would make andwhich would certainly be heard in the adjoining room?She stood before the thick doors, however, and felt them with herfingers, seeking some weak spot."If I only had an instrument," she said.Martine, less eager, interrupted her, objecting: "Oh, no, no, madame!We might be surprised! Wait, I will go again and see if mademoiselle isasleep now."She went to the bedroom on tiptoe and returned immediately, saying:"Yes, she is asleep. Her eyes are closed, and she does not stir."Then both went to look at her, holding their breath and walking with theutmost caution, so that the boards might not creak. Clotilde had indeedjust fallen asleep: and her stupor seemed so profound that the two oldwomen grew bold. They feared, however, that they might touch and wakenher, for her chair stood close beside the bed. And then, to putone's hand under a dead man's pillow to rob him was a terrible andsacrilegious act, the thought of which filled them with terror. Might itnot disturb his repose? Might he not move at the shock? The thought madethem turn pale.Felicite had advanced with outstretched hand, but she drew back,stammering:"I am too short. You try, Martine."The servant in her turn approached the bed. But she was seized with sucha fit of trembling that she was obliged to retreat lest she should fall."No, no, I cannot!" she said. "It seems to me that monsieur is going toopen his eyes."And trembling and awe-struck they remained an instant longer in thelugubrious chamber full of the silence and the majesty of death, facingPascal, motionless forever, and Clotilde, overwhelmed by the grief ofher widowhood. Perhaps they saw, glorifying that mute head, guardingits work with all its weight, the nobility of a life spent in honorablelabor. The flame of the tapers burned palely. A sacred awe filled theair, driving them from the chamber.Felicite, who was so brave, who had never in her life flinched fromanything, not even from bloodshed, fled as if she was pursued, saying:"Come, come, Martine, we will find some other way; we will go look foran instrument."In the study they drew a breath of relief. Felicite looked in vain amongthe papers on Pascal's work-table for the genealogical tree, whichshe knew was usually there. She would so gladly have begun her work ofdestruction with this. It was there, but in her feverish excitement shedid not perceive it.Her desire drew her back again to the press, and she stood before it,measuring it and examining it with eager and covetous look. In spite ofher short stature, in spite of her eighty-odd years, she displayed anactivity and an energy that were truly extraordinary."Ah!" she repeated, "if I only had an instrument!"And she again sought the crevice in the colossus, the crack into whichshe might introduce her fingers, to break it open. She imagined plansof assault, she thought of using force, and then she fell back onstratagem, on some piece of treachery which would open to her the doors,merely by breathing upon them.Suddenly her glance kindled; she had discovered the means."Tell me, Martine; there is a hook fastening one of the doors, is therenot?""Yes, madame; it catches in a ring above the middle shelf. See, it isabout the height of this molding."Felicite made a triumphant gesture."Have you a gimlet--a large gimlet? Give me a gimlet!"Martine went down into her kitchen and brought back the tool that hadbeen asked."In that way, you see, we shall make no noise," resumed the old woman,setting herself to her task.With a strength which one would not have suspected in her little hands,withered by age, she inserted the gimlet, and made a hole at the heightindicated by the servant. But it was too low; she felt the point, aftera time, entering the shelf. A second attempt brought the instrument indirect contact with the iron hook. This time the hole was too near. Andshe multiplied the holes to right and left, until finally she succeededin pushing the hook out of the ring. The bolt of the lock slipped, andboth doors opened."At last!" cried Felicite, beside herself.Then she remained motionless for a moment, her ear turned uneasilytoward the bedroom, fearing that she had wakened Clotilde. But silencereigned throughout the dark and sleeping house. There came from thebedroom only the august peace of death; she heard nothing but the clearvibration of the clock; Clotilde fell asleep near one. And the pressyawned wide open, displaying the papers with which it overflowed, heapedup on its three shelves. Then she threw herself upon it, and the work ofdestruction began, in the midst of the sacred obscurity of the infiniterepose of this funereal vigil."At last!" she repeated, in a low voice, "after thirty years of waiting.Let us hurry--let us hurry. Martine, help me!"She had already drawn forward the high chair of the desk, and mounted onit at a bound, to take down, first of all, the papers on the top shelf,for she remembered that the envelopes were there. But she was surprisednot to see the thick blue paper wrappers; there was nothing there butbulky manuscripts, the doctor's completed but unpublished works, worksof inestimable value, all his researches, all his discoveries, themonument of his future fame, which he had left in Ramond's charge.Doubtless, some days before his death, thinking that only the envelopeswere in danger, and that no one in the world would be so daring as todestroy his other works, he had begun to classify and arrange the papersanew, and removed the envelopes out of sight."Ah, so much the worse!" murmured Felicite; "let us begin anywhere;there are so many of them that if we wish to get through we musthurry. While I am up here, let us clear these away forever. Here, catchMartine!"And she emptied the shelf, throwing the manuscripts, one by one, intothe arms of the servant, who laid them on the table with as little noiseas possible. Soon the whole heap was on it, and Felicite sprang downfrom the chair."To the fire! to the fire! We shall lay our hands on the others,and too, by and by, on those I am looking for. These can go into it,meantime. It will be a good riddance, at any rate, a fine clearance,yes, indeed! To the fire, to the fire with them all, even to thesmallest scrap of paper, even to the most illegible scrawl, if we wishto be certain of destroying the contamination of evil."She herself, fanatical and fierce, in her hatred of the truth, in hereagerness to destroy the testimony of science, tore off the first pageof one of the manuscripts, lighted it at the lamp, and then threw thisburning brand into the great fireplace, in which there had not been afire for perhaps twenty years, and she fed the fire, continuing tothrow on it the rest of the manuscript, piece by piece. The servant, asdetermined as herself, came to her assistance, taking another enormousnotebook, which she tore up leaf by leaf. From this forth the fire didnot cease to burn, filling the wide fireplace with a bright blaze, withtongues of flame that seemed to die away from time to time, only toburn up more brightly than ever when fresh fuel fed them. The firegrew larger, the heap of ashes rose higher and higher--a thick bed ofblackened leaves among which ran millions of sparks. But it was a long,a never-ending task; for when several pages were thrown on at a time,they would not burn; it was necessary to move them and turn them overwith the tongs; the best way was to stir them up and then wait untilthey were in a blaze, before adding more. The women soon grew skilful attheir task, and the work progressed at a rapid rate.In her haste to get a fresh armful of papers Felicite stumbled against achair."Oh, madame, take care," said Martine. "Some one might come!""Come? who should come? Clotilde? She is too sound asleep, poor girl.And even if any one should come, once it is finished, I don't care;I won't hide myself, you may be sure; I shall leave the empty pressstanding wide open; I shall say aloud that it is I who have purifiedthe house. When there is not a line of writing left, ah, good heavens! Ishall laugh at everything else!"For almost two hours the fireplace blazed. They went back to the pressand emptied the two other shelves, and now there remained only thebottom, which was heaped with a confusion of papers. Little by little,intoxicated by the heat of the bonfire, out of breath and perspiring,they gave themselves up to the savage joy of destruction. They stoopeddown, they blackened their hands, pushing in the partially consumedfragments, with gestures so violent, so feverishly excited, that theirgray locks fell in disorder over their shoulders. It was like a dance ofwitches, feeding a hellish fire for some abominable act--the martyrdomof a saint, the burning of written thought in the public square; a wholeworld of truth and hope destroyed. And the blaze of this fire, whichat moments made the flame of the lamp grow pale, lighted up the vastapartment, and made the gigantic shadows of the two women dance upon theceiling.But as she was emptying the bottom of the press, after having burned,handful by handful, the papers with which it had been filled, Feliciteuttered a stifled cry of triumph."Ah, here they are! To the fire! to the fire!"She had at last come upon the envelopes. Far back, behind the rampartformed by the notes, the doctor had hidden the blue paper wrappers. Andthen began a mad work of havoc, a fury of destruction; the envelopeswere gathered up in handfuls and thrown into the flames, filling thefireplace with a roar like that of a conflagration."They are burning, they are burning! They are burning at last! Hereis another, Martine, here is another. Ah, what a fire, what a gloriousfire!"But the servant was becoming uneasy."Take care, madame, you are going to set the house on fire. Don't youhear that roar?""Ah! what does that matter? Let it all burn. They are burning, they areburning; what a fine sight! Three more, two more, and, see, now the lastis burning!"She laughed with delight, beside herself, terrible to see, when somefragment of lighted soot fell down. The roar was becoming more and morefierce; the chimney, which was never swept, had caught fire. This seemedto excite her still more, while the servant, losing her head, began toscream and run about the room.Clotilde slept beside the dead Pascal, in the supreme calm of thebedroom, unbroken save by the light vibration of the clock strikingthe hours. The tapers burned with a tall, still flame, the air wasmotionless. And yet, in the midst of her heavy, dreamless sleep, sheheard, as in a nightmare, a tumult, an ever-increasing rush and roar.And when she opened her eyes she could not at first understand. Wherewas she? Why this enormous weight that crushed her heart? She came backto reality with a start of terror--she saw Pascal, she heard Martine'scries in the adjoining room, and she rushed out, in alarm, to learntheir cause.But at the threshold Clotilde took in the whole scene with crueldistinctness--the press wide open and completely empty; Martine maddenedby her fear of fire; Felicite radiant, pushing into the flames with herfoot the last fragments of the envelopes. Smoke and flying soot filledthe study, where the roaring of the fire sounded like the hoarse gaspingof a murdered man--the fierce roar which she had just heard in hersleep.And the cry which sprang from her lips was the same cry that Pascalhimself had uttered on the night of the storm, when he surprised her inthe act of stealing his papers."Thieves! assassins!"She precipitated herself toward the fireplace, and, in spite of thedreadful roaring of the flames, in spite of the falling pieces of soot,at the risk of setting her hair on fire, and of burning her hands,she gathered up the leaves which remained yet unconsumed and bravelyextinguished them, pressing them against her. But all this was verylittle, only some _debris_; not a complete page remained, not even afew fragments of the colossal labor, of the vast and patient work ofa lifetime, which the fire had destroyed there in two hours. And withgrowing anger, in a burst of furious indignation, she cried:"You are thieves, assassins! It is a wicked murder which you have justcommitted. You have profaned death, you have slain the mind, you haveslain genius."Old Mme. Rougon did not quail. She advanced, on the contrary, feelingno remorse, her head erect, defending the sentence of destructionpronounced and executed by her."It is to me you are speaking, to your grandmother. Is there nothing,then, that you respect? I have done what I ought to have done, what youyourself wished to do with us before.""Before, you had made me mad; but since then I have lived, I have loved,I have understood, and it is life that I defend. Even if it be terribleand cruel, the truth ought to be respected. Besides, it was a sacredlegacy bequeathed to my protection, the last thoughts of a dead man, allthat remained of a great mind, and which I should have obliged every oneto respect. Yes, you are my grandmother; I am well aware of it, and itis as if you had just burned your son!""Burn Pascal because I have burned his papers!" cried Felicite. "Doyou not know that I would have burned the town to save the honor of ourfamily!"She continued to advance, belligerent and victorious; and Clotilde, whohad laid on the table the blackened fragments rescued by her fromthe burning flames, protected them with her body, fearing that hergrandmother would throw them back again into the fire. She regarded thetwo women scornfully; she did not even trouble herself about the firein the fireplace, which fortunately went out of itself, while Martineextinguished with the shovel the burning soot and the last flames of thesmoldering ashes."You know very well, however," continued the old woman, whose littlefigure seemed to grow taller, "that I have had only one ambition, onepassion in life--to see our family rich and powerful. I have fought, Ihave watched all my life, I have lived as long as I have done, only toput down ugly stories and to leave our name a glorious one. Yes, I havenever despaired; I have never laid down my arms; I have been continuallyon the alert, ready to profit by the slightest circumstance. And all Idesired to do I have done, because I have known how to wait."And she waved her hand toward the empty press and the fireplace, wherethe last sparks were dying out."Now it is ended, our honor is safe; those abominable papers will nolonger accuse us, and I shall leave behind me nothing to be feared. TheRougons have triumphed."Clotilde, in a frenzy of grief, raised her arm, as if to drive her outof the room. But she left it of her own accord, and went down to thekitchen to wash her blackened hands and to fasten up her hair. Theservant was about to follow her when, turning her head, she saw heryoung mistress' gesture, and she returned."Oh! as for me, mademoiselle, I will go away the day after to-morrow,when monsieur shall be in the cemetery."There was a moment's silence."But I am not sending you away, Martine. I know well that it is not youwho are most to blame. You have lived in this house for thirty years.Remain, remain with me."The old maid shook her gray head, looking very pale and tired."No, I have served monsieur; I will serve no one after monsieur.""But I!""You, no!"Clotilde looked embarrassed, hesitated a moment, and remained silent.But Martine understood; she too seemed to reflect for an instant, andthen she said distinctly:"I know what you would say, but--no!"And she went on to settle her account, arranging the affair like apractical woman who knew the value of money."Since I have the means, I will go and live quietly on my incomesomewhere. As for you, mademoiselle, I can leave you, for you are notpoor. M. Ramond will explain to you to-morrow how an income of fourthousand francs was saved for you out of the money at the notary's.Meantime, here is the key of the desk, where you will find the fivethousand francs which monsieur left there. Oh? I know that there willbe no trouble between us. Monsieur did not pay me for the last threemonths; I have papers from him which prove it. In addition, I advancedlately almost two hundred francs out of my own pocket, without hisknowing where the money came from. It is all written down; I am not atall uneasy; mademoiselle will not wrong me by a centime. The day afterto-morrow, when monsieur is no longer here, I will go away."Then she went down to the kitchen, and Clotilde, in spite of thefanaticism of this woman, which had made her take part in a crime,felt inexpressibly sad at this desertion. When she was gathering up thefragments of the papers, however, before returning to the bedroom, shehad a thrill of joy, on suddenly seeing the genealogical tree, whichthe two women had not perceived, lying unharmed on the table. It was theonly entire document saved from the wreck. She took it and locked it,with the half-consumed fragments, in the bureau in the bedroom.But when she found herself again in this august chamber a great emotiontook possession of her. What supreme calm, what immortal peace, reignedhere, beside the savage destruction that had filled the adjoining roomwith smoke and ashes. A sacred serenity pervaded the obscurity; the twotapers burned with a pure, still, unwavering flame. Then she saw thatPascal's face, framed in his flowing white hair and beard, had becomevery white. He slept with the light falling upon him, surrounded by ahalo, supremely beautiful. She bent down, kissed him again, felt on herlips the cold of the marble face, with its closed eyelids, dreaming itsdream of eternity. Her grief at not being able to save the work which hehad left to her care was so overpowering that she fell on her knees andburst into a passion of sobs. Genius had been violated; it seemed to heras if the world was about to be destroyed in this savage destruction ofa whole life of labor.XIV.In the study Clotilde was buttoning her dress, holding her child, whomshe had been nursing, still in her lap. It was after lunch, aboutthree o'clock on a hot sunny day at the end of August, and through thecrevices of the carefully closed shutters only a few scattered sunbeamsentered, piercing the drowsy and warm obscurity of the vast apartment.The rest and peace of the Sunday seemed to enter and diffuse itselfin the room with the last sounds of the distant vesper bell. Profoundsilence reigned in the empty house in which the mother and child were toremain alone until dinner time, the servant having asked permission togo see a cousin in the faubourg.For an instant Clotilde looked at her child, now a big boy of threemonths. She had been wearing mourning for Pascal for almost tenmonths--a long and simple black gown, in which she looked divinelybeautiful, with her tall, slender figure and her sad, youthful facesurrounded by its aureole of fair hair. And although she could notsmile, it filled her with sweet emotion to see the beautiful child, soplump and rosy, with his mouth still wet with milk, whose gaze hadbeen arrested by the sunbeam full of dancing motes. His eyes were fixedwonderingly on the golden brightness, the dazzling miracle of light.Then sleep came over him, and he let his little, round, bare head,covered thinly with fair hair, fall back on his mother's arm.Clotilde rose softly and laid him in the cradle, which stood beside thetable. She remained leaning over him for an instant to assure herselfthat he was asleep; then she let down the curtain in the alreadydarkened room. Then she busied herself with supple and noiselessmovements, walking with so light a step that she scarcely touched thefloor, in putting away some linen which was on the table. Twice shecrossed the room in search of a little missing sock. She was verysilent, very gentle, and very active. And now, in the solitude of thehouse, she fell into a reverie and all the past year arose before her.First, after the dreadful shock of the funeral, came the departure ofMartine, who had obstinately kept to her determination of going away atonce, not even remaining for the customary week, bringing to replace herthe young cousin of a baker in the neighborhood--a stout brunette, whofortunately proved very neat and faithful. Martine herself lived atSainte-Marthe, in a retired corner, so penuriously that she must bestill saving even out of her small income. She was not known to have anyheir. Who, then, would profit by this miserliness? In ten months she hadnot once set foot in La Souleiade--monsieur was not there, and she hadnot even the desire to see monsieur's son.Then in Clotilde's reverie rose the figure of her grandmother Felicite.The latter came to see her from time to time with the condescension of apowerful relation who is liberal-minded enough to pardon all faults whenthey have been cruelly expiated. She would come unexpectedly, kissthe child, moralize, and give advice, and the young mother had adoptedtoward her the respectful attitude which Pascal had always maintained.Felicite was now wholly absorbed in her triumph. She was at last aboutto realize a plan that she had long cherished and maturely deliberated,which would perpetuate by an imperishable monument the untarnished gloryof the family. The plan was to devote her fortune, which had becomeconsiderable, to the construction and endowment of an asylum for theaged, to be called Rougon Asylum. She had already bought the ground,a part of the old mall outside the town, near the railway station; andprecisely on this Sunday, at five o'clock, when the heat should haveabated a little, the first stone was to be laid, a really solemnceremony, to be honored by the presence of all the authorities, and ofwhich she was to be the acknowledged queen, before a vast concourse ofpeople.Clotilde felt, besides, some gratitude toward her grandmother, whohad shown perfect disinterestedness on the occasion of the openingof Pascal's will. The latter had constituted the young woman hissole legatee; and the mother, who had a right to a fourth part,after declaring her intention to respect her son's wishes, had simplyrenounced her right to the succession. She wished, indeed, to disinheritall her family, bequeathing to them glory only, by employing her largefortune in the erection of this asylum, which was to carry down tofuture ages the revered and glorious name of the Rougons; and afterhaving, for more than half a century, so eagerly striven to acquiremoney, she now disdained it, moved by a higher and purer ambition. AndClotilde, thanks to this liberality, had no uneasiness regarding thefuture--the four thousand francs income would be sufficient for her andher child. She would bring him up to be a man. She had sunk the fivethousand francs that she had found in the desk in an annuity for him;and she owned, besides, La Souleiade, which everybody advised herto sell. True, it cost but little to keep it up, but what a sad andsolitary life she would lead in that great deserted house, much toolarge for her, where she would be lost. Thus far, however, she had notbeen able to make up her mind to leave it. Perhaps she would never beable to do so.Ah, this La Souleiade! all her love, all her life, all her memories werecentered in it. It seemed to her at times as if Pascal were living herestill, for she had changed nothing of their former manner of living.The furniture remained in the same places, the hours were the same, thehabits the same. The only change she had made was to lock his room,into which only she went, as into a sanctuary, to weep when she felt herheart too heavy. And although indeed she felt very lonely, very lost, ateach meal in the bright dining-room downstairs, in fancy she heard therethe echoes of their laughter, she recalled the healthy appetite of heryouth; when they two had eaten and drank so gaily, rejoicing in theirexistence. And the garden, too, the whole place was bound up with themost intimate fibers of her being, for she could not take a step in itthat their united images did not appear before her--on the terrace; inthe slender shadow of the great secular cypresses, where they had sooften contemplated the valley of the Viorne, closed in by the ridges ofthe Seille and the parched hills of Sainte-Marthe; the stone steps amongthe puny olive and almond trees, which they had so often challengedeach other to run up in a trial of speed, like boys just let loose fromschool; and there was the pine grove, too, the warm, embalsamed shade,where the needles crackled under their feet; the vast threshing yard,carpeted with soft grass, where they could see the whole sky at night,when the stars were coming out; and above all there were the giant planetrees, whose delightful shade they had enjoyed every day in summer,listening to the soothing song of the fountain, the crystal clear songwhich it had sung for centuries. Even to the old stones of the house,even to the earth of the grounds, there was not an atom at La Souleiadein which she did not feel a little of their blood warmly throbbing, withwhich she did not feel a little of their life diffused and mingled.But she preferred to spend her days in the workroom, and here it wasthat she lived over again her best hours. There was nothing new in itbut the cradle. The doctor's table was in its place before the window tothe left--she could fancy him coming in and sitting down at it, for hischair had not even been moved. On the long table in the center, amongthe old heap of books and papers, there was nothing new but the cheerfulnote of the little baby linen, which she was looking over. The bookcasesdisplayed the same rows of volumes; the large oaken press seemed toguard within its sides the same treasure, securely shut in. Under thesmoky ceiling the room was still redolent of work, with its confusion ofchairs, the pleasant disorder of this common workroom, filled with thecaprices of the girl and the researches of the scientist. But what mostmoved her to-day was the sight of her old pastels hanging against thewall, the copies which she had made of living flowers, scrupulouslyexact copies, and of dream flowers of an imaginary world, whither herwild fancy sometimes carried her.Clotilde had just finished arranging the little garments on the tablewhen, lifting her eyes, she perceived before her the pastel of oldKing David, with his hand resting on the shoulder of Abishag the youngShunammite. And she, who now never smiled, felt her face flush with athrill of tender and pleasing emotion. How they had loved each other,how they had dreamed of an eternity of love the day on which she hadamused herself painting this proud and loving allegory! The old king,sumptuously clad in a robe hanging in straight folds, heavy withprecious stones, wore the royal bandeau on his snowy locks; but she wasmore sumptuous still, with only her tall slender figure, her delicateround throat, and her supple arms, divinely graceful. Now he was gone,he was sleeping under the ground, while she, her pure and triumphantbeauty concealed by her black robes, had only her child to express thelove she had given him before the assembled people, in the full light ofday.Then Clotilde sat down beside the cradle. The slender sunbeamslengthened, crossing the room from end to end, the heat of the warmafternoon grew oppressive in the drowsy obscurity made by the closedshutters, and the silence of the house seemed more profound thanbefore. She set apart some little waists, she sewed on some tapes withslow-moving needle, and gradually she fell into a reverie in the warmdeep peacefulness of the room, in the midst of the glowing heat outside.Her thoughts first turned to her pastels, the exact copies and thefantastic dream flowers; she said to herself now that all her dualnature was to be found in that passion for truth, which had at timeskept her a whole day before a flower in order to copy it with exactness,and in her need of the spiritual, which at other times took her outsidethe real, and carried her in wild dreams to the paradise of flowers suchas had never grown on earth. She had always been thus. She felt that shewas in reality the same to-day as she had been yesterday, in the midstof the flow of new life which ceaselessly transformed her. And then shethought of Pascal, full of gratitude that he had made her what she was.In days past when, a little girl, he had removed her from her execrablesurroundings and taken her home with him, he had undoubtedly followedthe impulses of his good heart, but he had also undoubtedly desiredto try an experiment with her, to see how she would grow up in thedifferent environment, in an atmosphere of truthfulness and affection.This had always been an idea of his. It was an old theory of hiswhich he would have liked to test on a large scale: culture throughenvironment, complete regeneration even, the improvement, the salvationof the individual, physically as well as morally. She owed to himundoubtedly the best part of her nature; she guessed how fanciful andviolent she might have become, while he had made her only enthusiasticand courageous.In this retrospection she was clearly conscious of the gradual changethat had taken place within her. Pascal had corrected her heredity,and she lived over again the slow evolution, the struggle between thefantastic and the real in her. It had begun with her outbursts of angeras a child, a ferment of rebellion, a want of mental balance that hadcaused her to indulge in most hurtful reveries. Then came her fitsof extreme devotion, the need of illusion and falsehood, of immediatehappiness in the thought that the inequalities and injustices of thiswicked world would he compensated by the eternal joys of a futureparadise. This was the epoch of her struggles with Pascal, of thetorture which she had caused him, planning to destroy the work of hisgenius. And at this point her nature had changed; she had acknowledgedhim for her master. He had conquered her by the terrible lesson of lifewhich he had given her on the night of the storm. Then, environment hadacted upon her, evolution had proceeded rapidly, and she had ended bybecoming a well-balanced and rational woman, willing to live life as itought to be lived, satisfied with doing her work in the hope that thesum of the common labor would one day free the world from evil and pain.She had loved, she was a mother now, and she understood.Suddenly she remembered the night which they had spent in the threshingyard. She could still hear her lamentation under the stars--the crueltyof nature, the inefficacy of science, the wickedness of humanity, andthe need she felt of losing herself in God, in the Unknown. Happinessconsisted in self-renunciation. Then she heard him repeat his creed--theprogress of reason through science, truths acquired slowly and foreverthe only possible good, the belief that the sum of these truths, alwaysaugmenting, would finally confer upon man incalculable power and peace,if not happiness. All was summed up in his ardent faith in life. As heexpressed it, it was necessary to march with life, which marched always.No halt was to be expected, no peace in immobility and renunciation, noconsolation in turning back. One must keep a steadfast soul, the onlyambition to perform one's work, modestly looking for no other rewardof life than to have lived it bravely, accomplishing the task which itimposes. Evil was only an accident not yet explained, humanity appearingfrom a great height like an immense wheel in action, working ceaselesslyfor the future. Why should the workman who disappeared, having finishedhis day's work, abuse the work because he could neither see nor know itsend? Even if it were to have no end why should he not enjoy the delightof action, the exhilarating air of the march, the sweetness of sleepafter the fatigue of a long and busy day? The children would carry onthe task of the parents; they were born and cherished only for this, forthe task of life which is transmitted to them, which they in their turnwill transmit to others. All that remained, then, was to be courageouslyresigned to the grand common labor, without the rebellion of the ego,which demands personal happiness, perfect and complete.She questioned herself, and she found that she did not experience thatanguish which had filled her formerly at the thought of what was tofollow death. This anxiety about the Beyond no longer haunted her untilit became a torture. Formerly she would have liked to wrest by forcefrom heaven the secrets of destiny. It had been a source of infinitegrief to her not to know why she existed. Why are we born? What do wecome on earth to do? What is the meaning of this execrable existence,without equality, without justice, which seemed to her like a fevereddream? Now her terror was calmed; she could think of these thingscourageously. Perhaps it was her child, the continuation of herself,which now concealed from her the horror of her end. But her regular lifecontributed also to this, the thought that it was necessary to live forthe effort of living, and that the only peace possible in this world wasin the joy of the accomplishment of this effort. She repeated to herselfa remark of the doctor, who would often say when he saw a peasantreturning home with a contented look after his day's work: "There is aman whom anxiety about the Beyond will not prevent from sleeping." Hemeant to say that this anxiety troubles and perverts only excitableand idle brains. If all performed their healthful task, all would sleeppeacefully at night. She herself had felt the beneficent power of workin the midst of her sufferings and her grief. Since he had taught her toemploy every one of her hours; since she had been a mother, especially,occupied constantly with her child, she no longer felt a chill ofhorror when she thought of the Unknown. She put aside without an effortdisquieting reveries; and if she still felt an occasional fear, ifsome of her daily griefs made her sick at heart, she found comfort andunfailing strength in the thought that her child was this day a dayolder, that he would be another day older on the morrow, that dayby day, page by page, his work of life was being accomplished. Thisconsoled her delightfully for all her miseries. She had a duty, anobject, and she felt in her happy serenity that she was doing surelywhat she had been sent here to do.Yet, even at this very moment she knew that the mystic was not entirelydead within her. In the midst of the profound silence she heard a slightnoise, and she raised her head. Who was the divine mediator thathad passed? Perhaps the beloved dead for whom she mourned, and whosepresence near her she fancied she could divine. There must always bein her something of the childlike believer she had always been, curiousabout the Unknown, having an instinctive longing for the mysterious.She accounted to herself for this longing, she even explained itscientifically. However far science may extend the limits of humanknowledge, there is undoubtedly a point which it cannot pass; and itwas here precisely that Pascal placed the only interest in life--inthe effort which we ceaselessly make to know more--there was only onereasonable meaning in life, this continual conquest of the unknown.Therefore, she admitted the existence of undiscovered forces surroundingthe world, an immense and obscure domain, ten times larger than thedomain already won, an infinite and unexplored realm through whichfuture humanity would endlessly ascend. Here, indeed, was a field vastenough for the imagination to lose itself in. In her hours of reverieshe satisfied in it the imperious need which man seems to have for thespiritual, a need of escaping from the visible world, of interrogatingthe Unknown, of satisfying in it the dream of absolute justice and offuture happiness. All that remained of her former torture, her lastmystic transports, were there appeased. She satisfied there that hungerfor consoling illusions which suffering humanity must satisfy in orderto live. But in her all was happily balanced. At this crisis, in anepoch overburdened with science, disquieted at the ruins it has made,and seized with fright in the face of the new century, wildly desiringto stop and to return to the past, Clotilde kept the happy mean; in herthe passion for truth was broadened by her eagerness to penetrate theUnknown. If sectarian scientists shut out the horizon to keep strictlyto the phenomenon, it was permitted to her, a good, simple creature, toreserve the part that she did not know, that she would never know. Andif Pascal's creed was the logical deduction from the whole work, theeternal question of the Beyond, which she still continued to put toheaven, reopened the door of the infinite to humanity marching everonward. Since we must always learn, while resigning ourselves neverto know all, was it not to will action, life itself, to reserve theUnknown--an eternal doubt and an eternal hope?Another sound, as of a wing passing, the light touch of a kiss upon herhair, this time made her smile. He was surely here; and her whole beingwent out toward him, in the great flood of tenderness with which herheart overflowed. How kind and cheerful he was, and what a love forothers underlay his passionate love of life! Perhaps he, too, had beenonly a dreamer, for he had dreamed the most beautiful of dreams, thefinal belief in a better world, when science should have bestowedincalculable power upon man--to accept everything, to turn everythingto our happiness, to know everything and to foresee everything, tomake nature our servant, to live in the tranquillity of intelligencesatisfied. Meantime faith in life, voluntary and regular labor, wouldsuffice for health. Evil was only the unexplained side of things;suffering would one day be assuredly utilized. And regarding from abovethe enormous labor of the world, seeing the sum total of humanity, goodand bad--admirable, in spite of everything, for their courage andtheir industry--she now regarded all mankind as united in a commonbrotherhood, she now felt only boundless indulgence, an infinitepity, and an ardent charity. Love, like the sun, bathes the earth, andgoodness is the great river at which all hearts drink.Clotilde had been plying her needle for two hours, with the same regularmovement, while her thoughts wandered away in the profound silence. Butthe tapes were sewed on the little waists, she had even marked some newwrappers, which she had bought the day before. And, her sewing finished,she rose to put the linen away. Outside the sun was declining, andonly slender and oblique sunbeams entered through the crevices of theshutters. She could not see clearly, and she opened one of the shutters,then she forgot herself for a moment, at the sight of the vast horizonsuddenly unrolled before her. The intense heat had abated, a deliciousbreeze was blowing, and the sky was of a cloudless blue. To the leftcould be distinguished even the smallest clumps of pines, among theblood-colored ravines of the rocks of the Seille, while to the right,beyond the hills of Sainte-Marthe, the valley of the Viorne stretchedaway in the golden dust of the setting sun. She looked for a moment atthe tower of St. Saturnin, all golden also, dominating the rose-coloredtown; and she was about to leave the window when she saw a sight thatdrew her back and kept her there, leaning on her elbow for a long timestill.Beyond the railroad a multitude of people were crowded together on theold mall. Clotilde at once remembered the ceremony. She knew that herGrandmother Felicite was going to lay the first stone of the RougonAsylum, the triumphant monument destined to carry down to future agesthe glory of the family. Vast preparations had been going on for a weekpast. There was talk of a silver hod and trowel, which the old lady wasto use herself, determined to figure to triumph, with her eighty-twoyears. What swelled her heart with regal pride was that on this occasionshe made the conquest of Plassans for the third time, for she compelledthe whole town, all the three quarters, to range themselves around her,to form an escort for her, and to applaud her as a benefactress. For, ofcourse, there had to be present lady patronesses, chosen from among thenoblest ladies of the Quartier St. Marc; a delegation from thesocieties of working-women of the old quarter, and, finally, themost distinguished residents of the new town, advocates, notaries,physicians, without counting the common people, a stream of peopledressed in their Sunday clothes, crowding there eagerly, as to afestival. And in the midst of this supreme triumph she was perhapsmost proud--she, one of the queens of the Second Empire, the widow whomourned with so much dignity the fallen government--in havingconquered the young republic itself, obliging it, in the person of thesub-prefect, to come and salute her and thank her. At first there hadbeen question only of a discourse of the mayor; but it was known withcertainty, since the previous day, that the sub-prefect also wouldspeak. From so great a distance Clotilde could distinguish only a movingcrowd of black coats and light dresses, under the scorching sun. Thenthere was a distant sound of music, the music of the amateur band of thetown, the sonorous strains of whose brass instruments were borne to herat intervals on the breeze.She left the window and went and opened the large oaken press to putaway in it the linen that had remained on the table. It was in thispress, formerly so full of the doctor's manuscripts, and now empty,that she kept the baby's wardrobe. It yawned open, vast, seeminglybottomless, and on the large bare shelves there was nothing but the babylinen, the little waists, the little caps, the little socks, all thefine clothing, the down of the bird still in the nest. Where so manythoughts had been stored up, where a man's unremitting labor for thirtyyears had accumulated in an overflowing heap of papers, there was nowonly a baby's clothing, only the first garments which would protect itfor an hour, as it were, and which very soon it could no longer use.The vastness of the antique press seemed brightened and all refreshed bythem.When Clotilde had arranged the wrappers and the waists upon a shelf,she perceived a large envelope containing the fragments of the documentswhich she had placed there after she had rescued them from the fire. Andshe remembered a request which Dr. Ramond had come only the day beforeto make her--that she would see if there remained among this _debris_any fragment of importance having a scientific interest. He wasinconsolable for the loss of the precious manuscripts which the masterhad bequeathed to him. Immediately after the doctor's death he had madean attempt to write from memory his last talk, that summary of vasttheories expounded by the dying man with so heroic a serenity; but hecould recall only parts of it. He would have needed complete notes,observations made from day to day, the results obtained, and the lawsformulated. The loss was irreparable, the task was to be begun overagain, and he lamented having only indications; he said that it would beat least twenty years before science could make up the loss, and take upand utilize the ideas of the solitary pioneer whose labors a wicked andimbecile catastrophe had destroyed.The genealogical tree, the only document that had remained intact, wasattached to the envelope, and Clotilde carried the whole to the tablebeside the cradle. After she had taken out the fragments, one by one,she found, what she had been already almost certain of, that not asingle entire page of manuscript remained, not a single complete notehaving any meaning. There were only fragments of documents, scraps ofhalf-burned and blackened paper, without sequence or connection. But asshe examined them, these incomplete phrases, these words half consumedby fire, assumed for her an interest which no one else could haveunderstood. She remembered the night of the storm, and the phrasescompleted themselves, the beginning of a word evoked before her personsand histories. Thus her eye fell on Maxime's name, and she reviewedthe life of this brother who had remained a stranger to her, and whosedeath, two months before, had left her almost indifferent. Then, ahalf-burned scrap containing her father's name gave her an uneasyfeeling, for she believed that her father had obtained possession of thefortune and the house on the avenue of Bois de Boulogne through the goodoffices of his hairdresser's niece, the innocent Rose, repaid, no doubt,by a generous percentage. Then she met with other names, that ofher uncle Eugene, the former vice emperor, now dead, the cureof Saint-Eutrope, who, she had been told yesterday, was dying ofconsumption. And each fragment became animated in this way; theexecrable family lived again in these scraps, these black ashes, wherewere now only disconnected words.Then Clotilde had the curiosity to unfold the genealogical tree andspread it out upon the table. A strong emotion gained on her; she wasdeeply affected by these relics; and when she read once more the notesadded in pencil by Pascal, a few moments before his death, tears rose toher eyes. With what courage he had written down the date of his death!And what despairing regret for life one divined in the trembling wordsannouncing the birth of the child! The tree ascended, spread outits branches, unfolded its leaves, and she remained for a long timecontemplating it, saying to herself that all the work of the masterwas to be found here in the classified records of this family tree.She could still hear certain of his words commenting on each hereditarycase, she recalled his lessons. But the children, above all, interestedher; she read again and again the notes on the leaves which bore theirnames. The doctor's colleague in Noumea, to whom he had written forinformation about the child born of the marriage of the convict Etienne,had at last made up his mind to answer; but the only information he gavewas in regard to the sex--it was a girl, he said, and she seemed to behealthy. Octave Mouret had come near losing his daughter, who had alwaysbeen very frail, while his little boy continued to enjoy superb health.But the chosen abode of vigorous health and of extraordinary fecunditywas still the house of Jean, at Valqueyras, whose wife had had twochildren in three years and was about to have a third. The nestlingsthrove in the sunshine, in the heart of a fertile country, while thefather sang as he guided his plow, and the mother at home cleverly madethe soup and kept the children in order. There was enough new vitalityand industry there to make another family, a whole race. Clotildefancied at this moment that she could hear Pascal's cry: "Ah, ourfamily! what is it going to be, in what kind of being will it end?" Andshe fell again into a reverie, looking at the tree sending its latestbranches into the future. Who could tell whence the healthy branch wouldspring? Perhaps the great and good man so long awaited was germinatingthere.A slight cry drew Clotilde from her reflections. The muslin curtain ofthe cradle seemed to become animate. It was the child who had wakened upand was moving about and calling to her. She at once took him out of thecradle and held him up gaily, that he might bathe in the golden light ofthe setting sun. But he was insensible to the beauty of the closing day;his little vacant eyes, still full of sleep, turned away from the vastsky, while he opened wide his rosy and ever hungry mouth, like a birdopening its beak. And he cried so loud, he had wakened up so ravenous,that she decided to nurse him again. Besides, it was his hour; it wouldsoon be three hours since she had last nursed him.Clotilde sat down again beside the table. She took him on her lap, buthe was not very good, crying louder and louder, growing more and moreimpatient; and she looked at him with a smile while she unfastened herdress, showing her round, slender throat. Already the child knew, andraising himself he felt with his lips for the breast. When she placedit in his mouth he gave a little grunt of satisfaction; he threw himselfupon her with the fine, voracious appetite of a young gentleman who wasdetermined to live. At first he had clutched the breast with his littlefree hand, as if to show that it was his, to defend it and to guard it.Then, in the joy of the warm stream that filled his throat he raised hislittle arm straight up, like a flag. And Clotilde kept her unconscioussmile, seeing him so healthy, so rosy, and so plump, thriving so wellon the nourishment he drew from her. During the first few weeks she hadsuffered from a fissure, and even now her breast was sensitive; but shesmiled, notwithstanding, with that peaceful look which mothers wear,happy in giving their milk as they would give their blood.When she had unfastened her dress, showing her bare throat and breast,in the solitude and silence of the study, another of her mysteries,one of her sweetest and most hidden secrets, was revealed at the sametime--the slender necklace with the seven pearls, the seven fine, milkystars which the master had put around her neck on a day of misery, inhis mania for giving. Since it had been there no one else had seen it.It seemed as if she guarded it with as much modesty as if it were a partof her flesh, so simple, so pure, so childlike. And all the time thechild was nursing she alone looked at it in a dreamy reverie, moved bythe tender memory of the kisses whose warm perfume it still seemed tokeep.A burst of distant music seemed to surprise Clotilde. She turned herhead and looked across the fields gilded by the oblique rays of the sun.Ah, yes! the ceremony, the laying of the corner stone yonder! Thenshe turned her eyes again on the child, and she gave herself up to thedelight of seeing him with so fine an appetite. She had drawn forward alittle bench, to raise one of her knees, resting her foot upon it,and she leaned one shoulder against the table, beside the tree and theblackened fragments of the envelopes. Her thoughts wandered away in aninfinitely sweet reverie, while she felt the best part of herself, thepure milk, flowing softly, making more and more her own the dear beingshe had borne. The child had come, the redeemer, perhaps. The bellsrang, the three wise men had set out, followed by the people, byrejoicing nature, smiling on the infant in its swaddling clothes. She,the mother, while he drank life in long draughts, was dreaming alreadyof his future. What would he be when she should have made him tall andstrong, giving herself to him entirely? A scientist, perhaps, who wouldreveal to the world something of the eternal truth; or a great captain,who would confer glory on his country; or, still better, one of thoseshepherds of the people who appease the passions and bring about thereign of justice. She saw him, in fancy, beautiful, good and powerful.Hers was the dream of every mother--the conviction that she had broughtthe expected Messiah into the world; and there was in this hope, in thisobstinate belief, which every mother has in the certain triumph of herchild, the hope which itself makes life, the belief which gives humanitythe ever renewed strength to live still.What would the child be? She looked at him, trying to discover whomhe resembled. He had certainly his father's brow and eyes, therewas something noble and strong in the breadth of the head. She saw aresemblance to herself, too, in his fine mouth and his delicate chin.Then, with secret uneasiness, she sought a resemblance to the others,the terrible ancestors, all those whose names were there inscribed onthe tree, unfolding its growth of hereditary leaves. Was it this one, orthis, or yet this other, whom he would resemble? She grew calm, however,she could not but hope, her heart swelled with eternal hope. Thefaith in life which the master had implanted in her kept her brave andsteadfast. What did misery, suffering and wickedness matter! Health wasin universal labor, in the effort made, in the power which fecundatesand which produces. The work was good when the child blessed love. Thenhope bloomed anew, in spite of the open wounds, the dark picture ofhuman shame. It was life perpetuated, tried anew, life which we cannever weary of believing good, since we live it so eagerly, with all itsinjustice and suffering.Clotilde had glanced involuntarily at the ancestral tree spread outbeside her. Yes, the menace was there--so many crimes, so much filth,side by side with so many tears, and so much patient goodness; soextraordinary a mixture of the best and the most vile, a humanity inlittle, with all its defects and all its struggles. It was a questionwhether it would not be better that a thunderbolt should come anddestroy all this corrupt and miserable ant-hill. And after so manyterrible Rougons, so many vile Macquarts, still another had been born.Life did not fear to create another of them, in the brave defiance ofits eternity. It continued its work, propagated itself according to itslaws, indifferent to theories, marching on in its endless labor. Evenat the risk of making monsters, it must of necessity create, since, inspite of all it creates, it never wearies of creating in the hope, nodoubt, that the healthy and the good will one day come. Life, life,which flows like a torrent, which continues its work, beginning it overand over again, without pause, to the unknown end! life in which webathe, life with its infinity of contrary currents, always in motion,and vast as a boundless sea!A transport of maternal fervor thrilled Clotilde's heart, and shesmiled, seeing the little voracious mouth drinking her life. It was aprayer, an invocation, to the unknown child, as to the unknown God! Tothe child of the future, to the genius, perhaps, that was to be, to theMessiah that the coming century awaited, who would deliver the peoplefrom their doubt and their suffering! Since the nation was to beregenerated, had he not come for this work? He would make the experimentanew, he would raise up walls, give certainty to those who were indoubt, he would build the city of justice, where the sole law oflabor would insure happiness. In troublous times prophets were to beexpected--at least let him not be the Antichrist, the destroyer, thebeast foretold in the Apocalypse--who would purge the earth of itswickedness, when this should become too great. And life would go onin spite of everything, only it would be necessary to wait for othermyriads of years before the other unknown child, the benefactor, shouldappear.But the child had drained her right breast, and, as he was growingangry, Clotilde turned him round and gave him the left. Then she beganto smile, feeling the caress of his greedy little lips. At all eventsshe herself was hope. A mother nursing, was she not the image of theworld continued and saved? She bent over, she looked into his limpideyes, which opened joyously, eager for the light. What did the child sayto her that she felt her heart beat more quickly under the breast whichhe was draining? To what cause would he give his blood when he shouldbe a man, strong with all the milk which he would have drunk? Perhaps hesaid nothing to her, perhaps he already deceived her, and yet she was sohappy, so full of perfect confidence in him.Again there was a distant burst of music. This must be the apotheosis,the moment when Grandmother Felicite, with her silver trowel, laid thefirst stone of the monument to the glory of the Rougons. The vast bluesky, gladdened by the Sunday festivities, rejoiced. And in the warmsilence, in the solitary peace of the workroom, Clotilde smiled at thechild, who was still nursing, his little arm held straight up in theair, like a signal flag of life.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Doctor Pascal, by Emile Zola*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DOCTOR PASCAL ******** This file should be named 10720.txt or 10720.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/7/2/10720/Produced by David Widger, Dagny, and John BickersUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Isa. 42:9."Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret untohis servants the prophets." Amos 3:7.PREFACE.The subject of prophecy should be of interest to every Bible student.Its importance can not be overestimated. By it we are enabled toascertain our true position in this time-world. From the early dawn ofcreation, Inspiration has foretold with certainty the great factsconnected with the history of God's chosen people. By this means alone,the divinity of Jesus Christ and the truth of our holy religion has beenestablished in many minds; for it is not in the power of mortals thus tovaticinate future events. With such surprising accuracy have thesepredictions been fulfilled that even infidels ofttimes bear witness totheir truthfulness. "Behold the former things are come to pass, and newthings do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them." Isa.42:9. "For I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is nonelike me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient timesthe things that are not yet done." Isa. 46:9, 10.The Revelation is a rich mine of prophetic truth. The history of thecurrent dispensation is there delineated in advance so perfectly that wecan not but attribute its authorship to Him who knoweth the end from thebeginning, and worketh all things after the counsel of his own will. Itwas written for the special benefit of the people of God, and we shouldgive it prayerful consideration.In the preparation for this work, I have gleaned historical informationfrom all the general and ecclesiastical histories, encyclopedias, etc.,within my reach, and only regret that I had not access to a stillgreater number. However, knowing that large books are seldom read, Idetermined in advance not to write an extensive work, but to condensethe subject matter as much as possible, and, therefore, I have beenobliged to omit much valuable material previously gathered. For thisreason many lines of prophetic truth penned by others of the sacredwriters have been passed over in silence, even though relating to thesame events as certain symbolic visions in the Revelation.I have availed myself of all the helps and the commentaries within myreach in the study of this important subject. However, I have but seldomreferred to the opinions of expositors. In most cases their explanationsare not based upon any established rule of interpretation, and thedefinite laws of symbolic language are usually overlooked ordisregarded. Ordinary readers of the Revelation have always supposedthat the only course for them was to take the opinion of some learnedexpositor and to believe on _his authority_; and when they have foundthat equally learned and judicious men sustained the most oppositeviews, they have been bewildered amid conflicting opinions and havedecided that, when such men were at issue, it was useless for them toinvestigate. While, therefore, I have made every available use of theiropinions, it was only for the purpose of forming my own and of enablingmyself so to unfold the nature of the symbols that every one might seefor himself the propriety of the interpretation given.The present knowledge that has been attained of this prophetic book islargely the result of the combined efforts of all who have labored tounfold its meaning. No one has had the honor of first understanding allits parts, and very few have failed to contribute something, more orless, to its true interpretation. Therefore I have endeavored as much aspossible to gather up the good from the labors of my predecessors and tocombine it with the results of my own study and research. The Expositionof Mr. Lord has had an important bearing on this work. For manybeautiful thoughts concerning the nature and the use of symbols, in thechapter on the nature of symbolic language, I must acknowledge specialindebtedness to the Lectures of Thomas Wickes on the Apocalypse,delivered many years ago, although I have ofttimes arrived at quitedifferent conclusions in their interpretation throughout the Revelation.Much appreciated assistance has been derived from the works of othercommentators as well.There is considerable disagreement among historians themselves regardingcertain historical points, but their differences are of minor importanceso far as the present work is concerned. When such points were involved,I have simply endeavored to follow the best authorities. Lengthy orimportant quotations from other writers have been duly credited wherethey appear, hence no special mention is necessary in this place. Minorextracts are merely enclosed within quotation-marks.The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 6 Vols., Philadelphia, 1872,is the edition of Gibbon's Rome from which quotations are made.To assist in simplifying the subject and in placing it before the readerin a concise, comprehensive manner, a number of useful diagrams havebeen added; for they serve about the same purpose in the study of asubject so complicated as do maps in the study of geography. I wouldespecially call attention to the large "Diagram of the Revelation,"where the various lines of prophetic truth are outlined in parallelseries, enabling the reader to comprehend at once where the symbolicnarrative returns to take up a new line of thought covering the sameperiod of time. In these diagrams, however, no attempt has been made toset forth every phase of thought connected with the subject; only themain features have been outlined.Feeling directed by the Lord to undertake this work and realizing thegreatness of the task, I have earnestly sought for divine wisdom andguidance, and I humbly acknowledge his gracious assistance in itsprosecution; and while I can not indulge the hope that human fallibilityhas been overcome, yet I firmly believe that a careful reliance upon theHoly Spirit has been an effectual means of avoiding error and unfoldingmany of the hitherto mysterious prophecies of this wonderful book. Tohis worthy name I ascribe all praise and glory. The future, doubtless,will witness a still greater development of this subject; for men of Godmore worthy and possessing greater abilities will arise, who, beginningwhere we have left off, will continue its investigation and throw uponit additional light as yet unrevealed.That the Lord will bless The Revelation Explained to the good of hischurch upon earth and grant it a place, however small, in the cause ofpresent truth, is my earnest prayer.Yours in Christ,F.G. Smith._Grand Junction, Mich., June 26, 1906_.PREFACE TO FOURTH EDITIONThe reception accorded this work when it was first submitted to thepublic was more than gratifying to the author. The lapse of time hasonly tended to confirm still more strongly the fundamental nature of theprinciple of interpretation adopted. In order to supply the constantdemand, the fourth edition is now issued.I have taken advantage of this opportunity to make certain revisionsnecessitated by an increase of knowledge since the work was firstwritten, nearly twelve years ago. This revision, however, did notrequire an entire re-writing and does not involve a change infundamentals.F.G.

It will be seen at a glance that it is wholly unlikethe common language of life; and it will be useless for us to undertaketo ascertain its signification unless we understand perfectly theprinciples upon which it is founded.The question may be asked, "Is the language intelligible at all?"Considering the variety of interpretations placed upon it by expositorsand the opinions generally held respecting it, we might conclude that itis not. The majority of the people look upon these prophecies as "a massof unintelligible enigmas," and are ready to tell the student ofRevelation that this book "either finds or leaves a man mad." But are weto look upon its language as being applied at a venture, without anydefinite rule, capable of every variety of meaning, so that we can neverbe quite _sure_ that we have its correct interpretation?Commentators generally unite in attaching a definite meaning to certainsymbols, and they tell us that these can not be applied otherwisewithout violating their nature. They may not give us their reasons forthus applying them (in fact, they generally do not), yet it is evidentlyassumed that such reasons do exist. Now, if reasons actually exist why adefinite signification must be applied to the symbol in the one case,why do they not exist in another case, and in all cases? If any lawexists in the case at all, it is a uniform one, for a law that does notpossess uniformity is no law; otherwise, it would be an unintelligiblerevelation, and the only possible thing left for us to do would be toattempt to solve it like a riddle--guess it out. It would be as if thewriter were to use words with every variety of meaning peculiarly hisown attached, without informing the reader what signification to givethem in a given instance. No man has a right thus to abuse written orspoken language; and we may take it for granted that the God of heavenwould not make such an indiscriminate use of symbolical language whenmaking a revelation to men. There is no other book the wide world aroundin which language is as carefully employed as in the Bible; and we canrest assured that when God gave this Revelation to Jesus Christ "to_show_ unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass," hemade choice of proper symbols whose meaning can be definitely evolved,provided we can but ascertain the great underlying principles upon whichtheir original selection was based.In the ordinary communication of our thoughts we employ arbitrary signsand sounds to which we have universally agreed to fix a definitemeaning. Thus, our entire spoken language is made up of a great varietyof sounds or words with which by long practise we have become familiar.We call a certain object a horse, not because there is any similaritybetween the sound and the animal designated, but because we have agreedthat that sound shall represent that object. So, also, we have agreedthat the characters h-o-r-s-e shall represent the same thing; and by theuse of twenty-six characters, called the alphabet, placed together invarious combinations, we are able to write our entire spoken language.The incidents connected with the introduction of written language amonga barbarous people are worthy of remark in this connection. That thoughtcan be conveyed to persons at a distance by the use of certaincabalistic characters seems to them incredible, and when compelled tobelieve it, they look upon the person that can accomplish such wondersas embodying something supernatural. These things I mention merely tocall attention to the fact that spoken and written language is a curiousand wonderfully complicated affair. This is brought forcibly to ourminds when we hear persons conversing in a foreign tongue, or when wepick up a book the characters of which are wholly unlike those of ourown language. To us an English book is full of instinctive beauty, everyletter or mark possessing a definite meaning that is instantly conveyedto our minds, because we have become familiar with them by diligentstudy and practise.There are other ways of transferring thought besides the complicatedsystem just mentioned--ways which are much more natural and simple.Thus, a simpler way to represent a certain object would be to draw apicture of it; or, better still, to represent a certain character orquality by exhibiting, not the object itself, but an analagous one whosepeculiar character that property is; for examples: the quiet, peaceful,gentle disposition of a child, by a lamb; a man of cunning, artful,deceptive disposition, by a fox; or a cruel, bloodthirsty, vindictivetyrant, by a tiger, etc. This is hieroglyphical or symbolic language.This language takes precedence over every other for naturalness andsimplicity, being common to a greater or less extent among all nationsand intelligible to all.Spoken language was undoubtedly a gift from God originally, whilewritten language is probably a mere human invention. We are not tosuppose that the first attempts to convey thought in writing would be byan alphabetical system, but by the symbolic, it being, as before stated,the most natural and within reach of the ordinary ingenuity of man. Thisis proved by the fact that the inscriptions on the ancient monuments ofEgypt and the inscriptions of other nations of antiquity are of thischaracter. It is also a fact worthy of notice that, four thousand yearslater, men of other countries and of other languages have, by much studyand a careful comparison of the symbols, been able to decipher withaccuracy those hierographical representations.[1] This of itself issufficient to establish the point that definiteness can be attached tothe use and the interpretation of carefully-selected symbols, when theprinciples that governed their original selection are discovered.[Footnote 1: The systems of hieroglyphical writing employed by variousnations have, for the most part, remained unintelligible until a key oftheir interpretation was discovered. In 1799 M. Bouchard, a Frenchcaptain of engineers, while digging intrenchments on the site of an oldtemple near the Rosetta mouth of the Nile, unearthed a black stonecontaining a trilingual inscription in hieroglyphics, demoticcharacters, and Greek. The last paragraph of the Greek inscriptionstated that two translations, one in the sacred and the other in thepopular Egyptian language, would be found adjacent; hence thiscelebrated stone has afforded European scholars a key to the languageand writing of the ancient Egyptians. The cuneiform writing of theBabylonians and Persians remained a mystery also until modern times, butgreat progress has now been made in the deciphering of thousands ofinscribed clay tablets, cylinders, prisms, etc. The key to itsinterpretation is the celebrated inscription at Behistun, cut upon theface of a high rock three hundred feet above its base, and recording aportion of the history of Darius. It is written in the cuneiformcharacters, in three languages--Median, Persian, and Assyrian.]I do not wish to be understood as implying that the symbolical languageof Scripture is identical with the hieroglyphics of ancient monuments.There may be different kinds of symbolic representations; but they arenot arbitrary, as is spoken language, and can not be arbitrarilyapplied; a fixed law governs them all.Now, the book of Revelation is made up of this symbolic language. It isnot, however, confined to this book alone. There are many instances ofit to be found elsewhere in the sacred volume, and in many cases it isexplained by inspiration itself, thus giving us a reliable key to thewhole. Joseph's dream of the eleven sheaves that made obeisance to hissheaf was of this description (Gen. 37:7, 8), and his eleven brethrenwere angered, because its meaning was apparent--that they should behumbled before him. Also, his dream of the sun, the moon, and the elevenstars (verses 9, 10) was understood to signify the subjection of theentire family unto him, which was actually fulfilled after Joseph'sexaltation in Egypt. The chief butler's dream of the vine with threebranches bearing grapes, which he took and pressed into the king's cup,was interpretated by Joseph as signifying the butler's restoration inthree days to his former position of cup-bearer to the king; while thechief baker's dream of the three baskets upon his head, out of which thebirds ate, was interpretated as signifying his execution in the samelength of time. Gen. 40. Pharaoh's dream of the seven fat kine and theseven lean kine, also of the seven full ears and the seven thin ears,signified seven years of plenty and seven years of famine. Gen. 41.Again, the four divisions of King Nebuchadnezzar's wonderful image wasexplained by Daniel as signifying four universal monarchies and the tentoes as signifying the ten minor kingdoms which grew out of the fourth;while the stone that was cut out of the mountain without humanintervention he interpreted as signifying the divine kingdom of God.Dan. 2. The two-horned ram of Daniel's vision (chap. 8), according tothe explanation of the angel, symbolized the Medo-Persian empire, itstwo horns signifying the two dynasties of allied kings that composed it.The he-goat signified the Greco-Macedonian empire; his great horn, itsfirst mighty king; and the four horns that replaced the great one whenbroken represented four kings under whom the empire would eventually bedivided into as many parts. In the Apocalypse itself we have a number ofsymbols divinely interpreted, "The seven stars are the angels of theseven churches." "The seven candle-sticks which thou sawest are theseven churches." "The ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings." "Thewaters which thou sawest ... are peoples, and multitudes, and nations,and tongues." "The woman which thou sawest is that great city whichreigneth over the kings of the earth," etc.It will be seen that the great underlying principle or _law_ upon whichsymbolic language is based is ANALOGY. An object is chosen to representnot itself, but something of analagous character.Webster defines _symbol_ as follows: "The sign or representation of anymoral thing by the images or properties of natural things. Thus, a lionis the _symbol_ of courage; the lamb is the _symbol_ of meekness orpatience." Home, in his Introduction to the Study of the Bible, says:"By symbols we mean certain representative marks, rather than expresspictures; or, if pictures, such as were at the time _characters_, andbesides presenting to the eye the resemblance of a particular object,suggested a general idea to the mind, as when a _horn_ was made todenote _strength_, an _eye_ and _scepter, majesty_, and in numberlesssuch instances; where the picture was not drawn to express merely thething itself, but something else, which was, or was conceived to be,analagous to it." The main idea, then, as expressed in the foregoingdefinitions, is the representation of an object, not by a picture ofitself, but by something analagous, such as the exhibition of moralqualities by images drawn from nature. But the use of symbols is notconfined to the representation of moral subjects alone. Anything may besymbolized to which a corresponding analagous object can be found.To establish the principle of analogy here laid down, it will benecessary to refer only to a few of the numerous examples of divinelyinterpreted symbols in the Scriptures. Any one can readily perceive theanalogy between the seven fat kine of Pharaoh's dream and as many yearsof plenty; so, also, with the seven full, healthy ears that grew up onseven stalks. Likewise, the analogy between the seven thin kine and asmany years of famine, and the seven thin, blasted ears that representedthe same thing, is apparent. One fat kine or one full ear wouldsymbolize one year of plenty, when crops were abundant; while sevenwould represent as many distinct seasons of prosperity, etc. Kine do notrepresent kine, but something analagous. The beasts of Daniel's visionsdo not represent animals like themselves, or a multitude of suchanimals, but something of analagous disposition. The analogy between awild, ferocious beast, stamping upon or devouring everything within itsreach, and a cruel, persecuting, tyrannical government is apparent. Ahorn does not signify a horn, but some great power, such as a dynasty ofkings or rulers; and what the horn is to the animal in manifesting itsdesolating disposition, kings and rulers are to an empire in executingthe persecuting or oppressive principles of the body politic. A pure,chaste virgin is used to symbolize the true church of God; whereas acorrupt harlot is chosen to represent an apostate church, andfornication her idolatrous worship.Although this principle is worthy of further elucidation, yet enough hasbeen said to firmly establish the point that symbolic language isfounded upon analogy. It is also clear that, whenever we attach aliteral signification to a symbolic object, we immediately destroyentirely its use as a symbol. So we may accept it as one establishedlandmark in the interpretation of the Apocalypse, that every symbol,regardless of the department from which it is taken--whether from thematerial universe, the animal kingdom, human life or the heavenlyrealm--stands as the representative, not of itself, but of some otherobject of analagous character not found in the same department fromwhich it is drawn.This develops another important fact worthy of attention. If the greatlaw of symbolic language is based upon analogy, it is clear to ademonstration that the symbols employed _must be_ definitely applied.They can not be arbitrary, as the words composing our spoken languageare. There is nothing in the nature of the thing to prevent our callinga horse an elephant, provided we had only agreed universally to adoptthat designation of the animal referred to (arbitrary sounds can bearbitrarily applied); but we violate nature when we attempt to make aferocious tiger the symbol of an innocent child, or represent ablood-thirsty tyrant by the symbol of a lamb. A disgusting, pollutedharlot may be the proper symbol of an apostate church, but of the pure,holy church of God--_never_. A proper correspondence must be kept up. Wemust follow nature strictly.Symbols are drawn from every department--from animate and inanimatecreation, from animal life and human life, from the visible universebelow and the heavenly world above, and also from some objects of fancyto which there is no corresponding object in existence, such as Daniel'sfour-headed beast, or the one in the Revelator's vision with seven headsand ten horns; but in the selection of the same a proper correspondenceof quality is kept up. The symbols that are chosen to set forth thegreat spiritual affairs of the church are such as are in themselvesnobler than those selected to describe the political affairs of kingsand empires, because in the divine estimation the church is ofinfinitely greater importance and occupies a more honorable positionthan worldly kingdoms. Thus, a beautiful virgin bride is chosen torepresent the church of God; whereas a great red dragon with seven headsand ten horns is chosen to symbolize the Pagan Roman empire. Theglorious body of God's reformers is set forth under the symbol of anangel from heaven, with his face as the sun, his feet as pillars offire, and a rainbow upon his head; whereas the Saracen warriors ofMahomet are locusts upon the earth, with stings of scorpions. Thedepartment of human and angelic life is chosen to set forth thespiritual affairs of the church, while the department of nature and ofanimal life represents the political affairs of nations. To this generalrule, there is at least one exception. Certain things connected withGod's chosen people under the old dispensation are considered propersymbols to represent similar things or events in the New Testamentdispensation, without special regard to the department from which theyare drawn. Thus, the temple, altar, incense, candlesticks, holy city,etc., of the former age, though not taken from the department of humanor angelic life, are, nevertheless, clearly used to represent affairs ofthe church, the analogy in the case being apparent because of theirformer prominence as connected with the Lord's covenant people.Again, when the symbol selected is that of a living, active, intelligentagent, it represents an analagous intelligent agent. Likewise, theactions of the former plainly denote analagous actions in the latter,and the effects produced by the actions of the symbolic agent signifyanalagous effects produced by the actions of the agent symbolized. Tomake it clearer: agents symbolize agents, actions symbolize actions, andeffects symbolize effects. If this be not true--if agents can symbolizeactions and effects as well as agents, or if actions can symbolizeagents and effects--then all is an inextricable maze of confusion, andwell may we repeat the words uttered by a certain minister to thewriter, "The book should have been called Mystification, notRevelation."The same principle of analogy is carried out in another particular.Whenever the enemies of God or destructive agents are intended, objectsof a corresponding desolating character are chosen as their symbols;whereas the peaceful triumphs of the cross, as exhibited by God's chosenpeople, are described under symbols of an equally benign and gentlecharacter. Thus, the anti-christian, persecuting power of Rome isdescribed as a ferocious wild beast, stamping everything beneath itsfeet and spreading desolation on every side. The Vandal hordes ofNorthern barbarians, who, under Genseric overran the Western Romanempire early in the fifth century, are symbolized by a volcanic mountaincast into the sea and spreading its streams of molten lava in everydirection. The fearful pest of Mohammedanism is a dense smoke issuingfrom the bottomless pit and darkening the heavens. The Saracens ofMahomet are swarms of locusts appearing upon the earth, with scorpionstings, tormenting men five months, or, prophetically, one hundred andfifty years. On the other hand, a church is a candle-stick; its pastor,a beautiful star; the whole church, a virgin bride; the gloriousassembly of God's reformers, a rainbow angel, etc.From the foregoing it will be seen that symbols are not words, butthings, chosen because of some analagous resemblance to represent otherthings; and by a careful study of the nature of the symbols themselveswe can ascertain where to look for their fulfilment. In the present workno attempt has been made to prove the interpretations given merely bythe authority of learned names (for they can be arrayed on every side ofa passage), but the nature of the symbols themselves has been developed;and the reader will be able to judge how nearly the known laws ofsymbolic language have been followed.It will be necessary, however, to notice another exception to the rulesgiven, although it can scarcely be said to form an exception--it ratherproves the very position taken. Undoubtedly, there are some few objectswhose nature forbids their symbolization, there being no object inexistence of analagous character that can be chosen as theirrepresentative. God, evidently, can not be symbolized; for where is theindividual in heaven or on earth that can stand as his representative?"To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare untohim?" Isa. 40:18. Man can not represent him, angels can not; forwhenever they appear on the panoramic scene, they denote distinguishedagencies among men. There may be certain symbols connected with hisperson, setting forth his divine attributes and proclaiming the eternalmajesty of his name; but he himself is described as "One sitting upon athrone," before whom the created intelligences of earth and heaven falldown and worship unceasingly, but no symbol of Him is given. The sameexception also applies to the person of Jesus, our Savior and Redeemer.While the human aspect of the Savior, as exhibited during theincarnation in his sacrificial death, may be properly symbolized by alamb, as in chap. V, there is no created intelligence in God's greatuniverse that can be chosen to represent, in his true, essentialdivinity, Him who does not deem it robbery to claim equality with God.There may, likewise, be certain symbols connected with his person togive us at least a faint impression of his divine character and infinitemajesty; yet when he appears upon the symbolic scene, he distinctlyannounces, "I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and wasdead; and, behold, I am alive forevermore." "He hath on his vesture andon his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS." Sowhenever the divine Christ appears on the symbolic scene, he comes inhis own person, proclaiming his own name, and we need look for no symbolof him.Upon the opening of the fifth seal, the souls of the martyrs arerepresented as crying unto God from the altar for the avenging of theirblood on those who dwell on the earth. Where is there an object in allcreation analagous to a disembodied spirit? None can be found. It iseasy to give them an arbitrary name; therefore they appear in theRevelation under their own appropriate title, as "the _souls_ of themthat were slain." Chap. 6:9, 10, also 20:4.This exception applies to every case where no corresponding object canbe selected as a symbol. Where the nature of the subject forbids itssymbolization, there the description must of necessity be literal, andall such objects appear under their own appropriate titles. Otherwise,we are to look upon the entire book of Revelation as a vast collectionof symbols whose interpretation is to be found, not in the departmentfrom which they are taken, but in another, to which they bear a certainanalagous resemblance.Although not pertaining strictly to the subject of symbolic language,yet a word respecting the plan of the prophecy will be appropriate atthis time. The prophetic events are not arranged after the ordinary planof histories, narrating all the contemporaneous events in a givenperiod, whether civil, religious, literary, scientific, or biographical,thus finishing up the history of that period; but it consists of anumber of distinct themes running over the same ground. The proof ofthis assertion will appear as we proceed with the development of theprophecies.May the wisdom of heaven direct us in the perusal of this wonderful bookof Revelation, and may we at last be "accounted worthy to obtain thatworld," and the glorious privilege of rendering eternal praise to "Himthat sitteth upon the throne," "upholding all things by the word of hispower," "declaring the end from the beginning," and revealing his mightyworks unto the children of men.CHAPTER I.    The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show    unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he    sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:    2. Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of    Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.    3. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of    this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein:    for the time is at hand.This book of the Revelation is frequently styled the Apocalypse, derivedfrom the word by which it is designated in Greek. Jesus Christ havingreceived it from God, its author, designed it for the future benefit ofhis church, and communicated it to his servants by the hand of thebeloved apostle John. Its character is described by its title"Revelation," which signifies something revealed or made known; and itsobject was to "show unto his servants things which must shortly come topass." This object of God's in delivering the Revelation to his churchshould be a sufficient refutation of the popular theory that this bookis unintelligible, and its varied symbols wrapped in such deep mysterythat their meaning can not be evolved; for it is not consonant with thesupreme power and wisdom of the God-head to suppose that, in making arevelation to man, he would make the fatal mistake of clothing hislanguage with a mystery that defies the intellect of mortals to unveil.It is said of the things herein revealed that they "must shortly come topass," by which is meant not that they were all to be completelyfulfilled within a short time, but that the series of special eventspredicted were soon to begin. Thus, we speak of a century or eternity asnear at hand, by which we mean that the events of the period spoken ofare about to commence, although the end of the series may be very faroff.But who are "his servants"? For whose benefit was the Revelation given?Surely it was for all those who become children of God by faith inChrist Jesus, from the beginning of the gospel dispensation when it wasgiven, until the end of time; for a benediction is pronounced upon _all_those who read and hear its prophecies and "keep those things which arewritten therein." It was this promised blessing unto the earnestinquirers into the truths of Revelation that enabled the writer todecide to give these prophecies the consideration that is justly theirdue, and to recognize their infinite importance to the present church;"for the time is at hand" that will close the series of events hereinpredicted and usher in eternity. Every fulfilment of prophecy bringswith it new duties, and enjoins fresh responsibilities upon the peopleof God; yea, "every revolving century, every closing year, adds to theurgency with which attention is challenged to the concluding portion ofHoly Writ." Daniel prophetically described some of the events containedalso in the Apocalypse, but he was told to shut up the words and sealthe book _until_ the time of the end, when "many shall run to and fro,and knowledge shall be increased."It has been a matter of conjecture as to who the angel or messenger wasthat Christ sent to deliver the prophecies to John. Some suppose it tohave been Gabriel, because of his having been a chosen instrument todeliver similar prophecies to Daniel. Some think it was Elijah, hehaving been translated that he should not see death, and afterwardsappearing on the mount of transfiguration. Others think it was one ofthe redeemed sons of earth; because afterward, when rejecting theworship John was about to tender him, he says, "See thou do it not: I amthy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony ofJesus: worship God." Chaps. 19:10; 22:9. But we can not identify thismessenger positively, as no definite information is given. To theserevelations received John bore a faithful record of all things that he_saw_, implying the fact that they passed in vision before him and hebeheld them as in a picture.    4. JOHN to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto    you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is    to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;    5. And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the    first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the    earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in    his own blood,    6. And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father;    to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.    7. Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,    and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth    shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.    8. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the    Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the    Almighty.The Apocalypse opens with the salutation of John to the seven churchesin Asia, unto whom it was particularly addressed, and for whom specialmessages were prepared. There were other congregations of the church ofGod in Asia, or Asia Minor, besides the seven to whom the Revelation wassent, such as Colosse, Miletus, Troas, etc. Why only seven wereaddressed, we do not know, unless it be that the number seven is used,as elsewhere in the Sacred Volume, to denote fulness or completeness,being, as has been said, "a kind of memorial of the great facts of thefirst seven days of time which have divided all ages into cycles ofweeks." So when we read of Christ's walking in the midst of the sevenchurches, we are to understand that he is in all the congregations ofhis people; and the ministers of the seven churches who are upheld bythe Lord himself are representative, in one important sense at least, ofthe entire Christian ministry; for Christ has promised to be with themalway "even unto the end of the world." Mat. 28:20.This salutation of John's is one of great beauty and splendor, settingforth, as it does, the divine attributes of the great Jehovah in astriking manner as he "which is, and which was, and which is to come,"an expression embracing eternity and designating the eternal,unchangeable God. The seven spirits before his throne describe the thirdperson in the Trinity, as will appear clearer hereafter, seven beingused as a sacred or perfect number designating his dignity andexcellence. Some have supposed that seven angelic spirits were heredescribed; but it is not consistent with the honor due the God-head tosuppose that created intelligences should be exalted to a plane ofequality with the supreme Deity. Moreover, they would probably have beendescribed as seven _angels_, and not as seven _spirits_.Jesus Christ is mentioned next and more fully described, he being thedirect author of the Revelation. He is "the first begotten of the dead,the prince of the kings of the earth," and the one "that loved us, andwashed us from our sins in his own blood." The statement that Christ isthe "first-begotten of the dead," is parallel to similar expressions inthe Bible, where he is declared to be "the first-fruits of them thatslept," "and the first-born from the dead." Though others had beenrestored to life before the resurrection of Christ, yet he was the firstto rise with an immortal, glorified body. These expressions may alsodenote that Christ was the chief or central figure among all those whoarose. But it was by virtue of his coming and of his victory over deaththat any were enabled to rise before his resurrection, as in the mindand purpose of God, who "calleth those things which be not as thoughthey were" (Rom. 4:17), Christ was ordained to die and rise again, fromthe foundation of the world. He is the "prince of the kings of theearth" by virtue of his being exalted to the right hand of God, with"angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him." 1 Pet.3:22. "Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion,and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in thatwhich is to come." Eph. 1:21."Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,"describes the great atonement work of Jesus Christ, by which we arecleansed from all sin and made a royal, kingly priesthood unto God evenin this world. Every soul that has received the blessed experience Johnhere describes will be able to appreciate the unbounded rapture thebeloved apostle felt in the contemplation of this wonderful theme ofredemption that caused him to ascribe to God, its author, "glory anddominion forever and ever."This Jesus is he who will come again, not in humiliation and suffering,but in glory and honor; not as a Lamb to shed his blood for the sins ofthe world, but as the Lion of the tribe of Juda, with infinite power andmajesty, causing all the kindreds of earth to wail because of him. Theblasphemous Jews, who clamored for his crucifixion; Pilate, whodelivered him up; and the Roman soldiery, who drove the nails andpierced his side, producing a death of greatest ignominy--all will seehim when he comes. But while the proud enemies of God and the crueloppressors of his saints are overwhelmed with terror at the sight of Hisperson, the saints of all ages will shout for joy, saying, "Even so.Amen." "The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether." Inthe face of this awful truth, how dare men assert that the second adventwill usher in a thousand years of peace and tranquility, during whichtime the wicked will lie in their graves, when God's word declares that_every eye_ shall see him when he comes?The present description of Christ closes with the statement that he isthe Alpha and the Omega, which, being the first and last letters of theGreek alphabet, mean the same as "the beginning and the ending"; whilethe whole concludes with the statement that he is the one "which is, andwhich was, and which is to come, the Almighty"--which is the same as thedescription given of God in verse 4. Nothing in addition to this couldbe ascribed to Christ. Every attribute with which the Deity himself isinvested is here ascribed to Jesus Christ. If our Savior is anythingmore than this description declares him to be, it is beyond the reach ofour finite minds to comprehend. The sacred writers everywhere speak ofhim as a being worthy of worship and praise; and this fact, taken inconnection with the universal proneness of men to take the honor fromGod and to give it to those who are no gods, is a convincing proof thatChrist is God and, as such, is worthy of all honor and praise; andnowhere is there given in regard to Christ a warning caution such asJohn received from the angel at whose feet he fell to worship--"See thoudo it not ... worship God."    9. I John, who also am your brother, and companion in    tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ,    was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and    for the testimony of Jesus Christ.    10. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a    great voice, as of a trumpet,    11. Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and,    What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven    churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and    unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto    Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.At the time the Revelation was given, John was a prisoner in the Isle ofPatmos (now called Patmo or Patino), a small, desolate, rocky island inthe Aegean sea, near the coast of Asia Minor, its greatest length fromnorth to south being about ten miles, and its greatest breadth six. Tothis lonely place, according to Jerome and others, John was exiledduring the reign of the tyrant Domitian, in A.D. 95. The reason of hisbanishment is given--"For the word of God, and for the testimony ofJesus Christ." Having confined him to this barren spot, the emperor nodoubt thought he had effectually cleared the world of this preacher ofrighteousness. Doubtless the persecutors of John Bunyan[2] thought thesame when they had him shut up in Bedford jail. But when men think thetruth is dead and buried out of sight, God suddenly gives it aresurrection with thirty-fold greater glory. It was so in this case. Thegiving of the book of Revelation--the writing on this spot of thehistory of the church in advance--has changed the name of this rockyisland from deepest infamy to one of sacred interest and holyrecollections. The death of Domitian occurred in A.D. 96, and hissuccessor, the humane Nerva, recalled those who had been exiled becauseof their faithfulness to Christianity; and John returned to Ephesus,where he spent the remainder of his days, dying a natural death at theadvanced age of about one hundred years.[Footnote 2: John Bunyan (1628-1688) was a Puritan. After therestoration of the Stuarts to the throne, at the close of the EnglishRevolution and the failure of the Commonwealth, he was imprisoned fortwelve years "on account of non-conformity to the established worship."It was during this dreary confinement that he wrote his "Pilgrim'sProgress," the most admirable allegory in English literature.]The humble manner in which John speaks of himself is affectionate. Hedoes not represent himself to the churches as some great apostle orprophet, but as "your brother and companion in tribulation," a sharerwith them in the trials and the persecutions that they were all calledupon to endure. He also testified that he was "in the kingdom andpatience of Christ," of which we will speak more hereafter.It was on the first day of the week, or the Lord's day, that the visionrecorded in this chapter was given John, while he was "in the Spirit,"or under the influence of the spirit of prophecy. He was commanded towrite in a book the things that he saw and to send it unto the sevenchurches of Asia. It is important to bear in mind the fact that thesevisions are things that John _saw_, all the actors and events passingbefore him as a moving panorama--the most stupendous scene that humaneyes have ever beheld, containing the future political history ofvarious nations and kingdoms and also the history of the church in herdifferent phases from the beginning until the final consummation. Of theseven churches we will speak more particularly hereafter.    12. And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being    turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;    13. And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the    Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt    about the paps with a golden girdle.    14. His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as    snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;    15. And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a    furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.    16. And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his    mouth went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as    the sun shineth in his strength.    17. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid    his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first    and the last:    18. I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive    for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.The hieroglyphic, or symbolic, characters now begin. Turning in thedirection from which the voice came, John saw seven beautifulcandle-sticks and standing in their midst, a personage whose appearancewas inexpressibly glorious. John had recognized the voice of Christannouncing "I am the first and the last," but he was not prepared forthe sight that met his gaze when he turned and found himself in theimmediate presence of his August Majesty, the Son of God. A human formwas there, but clothed in such vestments as proclaimed God; and nowonder mortality was overwhelmed when ushered into the presence of theuncreated Deity--he whose feet glowed as brass in a furnace, whose eyeswere as a flame of fire, and whose voice was as the sound of manywaters. Any man would have fallen as dead before such a personage as ishere described. Men may talk atheism, but it is the atheism of the lipsand of a coward heart, an atheism that would flee appalled before theburning footsteps of the Deity, and the irresistible conclusion wouldbe, "It is God himself."John was not left in doubt regarding the identity of this personage;for, laying his hand upon the prostrate form of the apostle, he said,"Fear not; I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and wasdead; and, behold, I am alive forevermore, Amen; and have the keys ofhell and of death." The ever-living One entered death's domains andpermitted himself to be bound with chains; but at his pleasure he brokethem asunder, conquered death, and rose triumphant, carrying with himthe keys of hell and of death; and he has ascended on high, aliveforevermore; and at his voice all the dead will arise at his appearing,for the grave can no longer hold its victims.This vision settles an important fact--that when Christ appears upon thepanoramic scene, he comes in his own person, and not in the character ofa created substitute. There may be symbols connected with hisperson--the sword of his mouth may signify vengeance upon his enemies;his eyes as a flame of fire, superior intelligence and penetratingvision, etc.--but he distinctly announces himself to be the Christ ofGod. There is no creature in the universe that could personate "him thatliveth, and was dead, but is alive forevermore."    19. Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which    are, and the things which shall be hereafter;    20. The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right    hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the    angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which    thou sawest are the seven churches.Here John received a special commission to write the things of thefuture that were to be given, the things that were then taking place,and also certain events which had come under his personal observationduring his life-time, and which were also included in the symbolicvisions, thus covering the entire gospel dispensation.The special symbols employed in this introductory vision are hereexplained by Christ himself, thus leaving us in no doubt whatever. Astar is a fit symbol of the position of a Christian minister--set in thechurch to give the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world;while a candle-stick fitly represents the congregation working with himand sustaining him in his position. The special power ofChrist--symbolized by his right hand--is manifested in upholding hisministers, while he walks in the midst of his churches, ready with thesword of his mouth to defend them from the attacks of their adversariesand to prove their constant Guardian and Protector.CHAPTER II.    Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things    saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who    walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;    2. I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and how    thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried    them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found    them liars:    3. And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake    hast labored, and hast not fainted.    4. Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast    left thy first love.    5. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent,    and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly,    and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou    repent.    6. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the    Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.    7. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto    the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the    tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.The special messages to the seven churches of Asia Minor are not of suchthrilling interest as are the symbolic visions of the remainder of thebook, yet we can learn many beneficial lessons from the variousexperiences of these congregations.At the time the Revelation was given, Ephesus was the chief capital ofProconsular Asia and its pride and glory. It was also that country'schief mart of idolatry, containing, as it did, the magnificent temple ofDiana, which is reckoned as one of the seven wonders of the world. Thistemple, according to the disclosures of modern excavations, was fourhundred and eighteen feet in length, and two hundred and thirty-nine inwidth, with one hundred beautiful external pillars of Parian marble,each a single shaft about fifty-six feet high. The city was proud of thetitle it had received, "Servant of the Goddess," and even the Romanemperors vied with wealthy natives in lavishing gifts to her. One of thelatter, named Vibius Salutaris, presented a large quantity of gold andsilver images to be carried annually in procession.In this proud, wealthy, idolatrous city the apostle Paul planted aChristian church, and the great inroads the gospel made into theprevalent system of idolatry is shown by one circumstance mentioned inthe Book of Acts. "And many that believed came, and confessed, andshowed their deeds. Many of them also which used curious arts broughttheir books together, and burned them before all men: and they countedthe price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. Somightily grew the word of God and prevailed." Acts 19:18-20. Fiftythousand pieces of silver would be equal to ten thousand dollars' worth,or, according to some estimates, six times that amount. But ten thousanddollars' worth of books on incantation and magic alone destroyed,considering the scarcity of books in that day, shows the wondrous extentto which the gospel had been accepted. This was made the occasion of agreat tumult in the city, when one, Demetrius, seeing that the prestigeof Diana was diminishing, stirred up the people of the city against Pauland his companions, and cried vehemently, "Great is Diana of theEphesians!" The souvenir silver shrines and images of this goddess,which had been in such demand by the multitudes of people constantlyvisiting the city, were no longer sought for when the knowledge of theone true God was made known; and well might Demetrius and hisfellow-craftsmen be alarmed as their means of wealth disappeared.The spiritual condition of this church in Paul's time is worthy ofnotice; for it presents a striking contrast with its condition at thetime when the special message of the Revelation was addressed to it.Paul in his epistle to the Ephesians taught them the glorious doctrineof entire sanctification (chap. 5:25-27), and they had received theexperience; for he gives them the express command, "Grieve not the holySpirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption." Chap.4:30. And again, "After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holySpirit of promise." Chap. 1:13. Their ministers, also, had been placedin their position by authority of the Holy Ghost, and were commanded tofeed the flock. See Acts 20:28. When this was their heavenly experience,their "first works" of patience, love, and perseverance, were acceptableunto Christ; but it was not their present condition. A sad declensionhad taken place; therefore the declaration, "I have somewhat againstthee, because thou hast left thy first love." This was no mere humanestimate placed upon their piety, but it was their condition as Christhimself knew it to be. He "who walketh in the midst of the seven goldencandlesticks," and knoweth the hearts of all men, declared they hadfallen, and commanded them to repent and to do the first works. How sadthat a congregation which had one time enjoyed the fulness of God'sfavor should fall from grace and be threatened with destruction by theLord himself! But there is one consolation to be obtained from theexperience of this church, and that is, that even if persons haveenjoyed an experience of pardon and of sanctification and have lost it,there is a possibility of their recovering the favor of God, providedthey "repent, and do the first works."But Christ, who in chapter 1:5 is said to be "the faithful witness,"will not overlook anything that is good, nor censure a congregationunjustly. He finds in this church one fact worthy of commendation--theirabhorrence of the deeds of the Nicolaitans. The infamous practisesattributed to this party are promiscuous sexual intercourse and theeating of things sacrificed to idols. It is said to have derived itsname from Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch, who was one of the sevendeacons appointed by the church at Jerusalem, Acts 6:5. But there is nosatisfactory evidence that Nicolas was its founder; and it is the beliefof many, that the sect attributed their origin to him simply to gain theprestige of his name. However, its mention in this connection issufficient proof that at this time those corrupt principles had beenwidely promulgated.The letter closes with an admonition and a promise--an admonition togive heed to the things uttered by the Spirit, and a promise ofeverlasting life to the overcomer. This shows that Christ does notapprove or condemn indiscriminately. If the great mass of professorscontinue in their backslidden condition, the individual that gives heedto God's Word and is made an overcomer will have a right to "the tree oflife, which is in the midst of the paradise of God."What, may we ask, has been the fate of this church against which Christuttered the threat of removal? There is no proof that they gave heed tothe exhortation to repent, and the candle-stick has long since beentaken away. Not a vestige of a church remains to mark the site of thisonce important congregation; nay, the city itself is no more, the stork,the jackal, and a few miserable Turkish huts alone remaining on the siteof this once proud metropolis where thousands congregated and cried,"Great is Diana of the Ephesians!"    8. And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These    things saith the first and the last which was dead, and is    alive;    9. I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art    rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews,    and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.    10. Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold,    the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be    tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful    unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.    11. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto    the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second    death.Smyrna was situated on a bay of the Aegean Sea, its beautiful harborrendering it from time immemorial one of the most important commercialcities of Asia Minor. History does not inform us when the gospel wasfirst introduced in this city; but at a very early date a largecongregation existed there, with the venerable Polycarp as its pastor.He suffered death by martyrdom under the reign of Marcus Aurelius aboutA.D. 167.In each of the seven letters to the churches Christ introduces himselfby some appellation significant of the character he assumes toward them.In this he styles himself "the first and the last, which was dead, andis alive," a fact very important for that congregation to rememberduring the great seasons of persecution and oppression through whichthey were to be called to pass.Against this church Christ has no words of condemnation to utter; all isencouragement and promise. Their condition of poverty is mentioned. Itis probable that this very poverty arose because of their acceptingChristianity and taking joyfully the spoiling of their goods; for it isa well-known fact that, when individuals embrace Christianity in anidolatrous land, they are disinherited by parents, cast out byrelatives, and denied public employment. Even the community refuses toassociate with them or to render them assistance in any form. Theirmeans of subsistence is thus cut off, and they are harassed in everypossible manner. Perhaps this is the very trial of poverty the church ofSmyrna passed through; but Christ declares that they are rich: yea, Godhath "chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of thekingdom which he hath promised to them that love him." Jas. 2:5. Theirenemies may think that they have reduced them to a condition ofwretchedness, but in this the persecutors are mistaken. God says therighteous are rich. A certain writer has remarked, "There is many a richpoor man, and many a poor rich man."The blasphemy of opposing, self-styled Jews is next mentioned. In allprobability the term _Jew_ is applied in its spiritual sense. Pauldeclares that "he is not a Jew which is one outwardly ... but he is aJew which is one inwardly" (Rom. 2:28, 29), and that "if ye be Christ's,then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." Gal.3:29. These persons professed to belong to the true "Israel of God"(Gal. 6:16), but they were without salvation; and the Smyrnaen churchwould not recognize them as belonging to the congregation, and thereforethe only name that could be applied to them was "the synagogue ofSatan." Had they been tolerated in the assembly of the righteous, Christwould have condemned or rebuked the church for not performing theirduty, the same as he did the churches of Pergamos and Thyatira.Great persecutions for the church of Smyrna are predicted; but he "whichwas dead, and is alive forevermore," having passed through the ordeal ofsuffering and death himself, stands in a position to speak words ofcomfort and consolation, assuring them in the strongest terms that,although wicked men and the devil may cast them into prison andpersecute them unto the death, yet "he that overcometh shall not be hurtof the second death." The overcomers are of the number of those who,having had "part in the first resurrection, on such the second deathhath no power." Chap. 20:6. The ten days doubtless are prophetic time(which will be explained later) and signify ten years, which wasprobably fulfilled in the terrible persecution that began under thereign of Diocletian, and continued ten years, or from A.D. 302 to 312.The subsequent history of Smyrna has been different from that ofEphesus, in that it has retained its name and importance until thepresent day, being the greatest commercial city in the Levant. It has apopulation of more than two hundred thousand, several thousand of whombelong to the Greek and Armenian churches. The light there has becomedimmed, but let us pray that God will soon remember the faith andperseverance of his ancient servants and again trim the lamps that onceshone so brightly.    12. And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These    things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;    13. I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where    Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not    denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my    faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.    14. But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast    there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to    cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat    things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.    15. So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the    Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.    16. Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will    fight against them with the sword of my mouth.    17. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto    the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the    hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone    a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that    receiveth it.Pergamos was a city of considerable importance, the ancient metropolisof the province of Mysia and the residence of the Attalian kings.The description here given of Christ is in accordance with the characterof the church addressed and the work he found necessary to perform init. They are said to be located "where Satan's seat is." Pergamos was acity reputed to be "sacred to the gods" and was one of the headquartersof idolatry. There are numerous such cities now among the Hindoos andother idolatrous nations. These cities are regarded with peculiarveneration and sanctity, and they contain the most honored temples. Inthe midst of such surroundings the influences against Christianity wouldbe very great.The congregation is commended because of its loyalty and steadfastnessduring a period of persecution in which Antipas was slain. When thispersecution occurred, we are not informed; and as to the identity ofAntipas, we are also left in uncertainty. Some suppose him to have beenthe elder of the church.Christ censures them severely, however, for tolerating persons in theirmidst who held the doctrine of Balaam and the pernicious sentiments ofthe Nicolaitans, and he threatens to fight against them with the swordof his mouth unless they repent. The doctrine of Balaam is partlyexplained--he "taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before thechildren of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commitfornication." When Balak desired Balaam to pronounce a curse againstIsrael, God by various means miraculously prevented Balaam's doing so;but Balaam craftily instructed Balak to make use of the women of Moab toseduce the men of Israel to sacrifice to their idols and to indulge inthe licentious accompaniments to such idolatry. In many places inheathen countries to-day vile women are attached to the temples of thegods, and at certain stated feasts licentiousness becomes a sanctionedpart of the religious celebration. Balaam's plan was successful. God wasdispleased with Israel, and because of this fornication there fell inone day twenty-four thousand. For a full account see Num. 22-25;31:13-17.It would appear that the doctrine of Balaam and the doctrine of theNicolaitans were classed as two different heresies; but the corrupttenets of the latter were identical with those of the former, and theprobable meaning is, "As the Hebrews had Balaamites among them; so,likewise, you have among you the Nicolaitans teaching the samepernicious doctrines." It is also a singular fact that the Hebrewsignification of Balaam and the Greek of Nicolas is the same--"subduerof the people." Thus the doctrine of Balaam would stand as arepresentation of the principles taught by the Nicolaitans.The letter to this church also closes with an exhortation and a promise.Hidden manna and a white stone in which is inscribed a new name arerewarded the overcomer. The interpretations of this white stone havebeen various, but the difficulty seems to lie in determining whichancient custom is meant. The most satisfactory to my mind is thatcontained in the following account by Mr. Blunt:"In primitive times, when traveling was rendered difficult from want ofplaces of public entertainment, hospitality was exercised by privateindividuals to a very great extent, of which, indeed, we find frequenttraces in all history, and in none more than in the Old Testament.Persons who partook of this hospitality, and those who practised it,frequently contracted habits of friendship and regard for each other,and it became a well-established custom among the Greeks and Romans toprovide their guests with some particular mark, which was handed downfrom father to son, and insured hospitality and kind treatment wheneverit was presented. This mark was usually a small stone or pebble, cut inhalves, upon each of which the host and the guest mutually inscribedtheir names, and then interchanged with each other. The production ofthese stones was quite sufficient to insure friendship for themselves ordescendants whenever they traveled again in the same direction; while itis evident that these stones required to be privately kept, and thenames written upon them carefully concealed, lest others should obtainthe privileges instead of the persons for whom they were intended." Sothose who have obtained salvation and are overcomers through the bloodhave received the sure pledge of Christ's eternal friendship (whichthose who know not God can not receive) and are invited to partake ofall of his hospitalities, even to "eat of the hidden manna," which isexperienced by the truly sanctified.    18. And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These    things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame    of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;    19. I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and    thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the    first.    20. Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because    thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a    prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit    fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.    21. And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she    repented not.    22. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit    adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of    their deeds.    23. And I will kill her children with death; and all the    churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and    hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your    works.    24. But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many    as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths    of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.    25. But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.    26. And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end,    to him will I give power over the nations:    27. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of    a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of    my Father.    28. And I will give him the morning star.    29. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto    the churches.To this congregation Christ manifests himself in the character of him"who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet like finebrass," denoting the fact that he is the great discerner of all heartsand that he is able to render unto every man according to his deeds.Whether the expression, "his feet like fine brass," has any particularsignification, I am unable to say.This letter opens with a commendation of the works, the charity, theservice, and the faith of this church. In these things they had madeconsiderable advancement. Nevertheless, Christ had something againstthem, because they had suffered "that woman Jezebel" to teach falsedoctrines and to seduce the servants of Christ to compromise withidolatry and to commit fornication. It is improbable that Jezebel washer real name; but she was a Jezebel in character, named in this letterafter King Ahab's wicked wife, who killed the Lord's prophets, seducedher husband into idolatry, and fed the priests of Baal at her own table.Some have supposed that this appellation designated a number or class ofpeople teaching these doctrines; but the manner in which "her children,"or disciples, are spoken of would seem rather to point out a particularwoman--one who was a leader and the chief instrument of mischief.The long-suffering of Christ had been manifested in this case. He hadgiven her an opportunity to repent of her evil deeds, but she would not.Now he declares that he will cause his judgments to descend upon her andher followers. By casting her into a bed is doubtless meant that hewould bring her down upon a bed of sickness and pain and thus make her amost distressing object. Her partners in sin were to suffer "greattribulation," and "her children," or disciples, he would kill withdeath, or deadly pestilence. Thus would this whole corrupt party bevisited with divine judgments according to their works; while theirgreat pretensions to wisdom and discernment, "as they speak," or as theyterm it, will be shown to be nothing but the "depths of Satan."The frequent references to these gross sins in the letters to thechurches may seem a little strange to us in the altered circumstances ofsociety in which we live; but when we consider the tone of publicsentiment and the prevalence of idolatry at that time, it will be seenthat the lapse into these sins was very easy. Some compromised with theheathen by joining in their idolatrous feasts, maintaining that the meatwas not affected one way or the other, and this proved but astepping-stone to the licentious principles and the corrupt practises ofthose with whom they thus associated.The remainder of this letter is full of encouragement to the faithful.The only burden Christ placed upon them was a severe censure becausethey tolerated that abominable party in their midst. They were exhortedto continue faithful and were promised power over the nations. Thesethey should rule with a rod of iron, the same as Christ, who receivedthis power from his Father. The law, or rod, with which Christ, and hispeople with him, as _kings_ and priests, rule the nations is the word ofGod, the most unyielding law, based upon the greatest authority, everwritten. "Let the saints be joyful in glory ... let the high praises ofGod be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand; to executevengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; to bindtheir kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; toexecute upon them the _judgments written_: this honor have _all hissaints_." Psa. 149:5-9.CHAPTER III.    And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things    saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven    stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest,    and art dead.    2. Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are    ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.    3. Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold    fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come    on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will    come upon thee.    4. Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled    their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they    are worthy.    5. He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white    raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of    life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before    his angels.    6. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto    the churches.Sardis was one of the chief cities of western Asia Minor. It wasbeautifully situated on the river Pactolus, in the middle Hermus valley,at the foot of Mount Tmolus, and was once the capital of the kingdom ofLydia, the place of residence of Croesus and other Lydian kings. It wasa city of great opulence and splendor, and "distinguished for thevoluptuous and debauched manners of its inhabitants."To this church Christ introduces himself as "he that hath the sevenSpirits of God, and the seven stars"--that is, he has control of theHoly Spirit's agency and of his ministers. Thus, the great spiritualagencies of the church are in his keeping to bestow or to take away ashe pleases. Considering the dead condition of this church of Sardis, itwas very appropriate for Christ thus to address himself to them. He hasno words of commendation to offer, no works of charity, service, faith,and patience of which to approve. They had works, but these were not"perfect before God." They were threatened with sudden visitation, asunexpected as a thief breaking in unawares upon the slumbering inmatesof a dwelling in the still hours of night. Their condition was differentfrom that of any of the churches before mentioned. They are not chargedwith such vile practises as prevailed at Pergamus and Thyatira, thedoctrine of the Nicolaitans had gained no foothold among them, yet theirworks were not perfect. "Thou hast a name that thou livest, and are_dead_." They had maintained the external form of religion, but thevital power of godliness was lacking.Although Christ could not commend this church as a body, on account oftheir lack of spirituality, yet he testified, "Thou hast a few nameseven in Sardis which have not defiled their garments." In the midst ofall the cold formalism of professors and surrounded by worldliness andiniquity, a few preserved their Christian integrity and were approved bythe Lord. "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this... to keep himself unspotted from the world." Jas. 1:27. All suchovercomers have the promise of being clothed in white raiment ("therighteousness of saints "--chap. 19:8) and of having their namespreserved in the "book of life" in heaven and confessed before theFather and the holy angels. Wondrous admission into the heavenly realm!Presented to the Father and the innumerable hosts of heaven _by theLord, himself_, there, amid sacred environments, to enjoy thetranscendent felicity of eternal blessedness! "They are worthy," saithChrist.Although this church was threatened with sudden visitation, there is nohint given of the manner in which this should be fulfilled, for thereason, perhaps, that it might be all the more unexpected. The churchhas long since passed out of existence. The city itself has lain inruins for centuries, the modern village of Sart composed of a few hutsinhabited by semi-nomadic Yuruks alone remaining near the ancient site.Cattle now graze on grassy plains once traversed by streets and throngedwith the inhabitants of this superb metropolis.    7. And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These    things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the    key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and    shutteth, and no man openeth;    8. I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open    door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength,    and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.    9. Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say    they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them    to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have    loved thee.    10. Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will    keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all    the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.    11. Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that    no man take thy crown.    12. Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my    God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the    name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new    Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and I    will write upon him my new name.    13. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto    the churches.Philadelphia was once a large and powerful city, and it continued thusuntil later times. Prior to the time the Revelation was written, it hadsuffered severely from repeated earthquakes, which caused it to bealmost deserted by its inhabitants. Subsequently, however, it recoveredand became a prosperous, influential city.The character Christ assumes toward this church is that of the Holy andTrue--one who will justly reward them for their patience andperseverance--and by virtue of his possessing the key of David (a symbolof power and authority), he is able to place before them an open doorwhich no man can shut.The character of this church is wholly unlike that of the preceding. Inthat, there was nothing to commend, but much to condemn; whereas tothis, all is admonition, encouragement, and promise, because they had"kept the word of his patience" and had not denied his name. Christ knewtheir works and that they were worthy of approval. They still possessed"a little strength" and had not denied his name.Christ, who always upholds and rewards his faithful followers, althoughthey be few in number and constitute the despised of earth, was notunrighteous that he should overlook this humble congregation of devoteddisciples that had kept his word, but he made them a number of specialpromises _because_ of their faith and perseverance. The first was theassurance that he had set before them an open door which no man couldshut. A door is a means either of entrance or of escape, and signifiesthat God was going to open before them a greater field of enlargementand success, or else would furnish them a sure means of escape andprotection from their cruel and relentless persecutors. It will beremembered that the church of Smyrna also received nothing butcommendation and encouragement; but there was no promise of an open doorto them. On the contrary, they were told that they should be tried, castinto prison, and suffer tribulation ten days. They were comforted,however, with a certain assurance of future reward and a crown ofeverlasting life. But before the church of Philadelphia there was openeda scene of greater prosperity, deliverance from enemies, greaterenlargement, and the glorious prospect of seeing multitudes of soulsbrought under the influence of the saving gospel of Christ.The next promise was that of deliverance from opposing Jews, who were tobe humbled before them. This refers, doubtless, to persons who had amere profession of Christianity and who were not recognized by thecongregation--the same as the blaspheming Jews of Smyrna. Thefaithfulness of God's elect would eventually be the means of bringingthem back to an experience of salvation, so that they would worship inthe midst of the church again.Another promise to this congregation was, "I also will keep thee fromthe hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world." Somedreadful calamity is here predicted, during which the power of God wouldbe mercifully manifested in granting this church a special preservation.Some suppose it to have reference to a great general persecutionthroughout the Roman empire, during which the Christians of Philadelphiawould be spared. This may have been the fact; but whether it was or not,we have no means of information. When we come to consider the symbols ofchapter 9, in which the delusive error of Mohammedanism is set forth, wewill see what a period of sore trial this delusion was to the Easternchurches. It is also a fact that, in the midst of this abounding heresy,the church of Philadelphia was preserved as was no other church of Asia.When the followers of Mohammed were sweeping like a whirlwind over theEastern empire, ravaging everything before them, Philadelphia remainedan independent Christian city, when _all the other_ cities of Asia Minorwere under the power of the Saracen sword. It held out against theOttoman power until the year 1390 A.D., when it surrendered to SultanBayazid's mixed army of Ottoman Turks and Byzantine Christians (?). Thiswas six years after the death of Wickliffe, "the morning star of thereformation," who opposed the corruptions of the Papacy, gave the worldthe first English translation of the Bible, and sowed the seeds thatsoon grew and produced a Huss, a Jerome, and a Luther. So God preservedthe Christians of Philadelphia in the East until he began raising upothers to herald his truth in the West, whose labors soon ripened intothe glorious Reformation of the Sixteenth Century.His final promise to the overcomer is that he shall be made a pillar inthe temple of God, and receive the name of God, of Christ, and of theNew Jerusalem, or city of God. In some manner the Christian is labelledwith the name of God, whose property he is; with the name of Christ, bywhom he was purchased; and with the name of the New Jerusalem, or cityof God, his inheritance and eternal abiding-place; and he is made apillar in the temple of God. By turning to Heb. 12:22, 23, we find thatthe general assembly and church of God in this dispensation constitutes,in one important sense, the New Jerusalem, or city of God, in which theovercomers abide. "But ye _are come_ unto Mount Sion, and unto the cityof the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem ... to the general assemblyand church of the first-born, which are written in heaven." The churchis also styled the house or temple of God, composed of people out of allnations who "are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone; in whom all thebuilding fitly framed together groweth unto _an holy temple_ in the Lord... for an habitation of God through the Spirit." Eph. 2:20-22. See also1 Cor. 3:17; 1 Pet. 2:5; 1 Tim. 3:15.To be a pillar in this temple of God means to occupy a conspicuous oruseful position in supporting the truth, examples of which are to befound in such characters as "James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to bepillars" in the church in apostolic times. Gal. 2:9. In the last prayerof Christ to the Father, he says concerning his disciples, "While I waswith them in the world, I kept them in thy name" (John 17:12); and sincethe church promised by Christ (Mat. 16:18) has been established, wecontinually bear the name of the Father, its title being the church orcity of God. We also bear the new name of Christ, as explained inchapter 2:17, and we meet together and worship in that name (Mat.18:20), obeying the exhortation of the apostle Paul--"Whatsoever ye doin word or deed, do all _in the name of the Lord Jesus_, giving thanksto God and the Father by him." Col. 3:17. A better understanding of themanner in which we receive the name of God and of his city will beobtained when we come to the consideration of the followers of a false,degenerate church represented as receiving the "mark of the beast," bywhich they are designated.To inquire further into the history of this church, Philadelphia stillremains with a population of about fifteen thousand. It contains anumber of places of public worship, a resident (Greek) archbishop, andseveral inferior clergy. Mr. Keith, in his "Evidence of Prophecy,"speaks of the then presiding bishop, and says that he acknowledges "theBible as the only foundation of all religious belief" and admits that"abuses have entered into the church, which former ages might endure,but the present must put down." It is also a singular coincidence thatthe modern Turkish name of the city, Ala-Shehr, signifies "city of God."This description of the church of Philadelphia I will bring to a closeby adding the following extract from Gibbon, recorded in his notedhistory entitled "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire." It is ofespecial value since the writer, being an avowed infidel, can not beconvicted of misconstruing historical facts in order to favorChristianity."The captivity or ruin of the seven churches of Asia was consummated [bythe Ottomans] A.D. 1312, and the barbarous lords of Ionia and Lydiastill trample on the monuments of classic and Christian antiquity. Inthe loss of Ephesus the Christians deplore the fall of the firstcandle-stick of the Revelation. The desolation is complete; and thetemple of Diana and the church of Mary will equally elude the search ofthe curious traveler. The circus and three stately theatres of Laodiceaare now peopled with wolves and foxes. Sardis is reduced to a miserablevillage. The God of Mohammed without a rival is invoked in the mosquesof Thyatira and Pergamus; and the populousness of Smyrna is supported bythe foreign trade of the Franks and Armenians. _Philadelphia alone_ hasbeen saved by prophecy or courage. At a distance from the sea, forgottenby the emperors, encompassed on all sides by the Turks, her valiant sonsdefended their religion and freedom above fourscore years, and at lengthcapitulated with the proudest of the Ottomans. Among the Greek coloniesof Asia, Philadelphia is still erect--a column in a scene of ruins--apleasing example that the path of honor and safety may sometimes be thesame." Vol. VI., p. 229.    14. And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;    These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the    beginning of the creation of God;    15. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I    would thou wert cold or hot.    16. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot,    I will spue thee out of my mouth.    17. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods,    and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art    wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:    18. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that    thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be    clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and    anoint thine eyes with eye salve, that thou mayest see.    19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous    therefore, and repent.    20. Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my    voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup    with him, and he with me.    21. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my    throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father    in his throne.    22. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto    the churches.Laodicea was one of the wealthiest cities of Asia Minor. It was builtupon some low hills, and occupied an important situation in the centerof a very fertile district. It was famous for its money transactions andfor the beautiful soft wool grown by the sheep of the country, whichfacts are both alluded to in the message. Verses 17, 18. During thereign of Tiberius Caesar it was entirely destroyed by an earthquake, butits wealthy inhabitants rebuilt it immediately. A Christian church wassoon planted there; for Paul makes the request that his epistle to theColossians be read in the church of Laodicea and that his epistle to thechurch of Laodicea (which was not included in the New Testament canon)be read unto them. Col. 4:16.The condition of this church, according to the burden of the message,was worse than that of any of the others; for there is not only nocommendation of former faith and piety, but it is not even said of them,as of the church at Sardis, that a few names were left who had notdefiled their garments. Christ, who here represents himself in thecharacter of the "faithful and true Witness," testifies that they are"neither cold nor hot." They did not have enough piety nor zeal to causethem to do anything for the honor of Christ and his cause, neither werethey open enemies. They were merely lukewarm, insincere friends, and, assuch, were in a position to do the greatest harm. A certain writer hassaid, "We always dread a professed but insincere friend; he is the leastdesirable of all relations."They are further described as being satisfied to remain in theirlukewarm condition, indulging themselves in the riches and the pleasuresof this life. Theirs was a rich, prosperous, influential church in theirestimation, and they were proud of it; but "the faithful and trueWitness" declares that they were "wretched, and poor, and blind, andnaked." What a contrast this congregation presents with the churches ofSmyrna and Philadelphia, whose poverty and "little strength" areexpressly mentioned, but who were rich in spirituality, and who receivedno reproof, but words of comfort! They of Laodicea possessed no truegold from the mine of gospel truth, no white raiment of righteousness tohide their spiritual nakedness, no clear vision to enable them todiscern the things of the Spirit. In fact, they lacked everythingnecessary to constitute a church of which the Lord could approve andwhich would be an honor to his cause. But notwithstanding their sadcondition, Christ still pleads with them to repent of their doings andto allow him to come in and sup with them, promising the overcomer theprivilege of sharing the throne of his Redeemer.On account of their lukewarmness a severe threat was uttered--"I willspue thee out of my mouth." Allusion is doubtless made to the formercatastrophe that overthrew the city under Tiberius, thus giving themwarning of the destruction that might come upon them in the future. Theresult has been in accordance with the prediction. God spued that churchout of his mouth centuries ago, and nothing remains of that proud,wealthy city. Not even a Turk has any fixed residence on the spot. Itsruins alone remain in their desolation, "rejected of God, deserted ofman, its glory a ruin, its name a reproach." The Encyclopaedia Britannicasays, "Its ruins are of wide extent.... There is no doubt, however, thatmuch has been buried beneath the surface by the _frequent earthquakes_to which the district is exposed."The prophecies concerning these individual churches have been fulfilled;so that even infidelity itself bears witness to the "strangeverification of Apocalyptic promise and threatening." Two of thechurches, Ephesus and Laodicea, where no spiritual souls remained, werethreatened with utter extinction. They are now in utter ruins--forsaken,desolate. Sardis, too, where only a few names were left, is reduced to asmall Turkish village, without a church or a Christian. Pergamus andThyatira, where much spirituality remained, but where wickedness alsowas tolerated, still survive, though but mere remnants of their formergreatness. While Smyrna and Philadelphia, where Christ found nothing tocondemn and to whose churches he uttered only words of comfort andpromise, remain until the present day and are the brightest spots on thewhole scene, standing like erect columns in the midst of the surroundingruins.I do not wish, however, to give too much prominence to the citiesthemselves in the fulfilment of these prophecies. The churches locatedin these seven cities of Asia were doubtless the main thing underconsideration in the utterance of these promises and threatenings. Yetit is a singular fact that the subsequent history of the citiesthemselves has accorded in a remarkable degree with the nature of theprophecies uttered. It may be that God has preserved Smyrna andPhiladelphia because of the piety of their ancient inhabitants.He who held the seven stars in his right hand and walked in the midst ofthe seven golden candle-sticks, still possesses the control of hisministers and is present in the congregations of the righteous; but letus all take warning from the example of the churches of Asia, and livesuch a life of devotion, charity, faith, and patience as Christ, the"faithful and true Witness," will approve of, that we may "walk with himin white" and have right to the "tree of life which is in the midst ofthe paradise of God."CHAPTER IV.    After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven:    and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet    talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will show    thee things which must be hereafter.    2. And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne    was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.    3. And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine    stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight    like unto an emerald.    4. And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and    upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in    white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.    5. And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings    and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before    the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.    6. And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto    crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the    throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.    7. And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast    like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the    fourth beast was like a flying eagle.    8. And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and    they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night,    saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is,    and is to come.    9. And when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him    that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,    10. The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on    the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and    cast their crowns before the throne, saying,    11. Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and    power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure    they are and were created.It is probable that the Apocalypse was communicated to John in parts, orconsisted of a series of symbolic visions. This is indicated by theexpression "after this I looked," and is also confirmed by the wordsfollowing, "And immediately I was in the spirit," implying that thevision recorded in chapter 1, which was given on the Lord's day, hadbeen interrupted and that a new one now began when the angel withtrumpet voice gave summons for him to ascend to heaven "in the spirit"(or under the influence of the spirit of prophecy) to behold the eventsof the future, passing before him as a vast moving picture.This fact of John's ascension to heaven to behold certain visions of thefuture (which begin properly with chapter 6) will serve to explain manyallusions to things said to occur in heaven, merely signifying that Johnwas in heaven when these things were revealed to him, although theirfulfilment was intimately connected with the affairs of the church onearth, for whose benefit the Revelation was given and unto whom it wassent.When the apostle ascended through the door that had been opened untohim, the first object that met his vision and absorbed his soul was athrone with the Almighty seated upon it, around whom all the inhabitantsof heaven were assembled. No symbol of God is given, for the reason thatthere is no analagous object that can be chosen as his representative.True, John saw a throne, but that is a symbol, not of God himself, butof his supreme power and authority. One was seated upon the throneseparate from the throne itself. It is not said that a jasper or asardine stone was seated thereon, for that would be to make such anobject the representative of God; but he that sat on the throne "was tolook upon" like a jasper or sardine stone. The jasper mentioned was inall probability the diamond, and is described in chapter 21:11 as astone most precious, clear as crystal; while the sardine stone was abrilliant gem of a red hue. This description naturally suggests thevestments of a great monarch in a position of authority upon his throne.The main idea, then, as here expressed, is that the appearance of theAlmighty was so inexpressibly glorious that it could be likened tonothing except the beauty of the most resplendent gems. But God himselfappears in his own person, unrepresented by another, for the reason, asabove stated, that no inferior intelligence of earth or heaven cananalagously represent the uncreated Deity.The throne of the omnipotent One was surrounded by a beautiful rainbowof emerald clearness, and was probably a perfect one, or a completecircle, such as ours would be could it come wholly into our sight. Therainbow on the cloud, to Noah and his descendants, constitutes the surepledge of God's covenant promise not to destroy the earth with anotherdeluge; so, also, the bow surrounding the throne is a symbol of God'scovenant favor with his people eternally.There were "lightnings and thunderings and voices" proceeding from thethrone--the same outward manifestations as heralded the Godhead when hecame down on Sinai to declare his holy law. The "seven lamps of fireburning before the throne" are said to signify the seven spirits of God.These are not lamp-stands or candle-sticks, such as the ones in themidst of which the Son of God walked on earth, but seven lights orflames of fire, representing the operation of the Holy Spirit upon thehearts of men and women. Surrounding the throne also was "a sea of glasslike unto crystal." In the Greek it stands in a little differentform--"And before the throne _as it were_ a sea of glass." Describingthe same object in chapter 15:2, the Revelator says, "I saw _as it were_a sea of glass." It was a broad expanse spread out before the thronewith a glassy or transparent appearance like crystal. Its significationwill be made clear hereafter.In addition to this description of the throne and Deity, our attentionis directed to certain objects before and surrounding the throne. Fourbeasts and four and twenty elders are brought to view. The word _beasts_is a very unfortunate translation, being necessarily associated in ourminds with the brute creation. It is not the word _therion_, which inthirty-five instances in the Apocalypse is translated beast, denoting ananimal of wild disposition, but the word _zoon_, which signifies "aliving creature," and is thus rendered by many of the translators of theNew Testament. Their being full of eyes signifies sleepless vigilanceand superior intelligence and discernment. The chief description givenof the first living creature is that it was "like a lion." It is stated,not that the creature was a lion, but that it was "like a lion." Itpossessed some peculiar quality characteristic of the lion; namely,strength and courage. The second living creature, "like a calf," or,more properly, the ox, is symbolic of sacrifice or of patient labor. Thethird, with "a face as a man," denotes reason and intelligence. Whilethe fourth, "like a flying eagle," is an emblem of swiftness andfar-sighted vision.But the peculiar qualities thus symbolized are possessed by the fourliving creatures themselves, and what do _they_ represent? To whom arethe four and twenty elders referred? They are particularly distinguishedfrom the angelic throng. In the ninth verse of the following chapter theelders and the living creatures represent themselves as the host ofpeople redeemed by the blood of Christ "out of every kindred, andtongue, and people, and nation." The above-mentioned characteristics,then, are the peculiar possession of God's people--power and courage toattack all enemies and to gain the victory; a spirit of perseverance inpatiently laboring for Christ, with a willingness to sacrifice theirlives, if necessary, for the glory of God; ability to receive a"knowledge of the truth," that they may understand the will of God inChrist Jesus concerning them; and power and willingness to obeyinstantly when able to discern spiritual things, rising above the thingsof earth and the trials and persecutions of life--soaring away toloftier heights, there to bask continually in the blessed sunlight ofGod's eternal presence.Why was it necessary that the redeemed company of God's people should berepresented by _four_ living creatures? Doubtless because it wouldprobably have been very difficult to select any _one_ creature combiningall the characteristics desired to represent all God's people of allages. It is also a significant fact that all the people of God on earthwere included in four great dispensations--ante-deluvian, post-deluvian,Mosaic, and Christian; although it is not certain that _four_ livingcreatures were selected for the special purpose of showing the number ofdispensations. However, this division of time is well established in theBible. Peter reckons a new world beginning with Noah (2 Pet. 3:6, 7),stating that the old world had been destroyed. 2 Pet. 2:5. God came downupon Mount Sinai and delivered the old covenant, thus marking a distinctdispensation; while Jesus Christ established the new covenant andushered in the fourth and last dispensation. See Heb. 12:18-24. Underthe first dispensation, Abel by faith offered unto God an "excellentsacrifice"; men "began to call upon the name of the Lord" (Gen. 4:26);Enoch "walked with God" and "was translated that he should not seedeath"; while Noah, "a preacher of righteousness," was "perfect in hisgeneration" and "condemned the world" by his preaching and obedience.The second dispensation was graced with a faithful Abraham, who"staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong infaith," from which circumstance he was called "the friend of God" andhas justly received the title "father of the faithful." In his footstepsfollowed Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Moses. The law age contains the namesof many illustrious prophets of God, and the New Testament era aboundswith brilliant examples of faith and devotion.The ministry of John the Baptist can not be said to form anotherdispensation, because of its short duration (he preceding Christ but sixmonths), and being at the time unknown outside of a very limitedterritory. Another dispensation could not be begun and _completed_ whilethe old covenant dispensation was yet in force; for that would make twodispensations in full force at the same time--a thing impossible. Also,John's work, according to the evangelist, marks the beginning of thegospel dispensation (Mark 1:1-4), from which time the kingdom of God waspreached and men pressed into it. Luke 16:16.It was by virtue of the future atonement-work of Christ that any wereenabled to enjoy God's favor in Old Testament times. Even theirsacrifices, which originated in the family of Adam and which werecontinued from generation to generation, pointed forward to thesacrificial offering of the Savior and by this means purchased covenantfavors with Heaven. So, after all, the atonement was for their benefitas well as for ours. Paul expressly informs us that Christ died for the"redemption of the transgressions that were _under the firsttestament_." Heb. 9:15. "Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and _all theprophets_" are "in the kingdom of God" (Luke 13:28), and constitute apart of this great redeemed host set forth under the symbol of the fourliving creatures.The four and twenty elders, although representing themselves as a partof this redeemed company, evidently have some special signification; forthey are presented to us as separate characters from the four livingcreatures. Who are they? Undoubtedly they represent the ministers ofGod, the number twenty-four also signifying perfection or completeness,being drawn from certain facts connected with the two dispensations inwhich God has had a clerical ministry. The natural heads of the tribesof Israel were the twelve patriarchs; while the spiritual heads of theChristian church are the twelve apostles of the Lamb, they constitutinga part of the foundation upon which it is built. Eph. 2:20. In asubsequent chapter we have an account of the sealing of the twelvetribes, by which is meant the sealing, not of the literal Israel, but ofthe spiritual, the twelve tribes being selected from the properdepartment to stand as a symbol of the true Israel in this dispensation,which is expressly said to consist of people of all nations. NaturalIsrael and spiritual Israel are frequently used to designate God'speople; so, also, in the case before us the twelve patriarchs as headsof the natural Israel and the twelve disciples as heads (in oneimportant sense) of the spiritual Israel are taken to represent theentire ministry. In the description of the New Jerusalem we findconspicuously inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of the childrenof Israel and of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, thus making the numbertwenty-four. Chap. 21:12, 14.Although the ministers seem to be a special class among thoseconstituting the redeemed multitude, yet their intimate connection withthe remainder is set forth under another symbol--that of wings _attachedto_ the four living creatures. Each of the four living ones possessedsix wings, which, taken numerically, make up twenty-four again. Thewings of a living creature would signify its means of flight; and it isby the action of the ministry, who "go into all the world" as flyingmessengers to preach the everlasting gospel, that the church of God isestablished among all nations. Thus, under the symbol of livingcreatures with wings is set forth the glorious harmony and unity thatexists in the body of Christ between ministry and laity.The elders are represented as being clothed in white raiment and aspossessing golden crowns. "White raiment" is a symbol of righteousness(chap. 19:8), while crowns represent special power and authority. God'sministers possess both. They are made righteous through the blood of theeverlasting covenant and are given power over all the power of the enemyand authority to heal the sick and to cast out devils.The entire company are engaged in worshiping God unceasingly, the elderscasting their crowns before the throne, thus ascribing all praise,honor, and glory to Him who has delegated to them the authority theypossess. And may we, my brethren, never grow weary in well-doing andconclude that the worship of God grows monotonous; but let us, withheart and soul, join the universal chorus, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord GodAlmighty."CHAPTER V.    And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book    written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.    2. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who    is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?    3. And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth,    was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.    4. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and    to read the book, neither to look thereon.    5. And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the    Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to    open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.    6. And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the    four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it    had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the    seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.    7. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him    that sat upon the throne.    8. And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and    twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of    them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the    prayers of saints.    9. And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the    book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and    hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and    tongue, and people, and nation;    10. And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we    shall reign on the earth.    11. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round    about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number    of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of    thousands;    12. Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain    to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and    honor, and glory, and blessing.    13. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and    under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in    them, heard it saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and    power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the    Lamb for ever and ever.    14. And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty    elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and    ever.The vision of this chapter is but a continuation of the preceding one,being a sublime description of the exaltation and office-work of Christin his two-fold character as the Lion of the tribe of Juda and as asacrificial offering for the sins of the world. The Apocalypse openswith the words, "The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave untohim," and it is fitting that his special prerogatives andcharacteristics, together with the true position he occupies, shouldfirst be revealed. This was especially necessary in view of the fact tobe revealed, that another would soon arise usurping the rights andprerogatives belonging to Christ alone, claiming to be supreme head ofthe church, sitting as God in the temple of God, and "showing himselfthat _he_ is God." 2 Thes. 2:4.The attention of John was directed to an object "in the right hand ofHim that sat on the throne"--a book sealed with seven seals--and to amighty angel calling with a loud voice for some one to come forward andloose the seals and open the book. No created intelligence of earth orheaven dared to step forward and declare himself able to accomplish theresult required, and because of this John wept much.The form of books in use when the Revelation was given was unlike thoseused now. They consisted of strips of parchment or other material,longer or shorter, rolled up. The book in the symbolic vision before usconsisted of a roll containing seven pieces each one rolled and sealedseparately, so that the outer seal could be broken and the contents ofits strip read without disturbing the remaining ones. Had the seals allbeen on the outside, nothing could have been read until they were allbroken; whereas the loosing of each seal was followed by some discoveryof the contents of the roll.This book in the hand of God is symbolical of something. Most of thecommentators think it represents the book of Revelation, in which case,of course, it would not include the present description of the bookitself, but only of its contents as applied to subsequent chapters. Butthis view, of itself, is unsatisfactory for many reasons. The rulesgoverning the use and the interpretation of symbolic language wouldforbid the thought of one book's symbolizing another book; for the mainidea conveyed by the term _symbol_ is, that the symbolic object standsas the representative, not of itself, but of something analagous.Reasoning by analogy, what would the contents of a sealed book in thehand of God symbolize? Evidently, the infinite counsels and purposesknown only to Jehovah. Its being written within and on the backsidewould indicate that those purposes were full and complete, being allwritten out and understood by him who "knoweth the end from thebeginning" and "worketh all things after the counsel of his own will."Its being sealed denotes that the contents were unrevealed, while itsbeing in the right hand of God--the hand of his power--shows that he isable to carry into execution his divine purposes and that none shall beable to alter them or to wrest them from him.While the events future of John's time form a part of the great plan andcounsels of Jehovah, yet it is taking a very limited view of the subjectto suppose that they alone constitute the sealed book of this vision;for then would that greatest of all events, the atonement of Christ andthe earliest triumphs of the gospel, have no special part in the sealed,mysterious counsels of the infinite One. It is much more consistent withthe characteristics and attributes of God to make this book a symbol,not merely of a part, but of all his divine plans and purposes in theentire gospel dispensation. This position gains credence from the factthat the visions of the Revelation cover many times the whole periodfrom the incarnation to the end. When the very first seal is broken, theearly success and triumphs of the gospel, as experienced in John'slifetime, are portrayed. According to the vision before us, it was byvirtue of Christ's death that he was able to open the book at all; andthe plan of redemption itself, which is based upon his atonement, isdeclared by the Scriptures to be a "mystery which from the beginning ofthe world hath been _hid in God_." Eph. 3:9. This redemption scheme wasthe great center of attraction to the prophets of the old dispensation,who "inquired and searched diligently" that they might comprehend itsdeep mysteries, "which things the _angels desired to look into_." 1 Pet.1:10-12.Now, if the contents of the sealed book were (at the time of thisvision) only the history of events to be, why was it that no man onearth or in heaven, nor even an angel before the throne, was foundworthy to "look into" it or to communicate its secrets to the childrenof men. Gabriel was sent as a worthy messenger to communicate to Daniela long series of future events reaching even until the end of time. Butthe contents of this roll were such that no created intelligence ofearth or heaven was able to unfold them. All remained unfathomablemystery--until Christ stepped forward in his character as a sacrificialLamb and declared himself able to undertake the task of loosing theseals and of opening the book. "Unto you it is given to _know themystery_ of the kingdom of God" (Mark 4:11), he said to his disciples,"even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations,but now is _made manifest_ to his saints." Col. 1:26. "Verily I say untoyou, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see thosethings which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those thingswhich ye hear, and have not heard them. Blessed are your eyes, for theysee; and your ears, for they hear." Mat. 13:17, 16.The fact that the suffering and death of Christ was a past event at thetime when the Revelation was given does not constitute a valid objectionto the position taken, that the contents of the sealed book embrace theplan of redemption during the entire period of its operation; for thereason that, in order to form a complete and continuous narrative, pastevents are frequently referred to in the Apocalypse. Thus, John saw abeast with seven heads signifying seven kings; but he was expresslyinformed that "_five are fallen_, one is [exists at present], and theother is not yet come." Chap. 17:10.When Christ appears on the symbolic stage, he is introduced by the elderas "the Lion of the tribe of Juda," and "the Root of David." The lion,being the king of beasts and the monarch of the forest, is indicative ofpower, such as Christ possesses. Christ is elsewhere denominated "Kingof kings and Lord of lords," and he himself laid claim to "all power inheaven and on earth," it having "pleased the Father that in him shouldall fulness dwell." Why he is termed "the Lion of the tribe of Juda," Iam unable to say, unless the expression is borrowed from the prophecyrecorded of him in Gen. 49:10--"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto himshall the gathering of the people be." His being the "Root of David"shows that he is the source and sustainer of David as to his positionand power. David was specially ordained of the Lord and sustained byhim. Of this there can be no doubt. David was a type; Christ is theantitype. David's position as ruler over natural Israel constitutes atype of Christ's position as ruler over the spiritual Israel; and it isin this sense that Christ reigns upon the throne of his father David.Luke 1:32, 33. And since Christ came in the line of David's descendants,he is called the offspring of David and a rod out of the stem of Jesse.Isa. 11:1, 10. His connection with the throne of David being evident, heis entitled to the right to reign over his people. The appellation_Lamb_ is one of the peculiar titles by which the Son of God isdesignated, having reference to that part of his mission in which heconstituted a sacrificial offering for sin. His forerunner John was ableto prophetically discern him in this character, and pointed to him as"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world." John 1:29.The Lamb was said to have seven horns and seven eyes. A horn is a symbolof power, and seven, being a sacred or perfect number, denotes thefulness of power possessed by Christ; while the seven eyes signify theseven spirits of God, or the Holy Spirit, which, being under the directcontrol of Christ, is sent forth into the world to effect theregeneration of men.When the Lion of the tribe of Juda stepped forward and undertook thetask of revealing the secret counsels and purposes of Jehovah to theworld, immediately a song of praise ascended from the lips of theredeemed sons of earth. The song was new, adapted to a new theme, andsung on a new occasion. "The four beasts and four and twenty elders felldown before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials[censers] full of odors, which are the prayers of saints. And they sunga new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open theseals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thyblood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and hastmade us unto our God kings and priests, and we shall reign on theearth." This song beautifully expresses the honor due to Jesus Christ inhis office-work as Redeemer of the world, by virtue of which people outof every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, are saved unto God andmade kings and priests on the earth. The angel who appeared to theJudean shepherds while they were watching their flocks by night,comforted them with the welcome announcement: "Fear not: for, behold, Ibring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to _all people_. Forunto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christthe Lord." Luke 2:10, 11.Since the preaching of the gospel began, men are instructed to "seekfirst the kingdom of God" (Mat. 6:33), and they "press into it" (Luke16:16) by the saving virtue of Him "who hath delivered us from the powerof darkness, and hath translated us _into the kingdom_ of his dear Son."Col. 1:13. Taking our place by the side of the writer of the Revelation,we testify with him that we are already "in the kingdom and patience ofJesus Christ" (Rev. 1:9), and that we "receive abundance of grace and ofthe gift of righteousness," whereby "we _reign in life_ by one JesusChrist." Rom. 5:17. In this happy condition, redeemed by the blood ofJesus, our Savior, made "a royal [kingly] priesthood" in the "holynation" of "peculiar people" that have been gathered out of all nationsof earth (1 Pet. 2:5, 9), we feel like singing anew this glad song ofredemption in honor of Jesus, our only Lord and Savior, who is God overall, blessed forever! Amen.This new and rapturous song of the redeemed was immediately caught by agreater multitude of the angelic order, an innumerable company, even"ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands," andtogether, with loud and united voices, did they swell the mighty anthem,"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, andwisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing." And again theheavenly strain was raised to loftier heights, until the stupendouschorus rolled around the universe, by every creature in heaven and onearth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, saying,"Blessing and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth uponthe throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever." A few gifted voices ofearth may possess such power and sweetness as almost to entrance us withtheir melody of song; but what an oratorio will it be, my brethren,when, released from the narrow limits of mortality, that sublime strainsung by the redeemed of all ages and ten thousand times ten thousand andthousands of thousands of angels, bursts in upon our ransomed souls! Didhuman thought ever reach the conception of music like this? Did the eyesof a mortal ever behold such rapturous scenes? You may feast your eyesupon earth's greatest beauty--Yosemite Valley, Yellowstone Park, NiagaraFalls, may pass before your vision; you may climb the lofty Alpinesummit and behold the snow-streaked and snow-capped peaks towering tothe heavens around you--or you may listen to the best music evercomposed by a Mozart, a Handel, or a Beethoven, or the finest everexecuted by a Liszt, a Rubenstein, or a Paderewski; yet I must tell youupon the authority of God's word that "eye hath not _seen_, nor ear_heard_, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things whichGod hath prepared for them that love him." 1 Cor. 2:9.This vision shows very clearly the lofty position to which Christ hasbeen exalted, possessing "a name which is above every name"; for theentire company of angels and redeemed saints unite in extolling him withsongs of praise, and that, too, before the very throne of the Deity andin the presence of his infinite Majesty. Surely we can not doubt thatours is a divine Savior, and one worthy of all praise, honor, power anddominion both now and forever.Though John beheld this wonderful vision in heaven, yet we must rememberthat it was given and recorded for the benefit of God's people uponearth. The plan of redemption was not actually revealed in heaven, for"Jesus Christ came _into the world_ to save sinners" (1 Tim. 1:15), andit was here that he was ordained to "taste death for every man." Heb.2:9. The ransomed company thus brought to view is intended to point outthe redeemed of earth; for there is no salvation to be obtained inheaven, in which place no blood was shed--the blood is one of the agentsthat bears witness in the earth. 1 John 5:7, 8. The central figures ofthis vision were God, the Holy Spirit, and Christ, around whom theliving creatures and elders were gathered, and they, in turn, weresurrounded by the angelic throng. This entire scene was doubtlessintended to represent the exalted character of spiritual things onearth, where the plan of redemption was revealed and the redeemed hostgathered out of all nations. In a very important sense the Father, theSon, and the Holy Ghost all dwell in the spiritual church, or newJerusalem, and are thus "in the midst" of God's people, surrounded bythe redeemed host who unceasingly worship them, and they, in turn, havethe promise that "the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them"(Psa. 34:7); yea, "an innumerable company of angels" reside in this"heavenly Jerusalem," or "city of the living God," unto which we, as apart of the "general assembly and church of the first-born," "_arecome_" in this dispensation. Heb. 12:22, 23.CHAPTER VI.    And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as    it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying,    Come and see.    2. And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him    had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth    conquering, and to conquer.We have now reached the point where the thrilling interest of this bookcommences. With the opening of the seals of the book of God's purposeswe have the prophecies of the future, the unfolding of the events to be,described under appropriate symbols. The contents of six seals arecontained in this and the following chapter, while the seventh occupiesthe remainder of the volume.A word relative to the plan of the prophecies will be appropriate atthis time. I will again state what will be made very clearhereafter--that the events are narrated by series, and not by centuries.A particular theme is taken up and carried through to its completion,then the narrative returns and another subject is traced to its end.Thus, the entire book consists of a number of distinct parallel seriescovering the same ground.Upon the opening of the first seal, John is summoned as with a voice ofthunder by one of the living creatures to draw near; and the object thatmeets his vision is a white horse with its rider. The symbol is that ofa victorious warrior, being drawn from the civil and military life ofthe Romans. The symbol is one of dignity. It does not consist of someinanimate object such as a mountain, a sea, or a river, neither is it awild ferocious beast; but it is that of a living, active, intelligentbeing, and he, as denoted by various insignia, a conqueror. He rides awhite horse, such as victors used in triumphal procession; his bow andcrown are also symbols of victory. He goes forth conquering and toconquer, or to make conquests.This symbol is a faithful representation of the early triumphs ofChristianity in its aggressive conflict with the huge systems of errorwith which it had to contend. Some have supposed that the riderrepresented Jesus Christ; but this can not be, for many reasons, two ofwhich I will give. First. Christ always appears on the symbolic stage inhis own character, unrepresented by another, for the reason, as beforestated, that there is no creature that can analagously represent Him whoclaims equality with God. Not one name or attribute peculiar to him ismentioned in the description. Second. There are four horsemen brought toview in this chapter, and the symbols all being drawn from the samedepartment, must have the same general application. If the firsthorseman symbolizes _a definite personage_, so do the remaining three;but we should have great difficulty in identifying the last three,giving them an individual application.Others make the first horseman a symbol of the gospel itself, but thegospel is not a living, active, intelligent agent, such as the symbolevidently is, but is only a system of the revealed truth. All congruityand appropriateness in the comparison is lacking.But let us give this symbol further consideration. It is not enough thatits interpretation alone be given, but the reader is justly entitled toa knowledge of the process by which we arrive at the truth. In the firstplace, we have a symbol of great dignity and excellence, and we mustlook for an object of corresponding character. The symbol is that of aliving agent, and consequently, we must look for its fulfillment in anactive, intelligent agent. The purity, or whiteness, of the horse onwhich the rider was seated would indicate an agency of mild, beneficentcharacter. Finally, the symbol is drawn, as before stated, from thecivil and military life of the Romans. Now, according to the laws ofsymbolic language, a symbol never represents an object like itself, butan analagous one in another department. A wild beast does not representa wild beast, but something of analagous character. Seven fat and sevenlean kine do not represent kine like themselves, but somethinganalagous--seven years of plenty and as many of famine. There are onlytwo great series of events described in the Revelation--the history ofecclesiastical events and the political history of certain nations. Thepresent symbol is drawn from one of these departments--the political orthe civil life of the Romans; and leaving the latter department to findits signification in another department, we have no place to go exceptinto the department of ecclesiastical affairs. Entering, therefore, thespiritual realm, and looking about us for an object that perfectly meetsevery requirement of the symbol, we find it in _the humble ministers ofChrist_, who boldly went forth in obedience to the divine command toextend the peaceful triumphs of the cross and to carry the gospel of thekingdom of God "into all the world." Mark 16:15-18; Mat. 28:19, 20. Thissuccession of faithful, holy, devoted men is worthy of a place inApocalyptic vision. They went forth "conquering and to conquer"; and thevictories they gained were such as the world never witnessed before.Worthy are they to wear a victor's crown, for they have "fought a goodfight."Because of its connection with events following, it is necessary for usto consider the divine position of these first ministers of the church.Their _equality_ is clearly taught in the New Testament. Christ gavethem the express command, "Be not ye called Rabbi: for one is yourMaster, even Christ; and all ye are _brethren_." Mat. 23:8. When two ofthe disciples manifested a desire to gain preeminence over theirbrethren and their aspirations displeased the ten, Christ said to themall, "Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion overthem, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. But it_shall not be so among you_." Mat. 20:25, 26. Thus a perfect standard ofequality in the ministry is lifted up. The beloved apostle, the writerof the Revelation, when addressing the elders of the seven churches ofAsia in particular, humbly and affectionately represented himself astheir "_brother_ and companion in tribulation." Rev. 1:9.I will now adduce the testimony of several creditable historians, whoare compelled to admit the humble equality of the New Testamentministry, notwithstanding the fact that some of them belonged tochurches containing a very _unequal_ ministry.Mosheim says: "The rulers of the church were called their presbyters orbishops, which two titles are, in the New Testament, undoubtedly appliedto the same order of men.... Let no one confound the bishops of thisprimitive and golden period of the church, with those of whom we read inthe following ages. For, though they were both distinguished by the samename, yet they differed extremely, and that in many respects." Vol. I,p. 99.This fact is now admitted by nearly all denominations, evenEpiscopalians. In the work entitled "Episcopacy Tested by Scripture,"published by the Protestant Episcopal Tract Society, New York, theauthor, one of their able advocates, makes the following admissionconcerning the title _bishop_ in the New Testament, "that the name isthere given to the middle order or presbyters; and _all_ that we read inthe New Testament concerning _bishops_, including of course the words_overseer_ and _oversight_, which have the same derivation, is to beregarded as pertaining to that middle grade"--the presbyters or elders.Page 12.The noted historian Waddington, also an Episcopalian, makes the sameadmission in the following words: "It is also true that in the earliestgovernment of the first Christian society, that of Jerusalem, not theelders only, but the 'whole church' were associated with the apostles;and it is even _certain_ that the terms _bishop_ and _elder_ or_presbyter_ were, in the first instances, and for a short period,sometimes used synomously, and indiscriminately applied to the _sameorder_ in the ministry." Church History, Part I, p. 41. The italicizingis mine.The well-known historian Milman, also an Episcopalian, in his History ofChristianity, says, "The earliest Christian communities appear to havebeen ruled and represented, in the absence of the apostle who was theirfirst founder, by their elders, who are likewise called bishops, oroverseers of the church." Page 194.Kurtz, in his Church History, says: "To aid them in their work, or tosupply their places in their absence (Acts 14:23), the apostles ordainedrulers in every church, who bore the common name of _elders_ from theirdignity, and of _bishops_ from the nature of their office. Thatoriginally the elders were the same as the bishops, we gather withabsolute certainty from the statements of the New Testament and ofClement of Rome, a disciple of the apostles. (See his first epistle tothe Corinthians, Chaps. 42, 44:52.) 1. The presbyters are expresslycalled bishops--compare [the Greek especially] Acts 20:17 with verse 28,and Titus 1:5 with verse 7. 2. The office of presbyter is described asnext to and highest after that of apostle (Acts 15:6, 22). Similarly,the elders are represented as those to whom alone the rule, the teachingand the care of the church is entrusted (1 Tim. 5:17; 1 Pet. 5:1,etc.).... In [several] passages of the New Testament and of Clement weread of many bishops in one and the same church. In the face of suchindubitable evidence, it is difficult to account for the pertinacitywith which Romish and Anglican theologians insist that these two officeshad from the first been different in name and functions.... Even Jerome,Augustine, Urban II. (1091) and Petrus Lombardus admit that originallythe two had been identical. It was reserved for the Council of Trent toconvert this truth into a heresy." Pages 67, 68. Chrysostom, Theodoret,and others also admitted the same.Many similar historical testimonies now lying before me to the humbleequality of the New Testament ministry could be added; but lest thereader become weary, I will conclude with the following beautifuldescription from D'Aubigne in his noted History of the Reformation: "Thechurch was in the beginning a community of brethren, guided by a few ofthe _brethren_." Again, "All Christians were priests of the living God,with _humble pastors_ as their guides." Vol. I, pp. 35, 50.With this description of the early ministers of Christ, who went forthunder the symbol of the first horseman to disciple all nations, we havethe events pertaining to the early history of the church, laid beforeus; until the opening of the second seal brings us to another importantphase of its history.    3. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second    beast say, Come and see.    4. And there went out another horse that was red: and power was    given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and    that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him    a great sword.The symbol of this seal is that of a rider going forth on a red horsearmed with a great sword with which to take peace from the earth and tokill. It is drawn from the same source as that of the preceding one, butdiffering greatly in the character of the horseman and the object of hismission. The symbol is one of great dignity--a living, intelligentagent--drawn from civil and military life. For the same reason as givenbefore, we must go out of the department of civil life into the historyof religious affairs to find its fulfilment.Notice, also, the peculiar characteristics of this horseman and whereinhe differs from that of the first seal. The color of the horse is red,denoting something very different from the peace, purity, and benignityof the white. Instead of gaining glorious spiritual conquests andtriumphs, like him of the first seal, he was to take peace from theearth. In the place of a victor's crown, he possesses "a great sword"with which to kill, denoting an agent of great destruction.Where shall we look in the history of religious affairs to find theobject that meets the requirements of this symbol? Who were the active,intelligent agents that appeared as the great opposers of theestablishment of Christianity by the rider of the white horse? We findthe answer undoubtedly in the propagators of the _Pagan religions_. Assoon as Christianity began to gain a foothold in the Roman Empire, thepriests and supporters of Paganism were exasperated to the last degree,and they determined to crush out the Christian religion. An example ofPagan opposition is found in the nineteenth chapter of Acts, where it isrecorded that the preaching of the gospel so stirred the people ofEphesus that they were filled with wrath and for the space of about twohours cried out, saying, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians!" This greatconflict between Christianity and Paganism will be more fully describedunder other symbols in a subsequent chapter, therefore I will make thisdescription brief.The destruction of life brought about by this rider of the red horsedoubtless signifies the great slaughter of the Christians at the handsof the Pagans. During ten seasons of severe persecution, which occurredunder the reigns of the emperors Nero, Domitian, Trajan, MarcusAurelius, Septimus Severus, Maximus, Decius, Gallus, Valerian, andDiocletian, the Christians suffered every indignity that theirrelentless persecutors could heap upon them. They had their eyes burnedout with red-hot irons; they were dragged about with ropes until lifewas extinct; they were beheaded, stoned to death, crucified, thrown towild beasts, burned at the stake; yet "they overcame by the blood of theLamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their livesunto the death." Chap. 12:11.It may appear at first that taking the rider of the horse as a symbolicagent but the killing which he effected as literal, is an inconsistencyand a variation from the laws of symbolic language; but such is notnecessarily the case. One principle laid down in the beginning was, thatthe description of an object or event must necessarily be literal whenno symbolic object could be found to analagously represent it. Thedestruction of human life could not well be represented symbolically,there being no destruction analagous to it whose meaning would beobvious; hence it must appear as a literal description. This is provedby many texts in the Revelation that will admit of no other application;such as verses 9-11 of this chapter; chapter 13:10; 17:6; etc.But the literal destruction of life may be chosen as a symbol torepresent a destruction to which it is plainly analagous; such as thedestruction of spiritual life, the overthrow of the civil orecclesiastical institutions of society, etc. That it is sometimesemployed thus as a symbol will be shown clearly in subsequent chapters.Hence, in every instance where killing men is the work of a symbolicagent, the context, or general series of events with which it isconnected, must determine whether the literal or symbolicalsignification is intended. In the present prophecy under considerationit is much more consistent to give it the literal application; for thedevotees of Paganism did not destroy the spiritual life of the church,which would be an analagous killing; neither did they succeed inoverthrowing the structure of Christianity.    5. And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third    beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and    he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.    6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A    measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a    penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.This symbol is also that of a horseman, differing from the precedingones only in his characteristics. He is seated upon a black horse,denoting something dark or appalling in its nature, the very opposite ofthat of the first seal. He possesses no bow nor crown, but instead hehas a pair of balances in his hand for weighing food. This he deals outonly at exorbitant prices--"a measure of wheat for a penny, and threemeasures of barley for a penny." The penny, or denarius, is equal toabout fifteen cents of our money, and was the ordinary wages of a daylaborer. In the parable of our Lord recorded in Mat. 20, the householderis represented as hiring laborers for a penny a day to labor in hisvineyard. The measure, or _choenix_, of wheat was the usual dailyallowance of food for a man. So according to the rate given, it wouldrequire a day's labor to supply food sufficient for one man, which showsan enormous price placed upon these necessaries of life. In ordinarytimes the penny would procure about twenty measures of wheat instead ofone, and fifty or sixty measures of barley instead of three. Surely thisrepresents famine prices.The expression "see thou hurt not the oil and the wine" seems to havesome direct connection with the exorbitant schedule of food rates. Thefollowing facts of history, as recorded by Lord, will serve to make thematter clear: "The taxes required in the Roman empire, to sustain thecourt and civil service, the army and desolating wars, and the hungrybrood of office-holders, as well as to provide largesses to thesoldiers, were excessive in the extreme, so as to prove an almostinsupportable burden to the people. The ordinary and economical expensesof the government were great; but when we take into view that during aperiod of seventy-two years previous to Diocletian, there weretwenty-six individuals who held the imperial crown, besides a greatnumber of unsuccessful aspirants, and that each of these must secure thefavor of the army and the people by large donations of money, we maywell conceive that the taxes and exactions laid to raise the neededamount must have proved a crushing burden. They were so great assometimes to strip men of their wealth and reduce them to poverty. Thesewere laid upon everything that could be brought into service. Nothingwas too insignificant to escape.... The taxes might be paid in money, orin produce, grain, fruit, oil, or whatever else it might be;... Theexactions were so excessive that the people were led to avoid them inevery possible mode, as men always will under such circumstances." Oncein fifteen years, a Roman indiction, an assessor would go round to levyupon the products of the soil, and the assessment was made according tothe amount of the yield. One method adopted to secure a lower assessmentat this time was that of mutilating their fruit trees and vines. We findamong the Roman laws severe enactments against such as "feign poverty,or cut a vine, or stint the fruit of a tree" in order to avoid a fairvaluation, and the penalty attached was the death of the offender andthe confiscation of all his property. The fact that this law existedshows that the offense was committed and also that the exactions of thegovernment must have been of the most oppressive kind.With these facts before us it is easy to discern the nature of thesymbol, being that of a Roman magistrate prepared to enforce his severeexactions upon the people at the exorbitant rate of three measures ofwheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny, accompaniedby the solemn injunction, "See thou hurt not the oil and the wine," thatis, the olive-trees and the vines.It is evident that we must, as before, go out of the department of civiland military life into the realm of ecclesiastical history to find thetrue fulfilment of this symbol. The black color of the horse woulddenote something directly opposite to that of the first seal; and sincethe symbol of the first seal represented the establishment of the puregospel of Jesus Christ, this symbol must represent the great apostasyand spiritual darkness that covered the world at a later period. And ifthe horseman of the first seal represented the chosen ministry who wentforth in a glorious mission to win trophies of grace, the horseman ofthis seal must represent _an apostate ministry_, possessing power andauthority to enforce the severest exactions upon the bread of life, thusproducing a desolating spiritual famine.This marvelous change from the humble apostolic ministry to an apostateone did not occur suddenly, but by degrees; and as it has a greatbearing upon other lines of truth to be brought out in subsequentchapters, it will be profitable to consider the most important steps bywhich this transformation was effected.When the desire for precedence or superiority first manifested itselfamong the disciples, Christ repressed it (Mat. 20:25, 26), and itappeared no more in their midst; but before the close of the firstcentury it is evident that a thirst for preeminence existed in thehearts of some who had been the servants of the church. An example ofthis is to be found in Diotrephes, who exalted himself above hisministerial associates. The Apostle John says concerning him: "I wroteunto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminenceamong them, receiveth us not. Wherefore if I come, I will remember hisdeeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and notcontent therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, andforbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church." 3 John9, 10.In the historical extracts given in the explanation of the firsthorseman, it is clear that the first ministers were all equal; but atime came about the close of the first century when the most influentialamong the clergy grasped the power and exalted themselves to a positionof authority over the rest. The manner in which this transformation waseffected is explained by the learned Gieseler as follows: "After thedeath of the apostles, and the pupils of the apostles, to whom thegeneral direction of the churches had always been conceded, some oneamongst the presbyters of each church was suffered gradually to take thelead in its affairs. In the same irregular way the title of _bishop_ wasappropriated to the first presbyter." Eccl. Hist., Vol. I, p. 65. In thedays when the apostles were active in the affairs of the church therewere but two classes in the ministry--elders, or bishops, and deacons;but when one of the presbyters was exalted to a higher position than therest and assumed to himself the exclusive use of the word bishop, therewere three classes. To quote the words of Geo. P. Fisher: "After wecross the limit of the first century we find that with each board ofelders there is a person to whom the name of bishop is speciallyapplied, although, for a long time, he is likewise often called apresbyter. In other words, in the room of a two-fold, we have athree-fold ministry." Hist. of the Christian Church, p. 51.The height to which the single bishop of authority in a church had beenexalted is well illustrated in the Ignatian Epistles. Ignatius wasbishop of Antioch and was condemned by the emperor Trajan to sufferdeath by being thrown to the wild beasts in the amphitheatre in Rome.His execution in this manner took place Dec. 20, A.D. 107. He wrote anumber of epistles, a few extracts from which I will give. "Wherefore itis fitting that ye should run together in accordance with the will ofyour bishop, which thing also ye do. For your justly renownedpresbytery, worthy of God, is fitted as exactly to the bishop as thestrings are to the harp." To the Ephesians, Chap. 4. "See that ye allfollow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father.... Let no mando anything connected with the church without the bishop." To theSmyrnaean's, Chap. 8. "It is not lawful without the bishop either tobaptize or to celebrate a love-feast; but whatsoever he shall approveof, that is also pleasing to God." Smyrnaean's, Chap. 8. "It is well toreverence both God and the bishop. He who honors the bishop has beenhonored of God; but he who does anything without the knowledge of thebishop, does [in reality] serve the devil." Smyrnaean's, Chap. 9.The power of these bishops advanced steadily during the second century.The churches of the cities where they were located extended themselvesinto the surrounding country and smaller towns, and the presbyters orelders of these inferior churches were presided over by the bishop oftheir mother church, and in this manner the great system of diocesanepiscopacy was developed.[3][Footnote 3: The ancient signification of the term _diocese_ must not beconfounded with the modern usage of the term. It then designated aterritory or district, usually containing a number of minor churches,presided over by one bishop.]In the latter part of the second century when the disputes concerningEaster and Montanism arose, the custom of diocesan bishops consultingwith each other on important doctrines began, and this developed in thethird century into regular provincial synods, or councils. On account ofthe ecclesiastical or political importance of the cities in which theywere located, certain bishops had a special deference given them, andthey were not slow to take advantage of the opportunity to exaltthemselves to the presidency of these councils; and in a very short timethey possessed immense power and constituted entirely a separate order,designated by the term metropolitan.The manner in which this important step in the great apostasy was takenand the effects produced thereby is well described in the words of thehistorian Mosheim (referring to events of the third century), from whomI quote: "In process of time, all the Christian churches of a provincewere formed into one large ecclesiastical body, which, like confederatestates, assembled at certain times, in order to deliberate about thecommon interests of the whole.... These councils ... _changed the wholeface of the church_, and gave it a new form; for by them the ancientprivileges of the people were considerably diminished, and the power andauthority of the bishops greatly augmented.... At their first appearancein these general councils, they acknowledged that they were no more thanthe delegates of their respective churches, and that they acted in thename, and by the appointment of their people. But they soon changed thishumble tone, imperceptibly extended the limits of their authority,turned their influence into dominion, and their councils into laws; andopenly asserted, at length, that Christ had empowered them to prescribeto his people, _authoritative rules of faith and manners_.... The orderand decency of these assemblies required that some one of the provincialbishops met in council, should be invested with a _superior_ degree ofpower and authority; and hence the rights of _metropolitans_ derivetheir origin."--Church History, Cent. II, Part 2.When a usurping clergy grasps the power to prescribe "authoritativerules of faith and manners," to employ the words of Mosheim, we may wellconceive that the true amount of pure spiritual food was exceedinglysmall and could be procured only at starvation rates. He who reads theecclesiastical events of the third century will find it only too truethat many of the cardinal virtues of apostolic Christianity were almostlost sight of and that a great spiritual famine existed in the earthover which this dark horseman of the third seal careered. Instead ofsalvation through the Spirit of God being carefully taught, baptismalregeneration was exalted, and the people were instructed in the savingvirtues of the eucharist. The Platonic idea concerning sin having itsseat in the flesh was adopted, and therefore perfect victory orsanctification was made to consist in the mortification of the naturalappetites and desires of the body, with the result that a life offasting, celibacy, or self-inflicted torture was looked upon as thesurest means of obtaining the favor of Heaven. The writings of sucheminent church Fathers as Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian and others nowlying before me, contain the surest evidences of the woeful extent towhich this dark cloud of superstition and error had settled down overthe world during the period of which I write.    7. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of    the fourth beast say, Come and see.    8. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat    on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was    given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with    sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of    the earth.The usual interpretation given this horse and its rider is to apply itto the desolating wars and famines that occurred in the Roman Empire.This view is embodied in the celebrated painting "Death on the PaleHorse," in which death is represented as going forth with war,pestilence, famine, and wild beasts, to ravage the Roman empire. We areinformed by historians that dreadful pestilences and famines did prevailand in some places nearly depopulated the country, and that theremaining inhabitants could not make head against the beasts thatmultiplied in the land. But the fact that such events occurred is notsufficient proof that this symbol has reference to such. Famines andpestilences may have occurred many times without forming a part of theApocalyptic vision.The greatest objection to giving this part of the vision such a literalinterpretation is, that it fails to bring out its symbolic character. Towhat, then, does it refer? We have, as before, a horseman, indicatingthat the agent is one of the same general character, differing mainly inhis features and mission. This horse was of a livid, cadaverous hue,denoting an agent of ghastly, terrible nature. The living rider bore theawful name of "Death," or as in the original, "The Death," by way ofemphasis. Death literally was not the agent--it is not so stated--butthe rider was termed The Death, or The Destroyer, because of histerrible mission; and Hell followed with him.Applying the laws of symbolic language as heretofore, it is evident thatthis symbol represents a great persecuting ecclesiastical power. Andwith this thought before us, we can scarcely fail to recognize it as atrue description of _the Papacy_. The great apostasy, described underthe preceding seal, prepared the way for the final and completeestablishment of the "man of sin"; but during the period there broughtto view the ministers of religion, power-seeking and apostate as theywere, were unable to enforce their claims by the power of persecution.Under the present seal, however, is represented a later stage of theircorruption, when a great hierarchal system, sustained and upheld by thearm of civil power, was able to bear tyrannical rule over a greatportion of the earth. During this period clerical ambition andusurpation reached its greatest height.After speaking of the power possessed by the metropolitans, Mosheimsays: "The universal church had now the appearance of one vast republic,formed by a combination of a great number of little states. Thisoccasioned the creation of a new order of ecclesiastics, who wereappointed in different parts of the world, as _heads_ of the church, andwhose office it was to preserve the consistence and union of thatimmense body, whose members were so widely dispersed throughout thenations. Such was the nature and office of the Patriarchs." ChurchHistory, Cent. II, part 2.Thus, the bishops, or metropolitans, of certain of the most importantcities were exalted to a still higher position as special _heads_ of thechurch. They were termed _Exarchs_ at first, after the title of theprovincial governors, but afterwards received the more ecclesiasticalappellation _Patriarchs_. The term Patriarch had been in use for a longtime in the church signifying merely a bishop, irrespective of thedignity he possessed, but it was finally limited to this higher class ofthe clergy, in which sense I now employ it. The cities that firstenjoyed this chief distinction were Alexandria, Rome, and Antioch. Thegeneral council of Nice (A.D. 325) in its sixth canon recognized thesuperior authority already possessed by these cities. See D'Aubigne'sHist, of Reformation, Vol. I, p. 41. The general council ofConstantinople in its third canon placed the bishop of Constantinople inthe same rank with the other three Patriarchs; and the general councilof Calcedon exalted the See of Jerusalem to a similar dignity, doubtlessbecause of its ancient importance as the birthplace of Christianity.Thus, Patriarchs were established in the five political capitals of theRoman empire; and they were considered the "_heads of the church_,"having spiritual authority over the whole empire. These were the onlyPatriarchates of importance. Certain ecclesiastics of the Church of Romeeven at the present time bear the honorary title Patriarch; but, toquote the words of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, "In a strictly technicalsense, however, that church recognizes only five Patriarchates, those ofConstantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Rome." Art.Patriarch. In the years 637 to 640 Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antiochfell into the hands of the Saracen followers of Mohammed, whichterminated their importance, and later the Greek schism separated thePatriarch of Constantinople from Rome; and thus the Patriarch of Romewas left in undisputed possession of the field and was soon recognizedas universal head of the church. So under the symbol of this dread rideron a pale horse is portrayed the great hierarchal system by which thePapacy was fully developed in the West.It is fitting that we notice particularly the agents of destructionemployed by this rider. He possesses a sword with which to kill--thesame instrument wielded by the rider of the red horse--but it is evidentthat he uses it with more terrific energy, by reason of which hereceives the name Death, or The Destroyer. It is possible, also, that inthis case a sword, wielded by the hand of an ecclesiastical power, maybe used as a symbol of a spiritual cutting off, or excommunication. Thesword of excommunication has been the most terrible ever wielded byhuman hand. When this pale horseman was careering over the world in thezenith of his power, excommunication and interdiction were the terror ofindividuals and the scourge of nations. At his word the rights of anindividual as king, ruler, husband or father, nay, even as a _man_, wereforfeited, and he was shunned like one infected with the leprosy. At hiscommand the offices of religion were suspended in a nation, and its deadlay unburied, until its proud ruler humbled himself at the feet of theecclesiastical tyrant who bore rule over the "fourth part of theearth."[4][Footnote 4: This tyranny of the Popes is well illustrated by thequarrel that took place between Hildebrand (Pope Gregory VII.) and HenryIV. of Germany. Gregory attempted to make certain reforms, but Henryrefused to recognize those innovations. Gregory excommunicated theemperor, with the result that he was "shunned as a man accursed byHeaven." His authority lost and his kingdom on the point of going topieces, Henry had but one thing to do--seek the pardon of the Pope. Hefound the Pontiff at Canoosa, but Gregory refused to admit the penitentto his presence. "It was winter, and for three successive days the king,clothed in sackcloth, stood with bare feet in the snow of the court-yardof the palace, waiting for permission to kneel at the feet of thePontiff and to receive forgiveness." On the fourth day he was grantedadmittance to the presence of the Pope.During the Pontificate of Innocent III. Philip Augustus, king of France,put away his wife. Innocent commanded him to take her back and forcedsubmission by means of an interdict. This submission of a brave, firm,and victorious prince shows the tremendous power wielded by the Popes inthat period.The manner, also, in which Innocent III. humbled King John of Englandaffords another illustration of the power of the Popes. John caused thevacant See of Canterbury to be filled, in accordance with the regularmanner of election, by one of his favorites. Innocent declared theappointment void, as he desired that the place should be filled by oneof his friends. John refused to allow the Pope's archbishop to enterEngland as Primate. Innocent then excommunicated John, laid all Englandunder an interdict, and incited Philip, king of France, to war, offeringhim John's kingdom upon the very liberal condition that he go over andtake it. The outcome of the matter was that John was compelled to yieldto the power of the Pope. He even gave him England as a perpetual fief,and agreed to pay the Papal See the annual sum of one thousand marks.]The loss of life by spiritual famine was extreme. The Word of God, whichis spirit and life to God's people (Jno. 6:63), was laid under interdictand the common people deprived of its benefits. At the time the blackhorse appeared, a little food could be obtained at famine prices; butwhen the fourth arrived, he was empowered to kill "with hunger." Also,one of his agents of destruction was death, or pestilence, a fit symbolof false and blasphemous doctrines breathed forth like a deadlypestilence blasting everything within its reach. Invocation of saints,worship of images, relics, celibacy, works of supererogation,indulgences, and purgatory--these were the enforced principles ofreligion, and like a pest they settled down upon the people everywhere.This rider also brought into operation "the beasts of the earth" to aidhim in his destructive work. To kill with sword or hunger shows thatsuch work of destruction is performed solely by him who has it in hispower; but to kill with beasts indicates that _they_ perform the deadlywork according _to their own natures_. Nothing is clearer than the factthat wild beasts stand as a symbol of persecuting tyrannicalgovernments; hence we are to understand that this rider was to employalso the arm of civil power to aid him in the deadly work. Howstrikingly this represents the historical facts of the case! In alltruly Roman Catholic countries the civil governments were only a cipheror tool in the hands of the church, and the ecclesiastics were the realrulers of the kingdom. But whenever any dark work of persecution was tobe performed, the wild beast was let loose to accomplish the result.When charged, however, with the bloody work, the Catholics alwaysanswer, "Oh, we _never persecute_--don't you see, it is the wild beaststhat are covered with gore--our hands are clean," yet they themselvesheld the chain that bound the savage monsters. We shall have occasion ina subsequent chapter to trace further the pathway of this dread rider ashe reels onward in the career of ages, "drunken with the blood of thesaints."This work of destruction performed by the dread rider on the pale horseis considered by many as a literal description of the persecutions ofthe Papacy. While Catholics usually charge the civil powers with thisbloody work, it is an undeniable fact of history that the Popes oftenordered or sanctioned crusades against the Waldenses, Albigenses, andother peoples (see remarks on verses 9-11, chap. 17:6), in which thesword, starvation, and every other means of cruelty imaginable werebrought into use to exterminate the so-called heresy. And in view of thefact explained in the comments on verses 3 and 4 of this chapter, that_killing_ is sometimes to be understood in a literal sense on account ofthere being nothing to analagously represent such destruction of life,it is not a violation of the laws of symbolic language thus to interpretit. It might be consistent in this case to give it a twofoldapplication; the agreeing facts of history regarding the Papacy stronglysuggest it. Thus, the _sword_ could signify a literal destruction oflife, as in verse 4, and also, in the present case, an ecclesiasticalcutting off by the Papacy, or excommunication; and _hunger_ couldsignify literal death by starvation, and also, as in verses 5 and 6, adestruction of spiritual life, etc.Where, let me ask, in the whole compass of human writings can be found aseries of events of such thrilling interest, so great in magnitude, asis contained in these eight verses? Who but the Omnipotent could haveconceived such a wonderful development of the power of iniquity and withsuch master-strokes of power compressed them into so small a scene ofsymbolic imagery? The impress of divinity is here speaking from everyline.    9. And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar    the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for    the testimony which they held:    10. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord,    holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them    that dwell on the earth?    11. And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it    was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little    season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that    should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.Upon the opening of this seal the scene changes entirely. No morehorsemen appear, but instead the souls of the martyrs are seen at thealtar crying for vindication of their blood upon the cruel oppressors ofearth. The question arises, Are these souls symbols of something else,or are they what they are here stated to be, "the souls of them thatwere slain"? Evidently, the latter, appearing under their own name andcharacter, because they can not properly be symbolized. They weredisembodied spirits, and where is there anything of analagous characterto represent such? Angels can not; for whenever they are employed assymbols, it is to designate distinguished agencies among men. Theytherefore appear under their own appropriate title as "the _souls_ ofthem that were slain."These souls appeared "under the altar," that is, _at the foot of thealtar_, being the same as that described in chap. 8:3--"And anotherangel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and there wasgiven unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers ofall saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne." Thus, theheavenly world, as opened up before John, appeared symbolized after thesanctuary of the temple in which stood the golden altar, or altar ofincense. Some have supposed that the brazen altar was the one referredto, signifying the living sacrifice these souls made of themselves toGod. But there is no altar mentioned in the symbols except the goldenaltar. Besides, these were not sacrificial victims; for Christ was madea complete sacrifice for sin, while these only suffered martyrdombecause of their faithfulness to the cause of Christ. It is much morereasonable to suppose that their interceding cries went up from thegolden altar, where the "prayers of all saints" ascended with muchincense.Their prayers to God for the avenging of their blood shows theexpectation on their part that the judgments of Heaven would descendupon the cruel and haughty persecutors and oppressors of earth, andtheir surprise was that the day of retribution had been so long delayed.The history of the church as developed under the preceding seals givesparticular force to this cry of the martyrs. For nearly three centuriesthe civil power of Pagan Rome had been employed to crush the cause ofGod. During ten terrible seasons of persecution they had been crucified,slain with the sword, sawn asunder, devoured by beasts in the arena, andgiven to the flames. When Constantine, a nominal Christian emperor,ascended the throne and protected religion by law, it was believed thatpersecutions must cease; but soon the discovery was made that the swordhad only changed hands, there having risen an ecclesiastical hierarchydestined to "glut itself upon the blood of which heathen Rome had onlytasted." The world was now made the arena for the terrible coursings ofthe pale horseman, and the "beasts of the earth" were let loose to fallwith savage fury upon their helpless victims, until millions lost theirlives at the instigation of the apostate Church of Rome. Is it anywonder that the souls of these martyrs should cry unto God for thevindication of their righteous blood?It is said that "white robes were given unto every one of them." Byreferring to chap. 3:4; 7:9, 13, 14, it will be seen that "whitegarments" and "white robes" are sometimes used as a symbol to describe apart of the heavenly inheritance. The martyr-spirits, although impatientat the delay of avenging judgment, received a righteous reward. But theperiod of tribulation to the church was not yet over. The cup ofiniquity in the hands of her enemies was not yet full, and they weretold to "rest for a little season, until their fellowservants also, andtheir brethren, that should be killed as they were, should befulfilled." The account given seems to indicate an important epoch, aperiod in which the martyrs had reason to expect the vindication oftheir righteous blood, but which, instead, was to be followed by anothergreat period of persecution. Considering the time of the events alreadydescribed in this series of prophecy, we have no difficulty in fixingthe chronology of this event at the dividing-point between the era ofPapal supremacy and the age of Protestantism--or at the Reformation ofthe Sixteenth Century. Did severe slaughter and persecution follow theReformation? Witness the reign of Mary Tudor, frequently styled "BloodyMary." During three years of her reign, 1555 to 1558, two hundred andeighty-eight were _burnt alive_ in England! Think of the inhumanmassacre of the innocent Waldenses of southern France by the violentbigot Oppede (1545), who slew eight hundred men in one town, and thrustthe women into a barn filled with straw and reduced the whole toashes--only a sample of his barbarity; or of their oppression insouthern Italy by Pope Pius IV. (1560), at whose command they were slainby thousands, the throats of eighty-eight men being cut on one occasionby a single executioner! Witness the horrible massacre of St.Bartholomew in Paris (Aug. 21, 1572), when the Queen dowager, theinfamous Catherine de Medici, lured immense numbers of the innocentHugenots into the city under the pretext of witnessing a marriagebetween the Hugenot Henry, king of Navarre, and the sister of CharlesIX., king of France--when the gates were closed and the work ofwholesale slaughter began at a given signal and raged for three days,during which time from six to ten thousand were butchered in Parisalone! Think of the rivers of blood in the Netherlands, where the Dukeof Alva boasted that in the short space of six weeks he had put eighteenthousand to death! Witness the dragoonading methods and other inhumanpersecutions to "wear out the saints of the Most High," that followedthe revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) by Louis XIV., king ofFrance, during whose reign three hundred thousand were brutallybutchered--while Pope Innocent XI. extolled the king by special letteras follows: "The Catholic church shall most assuredly record in hersacred annals a _work of such devotion toward her_, and CELEBRATE YOURNAME WITH NEVER-DYING PRAISES ... for _this most excellentundertaking_"!! My heart sickens with horror in the contemplation ofsuch events. Eternal God! can thy righteous eye behold suchheart-rending scenes of earth, and thy hand of power not be extended tohumble to the dust these cruel, haughty oppressors of thy people?    12. And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo,    there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as    sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;    13. And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a    fig-tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a    mighty wind.    14. And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled    together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their    places.    15. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich    men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every    bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in    the rocks of the mountains;    16. And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us    from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the    wrath of the Lamb;    17. For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be    able to stand?Upon the opening of this seal the scene changes again. The symbols areall drawn from an entirely different source. We are taken out of thedepartment of civil life into the scenes of nature, which is a clearevidence that the history of the church is no longer underconsideration. Had God intended to here continue her history, he wouldno doubt have employed symbols derived from the same source as thosepreceding, so as to prevent our being led astray. No more horsemen orliving characters appear, but we behold the most terrific convulsions ofnature--a mighty earthquake, the darkening of the sun and the moon, thefalling of the stars, and finally the dissolution of the heavens,together with the mountains and the islands being removed. If thehistory of the church is no longer under consideration, this greatchange of symbols directs us with absolute certainty into the politicaland civil world for their fulfilment. Of course, we are not to supposethat this is a literal description.In this manner the dignity and the excellence in the use and theinterpretation of symbols is preserved. To describe the religioushistory of the church, noble symbols chosen from the department of humanlife are selected; while symbols drawn from an inferior department--thatof nature--are chosen to represent political affairs. This point willappear very clear as we proceed in the interpretation of the Apocalypse.It is just what we might naturally expect.The question may be asked, If these symbols from nature representpolitical affairs, where in the events of civil history shall we lookfor their fulfilment? Every one will readily perceive the analogybetween an earthquake and a political revolution, when all society is ina state of agitation as when the solid earth trembles. It is alsoevident that the sun, moon, and stars bear the same analagousrelationship to the earth that kings, rulers, and princes do to the bodypolitic; while the firmament of heaven is analagous to the entire fabricof civil government, the symbolic heaven in which the symbolic orbs areset to give light.The symbols, then, point us to the most terrible revolutions--whensociety is in a state of agitation, when kingdoms are overthrown andtheir rulers and princes thrown from their positions or made objects ofthe most gloomy terror; yea, when the entire fabric of civil governmentis finally overthrown and all the institutions and organizations ofsociety are swept away as with a tornado. This is the time ofconsternation to the great men of earth, when they shall hide"themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains," and say tothe mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of himthat sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for thegreat day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?" This isthe time that the martyrs looked forward to when they cried, "How long,O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on themthat dwell on the earth?" A large portion of the Apocalypse is occupiedwith the history of these persecuting powers, civil and ecclesiastical.It is their dominacy that constitutes the long period of tribulation tothe church, when the witnesses prophesy in sackcloth and the faithfulare ground into the dust by the feet of these proud oppressors as theystand in the high places of the earth. But the cries of the slaughteredsaints have ascended to the throne as incense; God speaks; the judgmentsof Heaven descend upon these lofty ones; and a voice from heavendeclares, "They have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and _thouhast given them blood to drink_; for they are worthy."This is surely a striking combination of symbols, and the way they arearranged would indicate that their fulfilment occupied a considerableperiod of time. First we have a great earthquake, afterwards thedarkening of the sun and the moon, with the falling of the stars, andfinally the dissolution of the heavens themselves, with the sweepingaway of mountains and islands. This description covers the same periodas that described under the seven last plagues, beginning with certainfearful revolutions in which the nations that had slaughtered themillions of God's people were given "blood to drink," and ending finallyin "the great day of his wrath" that shall sweep them from theirpositions eternally. The full explanation of these events can not atpresent be appreciated by the reader, therefore I reserve it for thefuture, to be more fully developed under other symbols.In these six seals we have a vivid outline of mighty events, politicaland ecclesiastical, extending from the earliest stage of Christianity tothe end of time. This description in advance was no mere humanproduction. No human foresight would have detected, and no mortal mindwould have conceived, events so wonderful and so farreaching in theircharacter. Any other history would sooner have been imagined. It takesdivine wisdom to understand the true position of the church in thepresent, and she can scarcely read her past history by natural wisdomalone, much less outline the future. First the establishment ofChristianity is symbolized, then the violence of the Pagan party, theapostasy, and final establishment of the "man of sin," until themillions of earth are crushed by the spiritual tyranny or by the arm ofcivil power, and the cry of the martyrs goes up "How long, O Lord?" Butthey are told to rest "a little season," when they shall witness thehand of God laid upon these persecuting nations of earth, convulsingthem in the most fearful revolutions, and ending finally in theircomplete overthrow in that last "great day of God Almighty."CHAPTER VII.    And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four    corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that    the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on    any tree.    2. And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the    seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the    four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea.    3. Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,    till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.    4. And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there    were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the    tribes of the children of Israel.    5. Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the    tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad    were sealed twelve thousand.    6. Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the    tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of    Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.    7. Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the    tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of    Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.    8. Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the    tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of    Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.A clear understanding of the two visions in the chapter before us can beobtained only by considering the plan of the prophecy already referredto. The events are narrated by series. A particular theme is taken upand followed through to its completion; then the narrative returns andanother theme is introduced. But this is not all. Whenever the historyof abounding error or iniquity is set forth, we have in immediateconnection and in perfect contrast therewith a history of the truepeople of God; thus, the contemporaneous history of righteousness andiniquity, truth and error, a true church and a false one. The visions ofthis chapter cover the same period of time as the events described inthe preceding chapter, but form the most perfect contrast. The studentof Revelation who unfolds the dark history of apostasy and iniquitycontained in the preceding seals might naturally be led to ask, Is thisthe melancholy end of God's church? Does it deteriorate rapidly and turnout so badly, after all? As an answer to these questions, God gives usnext a history of his own people, showing that he preserved his ownchurch complete, although Antichrist reigned in power.The principal points in the vision before us are the tempestuous windsabout to descend upon the earth, and the sealing of God's servants. Thefirst of these, being drawn from nature, would lead us to look for itsfulfilment in political events; while the latter, derived from humanlife, directs us into the affairs of the church. The "four winds of theearth" from the "four corners of the earth" signify all the winds fromevery direction--the cardinal points of the compass; while the fourangels signify all the agencies that have control of these winds, whichfor the present are held in restraint in order to give opportunity forthe sealing of the Lord's servants. _Angels_ in the Scripture isfrequently used to denote evil agencies as well as good, the contextdetermining which is meant. See Chap. 12:7. The design of the winds wasto "hurt the earth, the sea, and the trees."What, let me ask, in the political world is analagous to tempestuousstorms sweeping over the earth? What but huge masses of men, excited byfierce passions, precipitating themselves upon the inhabitants of anempire, sweeping everything before them in the fury of their march andspreading desolation on every side? In the symbols of the next chapterwe find that just such hordes of men--barbarians--under their angels, orleaders, precipitated themselves upon the Roman empire; and the fearfuleffects upon the earth, the sea, and the green trees produced thereby,is particularly detailed. For the present, however, they are held underrestraint until the sealing of the servants of God should beaccomplished, then they were to go forward in their work of destruction.The sealing of the servants is not making them the people of God, butrather marking or designating them as such, just as later we find thedevotees of a corrupt apostate church specified as having the "mark ofthe beast." Considerable light can be thrown upon the subject of thesealing of God's servants and of the mark of the beast by consultingRoman history for the origin of such expressions. The many conquests ofthe Roman arms furnished so many prisoners that they became a drug inthe slave-markets of the world, and were so numerous that in many placesthey outnumbered the Roman citizens ten to one. In the first centurybefore Christ it is said that some Sicilian estates were worked by asmany as twenty thousand slaves. "That each owner might know his own, thepoor creatures were _branded like cattle_." The "mark of the beast"possessed by the followers of a false communion will be found to consistof an Antichristian spirit by which they are filled with "doctrines ofdevils." So, also, "the seal of the living God" consists of the givingof the Holy Spirit, by which his people are led into all truth. See John14:26. While Sabbatarians vainly try to prove that keeping the seventhday is the seal of God in this dispensation, yet there is not one textof Scripture that hints such a thing, but, on the contrary, theScriptures are against them. "Grieve not the _Holy Spirit_ of Godwhereby _ye are sealed_ unto the day of redemption." Eph. 4:30. Again,the Word of God says, "Now he which stablished us with you in Christ,and hath anointed us is God; who hath also sealed us, and given theearnest of the Spirit in our hearts." 2 Cor. 1:21, 22. The time thissealing of the people of God takes place is thus described: "_After_that ye believed, ye were _sealed_ with that Holy Spirit of promise."Eph. 1:13. The winds of heaven were restrained until the work of _fullsalvation_ could be firmly established in the earth. When Christappeared, the Roman empire was in a state of comparative quiet, and theimmense hosts of foreign invaders did not appear until the firmestablishment of Christianity, being held back by the power of God untilhis work should be accomplished.In the description of the sealing given, twelve thousand were selectedfrom each of the twelve tribes. Some have supposed this to havereference solely to salvation work among the Jewish nation; but thatwould be adopting the literal mode of interpretation, thus destroyingits symbolic character. The twelve tribes are chosen from the properdepartment to represent the church or "Israel of God" in thisdispensation, irrespective of nationality. The twelve gates in the wallof the heavenly city are named after the twelve tribes of the childrenof Israel (chap. 21:12), showing that it is only through "Israel" thatany one can enter the New Jerusalem. Since the gospel is given to allnations, this can not signify literal Israel. "The children of thepromise are counted for the seed." Rom. 9:8. "If ye be Christ's, thenare ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." Gal. 3:29.Since the vision is symbolical, we are to consider the numbers given assymbolical also, the definite number of twelve thousand from each of thetribes showing that the church of God was _complete and perfect_, nopart being omitted.    9. After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man    could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and    tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed    with white robes, and palms in their hands;    10. And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God    which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.    11. And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about    the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on    their faces, and worshipped God,    12. Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and    thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God    for ever and ever. Amen.    13. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are    these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?    14. And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me,    These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have    washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the    Lamb.    15. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him    day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne    shall dwell among them.    16. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither    shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.    17. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed    them, and shall lead them unto living mountains of waters: and    God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.In this scene the vision is carried forward to the close of the longperiod of tribulation and persecution to the church of God, when all herenemies are finally overthrown; and here are the glorious results, theharvest gathered: a great multitude whom no man can number, gathered outof all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, standing beforethe throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms intheir hands, the symbols of their victory. The scene is laid in heaven,and refers undoubtedly to the end of time when the heavenly world willbe opened up to all the faithful who have suffered for Christ amid thetrials and the oppositions through which his church is called to pass inthis present world. We are expressly informed by one of the elders whothese are in white robes and whence they came, so there can be noquestion respecting them. This is the glorious company of the redeemedof all ages who "came out of great tribulation, and have washed theirrobes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore they arebefore the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; andhe that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hungerno more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them,nor any heat." What a contrast with the scenes of earth, when oppressedby famine, and cold, and nakedness, and peril, and sword, they werekilled all the day long! But their sufferings are over; "for the Lambwhich is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead themunto living fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears fromtheir eyes."This redeemed company is represented as uniting in a song of praise andthanksgiving to God for bringing them through their long period oftrial, "saying Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, andunto the Lamb"; while heaven resounds with universal praise as theangels and all the redeemed host take up the chorus and swell the mightyanthem "saying, Amen; blessing, and glory, and wisdom and thanksgiving,and honor, and power, and might be unto our God forever and ever. Amen."It is clear that, in this chapter and the one preceding, we have twogrand parallel and comprehensive histories--in one, the process ofcorruption in the so-called church and the final judgments that overtookthese cruel persecutors of the Lord's people; in the other, the settingapart and sealing of God's servants, their preservation from thecontaminations of an apostate church, and the final glorious triumph ofall who endure unto the end.This vision has often been applied in a figurative manner to thespiritual reign of God's people on earth before the end of time--thatthey are overcomers through the blood of Christ, that God dwells withthem in his church, that their spiritual needs are all supplied so theyhunger and thirst no more--but a careful study of the plan of theprophecy will show that its real signification is the heavenly state atthe end. As the sixth seal describes the final overthrow of all theantichristian powers that have oppressed God's people on earth; so thisvision describes the great white-robed company gathered out of everynation, kindred, tongue, and people, who have been preserved faithfulthrough all these trials and tribulations, and who receive at last thecrown of everlasting life. This last vision will be more fully describedunder certain symbols contained in the last two chapters of this book;while the earthquake, the falling of the stars, etc., of the sixth sealwill be more perfectly detailed in chapters 15 and 16.CHAPTER VIII.    And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in    heaven about the space of half an hour.    2. And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to    them were given seven trumpets.    3. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a    golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that    he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the    golden altar which was before the throne.    4. And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of    the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.    5. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the    altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and    thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.The remainder of the book is embraced in the contents of the seventhseal. This may appear a little singular at first, being so much largerthan the preceding ones. But it is easily understood when we considerthe six as being a synopsis of the whole book, containing a history ofthe church apostate to the final consummation, and also thecontemporaneous history of the truth church of God; while the seventhgives in detail the account of these great persecuting powers, civil andecclesiastical, and the trials and triumphs of the saints in the NewJerusalem--developing more fully the events described under the six.Upon the opening of the seventh seal, "there was silence in heaven aboutthe space of half an hour." Whether this interval of silence is intendedto be symbolical of any event on earth I do not know; neither have Iseen any solution of the matter that is consistent or satisfactory. Somehave supposed that it denoted a cessation of persecution among theChristians of earth. But if that were the case, then its opposite,"voices in heaven," would indicate seasons of persecution. There wereseveral seasons of rest from persecution enjoyed by the early saints,and why should one period be singled out more than the rest and be thusdescribed? Besides, "a half hour," according to prophetic time wouldsignify only about one week, a period too short certainly to takeaccount of. Others have supposed that it signified the end of the world,and that heaven would then be deserted for a short time while thejudgment was taking place. But the events following show that the end ofthe world is not here described, therefore it can not have reference tosuch. Moreover, it is extremely doubtful whether silence in heaven wouldbe a proper symbol of such an event. I do not perceive the analogy. Infact, such an interpretation of _silence_ would be literal and notsymbolic.Its explanation would seem to be found in connection with certain factsstated respecting the opening of the preceding seals--that voicesfollowed them. When the first four seals were opened, John heard thevoices of the four beasts, "as it were a voice of thunder"; and on theopening of the fifth, he heard the souls of the martyrs crying unto God;but when the seventh was opened, there was silence for a time. Thecontrast is noticeable; but whether it has any special signification, Iam unable to say; perhaps not.Before the sounding of the seven trumpets, the acceptableness of theprayers of the saints is represented by an angel offering incense "uponthe golden altar which was before the throne." This scene was doubtlessintroduced to lend encouragement to God's children--that, althoughiniquity abounded on every side and the judgments of God were poured outupon the people, still the prayers of the faithful few were acceptablein his sight, ascending before the throne like sweet incense from offthe golden altar.After offering up the incense with the prayers of all saints, the sameangel took his censer and filled it with fire from off the altar andcast it (the fire) upon the earth--a token of God's avengingjudgments--"and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, andan earthquake." These, of course, were on earth, and symbolized therevolutions and convulsions now about to take place in the empire.    6. And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared    themselves to sound.    7. The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire    mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the    third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt    up.We here enter upon a series of prophecies developing fully thesuccessive steps in the decline of the Western Roman empire, by which itfinally tottered to its fall. It was necessary that this persecuting,tyrannical government should be subverted in order to give opportunityfor the establishment of apostate Christianity in the form of thePapacy, as it constituted the "let" or hindrance to the full developmentof the "man of sin" mentioned by the apostle in 2 Thes. 2. Thatpersecuting, Pagan Rome was a serious obstacle confronting thedevelopment of apostasy was recognized even by the early Christians.Thus, Tertullian, in his notable Apology, chapter 32, says: "Christiansare under a particular necessity of praying for the emperors, and forthe continued state of the empire; because we know that dreadful powerwhich hangs over the world, and _the conclusion of the age, whichthreatens the most horrible evils, is restrained by the continuance ofthe time appointed for the Roman empire_. This is what we would notexperience; and while we pray that it may be deferred, we hereby showour good-will to the perpetuity of the Roman state." In a subsequentchapter it will be seen that Pagan Rome, broken up into minor divisionsand no longer able to maintain her position in the political world,resigns her power and authority into the hands of the rising Papacy.Therefore it is not surprising that the means by which this great changeis effected should be made the subject of prophetic revelation. Besides,we have other things to guide us in the interpretation. We can readilyidentify the symbols under the fifth trumpet with the curse ofMohammedanism in the Eastern empire, and we would naturally suppose thatthe first four precede those. Again, the symbols are all drawn from thenatural world, which leads us assuredly into the political affairs ofthe empire for their fulfilment. They are also of the most destructivenature, therefore we look for objects of a corresponding desolatingcharacter. Finally, the vision of the preceding chapter representsfierce, destructive winds as about to descend upon the earth, beingtemporarily held in check to give opportunity for the primitiveestablishment of Christianity, implying that they would afterwards belet loose to burst like a tornado upon the empire. It is said positivelythat power was given "to hurt the earth and the sea" (chap. 7:2), and inthe vision before us the effects produced upon the earth and the treesare particularly detailed."The earth" signifies the Roman empire, or that portion of the earthmade the subject of apocalyptic vision. That this application of theword _earth_ is correct, is shown by various Scriptures. "And it came topass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustusthat _all the world_ should be taxed." Luke 2:1. "The queen of the South... came from the _uttermost parts of the earth_ [southern Arabia] tohear the wisdom of Solomon." Mat. 12:42. "Ye shall be witnesses ... untothe _uttermost part of the earth_." Acts 1:8. The apostles carried thegospel personally, only throughout the territory of the then-knowncivilized world--the Roman empire. Upon this earth there descended inthe vision before us a fierce storm of hail and fire, mingled withblood. Its being mingled with blood would indicate its destructiveeffects. One characteristic of this symbol particularly is worthy ofnotice. Hail and fire cast upon the earth would become absorbed speedilyor pass into new combinations with the surrounding elements, thus notremaining in any permanent form except in its effects. In thisparticular it is wholly unlike the symbol of the next trumpet, which isthat of a burning mountain cast into the sea, for such a body wouldnaturally remain permanently where it fell; whereas a storm of hail andfire would soon disappear. Also, the statement that this storm was castupon the earth would indicate that it was a calamity descending fromwithout upon the empire.Where, now, do we find the object that fully meets the requirements ofthis symbol--destructive agents descending upon the Roman empire like afurious storm of hail and fire, accomplishing the first important steptoward the subverting of the empire? We find it in the irruption of thefierce Gothic tribes of the North, who, under Alaric, burst like atornado upon the empire about the beginning of the fifth century,spreading destruction and desolation upon every side.The following quotations and facts from the highest authority on thesubject, Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (Vol. III, pp.190-294), will give the reader an idea of the awful effects produced bythe invasions of these barbarous tribes. The great Theodosius, emperorof the Western Roman empire, "had supported the frail and moulderingedifice of the republic," but upon his death he was succeeded by theweak Honorious. In a few months the Gothic barbarians were in arms. "Thebarriers of the Danube were thrown down, the savage warriors of Scythiaissued from their forests ... and the various tribes of barbarians, whoglory in the Gothic name, were irregularly spread over the woody shoresof Dalmatia to the walls of Constantinople." They were "directed by thebold and artful genius of Alaric," who soon concluded that the conquestof Constantinople was an impracticable enterprise. He "disdained totrample any longer on the prostrate and ruined countries of Thrace andDacia, and he resolved to seek a plentiful harvest of fame and riches ina province which had hitherto escaped the ravages of war.... The troopswhich had been posted to defend the straits of Thermopylae retired ...without attempting to disturb the secure and rapid passage of Alaric;and the fertile fields of Phocis and Baeotia were instantly covered by adeluge of barbarians, who massacred the males of an age to bear arms,and drove away the beautiful females, with the spoil and cattle of theflaming villages. The travelers who visited Greece several yearsafterwards, could easily discover the deep and bloody traces of themarch of the Goths.... The whole territory of Attica, from thepromontory of Sunium to the town of Megara, was blasted by his balefulpresence; and, if we may use the comparison of a contemporaryphilosopher, Athens itself resembled the bleeding and empty skin of aslaughtered victim.... Corinth, Argos, Sparta, yielded withoutresistance to the arms of the Goths; and the most fortunate of theinhabitants were saved, by death, from beholding the slavery of theirfamilies and the conflagration of their cities."Arcadius, the emperor of the East, wishing to dissuade Alaric fromfurther conquests and such wholesale massacres, promoted him to the rankof Master-general of the eastern Illyricum, but it had an oppositeeffect. "The birth of Alaric, the glory of his past exploits, and theconfidence in his future designs, insensibly united the body of the[Gothic] nation under his victorious standard; and, with the unanimousconsent of the barbarian chieftains, the Master-general of Illyricum waselevated, according to the ancient custom, on a shield, and solemnlyproclaimed king of the Visigoths. Armed with this double power, situatedon the verge of the two empires, he alternately sold his deceitfulpromises to the courts of Arcadius and Honorious; until he declared andexecuted his resolution of _invading the dominions of the West_.... Hewas tempted by the fame, the beauty, the wealth of Italy, which he hadtwice visited; and he secretly aspired to plant the Gothic standard onthe walls of Rome, and to enrich his army with the accumulated spoils ofthree hundred triumphs." He marched into Italy, and the emperor fledbefore him. A temporary respite was finally procured by the promise of apayment of four thousand pounds of gold.Alaric soon appeared, however, before the very walls of Rome, and thatsplendid city, surrounded by hordes of barbarians, was soon reduced to awretched condition by famine. Two representatives of the Romans waitedupon Alaric for terms of peace, stating that if such could not bearranged the inhabitants of the city, animated by despair, would fightto the bitter end. To this the haughty conqueror made this famous reply:"The thicker the grass, the easier it is mowed." With an insultinglaugh, he named the ransom required--all the gold and silver containedin the city, all the rich and precious movables, together with all theslaves. Then the ministers humbly asked, "What do you intend to leaveus?" "Your lives," the haughty king replied, and retired. He finallyrelaxed a little and fixed other terms, which included the immediatepayment of the enormous sum of five thousand pounds of gold, thirtythousand pounds of silver, besides other treasure. "The victoriousleader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the art anddiscipline of a Roman general, was at the head of a hundred thousandfighting men; and Italy pronounced, with terror and respect, theformidable name of Alaric."A second time Rome was besieged by Alaric and taken. Honorious wasdeposed and Attalus made emperor; but Honorious was afterwards restored.In A.D. 410 he again marched upon the city, captured and entered it."Eleven hundred and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome, theimperial city, which had subdued and civilized so considerable a part ofmankind, was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of Germaniaand Scythia." For six days the city was sacked by the barbaroussoldiery, and the horrible scenes of robbery, murder, and rapine thatensued can not be described. It has been said that "civilized warfare issufficiently terrible," but that would be almost a blessing comparedwith such scenes as these. For a space of four years Alaric ravagedItaly almost without opposition.The slaughter and devastation that followed this storm of "hail andfire" is thus described: "The banks of the Rhine were crowned like thoseof the Tiber, with houses and well-cultivated farms; and if a poetdescended the river, he might express his doubts on which side wassituated the territory of the Romans. This scene of peace and plenty wassuddenly changed into a desert, and the prospect of the smoking ruinscould alone distinguish the solitude of nature from the desolation ofman. The flourishing city of Mentz was surprised and destroyed, and manythousand Christians inhumanly massacred in the church. Wurms perishedafter a long and obstinate siege. Strasburg, Spires, Rheims, Tournay,Arras, Amiens, experienced the cruel oppression of the German yoke, andthe consuming flames of war spread from the banks of the Rhine over thegreatest part of the seventeen provinces of Gaul. That rich andextensive country, as far as the ocean, the Alps and the Pyrenees, wasdelivered to the barbarians, who drove before them, in a promiscuouscrowd, the bishop, the senator and the virgin, laden with the spoils oftheir houses and altars."Another historian describing the same, a few years after the event,says: "The barbarians meeting with little resistance, indulged in theutmost cruelty. The cities which they captured, they so utterlydestroyed that no traces of them now remain, except in Thrace andGreece, except here and there a tower or a gate. All the men who opposedthem they slew, young and old, and indeed spared not women, nor evenchildren. Whence there is still but a sparse population in Italy. Theplunder which they seized in every part of Europe was immense, andespecially at Rome, where they left nothing, either public or private."In this latter description reference is also made to some laterinvasions, but they were all of the same desolating character.These historical facts show how the green grass, or the feebler portionof society--the tender sex, the young, and the aged--were consumedbefore this fearful storm of hail and fire; and also how the trees, orthe stronger portion--those better able to make resistance--sufferedgreatly.It is also a fact to be observed that these fierce tribes which overranItaly, harassed or captured Rome repeatedly, and threatened theoverthrow of the empire, made no permanent settlement in that territory."Under Alaric the Goths make no lasting settlement. In the long tale ofintrigue and warfare between the Goths and the two Imperial courts whichfills up this whole time, cessions of territory are offered to theGoths, provinces are occupied by them, but as yet they do not take rootanywhere; no Western land as yet becomes Gothia,"--EncyclopaediaBritannica, Art. Goths. After the death of Alaric (A.D. 412), however,they settled in the southern part of Spain and Gaul[5]--part of theterritory of the West--but they no longer threatened the life of theempire; but, on the contrary, they became allies of the Romans inopposing the dreadful incursions of the Huns and other barbarians. Thustheir invasion of the West was at first terribly destructive--like astorm of hail and fire--but their ravages soon ceased, except in theirdisastrous and weakening effects.[Footnote 5: This division of the Gothic tribes is commonly called theVisigoths (Western Goths), as distinguished from the Ostrogoths, orEastern Goths.]    8. And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain    burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of    the sea became blood;    9. And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea,    and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were    destroyed.The symbol of this trumpet is that of a volcanic mountain cast into thesea, whence it sends forth its streams of lava in every direction untila third of the creatures in the sea are destroyed, thus spreadingdesolation on every side. It would naturally remain where it fell, apermanent instrument of destruction.We have here a description of the next step of importance in thedownfall of the Western empire. The second great invasion was that of"the terrible Genseric" with his Vandal hordes, who pushed southwardthrough Gaul and Spain, conquered the Carthaginian territory of northernAfrica, and there formed a permanent independent government in A.D. 439.From this fixed place, he continued for years to make incursions uponthe bordering cities and islands, burning the cities, murdering theinhabitants, and intercepting the commerce of the Mediterranean. Duringhis military career, 429-468, he became the terror of the inhabitants ofthe empire, insomuch that historians designate him "the terribleGenseric." The depredations committed by his followers were but arepetition of such scenes of barbarity as have already been described inthe invasions of Alaric under the first trumpet, therefore I will notdevote much space to the historical facts in the case. Their deeds,however, were such that the very term _Vandal_ has come to be used as adesignation of any man of ferocious character. Concerning the importantpart that this chieftain acted in the downfall of the Western empire,Gibbon uses this significant language: "Genseric, a name which, in thedestruction of the Roman empire, has deserved an equal rank with thenames of Alaric and Attila." Vol. III, p. 370.In the year 454 the empress Eudoxia wished to be revenged on Maximus,who had murdered her husband Valentinian and had grasped the throne, andshe secretly invited Genseric to attack Rome. That fierce general, whois described by the Encyclopaedia Britannica as "cruel toblood-thirstiness, cunning, unscrupulous, and grasping," was glad toundertake the task, and he soon landed an army of Vandals and AfricanMoors at the gates of the city. It was soon taken and for fifteen daysgiven over to be sacked by the barbarous soldiery. When they had gluttedtheir savage instincts with the horrible deeds of murder and rapine,loaded with the spoils of the imperial city, they returned to Africa,taking with them an immense number of captives, including Eudoxia andher two daughters. This desolating incursion left the empire weak andtottering to its fall. Genseric "became the tyrant of the sea; thecoasts of Italy, Greece, and Asia, were again exposed to his revenge andavarice. Tripoli and Sardinia returned to his obedience; he added Sicilyto the number of his provinces; and before he died, in the fulness ofyears and glory, he beheld the FINAL EXTINCTION of the empire of theWest." Gibbon, Vol. III, pp. 497, 498.By "the sea" into which this burning mountain was cast is meant, not theMediterranean nor any other literal sea, but the heart of the empire,and that in a state of agitation. The empire was in a state ofcomparative quiet when Alaric appeared; therefore the storm of hail andfire is represented as falling upon "the earth," as a result of whichsociety was thrown into a state of great agitation, and moved to itsdepths, like an ocean in a storm. This was its condition when Genseric,from his fixed position in Africa, began his desolating incursions;therefore the next symbol is that of a mountain cast into "the sea." Bythe sea becoming blood is doubtless meant the destruction of life in theempire, and "the third part" denotes the vast extent of the destruction.I must speak with hesitation on what is signified by "the creatureswhich were in the sea" and the "ships." By analogy I would be led torefer the former to the rulers and the dignitaries in the empire, theybearing an analagous position to the empire that fishes do to the watersof the sea; while the latter may refer to public monuments andstructures.    10. And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star    from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the    third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;    11. And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third    part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the    waters, because they were made bitter.The description given of this star is similar to that of a large burningmeteor, such as we frequently see shooting athwart the heavens. It fellrapidly to earth, as such meteors often do, and struck thefountain-heads of the rivers, imparting to them such a poisonous qualityas caused the death of those who drank the waters.This symbol is also drawn from the natural world, and hence we must lookfor its fulfilment in political events. The rapidity of its fall anddisappearance in the waters would direct us to an agent who would appearsuddenly and soon disappear, and whose career would leave bitterresults. The direct effects of this meteor were experienced by therivers and the fountains of waters, which bear an analagous relation tothe sea that bordering tribes and nations do to an empire. The heart ofthe empire, or "the sea," was directly affected by the burning mountain,under the preceding trumpet; while the tributaries of the sea, or thebordering tribes, are made the subject of direct attack under thissymbol and the poisonous qualities of their waters carried to fardistant points.Under this striking symbol we have a description of the third importantstep in the downward course of Rome--the short but eventful career ofAttila, with his terrible Scythians, or Huns. Singularly, Attila wassaid to "possess the iron sword of the war-god _Mars_," and he claimedfor himself the designation or title "The Scourge of God"; while hisfollowers were even more cruel and barbarous, if possible, than theGoths and the Vandals.Coming from the remote solitudes of Asia under the leadership of theirfierce king, they poured like a tornado, first upon the inhabitants ofthe Eastern empire (in 442, 445) and then turned their attentionwestward. Attila ruled over "nearly all the tribes north of the Danubeand the Black sea," and under his banner fought Ostrogoths, Gepidae,Alani, Heruli, and many other Teutonic peoples. Says Gibbon: "The wholebreadth of Europe, as it extends above five hundred miles from theEuxine to the Adriatic, was at once invaded, and occupied, and desolatedby the myriads of barbarians whom Attila led into the field." It was theboast of Attila that the grass never grew on the spot which his horsehad trod. In 451 he led his forces, seven hundred thousand strong,through the center of Germany into the heart of Gaul, where he was metat Chalons by the combined forces of the Visigoths, Alans, Franks andRomans, and was defeated, with the loss of one hundred and seventythousand of his men. This was one of the most gigantic as well as one ofthe most important battles of history. A rivulet flowing through thefield of battle is said to have been colored and swollen by the blood ofthe slain. The next year, however, with a greater force at his command,he fell with headlong fury upon northern Italy; but he did not attackRome. Suddenly and seemingly without cause, he withdrew his army; andthis peculiar action of his has been the wonder of historians eversince. Says the Encyclopaedia Britannica: "Attila at once withdrew fromItaly, but the motive which led him to act thus is not known." Accordingto the prophecy, he was to fall upon the "rivers and fountains ofwaters" only. A short time later, in 453, he died, and "the vast empireover which he had ruled broke up _immediately_ after his death, no onechief being powerful enough to seize the supremacy." Thus his short butwonderful career of about twelve years ended suddenly, like a meteorfalling into a river.But the effects of this invasion were farreaching. Rome in her decliningstrength, being unable to cope with these immense hordes of barbarians,was forced to call to her assistance the half-civilized tribes of Gothicbarbarians against a more dreaded foe. The success that attended theseconflicts of the combined forces were the means of giving greaterpolitical importance to these Gothic tribes and securing theirindependence. But while they rose, Rome fell. By the very act ofemploying such weapons in defense, Rome robbed herself of the littlepolitical strength remaining, and she was obliged to accept the bitterconsequences.Under each of these first three trumpets the extent of destruction isindicated by the expression "the third part." Since the successive stepsin the downfall of the empire is the subject under consideration, thisexpression as here applied doubtless has particular reference to theloss of political power and life, rather than referring directly to theloss of human life sustained. With this thought in view, it is evidentthat the political importance of the empire was entirely destroyed bythese desolating incursions. Of the truth of this fact all historiansagree. Nothing of Rome remained, except the semblance of a government,when the time arrived for the sounding of the next trumpet.    12. And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun    was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part    of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the    day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.The symbol of this trumpet is that of an eclipse of sun, moon, andstars, so that they shone not for a third part of the day and night.Under the sixth seal we showed that these luminaries of heaven are takenas symbols of rulers and princes; for the latter bear an analagousrelation to the empire that the former do to the earth. In thedarkening, then, of the sun, moon, and stars, we are to look for somedisastrous change or overthrow in the imperial government. Such an eventoccurred only a few years after the events described under the precedingtrumpets. With her political strength and resources exhausted, Romecould no longer maintain a separate existence, and Odoacer, king of theHeruli, overthrew Momyllus Augustulus, the last of the Roman line ofemperors, and caused himself to be proclaimed king of Italy in A.D. 476.This terminated the Western empire; and thus was the Roman sun eclipsedin darkness. In a subsequent chapter, however, we will find the eclipselifted at a later period and _New Rome_ enjoying all the power andauthority lost in her predecessors of the old Augustin line.Odoacer continued in possession of his kingdom seventeen years. Then hewas defeated and slain by Theodoric, and by him the kingdom of theOstrogoths was established in Italy. Sixty years later this kingdom wassubverted by Belisarius, the general of Justinian, emperor of the East,to whom it became a tributary province. In each of the principal citiesof Italy Justinian appointed a governor with the title of Duke, insubordination to another with the title of Exarch, whose residence wasat Ravenna. "Thus, at last, was Rome, once the proud mistress of theworld, reduced to a poor dukedom, made tributary to the Exarch ofRavenna, and he holding his authority at the will of the emperor ofConstantinople, the seat of the Eastern empire."Thus, under the symbols of these four trumpets we have developed thewondrous history of the downfall of imperial Rome, in order to giveopportunity for the scenes of the drama yet to follow. The "man of sin"could not be fully revealed in all his terrible features until thishindrance was removed out of the way. Imperial Rome for three centuriesstood as the great opposer of God's people and slaughtered thousands,perhaps millions, of the Lord's innocent servants, and the hand ofretributive Justice was finally extended to humble her to the dust.Singularly, the persons whom God made choice of to effect her downfallhave either regarded themselves as special instruments whose mission itwas to punish the world or else have received such designations byhistorians because of their awful work. Contemporary historiansdistinguish Alaric by the epithets "The Scourge of God," "The Destroyerof Nations"; while the great Vandal leader is designated "The TerribleGenseric." Attila claimed the title "The Scourge of God."    13. And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of    heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the    inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the    trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!The later editions of the Greek New Testament give the word _eagle_instead of _angel_--denoting a messenger or angel flying with theswiftness of an eagle. This messenger doubtless is not intended to besymbolic; for it is not one of the seven angels, but a messengerpossessing a warning, and that warning is given "to the inhabitants ofthe earth," as if they were addressed directly. It simply announces thatthe three trumpets yet to sound will possess greater calamities to thepeople of earth than those that have preceded, by reason of which theyare called woes. The manner, also, in which the woe trumpets are spokenof afterwards confirm the statement that the announcement is literal andnot symbolical. "One woe is past, and, behold, there come two more woeshereafter." Chap. 9:12. "The second woe it past: and, behold, the thirdwoe cometh quickly." Chap. 11:14. These announcements are evidentlyliteral, and serve to explain the passage before us. Accordingly, thelast three trumpets are generally referred to as the woe trumpets.CHAPTER IX.    And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven    unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless    pit.    2. And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out    of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the    air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.    3. And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and    unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have    power.    4. And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass    of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but    only those men which have not the seal of God in their    foreheads.    5. And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but    that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was    as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.    6. And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find    it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.    7. And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared    unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like    gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.    8. And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were    as the teeth of lions.    9. And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron;    and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of    many horses running to battle.    10. And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were    stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five    months.    11. And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the    bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but    in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.The symbols of this trumpet are of a very peculiar character andpeculiarly combined. They are not drawn entirely from the natural world,showing that we are not to look for their fulfilment in political eventsalone; neither are they drawn from human life in any such way as toindicate events in the religious history of the church. The leadingcharacters in it, however, are living, active agents of such adestructive nature as to entitle them to the designation of a woe.The first object presented in the vision is a "star" fallen to theearth. Our translation conveys the idea that this star was in the act offalling; but in the original it is different, being there represented ashaving fallen, its dejection from heaven to earth being complete. Theonly place that it appeared in view was on the earth, and there it isdescribed as fallen. A star is a symbol either of a civil ruler or of areligious teacher, the symbols in connection deciding whether it is setin the political or the ecclesiastical firmament. But this was not sucha star as He who walketh in the midst of the golden candle-sticksholdeth in his right hand, but it was a _fallen_ star, indicating thatit was the propagator of a false faith.To this star was given a key. In the Gospels the same figure isemployed, where the ministers of Christ are represented as possessingthe keys of the kingdom of heaven, showing that they acted in his nameand by his authority. How appropriate, then, is this symbol as appliedto a false teacher, who possesses, not the keys of the kingdom ofheaven, but, instead, "the key of the bottomless pit"! Thus, under thesymbol of the star and the key, we have the teacher and his authorityset forth. Armed with this authority, this false teacher "opened thebottomless pit; and there rose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of agreat furnace; and the sun and air were darkened by reason of the smokeof the pit." In the Scriptures Jesus is represented as the Sun ofrighteousness, while "the light of the _glorious gospel_ of Christ"illuminates the world. But here we have something of the oppositecharacter--a dense smoke eclipsing the sun and darkening the heavens.Have we not here a fit representation of a delusive faith proceedingfrom its true source, "the bottomless pit"? And is not a fallen star anappropriate symbol of its propagator?In representing a system of religion by these objects from nature wedepart from the general rule first laid down--that objects of naturesymbolize political affairs, while the department of human and angeliclife is chosen to represent religious affairs. But the reader shouldbear in mind one important exception to this rule--that thingsprominently connected with the history of the people of God in formerages are frequently employed (regardless of the department to which theybelong) to represent spiritual things, their interpretation being easilyseen; such as candle-sticks, altar, temple, incense, etc. When theplague of "thick darkness" covered the land of Egypt for three days,"the children of Israel had light in their dwellings." In the exodus theLord went before them "by night in a pillar of fire, to give themlight." After the erection of the tabernacle the holy place wasconstantly illuminated. This natural light in the Jewish age constitutesa beautiful type of the spiritual "light of the glorious gospel ofChrist" that has "shined in our hearts" in the Christian dispensation.This spiritual light comes from Christ, the "Sun of righteousness," the"true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world"; andproceeds, also, from his people, who "shine as lights in the world." Butit is the "light of the _gospel_." This light proceeds in a specialsense from God's ministers, who are represented as "stars" (chap. 1:20)and who possess "the keys of the kingdom of heaven." Mat. 16:19; 18:18.How appropriate, then, that a _fallen_ "star," possessing "the key ofthe bottomless pit," should be a symbol of a religious impostor, andthat the smoke which darkened the heavens, eclipsing the sun, the sourceof light, should represent a prominent delusive faith! I have alreadymentioned the fact that the symbols of this vision lead to a series ofevents entirely separate in their nature from the spiritual history ofthe church as developed under other symbols. We find its fulfilment inMohammed and the delusive system he promulgated. In the year 606 Mahometretired to a cave in Hera, near Mecca, and there received his pretendedrevelations, although it was not until six years later that he began toteach his doctrines publicly and to gain followers outside of the circleof his own family and personal friends. Gibbon, Vol. V., p. 121.The next object in the vision is the locusts that came out of the smoke,to which was given power like scorpions, or power to inflict a deadlysting like scorpions. To what living agents, then, did the delusion ofMohammedanism give birth--agents of a destructive nature like scorpionlocust? Evidently, the Saracens,[6] those warrior followers of Mohammedwho flocked to his standard. These locusts received the express commandthat "they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any greenthing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal ofGod in their foreheads." The successor of Mohammed, Abubeker, gave theSaracens a command that they should "destroy no palm-trees, nor burn anyfields of grain; cut down no fruit-trees, nor do any mischief to cattle,only such as you kill to eat." This command was singular, yet itdoubtless is not the fulfilment of the command to the locusts; for thatwould be adopting a literal meaning instead of a symbolic one, and tocomplete the picture we should have had literal Saracens instead oflocusts. We can not consistently make a part literal and the remaindersymbolical. In the explanation of the first trumpet (chap. 8:6, 7), weshowed that grass and trees symbolized the inhabitants of a kingdom,grass representing the feebler and trees the stronger portions ofsociety. The fact, then, that these locusts were not to destroy thegreen grass and trees show that they were not sent as a scourge upon thepolitical empire only, as was the storm of hail and fire under the firsttrumpet. Had their mission been like that of natural locusts, to destroyevery green thing, we should then conclude that they were sent as ascourge upon the empire alone, having nothing whatever to do with asystem of religion. These locusts, however, were commanded not to dowhat natural locusts always do--eat green grass and trees--and werecommissioned to do what locusts never do--"hurt men," but only those whohave not the seal of God in their foreheads; that is, the worshipers ofa false, idolatrous church, who are not known unto God as his truepeople. This is positive proof that the design of this vision is to setforth some awful religious imposture; for the "men" that they were tohurt are found in the department which by analogy represents religiousevents.[Footnote 6: "In earlier times the name of Saraceni was applied byGreeks and Romans to the troublesome Nomad Arabs of the Syro-Arabiandesert."--_Encyclopaedia Britannica_. In the Middle Ages, however,Europeans began to call all their Moslem enemies Saracens. It is in thelimited sense that it is here applied, designating the first followersof Mohammed before the rise of the Ottoman empire.]The fact that their commission was to torment those "men which have notthe seal of God in their foreheads," is a proof also of the wide-spreadapostasies that had already taken place. This was the time when the palehorseman was careering over the world carrying desolation everywhere byhis instruments of oppression--sword, pestilences, famine, and the wildbeasts of the earth. "The churches both in the Western and Easternempire were in the most deplorable condition, being corrupted with thegrossest ignorance and idolatry; the virgin Mary, the saints, andmiserable relics of every description being worshiped in the place ofJehovah, and superstition reigning with sovereign power over all minds."The Saracen warriors of Mohammed were sent as a scourge upon apostateChristendom, overrunning the very territory where the gospel was firstpreached, and were commissioned to "torment" the false professors ofChristianity.In regard to the kind and the extent of the injury they were to inflict,it is said that "to them it was given that they should not kill them,but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was asthe torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. And in those daysshall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die,and death shall flee from them." The Saracens, as here described underthe symbol of the locusts, sustained a two-fold relation, and thecareful and perfect manner in which the symbols are selected to set itforth is worthy of particular notice. In the first place, the Saracenswere a political body. As such, locusts would fitly represent them. Butthey were also a religious body, and how could that fact be symbolicallycombined with the other? It is done by the locusts' being forbidden toact out their own nature in eating grass and trees, and their beingcommanded instead to "hurt men," thus changing the field of theiroperations into the department of human life--the department that ischosen to symbolically set forth religious events. Thus thepolitico-religious system of the Saracens is accurately set forth. This,also, is nearly as clear as a demonstration that the position alreadytaken concerning the nature and the use of symbolic language is correct.It was given that they should "not kill" men. We have already shown thatkilling men when used symbolically signifies the destruction of thepolitical or ecclesiastical organizations and institutions of society.We could not consistently interpret it as literal slaughter, but as someanalagous destruction. Now, the Saracen power was, as already stated, apolitico-religious system, and its warriors were an infatuated set ofreligious fanatics, described by historians as "carrying the sword inone hand, and the Koran in the other." Thus, they had it in their powerto kill either religiously or politically--destroy either the church orthe empire--but they did neither, for their mission was not to kill, butto "torment." "They made extensive conquests and gained immense numbersof converts. But they did not overthrow the Eastern empire, althoughthey repeatedly attacked and besieged Constantinople, suffering,however, uniform defeat in the attempt. Neither did they destroy thechurch, corrupt and apostate as it was. To idolators and infidels theyput the alternative of the Koran or death; but allowed the Christians toretain their church organization, laying them, however, under severecontributions, and treating them to the ignominious appellation ofChristian dogs." Concerning the character of Mohammed, Gibbon informs usthat "he seldom trampled on a prostrate enemy, and he seems to promise,that on the payment of a tribute, the least guilty of his unbelievingsubjects might be indulged in their worship, or at least in theirimperfect faith" (Vol. V, p. 129), and this, of course, would be thenatural tendency of his followers. The Armenian and the Greek churchessurvived, and still exist in that portion of the world, but they haveindeed been greviously tormented. "The proud Moslem, glorying in hisprophet and religion, has heaped every possible insult and injury uponthe Christians," yet he suffered them to live, but live only for him totorment. Surely the oppressions thus experienced are appropriatelydescribed by the words, "as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketha man." Under such torments the professed Christians might court death,but such is not granted; and still they survive, but only to be"tormented." The Moslem had "the Christian dog" completely under hisfoot.We now turn our attention to the period of time during which theseSaracen locusts were to continue their ravages. It is given as "fivemonths," or one hundred and fifty days. As this description is entirelysymbolic, we must consider the time symbolic also, for time certainlycan be symbolized as well as anything else. It is very appropriate fordays to symbolize years, for they are analagous periods of time; thediurnal revolution of the earth being taken to represent the earth'sannual movement. Such a system of reckoning time was known centuriesago. When Jacob complained to Laban because he had been given Leahinstead of Rachel, "Laban said, It must not be so done in our country,to give the younger before the first-born. Fulfil her _week_, and wewill give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve me yet_seven other years_. And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week ... sevenother years." Gen. 29:26-30. In this case it will be seen that a day wasused to represent a year, since seven days, or one week, representedseven years. When the law was given, Moses recognized the week of sevennatural days, the last day of which was constituted a Sabbath of restfor Israel; but he also instituted a week of seven years, the last yearof which was a sabbatical year of rest unto the land. This last factwill explain such expressions as "forty days, _each day for a year_"(Num. 14:34), and "I have appointed thee each day for a year." Ezek.4:6.This period, then, of "five months," or one hundred and fifty days,would represent symbolically one hundred and fifty years. As beforestated, it was in the year A.D. 612 that Mohammed began to expound hisdoctrines publicly and to gather adherents around his standard, fromwhich point the locusts commenced, although the smoke had been let outof the pit a little previously. For a period of one hundred and fiftyyears from this date, they continued their ravages, until A.D. 762. Thenthey "built Bagdad, which became their settled seat of empire; andhenceforth they became a settled nation, making no further conquests."From that date their power began to decline. But during this one hundredand fifty years they spread over the country like swarms of devouringlocusts. According to the well-known facts of history, "they overranArabia, Palestine, Persia, Egypt, and the northern shores of Africa,from which they passed to the conquest of Portugal and Spain." Thesewere the countries that had been the most oppressed by a priest-riddenchurch and where especially were to be found those "men which have notthe seal of God in their foreheads." Europe was trembling and filledwith apprehension at what her fate might be at the hands of thesefanatic warriors who fought with savage fury, under the promise of theirprophet that, if slain in battle, they should be immediately transportedto Paradise. At the zenith of their power, and confident of success,they passed from Spain into France four hundred thousand strong. Buthere they exceeded their mission. The southern provinces of Francecontained many Christians who had the "seal of God" upon them, and thiscountry became the seat of the Waldenses and Albigenses, of whichinteresting people we shall learn more hereafter. The invading host wasmet at Tours by Charles, grandfather of Charlemagne, who dealt them sucha crushing blow that he was ever afterward designated by the surnameMartel--the Hammer. This battle was one of the fiercest recorded inhistory. The Saracens who had scarcely ever experienced defeat foughtwith the fury of despair, until, according to the accounts of that age,three hundred and seventy-five thousand of their number lay upon thefield of battle with their general. This decisive victory saved Europefrom her threatened subjection to the Mohammedan faith.The next point in the vision to claim our attention is the particulardescription of these locusts. Some of the points mentioned might find aliteral fulfilment in the personal appearance of the Saracens--such asthe crowns signifying the turbans they wore, etc., but we must adherestrictly to the symbolic mode of interpretation and look for theirfulfilment in Saracen character. Their being like war-horses denotestheir warlike disposition. The crowns on their heads signify their greatsuccess and triumphs. Their faces of men and hair like women doubtlesssignify their boldness on the one hand and their effeminateness on theother. Their teeth as the teeth of lions show their ferocity ofcharacter. Their breastplates of iron indicate their invincibility orelse their insensibility to injuries inflicted upon them. The sound oftheir wings like horses and chariots running to battle denotes themultitude and rapidity of their conquests. Their tails like scorpions,containing stings with which to "hurt men"--operating in the religiousworld--symbolize their position as propagators of a false faith. Thusthey are set forth in their two-fold character--as invincible warriorsand as the zealous professors of a delusion, whose sting was like thatof a scorpion when he strikes a man."And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomlesspit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tonguehath his name Apollyon." The following fact of history will explainthis: "The Saracens had their Caliphs, the successors of Mohammed, whounited in themselves the supreme civil, military and ecclesiasticalpowers. They were the high-priests of their religion, the commanders oftheir armies, and the emperors of the nation." This king over themsignifies a succession of rulers, and they are well described as "theangel of the bottomless pit," for that is the very place where thedelusion is said to have originated. Mahomet, as a fallen star, openedthe pit and let out the smoke, and his successors, who grasped his powerand authority, are fitly characterized as angels from the same place,bearing the name Abaddon or Apollyon, which terms both signifyDestroyer.Is not this a wonderful combination of symbols which can be carried outwith surprising accuracy? What human ingenuity could have ever contrivedsuch a marvelous series of events, and described them under suchappropriate symbols? Finally, let me ask, Where in the whole compass ofuniversal history can be found another series of events so perfectlymeeting every requirement of the symbols? In this we must acknowledgethe hand of God.    12. One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more    hereafter.This announcement, that one woe is past, meaning that the period of onehundred and fifty years during which the Saracens were to continue theirconquests has ended, serves an important purpose in enabling us to fixthe chronology of the events described. It proves that they succeed eachother.    13. And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the    four horns of the golden altar which is before God,    14. Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the    four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.    15. And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an    hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third    part of men.    16. And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred    thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.    17. And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat    on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and    brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of    lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and    brimstone.    18. By these three was the third part of men killed, by the    fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out    of their mouths.    19. For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for    their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with    them they do hurt.    20. And the rest of the men which were not killed by these    plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they    should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and    brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear,    nor walk:    21. Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their    sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.At the sounding of the sixth trumpet, or the second woe trumpet, a voiceis heard from the four horns (all the horns) of the golden altar. Thisprobably denotes that the very same altar where incense was offered upto God with the prayers of all saints was now crying out to him forvengeance upon an apostate church. That church had reached the summit ofapostasy and iniquity, the virgin Mary, the saints, and thousands ofidols in the form of miserable relics being worshiped more than God.Because of these abominable idolatries, a voice is heard crying from thegolden altar for the avenging judgments of Heaven, which were theloosing of the four angels bound in the river Euphrates. The symbols ofthis vision are also of peculiar character and drawn from differentdepartments. We have four angels bound in the Euphrates, an immense armyof horsemen, then a large number of horses with heads as of lions, andfire, smoke, and brimstone issuing from their mouths. The horses thusparticularly described are evidently intended to have a definitesymbolical signification, and being objects of nature, they wouldindicate a political or military power. The horsemen, being objects fromhuman life, would point us to some religious body; while the angelssignify the leaders that have control of these agencies. Their beingcommissioned "to slay the third part of men" show that they willoverthrow some of the established institutions of society. We are tolook, therefore, for some politico-religious power that should invadeand overthrow the empire. We are, of course, directed to the Easternempire; for the Western division was subverted under the symbols of thefirst four trumpets. With these specifications before us, we shall haveno difficulty in identifying the power intended--_the Turkish, orOttoman, empire_. Its agreement with the symbolic representations of thevision will be manifest from a statement of the facts of history."The Turks were of Tartar or Scythian origin, from the northern regionsof Asia, whence also the Huns hived upon Europe during the fourth andfifth centuries. The latter passed to the north of the Black sea fromRussia, and swept the regions of the Danube and the Rhine. The Turks,passing to the east of the same, fell upon the empire from that quarter.They took possession of Armenia Major in the ninth century, where theyincreased, and in the space of two hundred years became a formidablepower, being at the end of this period combined into four Sultanies, theheads of which were at Bagdad, Damascus, Aleppo, and Iconium. The firstof these was erected A.D. 1055; the two next A.D. 1079, and the lastA.D. 1080--all of them within twenty-five years, and the three lastwithin two."These four Sultanies are doubtless signified by "the four angels" thatwere bound in the river Euphrates. The Euphrates here is employed as asymbol, not of the Turks themselves--for the horsemen are their symbol,as we shall see--but of the binding of the angels. The use of this wordas a symbol is derived from a fact of history, being the object,according to Herodotus, that kept Cyrus back from entering the city ofBabylon. While the Persian monarch surrounded the walls of that ancientmetropolis of the Babylonian empire, with his army, he was held inrestraint by the river Euphrates; and it was not until he had divertedits waters into an artificial channel that he gained an entrance. So,also, these Sultanies, or leaders of the Turks, were held underrestraint as if bound by the river Euphrates, until the time appointedfor them to go forth on their mission of conquest. Different causes heldthem back. For a long time they were involved in fierce and almostcontinuous wars with the neighboring Tartar tribes on the east and thenorth, and at the same time the Crusaders of Europe were carrying on adetermined war with the Saracens for the possession of the Holy Land.For two centuries the armies of Christendom poured into Syria andPalestine to recover from the hands of the "infidels," as they werecalled, the holy sepulchre and the country that gave birth toChristianity; but when Europe finally abandoned the project, then wentforth the command to loose the four angels, "which were prepared for anhour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part ofman." To kill men symbolically, I have already shown, signifies thedestruction either of an empire as a political body or of the church(that is, the so-called church) as a religious body. The locusts underthe fifth trumpet were to do neither; but the symbolic characters ofthis vision are "to slay the third part of men," by which is set forththe fall and subjugation of the Eastern empire and church; just as,under the fifth trumpet, the fall of the Western empire was described bythe darkening of a third part of the sun, moon, and stars.Before considering the time-prophecy in this vision, we will pass on tonotice a few particulars respecting the horses and their riders. Thehorsemen possessed breastplates of fire, jacinth, and brimstone; whileout of the mouths of the horses proceeded fire, smoke, and brimstone.There is evidently a special design in distinguishing between the horsesand their riders. These symbols, being drawn from different sources--theformer from the natural world and the latter from human life--point outthe two characteristics of the Turks as a politico-religious power. Thesymbolic description of the two is almost identical. The horsemen hadbreastplates of fire, jacinth (purplish or reddish blue), and brimstone.This describes the character of the Turks as a religious system. Out ofthe horses' mouths proceeded fire, smoke, and brimstone, whichrepresents the Moslems as a political power. The only difference is thatthe smoke is substituted for the jacinth, but they very nearly agree incolor. We are thus brought to the conclusion that the political and thereligious power of the Turks is in harmony and agreement with eachother--united in the closest manner possible, like a horse and itsrider, and both animated by the same spirit. That spirit is perhapstheir fierce, fanatical, aggressive, intolerant character.The tails of the horses were like serpents with heads, their power beingin their mouth and in their tails--the one a lion, the other a serpent.It was by the fire, the smoke, and the brimstone that came from theirlion-heads that the third part of men was killed, or their conquestswere made; then with their serpent-like tails would they torment or"hurt" all those who would not adopt the Moslem faith, being in thisrespect like the scorpion locusts. Their lion-heads would denote theirinvincible strength and courage; and their serpent-tails, the tormentingsting inflicted upon those whom they subdued but who would not accepttheir religion. It is not said that the riders were the direct agents ofdestruction--not the Moslem faith as a religion--but it was the horsesthat accomplished the deadly work--the Ottomans as a political body.This was the power that extended conquests and established their empire,although it was accompanied by the religious system, working in perfectharmony.It is said that the "rest of the men which were not killed by theseplagues" repented not. This expression doubtless signifies the Western,or Latin, church. They saw these judgments of the Euphratean horsemen onthe Eastern empire, and the triumph of the Moslem sword and faith (thewoe fell as a judgment upon the Eastern church); still, they continuedas before in their abominable idolatries, by which is probably meanttheir worship of the virgin Mary, saints, relics, and images. There wasno reformation. Error, superstition, and ecclesiastical usurpationprevailed as before.The Turks obtained their first victory over the Christians of theEastern, or Greek, empire in A.D. 1281. Within ten years the Latins whoinhabited Palestine were entirely overthrown (see Gibbon, Vol. VI, p.47), and the way was now clear for Turkish aggression against the Greekempire. Before the end of the century the four Sultanies mentioned werecombined into one consolidated empire under Osman (corrupted byEuropeans into Ottoman) and from him took the name which it stillretains--the Ottoman empire. From the time they were let loose, theTurks continued their aggressions until A.D. 1453, when Constantinoplefell before their victorious arms, and the Eastern empire, with the lastof the Constantines, sunk to rise no more. "The Turkish sword and thereligion of the Koran were enthroned in the Christian metropolis of theRoman emperors; and the proud Moslem had the Christian dog completelyunder his foot." The Ottoman power, however, continued to grow and makenew conquests until the year A.D. 1672, when they conducted a successfulcampaign against Poland, in which forty-eight towns and villages wereceded to the Sultan, with promise of an annual tribute of two hundredand twenty thousand ducats. See Encyclopaedia Britannica, Art. Turkey.This was the last victory they ever gained wherein the Ottoman empireobtained any advantage. A little later they marched against Vienna, butsustained a miserable defeat. "Venice and Russia now declared waragainst Turkey; misfortune followed misfortune; city after city was rentaway from the empire; the Austrians were in possession of almost thewhole of Hungary, the Italians of almost all the Morea." EncyclopaediaBritannica, Art. Turkey. So the power of the Ottomans to extend theirconquests and to add to their empire, ended with the victory over thePoles in A.D. 1672. This fact is even admitted by Demetrius Cantemir,prince of Moldavia, one of their historians, in the following language:"This was the _last_ victory by which any advantage accrued to theOthman state, or any city or province was annexed to the ancient boundsof the empire." In accordance with this statement, the same historianentitles the first part of his history up to the victory over the Polesin 1672 the History of _the Growth of the Othman Empire_, and theremaining portion, _The Decay of the Othman Empire_.Calculating now the time during which these horsemen were prepared toextend their conquests--"an hour, and a day, and a month, and ayear"--we find according to prophetic, or symbolic, time--thirty days ina month, three hundred and sixty in a year--that it signifies threehundred and ninety-one years and fifteen days. This is exactly theperiod of time that elapsed between their first victory in A.D. 1281 andtheir last conquest in A.D. 1672. I can not verify the fifteen days,because no history at my command states the exact days of the month onwhich these victories occurred.One more point of importance must be considered before we conclude thischapter, and that is the continuance of the Ottoman power. The first, orSaracen, woe had power to torment men "five months," or one hundred andfifty years, during which time they continued their ravages. The secondwoe began when the command was given to loose the four angels, or thebeginning of the Ottoman conquests. "An hour, and a day, and a month,and a year," or three hundred and ninety-one years, marked the timeduring which they were "prepared" to extend their conquests. But it isnot stated that the woe itself, or the Ottoman power, would then cease;for it is not represented as ending until after the death and theresurrection of the witnesses (chap. 11:14), immediately following whichthe coming of Christ and the general judgment, or the third woe, isdescribed. Verses 15-18. The Turkish power has made no advance forcenturies, but has been on the decline; yet it will endure for itsallotted time. It furnishes us a way-mark by which we can determine ourposition along the pathway of time; for when it falls, we may restassured that the coming of Christ is imminent.For nearly two centuries it has been the wonder of civilized nations howthat corrupt, tyrannical government, which has been described as a"despotism tempered by assassination," could exist in the increasedlight and onward advance of modern civilization. Concerning its positionin Europe, Judson, in his recent history of Europe in the NineteenthCentury, says: "The Turkish empire has been an element of unrest inEurope. It has long been plain to all that it is not permanent. It hastaken no root. The Turks are merely encamped in Europe; and it is merelya question of time when the last of them must return across theBosphorus." Pp. 269, 270. But Turkey will continue to hold thisterritory of the old Greek empire until the time appointed by the Fatherfor her overthrow. The nations of Europe have often conspired for heroverthrow. This is what is known as the great Eastern Question, whichhas been described by one writer as "the expulsion of the Turk fromEurope, and the scramble for his territory." But it has not yet beenaccomplished, for the very reason doubtless, that it _could not_ takeplace before the resurrection of the witnesses, of which we will speaklater. Judson thus continues his account of the matter: "As soon as thisidea was realized [that Turkish power in Europe must fall] by theWestern nations, in place of the dread of the Turk which had so longbeen part and parcel of European thinking, the question of the disposalto be made of the Turkish possessions became matter of live interest.And this is the Eastern Question. The Greek empire vanished forever whenthe last Constantine fell in 1453. The only problem is one of partition.And the heart of it all is the disposal to be made of Constantinople.That imperial city is a site that, in strong hands, means power andwealth. What shall become of it? Russia early formed designs ofconquest.... The empress Catherine ... had a grand scheme for arestoration of the Greek empire under a Russian prince. Alexander I., atTilsit, planned a partition of the Ottoman empire with Napoleon, but thelatter declined to see Constantinople in Russian hands.'Constantinople,' said he, 'is the empire of the world.' In 1844Nicholas visited England and made guarded suggestions to theprime-minister about the Turkish lands. The Ottoman empire, said he, wasa sick man, nearly at the last extremity.... England declined to planfor a share of the inheritance, and nothing was done. In 1853 Nicholasresumed the subject with the British ambassador at St. Petersburg. Thesick man, he now held, was at the point of death.... But again Englanddeclined and, indeed, the next year went to war with Russia to save thesick man from a premature end at the hands of the would-be administratorof the estate. Another power doubly interested in the future of theTurkish dominions is Austria. That empire has been the traditional enemyof the Turk, and at the end of the seventeenth century was the actualbulwark of Europe against Mohammedan conquest. When the tide of warrolled the other way, Austria was ready to share in the spoils. Twicenear the end of the eighteenth century, was an alliance made betweenRussia and Austria for the partition of Turkey," etc. Pp. 270, 271.Thus, we find that these designs of nations for the overthrow of Turkeyhave so far been overruled; for God will not allow that power to come to"a _premature end_."CHAPTER X.    And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed    with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was    as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:    2. And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his    right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,    3. And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when    he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.    4. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was    about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me,    Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write    them not.    5. And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the    earth lifted up his hand to heaven,    6. And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created    heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the    things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are    therein, that there should be time no longer:    7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he    shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as    he hath declared to his servants the prophets.    8. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again,    and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand    of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.    9. And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the    little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it    shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet    as honey.    10. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate    it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I    had eaten it, my belly was bitter.    11. And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many    peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.In the preceding chapter we had a history of the two great woes thatbefell apostate Christendom. In this chapter we have in contrast aportion of the history of God's true church, to show us that all was notlost even though the Eastern church was greviously tormented by theserpent-tails of the horses and the Western church still continued asbefore in her sorceries, fornications, and abominable idolatries.The symbol is that of an angel from heaven. This is not the seventh, orthe third woe angel, who ushers in the general judgment (chap.11:15-18), but it is a special messenger appearing on earth with theawful message that the end of time is near and that when the seventhangel soon begins to sound the mystery of God shall be finished andthere shall be time no longer. This mighty angel is symbolical of somehuman agencies of distinguished character; for it stands in strikingcontrast with the destructive powers described under the precedingtrumpets. When angels appear on the panoramic scene only in the templeabove, they themselves are not symbolic characters, but only theconductors of the Revelation; but whenever they appear on earth, theyrepresent distinguished agencies among men. In the present vision thesymbol is drawn, not from the natural world, but from the heavenly, andthe scene is laid upon earth; therefore we must look to the history ofthe church to find its fulfilment in some distinguished agenciesappearing for the defence of Christ and his truth. The cloud, rainbow,face as the sun, and feet as pillars of fire, are doubtless intended toset forth their beautiful, benignant character, and to show that theangel is not such an one as those that were bound in the riverEuphrates. This one has the bow of covenant promise upon his head, andhis face shines as the sun.Where, then, in the history of God's true church do we find the agenciescorresponding to the symbol? We find them in the _holy ministry_ that hehas raised up and is now sending forth to preach the pure gospel and todeclare the speedy sounding of the seventh trumpet and the coming of theLord Jesus Christ to earth again.  "Lo, the angel now is standing on the sea and on the land;  How his voice the air is rending as to God he lifts his hand!  What an awful, awful message! Help us, Lord, this truth to see:  When the seventh trumpet thunders, then shall time no longer be.  "One more trumpet yet to summon us before the judgment seat,  Then the time of our frail planet will be said to be complete.  How the wicked will be wailing and the righteous overjoyed  When with fire the heav'ns are burning and the earth shall be destroyed!"This angel "set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on theearth," that his lion-like voice might be heard over all the world. Thisshows that the earth (the Apocalyptic earth--the territory of the Romanempire) was not the only place where the message was to be borne; it wasto be sounded upon the sea, which would indicate its promulgation amongall nations.When his mighty voice sounded, "seven thunders uttered their voices";and when about to record what they said, John was commanded to "seal upthose things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not." Thefact that they were not to be recorded shows that they were toconstitute no part of this Revelation. John evidently thought so atfirst; for they had the appearance of revelation, something clothed withdivine authority, but they were not to be delivered to the church. What,then, were they? The most probable supposition is, that they were thingsthat God for some reason did not choose to have revealed. Their sayingsmay have described events just prior to the end so perfectly as to leavethe world in no doubt respecting the nearness of Christ's second coming;whereas it appears in the Scriptures that God has designed that itshould be a matter of considerable uncertainty, especially to theunsaved. However, we can obtain no satisfactory explanation of thethings uttered by the seven thunders; for we can not identify positivelywhat John was commanded to "seal up."This angel had in his hand a little book that John was required to takeand eat. In advancing and taking the book, John himself becomes an actorin the symbolic scene, the same as was the book and the angel from whosehand he took it. Therefore we must now consider John a symbol ofsomething in this vision. Some of the commentators have supposed thatthis book signified the remainder of the book of Revelation. But Johnwas commanded to _write_ the Revelations, not to _eat_ them. And if heate them, how, then, could they constitute the remainder of the book?Its true signification is undoubtedly the word of God. In making such anapplication we do not necessarily make one book merely a symbol of alarger one, as the Bible is, but of God's _revealed will_, just the sameas the sealed book of chapter V was the symbol of the divine purposes.When we come to explain the resurrection of the witnesses in chapter XI,it will be found that this is the time when the word of God is againtaught in all its purity, being restored for the first time, in itsperfect sense, since the morning time of this dispensation. A greatspiritual famine has for centuries overspread the earth. Since the timethe black horse of the third seal entered on his career, the people havebeen starving for spiritual food. The few crumbs that have been droppedduring the reign of Protestantism have been eagerly gathered up by thespiritually-minded; but, thank God! the time has now arrived when themessengers appear with food from heaven, and the multitudes of earth'sstarving millions can "eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise thename of the Lord God." Joel 2:26. Halleluiah!In taking the book from the hand of the angel and eating it, John becamea symbol of the church, or people of God, who receive the Word from thehand of his ministers. The sweetness of its taste signifies theeagerness with which people receive it and the gladness experienced whenthey first partake of the heavenly manna; while the bitterness resultingtherefrom probably symbolizes the bitter persecutions and oppositions ofwhich it is the occasion. "Yea, and _all_ that will live godly in ChristJesus shall suffer persecution." 2 Tim. 3:12.John was told to "prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, andtongues, and kings," which signifies that the people of God must againbe witnesses of his saving grace throughout all the world. In thebeginning of this dispensation all his people prophesied among thenations; for Christ had said unto them, "Ye shall be _witnesses_ untome, both in Jerusalem, and in Judea, and in Samaria, and unto theuttermost parts of the earth." Acts 1:8. So, also, in this evening timewe go forth again on the same mission, inspired by the soon-coming ofour Savior."Even so come, Lord Jesus."CHAPTER XI.    And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel    stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the    altar, and them that worship therein.    2. But the court which is without the temple leave out, and    measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy    city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.    3. And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall    prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in    sackcloth.    4. These are the two olive-trees, and the two candlesticks    standing before the God of the earth.    5. And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their    mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt    them, he must in this manner be killed.    6. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days    of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to    blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they    will.The two principal objects of this vision is the city of Jerusalem withits holy temple and worshipers, and two witnesses prophesying for twelvehundred and sixty days. These are not objects from the natural world;therefore we may conclude that we have not here to do with politicalevents, while the character of the symbols point us with certainty tothe history of the church.There is a possibility that the speaker here is not the angel of thepreceding chapter; for the words in verse 1 "and the angel stood" may bean interpolation, they being found in very few manuscripts. See theRevised Version and the Emphatic Diaglott, Greek and English. If not,then he must be the angel through whom the Revelation was given. Chap.1:1; 22:8. Whether the angel is the same as the one in the precedingchapter or not, it is evident that that series of prophecy ends withchapter 10, and that he here introduces a new line of events runningover the entire gospel dispensation[7], in which John as an active agentin the panoramic vision still stands as a symbol of the people of God,who, in striking contrast with the blind devotees of an apostate church,are commanded to "measure the temple of God, and the altar, and themthat worship therein." The temple with its altar and court and the holycity itself, here used as symbols, are representative of somethinganalagous, and refer to no other than the outward, visible church of Godwith its doctrines and worshipers. Its measurement is designed to showhow far it conforms to the true church; while the rod is a symbol of therevealed will of God, by which the measurement is brought as to a truestandard.[Footnote 7: This statement may seem to conflict with the classificationof events in the "Diagram of the Revelation," where this prophecy istreated, not as an independent series, but as part of a compound seriesbeginning with chapter 8 and ending with chapter 11. For thusclassifying it my reason is, that the line of prophecy beginning withchapter 8 introduces the seven trumpets, and therefore the series is notcomplete until the seventh trumpet is given, which event concludes theline of truth given in the present chapter.]By noticing briefly the arrangement of the temple and the purposes towhich the different apartments were put, we shall be able to understandbetter the design of this vision. The temple proper consisted of twoapartments. In the first stood the altar of incense and other things; inthe second, the ark of the covenant, etc. The priests officiated in thefirst apartment regularly, while into the second went the high-priestalone once every year. This, Paul informs us, was a shadow of a greaterand more perfect tabernacle. Heb. 9:1-11; 8:2. The altar that ismentioned and that John was to measure is a symbol of the great cardinaldoctrine of the church--the atonement and mediation of Christ. He wasthe sacrifice made for sin, through whom we have redemption and accessunto God. John was also told to measure those who worshiped therein--theofficiating ministers in the sanctuary--who were thus made symbols ofthe ministers and the teachers in the church. To measure the temple ofGod, then, was to ascertain the great doctrines taught in the Scripturesand symbolized by the sanctuary, the altar, and the priests; namely, thedoctrines of the New Testament concerning God as the supreme lawgiver,the atonement of Jesus Christ as the only ground for justification, andthe ministers whom he appointed to officiate in his church.These are the great principles corrupted by the Papacy. Instead of theone supreme God, we find another in the temple of God, "showing himselfthat _he_ is God." Christ was not recognized as the supreme and onlyhead of the church; but instead the Pope claimed the title of universalhead and legislated supreme, while his decrees and anathemas wereaccepted as from Jehovah himself. Christ was not regarded as the onlymediator between God and man, but the virgin Mary and the saints wereexalted to share the mediatorial throne, the mother being more honoredthan the Son. Penance, counting of beads, works of supererogation, werebelieved to be more effectual in obtaining forgiveness of sin thanliving faith in our only Redeemer. Finally, in place of the humbleministers of Christ whom he appointed to officiate in his church, therewere haughty lords and rulers, making the most extravagant claims topower and authority over the minds and consciences of men. The court ofthe temple was the space outside of the sanctuary occupied by thecongregation while the worship within was conducted by the priests. Johnwas told to leave this out and measure it not; for it was given to theGentiles to tread under foot, or profane, for the space of forty and twomonths, or twelve hundred and sixty days. In the estimation of a Jew,the Gentiles were all idolaters and outside of God's covenant favor. Asa symbol, then, we are to understand that the great body of worshipersthus brought to view are not the true children of God at all, but are,as it were, uncircumcised, idolatrous Gentiles, having no connectionwhatever with the great head of the church and no part in the covenantof his mercy. The whole city of Jerusalem was to be given over to thisprofane multitude and by them desecrated for forty-two months, denotingthat this great company of worshipers was to constitute the visible,external church during the period specified. It is as though the city ofJerusalem were occupied by the idolatrous heathen, and the Jews drivenout as aliens. These Gentiles, then, were to constitute the one great(so-called) universal church--the Church of Rome.Forty and two months, or twelve hundred and sixty days, are symbolictime, signifying twelve hundred and sixty years, during which time thepower of apostasy was to reign supreme over the minds of men. The sameperiod is also referred to frequently in subsequent chapters. It isnecessary, then, for us to ascertain at what period of time the churchwas given over to a profane multitude that was not the true people ofGod. Some have supposed that this must refer to the time when Poperybecame fully established. Such, however, could not be the case (althoughthe time-period includes that important event); for the power ofapostasy was greatly developed centuries before the final supremacy ofthe Popes was established, and was necessary in order to prepare the wayfor their exaltation. The Popes obtained their authority by degrees. InA.D. 606 the emperor Phocas conferred the title "Universal Bishop" uponthe Pope of Rome. In A.D. 756 the Pope became a temporal sovereign. Yetthe power of Papal usurpation did not reach the summit until the reignof the impious Hildebrand, who succeeded to the Popedom in A.D. 1073,under the title of Gregory VII. But according to the symbols before us,we must look for a period not so much when the Popes were enabled todefinitely enforce their arrogant claims, as when the ministry becamecorrupted and when the inhabitants of the city, or the devotees of thevisible church, became a profane multitude entirely estranged from thecovenant of promise. The usurpations of the ministry that accompaniedthis great change in the external church have been considered alreadyunder the symbols of chapter VI. This mighty transformation to a churchcontaining nothing but uncircumcised Gentiles was fully accomplishedduring the latter half of the third century, from which date we mustlook for the true disciples of the Lord as entirely separate from thehierarchy. A few quotations from standard and ecclesiastical historieswill show this important epoch in the rise of the Papacy that plungedthe world into almost universal apostasy."The living church retiring gradually within the lonely sanctuary of afew solitary hearts, an external church was substituted in its place,and all its forms were declared to be of divine appointment. Salvationno longer flowing from the Word, which was henceforward put out ofsight, the priests affirmed that it was conveyed by means of the formsthey had themselves invented, and that no one could obtain it but bythese channels.... The doctrine of the church and the necessity of itsvisible unity, which had begun to gain ground in the _third century_,favored the pretensions of Rome." D'Aubigne's History of theReformation, Book I, Chap. 1."At the end of the third century almost half the inhabitants of theRoman empire, and of several neighboring countries, professed the faithof Christ. About this time endeavors to preserve a unity of belief, andof church discipline, occasioned numberless disputes among those ofdifferent opinions, and led to the establishment of an ecclesiasticaltyranny." Encyclopaedia of Religious Knowledge.Concerning the Roman diocese, the Encyclopaedia Britannica says, "Beforethe termination of the third century the office was held to be of suchimportance that its succession was a matter of interest to ecclesiasticsliving in distant sees." Vol. XIX, p. 488."Almost proportionate with the extension of Christianity was thedecrease in the church of vital piety. A philosophizing spirit among thehigher, and a wild monkish superstition among the lower orders, fasttook the place in the third century of the faith and humility of thefirst Christians. Many of the clergy became very corrupt, andexcessively ambitious. In consequence of this there was an awfuldefection of Christianity." Marsh's Church History, p. 185."We have found it almost necessary to separate, and indeed widely todistinguish the events of the two first, from those of the thirdcentury, for nearly at this point we are disposed to place the FIRSTCRISIS in the internal history of the church." Waddington's ChurchHistory."This season of external prosperity was improved by the ministers of thechurch for the exertion of new claims, and the assumption of powers withwhich they had not been previously invested. At first these claims weremodestly urged, and gradually allowed; but they laid a foundation forthe encroachments which were afterwards made upon the rights of thewhole Christian community, and for lofty pretensions to the right ofsupremacy and spiritual dominion.... Several alterations in the form ofchurch government appear to have been introduced during the thirdcentury. Some degree of pomp was thought necessary.... The externaldignity of the ministers of religion was accompanied by a still greaterchange in its discipline.... Many of the Jewish and Pagan proselytes ...languished in the absence of ceremonies which were naturally adapted tothe taste of the unreflecting multitude, while the insolent infidelhaughtily insisted upon the inanity of a religion which was notmanifested by an external symbol or decoration. In order to accommodateChristianity to these prejudices, a number of rites were instituted; andwhile the dignified titles of the Jewish priesthood were through acompliance with the prejudices of that people, conferred upon theChristian teachers, many ceremonies were introduced which coincided withthe genius of Paganism. The true gospels were taught by sensible images,and many of the ceremonies employed in celebrating the heathen mysterieswere observed in the institutions of Christ, which soon in their turnobtained the name of mysteries, and served as a melancholy precedent forfuture innovations, and as a foundation for that structure of absurdityand superstition which deformed and disgraced the church." Rutter'sHistory of the Church, pp. 52-56.This "season of external prosperity" mentioned by Rutter began with theaccession of Gallienus to the imperial throne in A.D. 260. Up to thistime the hand of persecution had been raised against the church almostincessantly; but from 260 until the reign of Diocletian persecutionalmost ceased, during this space of about forty years. But this periodalso marked the greatest decline in spiritual things and a marvelousdevelopment of the hierarchy. Speaking of the bishop of Rome in thesetimes, Dowling says, "He far surpassed all his brethren in themagnificence and splendor of the church over which he presided; in theriches of his revenues and possessions; in the number and variety of hisministers; in his credit with the people; and in his sumptuous andsplendid manner of living." History of Romanism, p. 34.Ammianus Marcellinus, a Roman historian, who lived during these times,adverting to this subject, says: "It was no wonder to see those who wereambitious of human greatness, contending with so much heat and animosityfor that dignity, because when they had obtained it, they were sure tobe enriched by the offerings of the matrons, and of appearing abroad ingreat splendor, of being admired for their costly coaches, and sumptuousfeasts, outdoing sovereign princes in the expenses of their table." Thisled Proetextatus, a heathen, who was praefect of the city, to say, "Makeme bishop of Rome, and I'll be a Christian too!"Speaking of the period now under consideration, Eusebius, "the father ofchurch history," "mentions one Paul, who was at this time bishop ofAntioch; who lived in luxury and licentiousness, and who was a teacherof erroneous doctrines, and usurped so great authority that the peoplefeared to venture to accuse him. In the conclusion of the same chapterin which this is found, he shows that after a general council was heldat Antioch, this Paul was excommunicated and robbed of his bishopric bythe bishops of Rome and Italy; from this it appears that they possessedan authority still greater than that usurped by Paul." The following arehis words: "Paul, therefore, having thus fallen from the episcopate,together with the true faith as already said, Domnus succeeded inadministration of the church at Antioch. But Paul being unwilling toleave the building of the church, an appeal was made to the emperorAurelian, who decided most equitably on the business, ordering thebuilding to be given up to those whom the Christian bishops of Italy andRome should write." Eccl. History, Book VII, Chap. 30. The EncyclopaediaBritannica says that this council at which Paul was excommunicated washeld "probably in the year 268," and that "Paul continued in his officeuntil the year 272, when the city was taken by the emperor Aurelian, whodecided in person that the church-building belonged to the bishop whowas in epistolary communication with the bishops of Rome and Italy."Vol. XVIII, p. 429.The above extracts show not only the development of error in the church,but also the great power already obtained by the hierarchy. Geo. Fishersays, "The accession of Constantine [A.D. 312] found the church sofirmly organized under the hierarchy that it could not lose its identityby being absolutely merged in the state." History of the ChristianChurch, p. 99.In the year A.D. 270 Anthony, an Egyptian, the founder of the monasticinstitution, fixed his abode in the deserts of Egypt and formed monksinto organized bodies. "Influenced by these eminent examples [Anthony,Hilarion, et al.] immense multitudes betook themselves to the desert,and innumerable monasteries were fixed in Egypt, Ethiopia, Lybia andSyria. Some of the Egyptian abbots are spoken of as having had five,seven, or even ten thousand monks under their personal direction; andthe Thebias, as well as certain spots in Arabia, are reported to havebeen literally crowded with solitaries. Nearly a hundred thousand of allclasses, it is said, were at one time to be found in Egypt.... Althoughthe enthusiasm might be at a lower ebb in one country than in another,it _actually affected the church universal_, so far as the extantmaterials of ecclesiastical history enables us to trace its rise andprogress.... The more rigid and heroic of the Christian anchoretsdispensed with all clothing except a rug, or a few palm leaves round theloins. Most of them abstained from the use of water for ablution; nordid they usually wash or change the garments they had once put on; thus_St. Anthony_ [the founder of this order] bequeathed to Athanasius askin in which his sacred person had been wrapped for half a century.They also allowed their beards and nails to grow, and sometimes becameso hirsute, as to be actually mistaken for hyaenas or bears." Hist. ofRomanism, pp. 88, 89. Reader, what was the condition of the so-calledchurch in A.D. 270 that could make the introduction of such abominationspossible? Although many more historical quotations on this point mightbe added, I will conclude with the two following extracts from JosephMilner."We shall, for the present, leave Anthony propagating the monasticdispositions, and extending its influence not only into the nextcentury, but for many ages after, and conclude this view of the state ofthe _third century_, with expressing our regret that the faith and loveof the gospel received toward the close of it a dreadful blow from theencouragement of this unchristian practise." Cen. III, Chap. 20."Moral, and philosophical, and monastic instructions will not effect formen what is to be expected from evangelical doctrine. And if the faithof Christ was so much declined (and its decayed state _ought to be datedfrom about the year 270_), we need not wonder that such scenes asEusebius hints at without any circumstantial details took place in theChristian world." Cent. IV, Chap. 1.After reading the foregoing statements of historians, the reader will, Ibelieve, agree with me that the year 270 is a consistent date to markthe time when the visible external church was wholly given over to theprofane multitude of uncircumcised, idolatrous Gentiles to tread underfoot. Measuring forward the allotted period of twelve hundred and sixtyyears brings us to the exact date of the first Protestant creed (_theAugsburg Confession_) in A.D. 1530. We must point to this date both forthe end of Rome's universal spiritual supremacy and for the rise ofProtestantism. D'Aubigne, in his History of the Reformation, when hecomes to this period, says: "The conflicts hitherto described have beenonly partial; we are entering upon a new period, that of generalbattles. Spires (1529) and Ausburg (1530) are names that shine forthwith more immortal glory than Marathon, Pavia, or Marengo. Forces thatup to the present time were separate, are now uniting into one energeticband." Book XVIII, Chap. 1. "The first two books of this volume containthe most important epochs of the reformation--the Protest of Spires, andthe Confession of Augsburg.... I determined on bringing the reformationof Germany and German Switzerland to the _decisive epochs_ of 1530 and1531. The history of the reformation, properly so called, is then in myopinion almost complete in those countries. The work of faith has thereattained its apogee: that of conferences, of interims, of diplomacybegins.... The movement of the sixteenth century has there made itseffort. I said from the very first, It is the history of the reformationand not of Protestantism that I am relating." D'Aubigne, Preface to Vol.V.The next important object in the vision is the "two witnesses" thatprophecied in sackcloth. From the description given, it would appear atfirst that these witnesses were active intelligent agents; and as such,belonging to the department of human life, they would symbolize thechurch, the number two denoting the ministry and the people of God. Butthe church is already symbolized in this chapter, the angel representingthe ministry, as in the preceding chapter, and John, who is clearly oneof the symbolic agents in this vision, representing the church;therefore the two witnesses must be representative of something else.Since the actions ascribed to them are drawn from the department ofhuman life, it is evident that their interpretation is to be found inconnection with the affairs of the church. By way of explanation, verse4 represents them to be "the two olive-trees, and the two candle-sticksstanding before the God of the earth," although it is not stated thatany olive-trees and candle-sticks were shown in this prophetic vision.In this reference is made to the fourth chapter of Zechariah, where twoolive-trees are represented as standing one on each side of a goldencandle-stick, distilling into it their oil for light. When asked for thesignification of the two olive-trees and the candlestick, the angelanswered, "This is the _Word_ of the Lord ... by my _Spirit_, saith theLord." Ver. 6. That the Word of God and the Spirit of God are specialwitnesses is proved by many texts. Jesus said, "Search the Scriptures... they are they which _testify_ of me." John 6:39. "This gospel of thekingdom shall be preached in all the world for a _witness_ unto allnations." Mat. 24:14. "The Holy Ghost also is a _witness_." Heb. 10:15."The Spirit itself beareth _witness_." Rom. 8:16. "It is the Spirit thatbeareth _witness_." 1 John 5:6. It is the Spirit acting in conjunctionwith the Word of God that gives spiritual life, through regeneration,unto men, and which opens their understanding that they may know thethings of God. 2 Cor. 2:9-15.God may have given us the explanation that these two witnesses were thesame as the olive-trees and the candle-sticks to prevent our being ledastray with the supposition that they were actually intelligent agents.(I speak humanly.) Accepting this statement, the actions of thesewitnesses here described can be explained only by the figure of speechknown as Personification, by which it is proper, under certainconditions, to attribute life, action, and intelligence to inanimateobjects. Thus, the blood of Abel is said to have cried from the ground.Gen. 4:9, 10. "The stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out ofthe timber shall answer it." Hab. 2:11. "The hire of the laborers ...which is of you kept back by fraud crieth: and the cries ... are enteredinto the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth." Jas. 5:4. "The mountains and thehills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees ofthe field shall clap their hands." Isa. 55:12. I would not attempt tovary from the general order and explain these two witnesses by thefigure of personification, were it not for the fact that the twoolive-trees and the two candle-sticks are here given as a means ofexplanation; and trees and candle-sticks, we know, are not active,intelligent agents, and consequently do not necessarily symbolize such.To "hurt" the Word and Spirit of God is to oppose, corrupt, or perverttheir testimony and to turn people away from them; and the judgments ofHeaven are pronounced in that Word and by that Spirit against such asturn away from the truth unto fables. They shall have their part in thelake that burns with fire and brimstone. Rev. 20:15; 22:8. It is alsosaid of them: "These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in thedays of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them toblood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will."This indicates the fact that these were God's own special witnesses sentin his name and by his authority, as were the prophets of old. Elijahshut up heaven by prayer; Moses called down the plagues upon Egypt; andthese were God's attestations that they were his divinely commissionedservants. So these two witnesses had power to shut heaven and to smitethe earth with plagues, not literally, but herein is symbolically setforth the fact that they were God's appointed agents, even thoughdespised and rejected, like Elijah in the midst of apostate Israel andMoses amid idolatrous Egypt, yet, like them, with the seal of Heavenupon their ministry.In the beginning of this dispensation these two witnesses were thevicars of Christ in his church upon earth. The word of God and theSpirit of God were the Governors of his people. At that time they hadperfect freedom of action among the children of God; but when theapostasy arose, the governing power of the Word and Spirit of God in thechurch was gradually usurped by the rising hierarchy, until, finally,men had entire authority in what was called the visible church. This wasbrought about when, to quote Mosheim's words, the bishops grasped thepower and authority "to prescribe authoritative rules of faith andmanners." D'Aubigne explains it thus: "Salvation no longer flowing fromthe _Word_, which was henceforward put out of sight, the priestsaffirmed that it was conveyed by means of the forms they had themselvesinvented, and that no one could attain it except by these channels....Christ communicated to the apostles, and these to the bishops, theunction of the _Holy Spirit_; and this Spirit is to be procured only inthat order of succession.... Faith in the heart no longer connected themembers of the church, and they were united by means of bishops,archbishops, popes, mitres, canons and ceremonies." History of theReformation, Book I, Chap. 1. Thus, the Word and Spirit of God as thetrue vicars of Christ in his church were finally expelled from what waslooked upon as the one visible church, and with them the true worshipersalso were driven out; and nothing remained in the public view except thegreat company of profane idolaters already referred to. The same isreferred to in a subsequent chapter as the flight of the true churchinto the wilderness, where, hidden from sight, she had a place preparedof God for twelve hundred and sixty days. So after all, God had a truechurch during the Dark Ages--a people that stood in opposition to theabounding corruption and iniquity of the church of Rome; a people thatrejected the established hierarchy and gave heed to the Word and Spiritof God. But their numbers were so few, comparatively, that theoperations of the two witnesses were greatly limited; hence they arerepresented as being clothed in sackcloth, a symbol of melancholy andmourning.Among those who opposed the teachings of that apostate church were theCathari, Poor Men of Lyons, Lombards, Albigenses, Waldenses, Vaudois,etc. The name Waldenses and Albigenses have frequently been looselyapplied to all the bands of people that passed under various titles indifferent countries and that opposed the doctrines and ecclesiasticaltyranny of Rome. Speaking of the twelfth century, Bowling says: "Thereexisted at that dark period, when 'all the world wondered after thebeast,' a numerous body of the disciples of Christ, who took the NewTestament for their guidance and direction in all the affairs ofreligion, rejecting the doctrines and commandments of men. Their appealwas from the decisions of councils, and the authority of popes,cardinals, and prelates, to the law and the testimony--the words ofChrist and his holy apostles." History of Romanism, p. 272. Egbert, amonkish writer of that age, speaking of them, says that he had oftendisputed with these heretics, "a sort of people," he adds, "who are verypernicious to the Catholic faith, which, like moths, they corrupt anddestroy. They are armed," says he, "_with the words of Scripture_ whichin any way seem to favor their sentiments, and with these they know howto defend their errors, and to oppose the Catholic truth. They areincreased to great multitudes throughout all countries, to the greatdanger of the church [of Rome]."For lack of space, an extensive history of these interesting people cannot be given; but a few references to them by their most inveterateenemies, the Papists themselves, are of such importance that I can notpass them by unnoticed. The testimony given by Evervinus, a zealousCatholic, in a letter he wrote to the celebrated Bernard, at thebeginning of the twelfth century, relative to the doctrine and mannersof these so-called _heretics_, is exceedingly valuable. Says he: "Therehave lately been some heretics discovered among us, near Colonge [sic:Cologne], of whom some have, with satisfaction returned again to thechurch. One that was a bishop among them, and his companions, openlyopposed us, in the assembly of the clergy and laity, the lord-archbishophimself being present, with many of the nobility, maintaining theirheresy from _the words of Christ and his apostles_. But, finding thatthey made no impression, they desired that a day might be fixed, uponwhich they might bring along with them men skilful in their faith,promising to return to the church, provided their teachers were unableto answer their opponents; but that otherwise, they would rather diethan depart from their judgment."Upon this declaration, having been admonished to repent, and three daysallowed them for that purpose, they were seized by the people, in theirexcess of zeal, _and committed to the flames_! and, what is mostastonishing, they came to the stake and endured the torment not onlywith patience, but even with joy. In this case, O holy father, were Ipresent with you, I should be glad to ask you, how these members ofSatan could persist in their heresy with such constancy and courage asis rarely to be found among the most religious in the faith of Christ?"He then proceeds: "Their heresy is this: They say that the church (ofChrist) is only among themselves, because they alone follow the ways ofChrist, and imitate the apostles, not seeking secular gains.... Whereasthey say to us, 'Ye join house to house, and field to field, seeking thethings of this world.'... They represent themselves as the poor ofChrist's flock, who have no certain abode, fleeing from one city toanother, like sheep in the midst of wolves, enduring persecution withthe apostles and martyrs: though strict in their manner oflife--_abstemious, laborious, devoted, and holy_ ... living as men whoare not of the world. But you, say they, lovers of the world, have peacewith the world, because ye are in it. False apostles, who adulterate theword of God, seeking their own things, have misled you and yourancestors. Whereas, we and our fathers, having been born and brought upin the apostolic doctrine, have continued in the grace of Christ, andshall continue so to the end.... They affirm that the apostolic dignityis corrupted by indulging itself in secular affairs, while it sits[professedly] in St Peter's chair. They do not hold with the baptism ofinfants, alleging that passage of the gospel, 'He that believeth and isbaptized shall be saved.' They place no confidence in the intercessionof saints and all things observed in the church, which have not beenestablished by Christ himself, or his apostles, they pronounce to besuperstitious. They do not admit of any purgatory fire after death,contending, that the souls of men, as soon as they depart out of thebodies, do enter into rest or punishment ... by which means they makevoid all the prayers and oblations of the faithful for the deceased....I must inform you also, that those of them who have returned to ourchurch, tell us that they had great numbers of their persuasion,scattered almost everywhere.... And as for those who were burnt, they,in defense they made of themselves, told us that this heresy had been_concealed from the time of the martyrs_ [by which is meant the earlyperiod of Christianity] and that it had existed in Greece and othercountries."Although Bernard began a strenuous opposition to these people, still hetestifies: "If you ask them of their faith, nothing can be moreChristian-like; and if you observe their conversation, nothing can bemore blameless, and what they speak they make good by their actions....As to life and manners, he circumvents no man, overreaches no man, doesviolence to no man. He fasts much and eats not the bread of idleness;but works with his hands for his support."Claudius, archbishop of Turin, who joined in hunting and persecutingthem to the death, writes, "Their heresy excepted, they generally live apurer life than other Christians." Again, "In their lives they areperfect, irreproachable, and without reproach among men, addictingthemselves with all their might to the service of God."The sum and substance of their offense is mentioned by Cassini, aFranciscan friar, where he says, "That ALL THE ERRORS of these Waldensesconsisted in this, that they denied the church of Rome to be the holymother church, and _would not obey her traditions_."In conclusion I quote from the celebrated Roman Catholic historianThuanus. He states their tenets as follows: "That the church of Rome,because it renounced the true faith of Christ, WAS THE WHORE OF BABYLON... that consequently _no obedience was to be paid to the Pope_, or tothe bishops who maintain her errors; that a monastic life was the sinkand dungeon of the church, the vows of which [relating to celibacy] werevain ... that the orders of the priesthood were marks of the great beastmentioned in the Apocalypse; that the fire of purgatory, the solemnmass, the consecration days of churches, the worship of saints, andpropitiations for the dead, were the devices of Satan." Lib. VI, Sec.16, Lib. XXVII. The chief offense of these so-called heretics seems tohave been that they denounced the Pope as "Antichrist" and the apostatechurch of Rome as "the Babylonish harlot."    7. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast    that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against    them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.    8. And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great    city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also    our Lord was crucified.    9. And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations    shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall    not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.    10. And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them,    and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because    these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.    11. And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God    entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great    fear fell upon them which saw them.    12. And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them,    Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and    their enemies beheld them.At the expiration of the twelve hundred and sixty years the scenechanges. The prophecy of the witnesses in their sackcloth state, hiddenaway from sight in the wilderness, ends, and they are now brought outinto public view--but only to be killed. Their slaughter takes place atthe hands of the beast. When we come to consider chapter XIII, we shallsee that the Papacy is described as a beast reigning for forty-twomonths, or twelve hundred and sixty years, after which time anotherbeast possessing great power and authority appears on the scene. Thissecond beast is Protestantism, and through it the murder of the twowitnesses at the close of the Papal supremacy in the vision before uswas effected.It would seem, by the similarity of statement that the beast "ascendethout of the bottomless pit," that the slaughter of the witnesses waseffected by the Papal beast (chap. 17:7, 8); but the Mohammedan delusionalso is said to have proceeded from "the bottomless pit." Chap. 9:1, 2.The expression _bottomless pit_ is doubtless used merely to signify thesource of certain powers in contradistinction to the heavenly sourcefrom which others proceeded. Although the Papal beast is said to haveoriginated in the bottomless pit, the second beast also doubtlessproceeded from the same source, for he possessed many of thecharacteristics of the former, and caused the earth to worship the firstbeast, as explained in chapter 13. That he was not of heavenly origin isshown by the statement that he came up "out of the earth." Chap. 13:11.But the direct proof that it was the Protestant beast, and not the Papalbeast--although the same expression as to its origin is used concerningit--that slew the two witnesses, is found in the fact that the reign ofthe first, or Papal, beast was limited to forty two months (chap. 13:5),corresponding to the twelve hundred and sixty years in which thewitnesses prophesied in the vision before us; while it was after the_close_ of this period, at the time when the second, or Protestant,beast arose (chap. 13:11), that the witnesses were slain.To many this may seem a hard saying; but I request that the matter begiven the most careful attention in the light of prophecy and divinetruth. It is true that the Sixteenth Century Reformation at firstbrought the witnesses out of the wilderness of seclusion where they hadremained during the long night of Romanism and exhibited them to thepublic view; but when thus placed upon exhibition, they were soon robbedentirely of their position as the Vicars, or Governors, of God's church.Since creed and sect-making first began, the Word and Spirit have notpossesed governing power and authority in Protestantism; but men haveusurped that place and prescribed authoritative rules of faith andpractise for the people. The principles of Higher Criticism have so farpervaded the realm of sectarian theology that a vast number of theclergy no longer regard the Bible as the inspired word of God to man,but simply as a remarkable piece of religious literature recording thenatural development of the religious consciousness among a peculiarlysensitive race of people. Protestantism certainly has placed the Bibleon the dissecting table and dismembered it in a manner wholly unknownbefore. While Protestants will not for a moment allow the blessed Bookto be hidden out of sight--put "into graves"--still they will not grantit that place it should occupy as the sole discipline of faith, so it isa dead letter to them. That all-glorious doctrine of Bible _unity_,which fills the whole New Testament, strikes a deathblow to all thecarnal divisions and institutions of sectarianism; and so with oneaccord they unite in _fighting it_. "Oh, the good old blessed Bible! wecould not do without it," say they; yet, as everybody knows, they aregoverned by the discipline and laws that they or their representativeshave formulated. Thus, the Word and Spirit of God are brought under thepublic gaze, only to be treated with such indignity in God's sight, andkilled; while infidels look on, and tauntingly remark, "Either thereligion of to-day is no Christianity, or the Word of God is a lie."In the beginning of this dispensation the church of God not onlyconsisted of all those who were spiritual, but constituted a visible,organic body as well, made up of numerous local congregations that wereseparate in the management of their internal affairs, yet interrelatedwith each other, and were directed by humble pastors, who were, inreference to each other, _equal_. The Word of God was their onlydiscipline, and the Spirit of God, their great Teacher and Guide. Thus,the two witnesses were active in their official position, in the publicview, as the Vicars or Governors of the church of God on earth. When,however, men usurped the place of these Vicars by ignoring the Spiritand rejecting the Word and making their own rules of faith, the effectwas a national hierarchy--the church of Rome, which for twelve hundredand sixty years stood in the public view. Yet the two witnesses werestill alive, though driven into obscurity and "clothed in sackcloth";for they still acted in their official position in the congregations ofthe medieval Christians already referred to, who resisted the doctrinesof men and clung tenaciously to the simple, primitive form of churchgovernment and allowed the Spirit and Word authority supreme.But during the Protestant era Christians the world over becameidentified with the various sects, hence were representing to the worldthe beast power instead of the true church. Thus, during the Protestantperiod, the church of God, _in its organic form_, was not representedanywhere on earth; for its members were scattered among those who were"worshiping the beast and his image." Hence the two witnesses, duringthis era, had no place to operate in their official capacity as theGovernors of God's church and are therefore represented as slain. Thegovernment of Protestant sects is not effected by the Word and Spirit;for the institutions themselves are of human origin, and men are theirlaw-makers and governors.When the two witnesses are deprived of their governing power and therules and disciplines of men substituted in their place, a decline intoworldliness is the invariable result. This has been the case repeatedlyin sectarianism. In fact, Protestantism, as a component part of thatgreat city Babylon, has so given herself over to "revellings,banquetings, and abominable idolatries," that a voice from heaven hasdeclared her to be "the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foulspirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird." Chap. 18:2.Witness the shows, festivals, frolics, grab-bag parties, kissing bees,cake-walk lotteries, and other abominations unnumbered, that are carriedon without shame, under the guise of religion, in the high places ofthis modern Babylon! If the Word of God with the full power andauthority of his Spirit could be turned in upon them, it would be likethe torment of fire; but no, it is dead to them, and they rejoice andmake merry and continue in "the same excess of riot."In the description before us, this city of sectarianism in which the twowitnesses are slain is "spiritually [or mystically] called Sodom andEgypt, where also our Lord was crucified." It is a mystical Sodom, Egyptand Jerusalem--a Sodom for wickedness and lewdness, an Egypt for thecaptivity and oppression of God's people, and a Jerusalem for thecrucifying of the Son of God afresh and putting him to an open shame.Thus, this city mystically combines the wickedness of the three mostwicked places on earth--Sodom, Egypt, and Jerusalem. These facts weshall notice more particularly hereafter.But these two witnesses were not always to remain trampled under foot inthe streets of great Babylon; for a time came when "the spirit of lifefrom God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and greatfear fell upon them which saw them." In this is portrayed thereformation which is now taking place in the world. About the year A.D.1880 God began to raise up holy men and women whom he commissioned topreach the everlasting gospel of the kingdom again; and they went forthin his name calling upon God's people everywhere to come "out of allplaces where they had been scattered in the cloudy and dark day" (Ezek.34:12) and to take up their abode in the one true church of JesusChrist, his body, independent of all sectarianism and the creeds anddisciplines of men. In this assembly of the faithful, gathered out ofall nations, no man nor set of men attempts to form laws or regulationsfor the supervision of spiritual affairs; but with one consent theyhumbly bow before the only true Lawgiver (Jas. 4:12), and say, "Thegovernment shall be upon his shoulder" (Isa. 9:6); and the Word andSpirit of God have perfect control of his saints. Halleluiah! They canpreach, teach, and believe every word of truth placed in the SacredVolume, without a conference or discipline of men forbidding. Standingupon this apostolic platform of eternal truth, they hurl the thunders ofdivine judgment against the hidden works of darkness, causing thegraceless devotees of fallen Babylon to quake with fear and to "gnawtheir tongues for pain."After the resurrection of these witnesses, a voice from heaven is heard,saying, "Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; andtheir enemies beheld them." This ascension to heaven in the presence oftheir enemies, which according to this chapter occurred before the endof time, has reference undoubtedly to their great exaltation. "Thygreatness is grown, and _reacheth unto heaven_." Dan. 4:22. We see thatin this text a similar expression signifies great exaltation. So thiswork is destined to assume such proportions that the people of earth mayhave the privilege of seeing the truth. In the preceding chapter John,as a symbol of the church at this time, under the living ministrysymbolized by the rain-bow angel, was told that he "must prophesy againbefore many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings." Verse 11.The signification of the time-period of three days and a half claims ourattention next. According to the foregoing explanation, it will be seenthat the writer applies it as three centuries and a half, or threehundred and fifty years--from A.D. 1530 to A.D. 1880. It will benecessary to adduce strong reasons for thus applying it. In the firstplace, the time-prophecies of the Bible are by no means confined to theyear-day manner of interpretation. Many times in the Old Testament theexpression occurs, "And it shall come to pass _in that day_," whichexpression is admitted by all to have reference to the gospel day, orthe entire gospel dispensation. When the church of Philadelphia waspromised deliverance from the _hour_ of temptation which was to comeupon all the world (chap. 3:10), no one supposes that a short period ofonly one week is specified. The rulers of the ten kingdoms were to"receive power as kings _one hour_ with the beast" (chap. 17:12), whichexpression will be shown later to really cover many years. We mightpoint out many such exceptions were it necessary.Again, it was the beast that came up at the expiration of the twelvehundred and sixty years, or Protestantism, that slaughtered thewitnesses, and we could not expect their resurrection during the reignof Protestantism, which every one will admit was longer than three andone-half years, according to the year-day application. The events asthey have developed prove that it was just three and one-half centuriesbefore Protestantism was entirely ignored and the Spirit and Wordrecognized as the sole Governors in the church of God. Besides, thegeneral trend of events following the formation of Protestantismnaturally divide the succeeding centuries into separate periods. Thefirst (sixteenth) was a fierce conflict for the establishment ofProtestantism; the second (seventeenth) was a violent reaction, whereinthe church of Rome nearly triumphed over her hated opposers; while thethird (eighteenth) is specially noted in history as the period ofinfidelity or reason. This division of time was so noticable thatD'Aubigne, who wrote about A.D. 1835, in his famous History of theReformation, refers to it in the following remarkable language: "It hasbeen said that the three last centuries, the sixteenth, the seventeenth,and the eighteenth, may be conceived as an immense battle of _threedays'_ duration. We willingly adopt this beautiful comparison.... Thefirst day was the battle of God, the second the battle of the priest,the third the battle of Reason. What will be the fourth? [1830-1930] Inour opinion, the confused strife, the deadly contest of all these powerstogether, TO END IN THE VICTORY OF HIM TO WHOM TRIUMPH BELONGS." BookXI, Chap. 9.The writer is thankful to God that he is permitted to see the fourth dayending "in the victory of Him to whom triumph belongs." And may we, mybrethren, be grateful to our dear Lord that it is our privilege to havepart in this glorious reformation of divine truth that is now sweepingover the world and gathering the elect together for the soon-coming ofthe Savior.    13. And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the    tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of    men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave    glory to the God of heaven.    14. The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh    quickly.At the time the witnesses reach their greatest exaltation, a greatearthquake takes place upon earth, and the tenth part of the city falls.The nature of the symbol would point us to some political upheaval.Since the great city of Babylon is composed of different divisions (aswill be seen hereafter), it is a matter of doubt as to which part of thecity is here referred to; but most probably that of the hierarchy asembraced in one of the ten divisions or kingdoms. Since the fulfilmentof this prediction is yet future, I speak with hesitation and wait forthe event to make all clear. It is probable, however, that either inthis political revolution, or about that time, the Ottoman power will beoverthrown; for immediately the announcement is made, "The second woe ispast; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly."    15. And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices    in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the    kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for    ever and ever.    16. And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on    their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,    17. Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art,    and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy    great power, and hast reigned.    18. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the    time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou    shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the    saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and    shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.    19. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was    seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were    lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and    great hail.The seventh angel that here sounded is the third woe-angel, andaccording to the description before us, ushers in the general judgment.When the temple of God was opened that this mighty event might takeplace on earth, there were "lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, andan earthquake, and great hail." Wondrous commotions took place in theworld, for kingdoms and empires were all overthrown, and Jesus Christwas the only king remaining, and his mission was to raise the dead thatthey might be judged, to give reward to the prophets and saints, and tobanish with everlasting destruction those that corrupted the earth. Thedescription itself is too plain to need further comment."The temple of God" that was opened in heaven is to be understood assymbolical (as explained in chap. 6:9), and not literal. In other words,the heavenly world appeared to John symbolized after the sanctuary ofthe temple on earth. Chap. 15:5-8; 16:1, 7, 17, etc. This is provedclearly by the fact that, when the real heaven, the future home of theredeemed, is described, John says, "I saw _no temple_ therein." Chap.21:22.Before dismissing the visions of this chapter, I wish to call attentionto one more point hitherto referred to--that of parallelism andcontrast. While we have the history of the church apostate described bythe treading down of the holy city, we have also, in immediate contrastand running parallel therewith, a history of the true church existingduring the same period of twelve hundred and sixty years, although itwas in a sackcloth state. And while the reign of Protestantism isdescribed as a period during which the two witnesses were in one sensedead, we have in immediate contrast a history of the last greatreformation, in which the spirit of life from God again enters thesesame witnesses, and they stand upright on their feet, to theconsternation of all their adversaries. Amen.CHAPTER XII.    And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed    with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a    crown of twelve stars:    2. And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and    pained to be delivered.    3. And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a    great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven    crowns upon his heads.    4. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of Heaven, and    did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the    woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child    as soon as it was born.    5. And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all    nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto    God, and to his throne.    6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a    place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a    thousand two hundred and threescore days.The three principal objects of this vision are the woman clothed withthe sun, the man-child born of her, and a red dragon with seven headsand ten horns. These, being drawn from nature and human life, wouldpoint us both to the church and to the state for their fulfilment. Thesymbols, also, are living agents, and we should expect the objects theyrepresent to be such.This woman is an appropriate symbol of the church of God, which iscomposed of living, intelligent beings; and that it is the true and notan apostate one, is shown by the fact that upon her flight into thewilderness she had a place prepared of God where she was nourished fortwelve hundred and sixty days. In a subsequent portion of the Apocalypsea vile harlot is taken as the representative of the church apostate. Inthis way a proper correspondence of character and quality is kept up.This woman appeared, not in the temple above, but in the firmament ofheaven, where she was clothed with the sun, the moon under her feet, andupon her head a crown of twelve stars. Thus the brightest luminaries ofheaven were gathered around her. Arrayed in this splendid manner, she iseasily distinguished from an apostate church, which would not be sohighly favored with such attire in this exalted position. Doubtless theobjects with which she is adorned have some special signification. Themoon is a fit symbol of the old covenant, above which the church hadjust risen, only to be clothed in the superior brightness and glory ofthe new covenant. And as the moon shines only with a borrowed light,obtaining its illumination from the sun; so, also, the old covenant wasonly a shadow of the good things to come and now stands eclipsed in thebrightness and transcendant glory of that new and better dispensation.According to the explanation given of the seven stars in the right handof Jesus (chap. 1:19), we are authorized to regard stars as a symbol ofChristian ministers, and the twelve that appear most prominently in thefirst history of the church are the twelve apostles of the Lamb.The dragon, a beast from the natural world, would properly symbolize atyrannical, persecuting government. This was a red dragon with sevenheads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. In the followingchapter we read that John saw a beast rising up out of the sea with thesame number of heads and horns, but ten crowns on his horns. And thedragon gave him (the beast) "his power, and his seat, and greatauthority." Verse 2. So far as the heads and horns are concerned, theonly difference between the two is that the crowns--a symbol of supremeauthority and power--have been transferred from the heads to the horns.In chapter 17 John saw the same beast again and there received thefollowing explanation of the seven heads: "And there are seven kings:five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when hecometh he must continue a short space." Verse 10. Concerning the hornshe was told, "The ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which havereceived no kingdom as yet." Verse 12. With this explanation before usit will be easy to identify the dragon of chapter 12 and the beast ofchapters 13 and 17 as the Roman empire, the first under the Pagan andthe second under the Papal form. The seven heads signify the sevendistinct forms of supreme government that ruled successively in theempire. The five that had already fallen when John received the visionwere the Regal power, the Consular, the Decemvirate, the MilitaryTribunes and the Triumvirate. "One is"--the Imperial.[8] Theidentification of its seventh and last head we shall leave until later.The ten horns, or kingdoms, which had not yet arisen when the Revelationwas given, were the ten minor kingdoms that grew out of the WesternRoman empire during its decline and fall. The historian Machiard, ingiving an account of these nations, and without any reference to theBible or its prophecies, reckons ten kingdoms, as follows:1. The Ostrogoths in Maesia;2. The Visigoths in Pannonia;3. Sueves and Alans in Gascoigne and Spain;4. Vandals in Africa;5. Franks in France;6. Burgundians in Burgundy;7. Heruli and Turings in Italy;8. Saxons and Anglis in Britain;9. Huns in Hungary;10. Lombards, at first on the Danube, and afterwardsin Italy.[Footnote 8: The fact that commentators and historians differ in theirenumeration of the forms of government that ruled in Rome is often asource of confusion to ordinary readers. Hence an explanation isnecessary. Rome was first ruled by kings, and therefore the first formof government is designated by either the term _Kings_ or the term_Regal Power_. Upon the expulsion of the kings and the formation of therepublic, the royal power was entrusted to two men who held it for ayear, and were called _consuls_. In times of great public danger theconsuls were superseded by a special officer called a _dictator_, whohad supreme power. As the early life of the republic was oftenthreatened with grave dangers, Rome was often governed by a dictator;hence this form of government is sometimes called the Dictatorship. Thethird form was the _Decemviri_, a government by ten men, who compiledthe twelve famous Tables of Laws. In 444 B.C. another change was made bythe appointment of _Military Tribunes_ (whose numbers varied) withconsular power. These were frequently called _Consuls_. The fifth formwas the _Triumvirate_, a government by three men. The sixth was the_Imperial_. Hence the different forms can be enumerated thus: 1. TheRegal Power, or Kings. 2. Consula or Dictators. 3. Decemvirate. 4.Military Tribunes, Tribunes, or Consuls. 5. Triumvirate. 6. Imperial.The seventh form will be considered in another place. See remarks onchap. 17:7-11.]Other historians agree substantially with this. These kingdoms all arosewithin one hundred and seventy years. The dragon is described with thehorns, although they were not now in existence and did not arise untilnearly the time when the dragon became the beast; likewise, he isrepresented with seven heads, although he really possessed only one headat a time, and five had already fallen and one being yet to come. He isdescribed with all the heads and horns he ever had or was to have.The tail of this dragon "drew the third part of the stars of heaven, anddid cast them to the earth." Some people who have never learned thenature of symbolic language try to imagine such a literal creature asthe one here described and picture in their minds what an awful thing itwould be to see the third part of the stars falling to the earth. Butreal stars that are fixed or planetary never fall, and if they did, theywould be as apt to fall in an opposite direction as toward the earth.Besides, if one should come tumbling down here, it would knock thisworld into oblivion. But with a knowledge of the proper use of symbolswe can easily identify this dragon with the Roman empire under its Paganform; and the casting down of the stars, which were doubtless used assymbols of ministers as in verse 1, signifies the warfare which thisawful beast power waged against the church of God, in which herministers were always a shining mark for the first persecution andsuffered terribly for the cause they represented.The man-child is the next object that claims our attention. Some havesupposed that it represented Jesus Christ in his first advent to theworld. But this could not be; for Christ is never represented as beingthe offspring of the church, but, on the other hand, is declared to beits originator. Some, also, have supposed that it represented the churchbringing forth Christ to the world in a spiritual sense. This, however,would be in direct conflict with the known laws of symbolic language. Avisible, living, intelligent agent, such as this man-child evidentlywas, could not be the symbol of an invisible spiritual presence.Besides, it has been clearly shown that Christ always appears in his ownperson, unrepresented by another, from the fact that he can not besymbolized. It is clear that this child can not signify a singledefinite personage; for after he is caught up to God, there is still aremnant of the woman's seed left upon earth. See verse 17.What, then, does the man-child signify? It symbolizes the mighty host ofnew converts or children that the early church by her earnest travailbrought forth. The seeming incongruity that the church, or mother, andher children are alike only serves to establish the point in questionwhen rightly understood. A child is of the same substance as its motherand is designed to perpetuate the race. So, also, the new-born babes inthe church are just the same spiritually as those who are older, and areintended to perpetuate the church of God on earth. But this explanationof itself is not sufficient to entirely satisfy an inquiring mind, andthe question is sure to be asked, Why was it necessary that the churchof God in this dispensation should be represented by two individuals--awoman and her son? I also will ask a question--Why, on the other hand,was it necessary that the great apostasy of this dispensation should berepresented by the double-figure of a woman and her daughters? Theanswer to the latter question would readily be given--to symbolize twodistinct phases of apostasy. So, also, it was necessary that adouble-symbol, such as a woman and her son, should be chosen to setforth _two phases_ of the church brought to view in this chapter. If buta single symbol were used, how could the church be thereby representedas continuing on earth and fleeing into the wilderness and at the sametime be represented as "overcome," persecuted to the death, and "caughtup unto God and to his throne"? This double-phase of the church--theexperience of the saints on earth and the reign of the martyrs inParadise--will be made very clear to the reader hereafter. But it wouldbe impossible to set forth these two phases under one symbol, andtherefore two are chosen.There is also direct Scripture testimony on this point. "Before shetravailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered ofa _man-child._ Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things?Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation beborn at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth herchildren." Isa. 66:7, 8. According to Heb. 12:22, 23, this Zion, orSion, referred to is the New Testament church, and the man-child thatshe is said to bring forth is interpreted by Isaiah as "a nation born atonce." Such language perfectly describes the rapid increase in theChristian church on Pentecost and shortly afterward, when thousands wereadded in one day. According to the apostle Paul, the host of Jews andGentiles reconciled unto God through Jesus Christ constituted "one newman" in Christ. Eph. 2:15. See also Gal. 3:28. R.V. This man-child wasto rule all nations with a rod of iron. For an explanation of this rulesee remarks on chapter 2:26, 27. The twelve hundred and sixty days willbe referred to later.    7. And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought    against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,    8. And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in    heaven.    9. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called    the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was    cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.    10. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come    salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the    power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast    down, which accused them before our God day and night.    11. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the    word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the    death.    12. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.    Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil    is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth    that he hath but a short time.    13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he    persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.    14. And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that    she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is    nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face    of the serpent.    15. And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after    the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the    flood.    16. And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her    mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon east out of    his mouth.    17. And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make    war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of    God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.In this vision we have a series of events covering exactly the sameperiod of time as that of the preceeding one; namely, a history of thechurch up to and including her flight into the wilderness, and of thesame opposing dragon. In this description, however, the events are moreperfectly detailed.Because this dragon was called the Devil and Satan, many have been ledinto the idea that it signified the Prince of darkness himself. Butsurely we could not suppose that Beelzebub has any such appearance asthis dragon. The foregoing explanation concerning his heads and hornsshows conclusively that the Pagan Roman empire is meant, and notBeelzebub. Why, then, was it called the Devil and Satan? Among theHebrews the term _Satan_ was frequently used in a very liberal sense andapplied to different objects, signifying merely an adversary or opposer.According to Young's Analytical Concordance the Hebrew word for Satan istranslated _adversary_ in a number of texts, a few of which I will referto. Num. 22:22: "And the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an_adversary_ [Satan, Heb.] against him." Here an angel of the Lord iscalled a Satan to Balaam. In 1 Sam. 29:4 David is called an adversary(Heb. Satan) to the Philistines. In 2 Sam. 19:22 certain opposers aresaid to be adversaries (Satans, Heb.) unto David; while in 1 Kings 11:25a certain man was said to be an adversary (Satan) to Israel all the daysof Solomon. A number of other instances could be given if necessary. Inthe New Testament, also, the term _Satan_ is sometimes used to signifymerely an opposer. "But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behindme, Satan." Mat. 16:23. In 1 Cor. 10:20 Paul declares "that the thingswhich the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to _devils_." Paganismstood as the great opposer of Christianity, hence was a Satan(adversary) unto it; while the apostle denominated its religious ritesas devil-worship. I do not question the fact that the spirit ofBeelzebub was manifested in the thing; but the dragon itself was theempire, as is proved by the heads and the horns. However, the Devil andthe agency through which he works are often used interchangeably. Satanand the serpent in Eden stand in the same relation as do Satan, orBeelzebub, and Paganism in the New Testament; hence to bind Paganism wasto bind the Devil and Satan in one important sense.The dragon would be a beast from the natural world (if such a creatureactually existed) and as such could represent nothing more than a civilempire; but in the vision under consideration he is represented asaccompanied by _angels_ actuated by his spirit and defending his cause.By this combination of symbols is set forth the politico-religioussystem of the empire--a religion that denied the doctrine of the oneexclusive God and the divinity of Jesus Christ. It was the religion of_infidelity_. It was the dragon as a false religious system thatChristianity attacked, and not the State itself. The following quotationfrom Butler's Ecclesiastical History will show the relation ofChristians to the empire:"The Romans were accustomed to tolerate all new religions if they tooktheir place by the side of those already existing, and if they did notcast reproach upon them.... But Christianity, by its very natureexclusive in its claims ... was offensive to the Romans and to theState. A religion which cast contempt upon the religions and ritessanctioned by the laws, and endeavored to draw men away from them,seemed to express thereby contempt and hostility for the State itself.Hence Christianity was branded as a malignant superstition, andChristians spoken of as the enemies of the human race.... From theletter of Pliny to Trajan, it was evidently recorded as an _religioillicita_, and the mere fact of being a Christian was counted of itselfa crime.... The exclusiveness of Christianity seemed also to place itsdisciples in a position of direct disloyalty to the emperors and theState. 'The emperor was ex-officio _Pontifex Maximus_; the gods werenational. Cicero declares as a principle of legislation, that no oneshould be allowed to worship foreign gods, unless they were recognizedby public statute. Maecenas thus counselled Augustas: Honor the godsaccording to the customs of your ancestors, and compel others to worshipthem. Hate and punish those who bring in strange gods.' As the Romanempire was founded on the absolutism of the State, and made nothing ofpersonal rights, Christianity, which first taught and acknowledged them,would be peculiarly offensive to the State. Moreover, the conscientiousrefusal of Christians to pay divine honor to the emperor and hisstatutes, and to take part in idolatrous ceremonies at public festivals... and their constant assembling themselves together, brought themunder the suspicion and obloquy of the emperors and the people." Pp. 49,50.The dragon was stationed in the same heaven where the woman appeared.This signifies his exalted position in the world. While the dragon wasin the height of his power and glory, Michael (Jesus Christ--Jude 9; 1Thes. 4:16; John 5:28) and his followers appeared on the scene, and afierce battle for supremacy ensued, resulting in the final victory ofthe hosts of Michael. That it was against the dragon as a religioussystem that the Christians fought is proved by the kind of weapons theyemployed. "And they overcame him by the _blood of the Lamb_ and by the_word of their testimony_; and they loved not their lives unto thedeath." Christianity never sought to overturn the civil empire, but didwith all the power of truth oppose the huge system of error sustained byit and gained such decisive victories that the cry was heard, "Now iscome salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the powerof his Christ; for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, whichaccused them before our God day and night." The Devil himself suffered asevere defeat when his favorite agents, the dragon and his followers,were cast down from their lofty position and Christianity was exaltedinstead. Says Butler: "The final victory of Christianity over heathenismand Judaism, and the mightiest empire of the ancient world, a victorygained without physical force, by the moral power of faith andperseverance, of faith and love, is one of the sublimest spectacles ofhistory, and one of the strongest evidences of the divinity andindestructible life of our holy religion." P. 40.But the fact that many Christians lost their lives in this conflict(verse 11), insomuch that the man-child is represented as being caughtup unto God (verse 5), shows that the dragon employed also the arm ofcivil power in his opposition to the growing truth. The rapid increaseof Christianity, despite the violent opposition and persecution of thePagan party, can be no better represented than by a quotation from thenotable Apology of Tertullian, who wrote during the persecution bySeptimus Severus, about the end of the second century."Rulers of the Roman Empire," he begins, "you surely can not forbid theTruth to reach you by the secret pathway of a noiseless book. She knowsthat she is but a sojourner on the earth, and as a stranger findsenemies; and more, her origin, her dwelling-place, her hope, herrewards, her honors, are above. One thing, meanwhile, she anxiouslydesires of earthly rulers--not to be condemned unknown. What harm can itdo to give her a hearing?... The outcry is that the State is filled withChristians; that they are in the fields, in the citadels, in theislands. The lament is, as for some calamity, that both sexes, every ageand condition, even high rank, are passing over to the Christian faith."The outcry is a confession and an argument for our cause; for we are apeople of yesterday, and yet we have filled every place belonging toyou--cities, islands, castles, towns, assemblies, your very camp, yourtribes, companies, palace, senate, forum. We leave to you your templesalone. We can count your armies: our numbers in a single province willbe greater. We have it in our power, without arms and without rebellion,to fight against you with the weapon of a simple divorce. We can leaveyou to wage your wars alone. If such a multitude should withdraw intosome remote corner of the world you would doubtless tremble at your ownsolitude, and ask, 'Of whom are we the governors?'"It is a human right that every man should worship according to his ownconvictions ... a forced religion is no religion at all.... Men say thatthe Christians are the cause of every public disaster. If the Tiberrises as high as the city walls, if the Nile does not rise over thefields, if the heavens give no rain, if there be an earthquake, if afamine or pestilence, straightway they cry, Away with the Christians tothe lion.... But go zealously on, ye good governors, you will standhigher with the people if you kill us, torture us, condemn us, grind usto the dust; your injustice is the proof that we are innocent. Godpermits us to suffer. Your cruelty avails you nothing.... The ofteneryou mow us down the more in number we grow; the blood of Christians isseed. What you call our obstinacy is an instructor. For who that sees itdoes not inquire for what we suffer? Who that inquires does not embraceour doctrines? Who that embraces them is not ready to give his blood forthe fulness of God's grace?"Another writer has said: "The church in this period appears poor inearthly possessions and honors, but rich in heavenly grace, inworld-conquering faith and love and hope; unpopular, even outlawed,hated and persecuted, yet far more vigorous and expansive than thephilosophies of Greece, or the empire of Rome; composed chiefly ofpersons of the lower social ranks, yet attracting the noblest anddeepest minds of the age, and bearing in her bosom the hope of theworld; conquering by apparent defeat and growing on the blood of hermartyrs; great in deeds, greater in sufferings, greatest in death forthe honor of Christ and the benefit of generations to come."This triumph of early Christianity over Paganism was a theme worthy ofthe song. "Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of ourGod, and the power of his Christ." Even before the death of theapostles, according to the younger Pliny, the temples of the gods inAsia Minor were almost forsaken. No wonder, then, that even theinhabitants of heaven were called upon to rejoice at so great a victoryattained by the followers of the Lamb. But the same voice also says,"Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil iscome down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hathbut a short time." This represents the violence of the Pagan party uponits defeat, being exasperated to the exercise of greater opposition andcruelty wherever the means and the power were still in their hands. Castdown from his exalted position in the heavens--the religious sphere--hisecclesiastical prestige lost, he had no place to abide but in theearth--the political kingdom--whence he took up arms, and "woe to theinhabitants of the earth." But "the days of Paganism in the empire werenumbered." The Devil knew that he had but a short time, therefore hecame down in great wrath. This is in accordance with the facts ofhistory. Paganism did not die an easy death, but struggled hard andlong.When cast from his high position, however, the dragon "persecuted thewoman which brought forth the man-child." The true idea expressed in theoriginal is that he _pursued_ the woman, and this signification isindicated by what follows--"To the woman were given two wings of a greateagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where sheis nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face ofthe serpent." The _time_ as a definite period signifies one year; hencea time, times, and half a time would be three and one-half years, ortwelve hundred and sixty days, as before explained. There is an apparentincongruity or contradiction of statement in reference to the symbolshere; but it is a contradiction that when rightly understood throwslight upon the whole subject. It will be noticed that the woman andMichael with his angels symbolize the same object--the people of God.Under the latter figure they were triumphant and the dragon wasdefeated. Yet after he was cast down, he turned upon the woman andpursued her, and thus, the church appeared to be the defeated party.According to this, then, the Pagan party is represented as _prevailing_soon after he met _defeat_ and the church apparently _defeated_ soonafter her period of _triumph_. Here again we have two separate symbolsof the same object in order to represent two of its different phases.This is explained satisfactorily by noticing carefully the facts. Thewoman, who is always the true church composed of holy people, was atfirst identical with the visible church, or the great body ofChristians, and in this condition was successful in spreading the puregospel and casting down the powers of iniquity symbolized by the dragon.But the dragon politically, as symbolized by his being a beast from thenatural world, with heads and horns, remained in power for some time,his religious prestige only being lost. Christianity did not attempt tocast down the dragon in the sense of destroying the civil empire. As iswell known, a great spiritual declension followed the period of thechurch's greatest triumph, which decline drove the woman, or the truechurch, into the wilderness; hence to all appearances the church becamea defeated party. About this same time, the dying cause of Paganismrevived for a season in terrible severity in the latter part of thethird century; hence to all appearances the dragon was triumphant. Thissupreme effort of Paganism's to regain its former position will bebetter understood in connection with what follows regarding the floodwhich he cast out of his mouth. But that the dragon was not permanentlytriumphant is shown by the fact that he afterwards resigned his powerand position unto the beast. Chap. 13:2.As to the meaning of the "two wings of a great eagle" given the woman toaid her in her flight, I am not able to say positively. Some apply themto "the grace and providence of God which watched over the church";others to the "spiritual gifts of faith, love," etc., which, likesupporting wings, bore the church above her enemies. But I can not seehow the wings of a great eagle can properly symbolize such things. Theyare not drawn from the right source. Perhaps nothing more is intended bythe wings than to denote the fact of her successful flight. That thisidea is the correct one seems quite clear when we consider the fact thatthe remarkable deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage isset forth under the same figure, that of eagles' wings. "Ye have seenwhat I did unto the Egyptians, and how _I bare you on eagles' wings_,and brought you unto myself." Ex. 19:4. With the wings of such apowerful bird she was able to escape, so that the dragon could notovertake her."And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman,that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. And the earthhelped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up theflood which the dragon cast out of his mouth." Here is a peculiarcombination of symbols from different departments--the serpent, a floodof water, the woman, and the earth. The last two as allies is a veryunusual circumstance. Some refer the flood of waters to heresies thatarose in, or was connected with, the hierarchy about this time; but inthat case how could it be said that it was the serpent that cast it out?Others apply it to errors that the Pagan party introduced baptized withthe name of Christianity, when they professed to become converts at alater period. It is certainly an appropriate _figure of speech_ to say aflood of error or of false doctrine; but whether a flood of water is aproper _symbol_ of the same is another question. I do not think it is.Water, being an object of nature, would point us to something political.False doctrines are usually symbolized by something different fromobjects in nature.There is considerable difficulty in verifying the symbol, but I willsubmit what up to the present has seemed to me as the most satisfactoryexplanation. It appears from the description that this was about thelast great public effort the dragon made to overwhelm the church andthat he was exasperated to this supreme effort by the humiliating defeathe had suffered. The means he employed was _water_, an object of nature;hence we are to look for some great political event by which the dragonmade his master-effort to destroy the woman shortly after her flightinto the wilderness. In A.D. 284 Diocletian, a Pagan, succeeded to theimperial throne. Before the close of his reign (305), the Christianssuffered the most terrible persecution ever received at the hands ofPagan Rome. It continued ten years--A.D. 302-312. It was the design ofthis emperor to completely extirpate the very name of Christianity, andhis unfortunate victims were slain by the thousands throughout theempire. "But the master-piece of [his] heathen policy was the order toseek and burn all copies of the Word of God. Hitherto the enemy had beenlopping off the branches of the tree whose leaves were for the healingof the nations; now the blow was made at the root. It had once been thepolicy of Antiochus Epiphanes, when he madly sought to destroy theJewish Scriptures. It was both wise and wicked. It had but one defect,it could not be carried into complete execution. The sacred treasure wasin too many hands, and too many of its guardians were brave and prudent,to make extermination possible. An African bishop said, 'Here is mybody, take it, burn it; but I will not deliver up the Word of God.' Adeacon said, 'Never, sir, never! Had I children I would sooner deliverthem to you than the divine word.' He and his wife were burnt together."Butler's Eccl. History, p. 66.But "_the earth_ helped the woman"--another unlooked-for politicalevent. Worn out with the cares of State, boasting that the very name ofChrist was abolished, and dying with a loathsome disease, the tyrantabdicated his throne. A number of individuals claimed imperial honors;but Constantine, the ruler of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, fought his wayagainst contending rivals and finally entered Rome, the capital, intriumph. Enthroned as emperor of the West, he immediately issued anedict of toleration favorable to the Christians (A.D. 313) and soonbecame a professed Christian himself and by law made Christianity theestablished religion of the empire. In 324, having crushed all rivals,he became sole emperor of the Roman world, and with a view of promotingChristianity convened what is known as the First General Council of theChurch, at Nicaea in Asia Minor, A.D. 325. The prestige of Paganism as areligious power had been overthrown long before by the followers ofChrist, but now its political importance received a death-blow, only afew expiring struggles appearing subsequently before the final downfallof Western Rome. Thus, the earth helped the woman and swallowed up theflood of persecution which the dragon cast out."And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with theremnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have thetestimony of Jesus." Finding that he could not destroy or exterminatethe church of God, he determined to make war upon its individualmembers.CHAPTER XIII.    And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up    out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his    horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.    2. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his    feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a    lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great    authority.    3. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and    his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after    the beast.    4. And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the    beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto    the beast? who is able to make war with him?    5. And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things    and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty    and two months.    6. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to    blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in    heaven.    7. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to    overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and    tongues, and nations.    8. And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose    names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from    the foundation of the world.    9. If any man have an ear, let him hear.    10. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he    that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here    is the patience and the faith of the saints.In this vision John beheld a beast rise out of the sea. Hisappearance--like that of a leopard with the feet of a bear and a mouthlike a lion--indicated that he was some terrible creature. He was also apersecutor of the saints, the same as the dragon that preceded him. Asbefore explained, this beast, also, symbolizes the Roman empire; for hepossesses the same heads and horns as the dragon, the only differencebeing that the supreme power and authority, as indicated by the crowns,is now vested in the ten horns, or minor kingdoms, instead of in theseven heads. The dragon as a political power represented Rome before heroverthrow by the barbarians; the beast as a political power representsnew Rome.A careful study of the characteristics of this beast, however, will showthat he represents more than a civil power. As a mere beast from thenatural world he could symbolize nothing more than some political power;but it will be noticed that, combined with his beastly nature, there arealso certain characteristics that belong exclusively to the departmentof human life--a mouth _speaking_ great things; power to magnify himselfagainst the God of heaven; the ability to single out the saints of Godand kill them, and to set himself up as an object to be worshiped, etc.This combination of symbols from the two departments--those of animaland of human life--points us with absolute certainty to Rome as apolitico-religious system. Ask any historian what world-wide powersucceeded Rome Pagan, and he will answer at once, "Rome Papal."While it is not my general design to explain the many lines of prophetictruth described under similar symbols in other parts of the Bible, yet Iwill ask the reader here to pardon the slight digression while I callattention briefly to a few thoughts in the seventh chapter of Danielregarding this same Papal power.Daniel received a vision of four great beasts, which were interpreted tosymbolize four universal monarchies. Verse 17. These were theBabylonian, the Medo-Persian, the Greco-Macedonian, and the Roman. Thefourth beast possessed ten horns, which were explained to signify tenkingdoms to arise out of the fourth empire. This is identical with thedragon of Rev. 12, except the latter possessed seven heads not mentionedby Daniel. In the midst of the ten horns (ten minor kingdoms) grew up a_little_ horn, which soon assumed greater proportions than his fellows,taking the place of three of the original horns, and into his hand thesaints of the Most High were given for "a time and times and thedividing of time," or twelve hundred and sixty years. This eleventh horndiffered from the ten in that it possessed a mouth speaking greatthings, and the eyes of a man. A horn with eyes and mouth in it is avery unusual thing, yet it is just such a combination as we might expectwhen we possess a correct knowledge of symbols. Being drawn from twodepartments--human life and animal life--this double-symbol directs usto a politico-religious system that came up among the ten horns thatgrew out of the old Roman empire. We instantly identify it with thegrowing Papacy, which arose to a position of great authority inconjunction with the new Roman empire.Three of the horns, or temporal kingdoms, were overthrown in order togive room for the complete development of this politico-religious power.Since great changes have frequently occurred among the nations of Europeoriginally embraced in the ten minor kingdoms, different powers havebeen referred to as the three described in Daniel's prophecy; but themost satisfactory explanation to my mind is that of the three kingdomsin Italy that were overthrown as if to give the hierarchy room fordevelopment, and that gave the Papacy its _first_ temporal sovereignty,thus completing the symbol by constituting her a civil as well as anecclesiastical horn.Odoacer, in A.D. 476, overthrew the old empire of the West andestablished the kingdom of the Heruli in Italy. Seventeen years later itwas subverted by Theodoric, who established the kingdom of theOstrogoths, which continued sixty years; then it, in turn, wasoverthrown by Belisarius, but was soon succeeded by the Lombards. TheLombard kingdom was subverted by Pepin and Charlemagne, who, aschampions of the church, gave a large part of their dominions to the Seeof Rome and thus favored the Papacy with her first temporal power. Thuswere the kingdoms of the Heruli, Ostrogoths, and Lombards plucked up bythe roots upon the very territory occupied first by the Papacy as atemporal power, and as if to give it room.The careful student of Daniel 7 will notice immediately the strikingsimilarity between the politico-religious system symbolized by thelittle horn and the leopard beast of Revelation 13 under consideration.The following parallels between them prove their identity:"1. The little horn was a blasphemous power: 'He shall speak great wordsagainst the Most High.' Dan. 7:25. The leopard beast of Rev. 13:6 doesthe same: 'He opened his mouth in blasphemy against God.'"2. The little horn made war with the saints, and prevailed againstthem. Dan. 7:21. This beast also, Rev. 13:7, makes war with the saints,and overcomes them."3. The little horn had a mouth speaking great things. Dan. 7:8, 20. Andof this beast we read, Rev. 13:5: 'And there was given unto him a mouthspeaking great things and blasphemies.'"4. The little horn rose on the cessation of the Pagan form of the Romanempire. This beast rises at the same time; for the dragon, Pagan Rome,gives him his power, his seat, and great authority."5. Power was given to the little horn to continue for a time, times,and the dividing of time, or twelve hundred and sixty years. Dan. 7:25.To this beast also power was given for forty and two months, or twelvehundred and sixty years. Rev. 13:5."6. At the end of the twelve hundred and sixty years the universaldominion of the little horn was to begin to decline, being consumed anddestroyed unto the end. Dan. 7:26. This beast, also, Rev. 13:10, was tobe led into captivity and 'killed with the sword.'"These points prove identity. To quote the words of a certain expositor:"When we have in prophecy two symbols ... representing powers that comeupon the stage of action at the _same time_, occupy the _sameterritory_, maintain the _same character_, do the _same work_, exist the_same length of time_, and meet the same _fate_, those symbols representthe same _identical power_." To this all must agree. Hence we have inthe vision before us a description of Papal Rome in her two-foldcharacter as a temporal and a religious power. The wounding and healingof the head of the beast will be explained in chapter XVII.How the same heads and horns can serve both the dragon and the leopardbeast will be better understood later. For the present it will besufficient to state that it is because they are the same beast inreality, being clothed, in its later form, in a Christian garb, insteadof the worn-out garments of infidelity or heathenism possessed by theformer. This transfer is expressed in the following words: "And thedragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority." Verse 2.This beast, then, succeeded to the dominion held by the dragon. It waslike an old, established firm retiring and giving its standing andcredit and well-earned reputation to a new partnership, to conduct asimilar business.While this beast, as before observed, represents the developed religiousand political power of the Papacy combined, still the actions ascribedto it show plainly that it is in its character as an _ecclesiastical_beast that its terrible features are here delineated. No one wouldsuppose that a mere political power would set itself up as an object tobe worshiped, exalting itself above the God of heaven, and then singleout and slaughter the saints for not complying therewith. As far asrendering obedience to civil governments is concerned, the Christians ofall ages have been the most peaceful and obedient servants of all. So weshall hereafter refer always to the _beast_ as an ecclesiastical power,unless otherwise stated.This beast all the world admired. "And they worshiped the dragon whichgave power unto the beast: and they worshiped the beast, saying, Who islike unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?" The peopleworshiped the established hierarchy, and they also worshiped the dragonfrom which the beast obtained so much of his power. The expression"_worshiped_ the dragon" shows plainly that it is the dragon as areligious system that is referred to, and not the old civil empire. How,then, could the old heathen worship be perpetuated in the church of Romeand form a part of her religious services? By adopting rites andceremonies purely Pagan in their origin. Since I have already statedthat the beast and the dragon as temporal powers were about the same inreality, except the change of sovereignty from the heads to the horns,it will now be necessary to show the remarkable similarity in spiritthat existed between them as religious powers, the one being thesuccessor of the other.1. The high-priest of the Pagan religions was called Pontifex Maximus,and he claimed spiritual and temporal authority over the affairs of men.The Pope of Rome possesses the same title and makes the same claims, andhe is clad in the same attire as the Pagan Pontiff.2. The heathen were accustomed to wear scapulars, medals, and images toshield them from the common ills and dangers of life. Romanists wear thesame and for the same purpose.3. The Pagans, by an official process called _deification_, frequentlyexalted men who had lived among them to a position worthy of specialhonor and worship. Papists, by a similar process called _canonisation_,raise their former men of prominence to the dignity of _saints_ and thenoffer up prayers to them.The foregoing practises are derived from Paganism; also from Judaism orPaganism came their practise of burning incense in public worship, theuse of holy water, burning wax candles in the daytime, and votive giftsand offerings. Other heathen principles are:4. Adoration of idols and images, a practise expressly forbidden by theMosaic law and unsanctioned by primitive Christianity;5. Road gods and saints (in Catholic countries);6. Processions of worshipers and self-whippers (especially in Catholiccountries);7. Religious orders of monks and nuns. One who has read of the vestalvirgins of old will recognize at once where monkery originated.In the city of Rome there still stands an old heathen temple built byMarcus Agrippa and dedicated in the year B.C. 27 to _all the gods_. Inthe year A.D. 610 it was reconsecrated by Pope Boniface IV. to "theblessed Virgin and all the saints." From that time until the present dayRomanists in the same temple have prostrated themselves before _the verysame images_ and have devoutly emplored them by the same forms of prayerand for the very same purposes as did the heathen of old. The onlydifference is, that instead of calling this idol Jupiter, they call itPaul; instead of denominating that one Venus, they call it Mary, etc.Well has Bowling said: "The scholar, familiar as he is with the classicdescriptions of ancient mythology, when he directs his attention to theceremonies of Papal worship, can not avoid recognizing their closeresemblance, if not their absolute identity. The temples of Jupiter,Diana, Venus or Apollo, their 'altars smoking with incense,' their boysin sacred habits, holding the incense box, and attending upon thepriests, their holy water at the entrance of the temples, with their_aspergilla_, or sprinkling-brushes, their thuribula, or vessels ofincense, their ever-burning lamps before the statues of their deities,are irresistibly brought before his mind, whenever he visits a RomanCatholic place of worship, and witnesses precisely the same things."History of Romanism, pp. 109, 110.Having failed in his direct attacks against the Christian church, withthe accession of Constantine, who established Christianity as the Statereligion, the dragon soon clothed his pernicious principles in aChristian garb and made war against the remnant of the woman's seed thatkept the commandments of God, through the rising hierarchy, under thename of Christianity; but his heads and horns being visible, and hebeing unable to control his tongue, his real sentiments crop out, and heis easily identified. It is not to be supposed, however, that the beastwould appear suddenly in full possession of the immense power ascribedto him in this chapter. On the contrary, Daniel represents it as a_little_ horn at first, whose look finally became "more stout than hisfellows." Dan. 7:8, 20. Such ecclesiastical power was attained only bythe process of gradual development. According to the vision hisuniversal power was limited to "forty and two months," or twelve hundredand sixty years. Since this has reference to the beast as anecclesiastal power, which according to Daniel grew up by degrees, thetime should be calculated the same as in chapter 11:2, 3--dated from thetime when the external, visible church was wholly in the hands of theprofane multitude of Gentiles and the true church crowded into thewilderness. The nationalized hierarchy, however, continued to advance togreater degrees of power over the nations, until it reached its zenithunder the pontificate of Gregory VII., A.D. 1073-1080.The great things and blasphemies spoken by this beast are doubtlessfulfilled by the prerogatives and rights belonging to God alone whichthis apostate church, especially through her regularly constituted head,claims. In fact, the Pope is the real mouth of this beast, the one whodictates her laws with great authority. He claims to be the vicar ofChrist on earth and supreme head of the church, even, as in the case ofPope Innocent, denominating himself the one before whom every knee mustbow, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under theearth. He claims power over the souls of all men on earth and even aftertheir departure from earth. If this is not blasphemy against God, histabernacle, or church, and "them that dwell in heaven," then I am whollyunable to imagine what would fulfil the prediction. Among theblasphemous titles assumed are these: Lord God the Pope, King of theWorld, Holy Father, King of kings, and Lord of lords, Vicegerent of theSon of God. He claims infallibility (which was backed up by theEcumenical council of 1870) and has for ages. Further, he claims powerto dispense with God's laws, to forgive sins, to release from purgatory,to damn, and to save.All the inhabitants of the earth were to worship him, except those whosenames were in the book of life. Thank God that even during the dark ageof Romanism a people existed who were owned by the Lord and who refusedto render idolatrous worship to this tyrannical beast. For furtherinformation regarding these medieval Christians, see remarks on chapter11:3. But these saints who opposed the Papal assumptions were made theobject of fearful persecutions, until Rome glutted herself upon theblood of millions of God's holy saints. This will be more fullydescribed in chapter 17, where this apostate church appears underanother symbol, "drunken with the blood of the saints, and with theblood of the martyrs of Jesus." In all their severe trials, however,they were comforted with the knowledge that Justice would not alwayssleep, but that a time would come when her retributive hand would bestretched forth to lead into captivity their persecuting enemies andbreak their world-wide reign of tyranny and usurpation. "Here is thepatience and the faith of the saints." To a number of people God gavespecial foresight of the coming reformation of the sixteenth century, inwhich the universal spiritual supremacy of the Papacy ended. A few ofthe many examples will be profitable.Says D'Aubigne: "John Huss preached in Bohemia a century before Lutherpreached in Saxony. He seems to have penetrated deeper than hispredecessors into the essence of Christian truth. He prayed to Christfor grace to glory only in his cross, and in the inestimable humiliationof his sufferings.... He was, if we may be allowed the expression, theJohn Baptist of the reformation. The flames of his pile kindled a firein the church that cast a brilliant light into the surrounding darkness,and whose glimmerings were not to be so readily extinguished. John Hussdid more: prophetic words issued from the depths of his dungeon. Heforesaw that a real reformation of the church was at hand. When drivenout of Prague and compelled to wander through the fields of Bohemia,where an immense crowd followed his steps and hung upon his words, hehad cried out: 'The wicked have begun by preparing a treacherous snarefor a goose. But if even the goose, which is only a domestic bird, apeaceful animal, and whose flight is not very far in the air, hasnevertheless broken through their toils, other birds, soaring moreboldly towards the sky, will break through them with still greaterforce. Instead of a feeble goose, the truth will send forth eagles andkeen-eyed vultures.' This prediction was fulfilled by the reformers."When the venerable priest had been summoned by Sigismund's order beforethe Council of Constance, and had been thrown into prison, the chapel ofBethlehem, in which he had proclaimed the gospel and the future triumphsof Christ, occupied his mind much more than his own defence. One nightthe holy martyr saw in imagination, from the depths of his dungeon, thepictures of Christ which he had painted on the walls of his oratory,effaced by the Pope and his bishops. This vision distressed him; but onthe next day he saw many painters occupied in restoring these figures ingreater number and in brighter colors. As soon as the task was ended,the painters, who were surrounded by an immense crowd, exclaimed, 'Nowlet the popes and bishops come! they shall never efface them more!' Andmany people rejoiced in Bethlehem, and I with them, adds John Huss.'Busy yourself with your defence rather than with your dreams,' said hisfaithful friend, the Knight of Chlum, to whom he had communicated thisvision. 'I am no dreamer,' replied Huss, 'but I maintain this forcertain, that the image of Christ will never be effaced. They havewished to destroy it, but it shall be painted afresh in all hearts bymuch better preachers than myself. The nation that loves Christ willrejoice at this. And I, awaking from the dead, and rising so to speak,from my grave, shall leap with great joy.'" History of the Reformation,Book I, Chap. 6.This bold witness for Christ was burned at the stake July 6, 1415, byorder of the General Council of Constance. When the fagots were piled uparound him ready for the torch, he said to the executioner, "You are nowgoing to burn a goose [Huss signifying goose in the Bohemian language];but in a century you will have a swan whom you can neither roast norboil." Fox's Book of Martyrs. This was fulfilled in Martin Luther.Henry Institorus, an inquisitor, uttered these remarkable words: "'Allthe world cries out and demands a council, but there is no human powerthat can reform the church by a council. The Most High will find othermeans, which are at present unknown to us, although they may be at ourvery doors, to bring back the church to its pristine condition.' Thisremarkable prophecy, delivered by an inquisitor at the very period ofLuther's birth, is the best apology for the reformation."Andrew Proles, provincial of the Augustines, used often to say: "Whence,then, proceeds so much darkness and such horrible superstitions? O mybrethren! Christianity needs a bold and a great reform, and methinks Isee it already approaching.... I am bent with the weight of years, andweak in body, and I have not the learning, the ability, and eloquence,that so great an undertaking requires. But God will raise up a hero, whoby his age, strength, talents, learning, genius and eloquence, shallhold the foremost place. He will begin the reformation; he will opposeerror, and God will give him boldness to resist the mighty ones of theearth."John Hilten censured the most flagrant abuses of the monastic life, andthe exasperated monks threw him into prison and treated him shamefully."The Franciscan, forgetting his malady and groaning heavily, replied: 'Ibear your insults calmly for the love of Christ; for I have said nothingthat can injure the monastic state: I have only censured its most cryingabuses.' 'But,' continued he (according to what Melancthon records inhis Apology for the Augsburg Confession of Faith), 'another man willrise in the year of our Lord 1516: he will destroy you, and you shallnot be able to resist him.'"In 1516 Luther held a public discussion with Feld-kirchen, in which heupheld certain doctrines of truth that made a great stir among theRomanists. Says D'Aubigne: "The disputation took place in 1516. This wasLuther's first attack upon the dominion of the sophists and upon thePapacy, as he himself characterizes it." And again, "This disputationmade a great noise, and it has been considered as the beginning of thereformation." Book I, Chap. 9. The next year, however, he enteredpublicly upon the actual work of reformation.Frederick of Saxony, surnamed the Wise, was the most powerful elector ofthe German empire at the period of the reformation. A dream he had andrelated just before the world was startled by the first great act ofreformation is so striking that I feel justified in repeating it in thisconnection. It was as follows:"Having gone to bed last night, tired and dispirited, I soon fell asleepafter saying my prayers, and slept calmly for about two hours and ahalf. I then awoke, and all kinds of thoughts occupied me untilmidnight.... I then fell asleep again, and dreamed the Almighty sent mea monk, who was a true son of Paul the apostle. He was accompanied byall the saints, in obedience to God's command, to bear him testimony,and to assure me that he did not come with any fraudulent design, butthat all he should do was conformable to the will of God. They asked mygracious permission to let him write something on the doors of thepalace-chapel at Wittemberg, which I conceded through my chancellor.Upon this, the monk retired thither and began to write; so large werethe characters that I could read from Schweinitz what he was writing[about 18 miles]. The pen he used was so long that its extremity reachedas far as Rome, where it pierced the ears of a lion which lay there, andshook the triple crown on the Pope's head. All the cardinals and princesran up hastily and endeavored to support it.... I stretched out my arm:that moment I awoke with my arm extended, in great alarm and very angrywith this monk, who could not guide his pen better. I recovered myself alittle.... It was only a dream. I was still half asleep, and once moreclosed my eyes. The dream came again. The lion, still disturbed by thepen, began to roar with all his might, until the whole city of Rome, andall the States of the holy empire, ran up to know what was the matter.The Pope called upon us to oppose this monk, and addressed himselfparticularly to me, because the friar was living in my dominions. Iagain awoke, repeated the Lord's prayer, entreated God to preserve hisHoliness, and fell asleep.... I then dreamt that all the princes of theempire, and we along with them, hastened to Rome, and endeavored oneafter another to break this pen; but the greater our exertions thestronger it became: it crackled as if it had been made of iron: we gaveit up as hopeless. I then asked the monk (for I was now at Rome, now atWittemberg) where he had got that pen, and how it came to be so strong.[In those days they used goosequills for pens.] 'This pen,' replied he,'belonged to a Bohemian goose [Huss] a hundred years old. I had it fromone of my old schoolmasters. It is so strong because no one can take thepith out of it, and I am myself quite astonished at it.' On a sudden Iheard a loud cry; from the monk's long pen had issued a host of otherpens. I awoke a third time; it was day light." History of theReformation, Book III, Chap. 4.Frederick related the foregoing to his brother John, the Duke of York,on the morning of Oct. 31, 1517, stating that he had dreamed it duringthe previous night. The same day at noon Martin Luther advanced boldlyto the chapel at Wittemberg and posted upon the door ninety-five theses,or propositions, against the Papal doctrine of indulgences. This was hispublic entrance upon the great work of reformation. The importance ofthe Reformation of the Sixteenth Century is incalculable. It gave thedeathblow to the universal spiritual supremacy of Rome. As we havealready seen, the Papacy had for centuries held despotic sway over theminds and the consciences of men. One potent cause of the Reformationwas the great Revival of Learning that marked the close of the medievaland the beginning of the modern period of history. This great mentalawakening contrasted sharply with the blind ignorance and superstitionof the Middle Ages, and caused many men to doubt the Scripturalauthority of many of the doctrines and ceremonies of the Church of Rome;such as invocation of saints, auricular confession, use of images,worship of the Virgin Mary, etc.Scandals and abuses in the Church of Rome also hastened the Reformation.During the fifteenth century the morals of that church had sunk to thegreatest depths of iniquity. The Popes themselves were, in some cases,monsters of impurity and iniquity, insomuch that historians are obligedto draw the vail over many of their dark deeds.But the real occasion of the revolt of the northern nations of Europeagainst the jurisdiction of Rome was the controversy regardingindulgences. "These in the Catholic church, are remissions, to penitentsof punishment due for sin, upon the performances of some work of mercyor piety, or the payment of a sum of money." When Leo X. was elected tothe Papal dignity (1513), he found the church in great need of money forthe building of Saint Peter's and other undertakings, and he hadrecourse to a grant of indulgences to fill the coffers of the church.The power of dispensing these indulgences in Saxony in Germany was givento a Dominican friar named Tetzel. This fanatic enthusiast entertainedthe most exaggerated opinion of the efficacy of indulgences. In hisharrangues he uttered such expressions as the following:"Indulgences are the most precious and the most noble of God's gifts.""There is no sin so great that an indulgence can not remit; ... only lethim pay well, and all will be forgiven him." "Come, and I will give youletters, all properly sealed, by which even the sins that you intend tocommit may be pardoned." "I would not change my privileges for those ofSt. Peter in heaven; for I have saved more souls by my indulgences thanthe apostle by his sermons." "The Lord Omnipotent hath ceased to reign;he has resigned all power to the Pope." See D'Aubigne's History of theReformation, Book III, Chap. 1.Martin Luther was an Augustine monk and a teacher of theology in theUniversity of Wittemberg. Before Tetzel appeared in Germany, Lutherpossessed a wide reputation for learning and piety, and he had alsoentertained doubts respecting many of the doctrines of the church.During an official visit to Rome in 1510 he was almost overwhelmed withsorrow because of the moral corruption there; but while penitentiallyascending on his knees the sacred stairs of the Lateran, he seemed tohear a voice thundering in his soul, "The just shall live by faith!"This marked an important epoch in his career.When Tetzel appeared in Saxony with his indulgences, Luther fearlesslyopposed him. He drew up ninety-five theses against the infamous trafficand nailed them to the door of the church at Wittemberg, and invited allscholars to criticise them and point out if they were opposed to thedoctrine of the Word of God or of the early church Fathers. Here theinvention of printing proved to be a powerful agency in advancing thecause of reformation by scattering copies of these theses everywhere;and soon the continent of Europe was in a perfect turmoil ofcontroversy. The Pope excommunicated Luther as a heretic. In replyLuther burned the Papal bull publicly at Wittemberg. Shortly afterwardLuther produced his celebrated translation of the Bible in the Germanlanguage. Even a brief history of the entire Reformation would be toolarge for the limits of the present volume, therefore with a few wordsrespecting the nature of the work of the Reformation we will pass on toanother prophetic vision.The great secret of the early success of the reformers was their appealfrom the decisions of councils and regulations of men to the Word ofGod. So long as the Word and Spirit of God were allowed their properplace as the Governors of God's people, the work was a spiritualblessing. But this happy state of affairs did not long continue. Withina few years the followers of the reformers were divided into hostilesects and began to oppose and persecute each other. Luther denouncedZwingle as a heretic, and "the Calvinists would have no dealings withthe Lutherans." The first Protestant creed was the Augsburg Confession(1530). This date marks an important epoch. From this time the peoplebegan to lose sight of the Word and Spirit of God as their Governors andto turn to the disciplines of their sects, which they upheld by everymeans possible. Thus we find Calvin at Geneva consenting to the burningof Servetus, because of a difference of religious views; and in Englandthe Anglican Protestants waged the most bitter, cruel, and relentlesswar not only against Catholics, but against all Protestants who refusedto conform to the Established Church. The Protestants placed armies inthe field and fought for their creeds, as during the Thirty Years' Warin Germany and the long period of the Hugenot wars in France. The realwork of the Reformation, the promulgation of so much of the truth of theBible, was an inestimable blessing to the world; but the rise ofProtestantism (organized sectism) in 1530 introduced another period ofapostasy as distinct in many of its features as was that of Romanismbefore it. The historian D'Aubigne recognizes an important change atthis period. He says:"The first two books of this volume contain the most important epochs ofthe Reformation--the Protest of Spires, and the Confession ofAugsburg.... I determined on bringing the reformation of Germany andGerman Switzerland to the _decisive epochs of_ 1530 and 1531. Thehistory of the Reformation, properly so-called, is then in my opinionalmost complete in those countries. The work of faith has there attainedits apogee: that of conferences, of interims, of diplomacy begins....The movement of the Sixteenth Century has there made its effort. I saidfrom the very first, It is the history of the Reformation and not ofProtestantism that I am relating." Preface to Vol. V.    11. And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and    he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.    12. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before    him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to    worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.    13. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down    from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,    14. And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of    those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the    beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should    make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and    did live.    15. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast,    that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as    many as would not worship the image of the beast should be    killed.    16. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor,    free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in    their foreheads:    17. And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the    mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.    18. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the    number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his    number is Six hundred threescore and six.The symbolic description of this beast directs us also to a politicaland a religious system rising at the expiration of the twelve hundredand sixty years' reign of the first beast, but that he was no suchterrible beast politically as the one before him is proved by the factthat he had but two horns and they _like a lamb_. This beast rose "outof the earth"--the Apocalyptic earth, or the territory of the Romanempire. The first beast rose out of the sea, which, as before shown,signifies the heart of the empire in an agitated state; for the tenhorns came up through the greatest political convulsions that the pageof history records. When John beheld the second beast "coming up,"however, the empire was in a state of comparative quiet, although fiercewars followed afterward. He stands as a symbol of _Protestantism_ inEurope; although his power and influence afterwards extended beyond the"earth"--the Apocalyptic earth--into "the whole world." Chap. 16:14.That this beast came up upon the same territory occupied by the Papacyis proved also by the statement that "he exerciseth all the power of thefirst beast before him." It was predicted in a subsequent chapter(17:16) that the ten horns, or kingdoms of Europe, after supporting thePapacy during the Dark Ages, would later turn against her. This has meta remarkable fulfilment under the reign of Protestantism.The first two nations to turn violently against Popery were England andGermany. They have ever since been the chief supporters and defenders ofProtestantism, and they are doubtless the two kingdoms symbolized by thetwo horns of the beast. While at one time the Pope was a temporalsovereign and could, by his political and ecclesiastical power, humblewith ease the mightiest nations of Europe before him, his authority hasbeen wrested from him by degrees, so that to-day not a vestige of histemporal power remains, and his anathemas fall harmlessly. The nationshave asserted their rights as kings. When King Victor Emmanuel enteredRome on the twentieth day of September, 1870, the Pope's temporal sunset forever, and he does not control even the city in which helives--Rome. He is often referred to as "the prisoner of the Vatican.""He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity," said theprophecy; "he that killeth with the sword must be killed with thesword." It was by force of arms that the Popes obtained and maintainedtheir temporal power over the nations, and by the force of arms theyhave had their authority torn from them. Religion has been referred toas "the basis of government"; for the legislators of any country are toa great degree influenced in their deliberations by religioussentiments. In all Protestant countries that greatest of Protestantprinciples, religious liberty, is as truly recognized by statute as wasthat infernal principle of the Papacy, religious intolerance, whenformerly enforced by law. Protestant principles have so far permeatedthe nations of Europe formerly controlled by the Papacy that religioustoleration is generally granted. In Italy, the headquarters of Popedom,where the Catholics are greatly in the majority, religious liberty isgranted by law. And even Spain, denominated by the EncyclopaediaBritannica "the most Catholic country in the world," exhibits "a generalindifferentism to religion," meaning that the fanaticism and intoleranceof former ages that caused thousands, and perhaps millions, to be slain,is rapidly dying out. In the vision before us, however, the specialactions ascribed to this beast--_speaking_, working miracles, deceiving,making an image and imparting life to it, etc., which all belongproperly to the department of human life--show conclusively that it isthe character of this beast as an _ecclesiastical power_ that is thechief point under consideration. He was not to become such a terriblebeast politically (for his horns were only _like a lamb_), but "he_spake_ as a dragon." As soon as we enter the department to which_speaking_ by analogy refers us, we find this beast to be a greatreligious power; and it is in this character alone that he is dilineatedin the remainder of the chapter. That the description of a religioussystem is the main burden of this symbol, is shown also by the fact thatit is in every case referred to in subsequent chapters as the "falseprophet." Chap. 16:13; 19:20; 20:10. Therefore every reference I make tothis second beast hereafter should be understood as signifying thereligious system of Protestantism, unless otherwise stated.That Protestantism in its many forms can be properly represented by asingle symbol--a beast or false prophet--may seem a little strange atfirst; but when we come to consider next the making of an image to thebeast, it will be seen that the Protestant sects, from God's standpointof viewing, are all alike in character, as were the multitudinous formsof heathen worship represented under the single symbol of the dragon.Hence only one beast, or the making of one image, was necessary to standas representative of the entire number. It will be noticed by the readerthat from verse 12 to the close of the chapter the term _beast_signifies the first beast, or the Papacy, and that the second beast, orProtestantism, is designated by the pronoun _he_._Image_ is defined to be "an imitation, representation, similitude ofany person or thing; a copy, a likeness, an effigy." The second beast,then, is to manufacture something in _imitation_ of the first beast. Ifany doubt exists as to which phase of the first beast, political orecclesiastical, is copied, it can be settled by considering what is saidof the image made from the original. "The image of the beastshould--_speak_." This directs us by analogy, as heretofore explained,to the department of religious affairs; hence the second beast forms an_ecclesiastical organization_ in imitation of the hierarchy of Rome. Atthis juncture the Protestant will doubtless exclaim, "Oh, our churchesare nothing like the church of Rome!" But consider a little in the lightof truth. God's Word teaches that they bear the close relationship of_mother_ and her _daughters_ (Rev. 17:5), and by the help of the Lord weshall point out a similarity of character in this and subsequentchapters. The symbol of the church of Rome in chapter 17 is that of acorrupt _prostitute_, while the symbol of Protestantism is that of her_harlot daughters_. The Roman church is a humanly organized institutiongoverned by a set of fallible men, their claims of infallibility to thecontrary notwithstanding. Protestant sects, likewise, are all humanorganizations (even though they may sometimes deny it), and are governedby a man or a conference of men. The Roman Catholic church makes andprescribes the theology that her members believe. Protestant churches,also, make their own disciplines and prescribe rules of faith andpractise. The Word of God, inspired by his Spirit, could not be enforcedin Romanism without destroying it; for its main spirit is Antichrist.So, too, the whole Word in Protestantism would soon annihilate herGod-dishonoring sects; for they are all contrary to its plain teachings,which condemn divisions and enjoin perfect unity and oneness upon theredeemed of the Lord. What is said concerning the image of the beastapplies to sectarianism as a whole and the human organization of all herso-called churches, regardless of the differences that exist betweenthem as individual institutions; for they may differ as widely as thevarious systems of heathen religions symbolized by the dragon, yet theycan be represented by the single symbol of an image to the first beast,because they are built upon the same general principles--are but humanorganizations, falsely called churches of Christ, and are all contraryto the Scriptures.Imparting life to the image of the beast simply signifies the completeorganization of the ecclesiastical institutions so that they are capableof self-government and their decrees possess authority. Every livingbody is animated by a spirit. The sectarian spirit that animates theMethodist body will lead people into that body, etc.; but the one Spiritof God will, if permitted, baptize us all into the one body of Christ,where we can all "drink into one Spirit." 1 Cor. 12:13. "And he spake asa dragon" signifies the great authority by which his laws are enactedand enforced upon the people."And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down fromheaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwellon the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do inthe sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, thatthey should make an image to the beast." Fire from heaven upon Elijah'ssacrifice was the attestation of God to his divine mission. Bringingdown fire from heaven, then, symbolically describes the claims of thisbeast to being a true prophet of the Lord.At this point we must make a distinction which, being true in the factsof history, must necessarily be intended in the symbolic representation.According to the symbols of the preceding chapter the woman, or truechurch, "fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared ofGod, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred andthreescore days." The time-prophecy is the same and covers the sameperiod as the reign of the Papal beast; therefore just as an importantchange in the Papacy occured at the expiration of the prophetic period,so also we must expect a radical change with respect to the true church:it must no longer be completely obscured in the wilderness.As the Reformation, and Protestantism as a religion, was the means ofending Rome's universal spiritual supremacy, so also the same movementmust be regarded as possessing sufficient light and truth to again bringinto prominence the work of the Spirit and the true people of God. "Firefrom heaven" may therefore be regarded as describing the divine work ofreformation, the unfolding of truth accompanied by the saving power ofGod. Such spiritual work has accompanied the origin of various religiousmovements during the Protestant era.The general description of the two-horned beast, however, brings intoprominence an evil characteristic--the disposition to lead people intodeception by making an image to the beast and then worshiping it. Theevil does not inhere in the work of bringing down "fire from heaven,"but in image-making and image-worship, for which the Spiritual worksimply furnished an occasion. The Spiritual work of reformation istherefore to be distinguished from the later work of creed- andsect-making. And since the beast takes advantage of Spiritmanifestations, in order to deceive men, he becomes a sort of apostateand is denominated "the _false prophet_." See Chap. 16:14; 19:20.Ecclesiastically considered, the two-horned beast stands as the symbolof the religious system of Protestantism as a whole--a peculiarcombination of truth and error, of good and bad, of "fire from heaven"and false, miracle-working power (chap. 16:14); while the "image to thebeast" signifies the sectarian institution--the man-made,man-controlled, unscriptural sect machinery manufactured in imitation ofthe Papal original. To exalt such earth-born churches and lead people toadore and worship them is but a species of idolatry and the rankestdeception. It is a sad fact that multitudes of people in Protestantismare more devoted to their particular church than they are to the LordJesus Christ. They can witness the open rejection of God's precious Wordand the vilest profanation of his holy name, without uttering a word ofprotest; but let anyone say a word against _their church_, and instantlythey are aroused to the highest pitch of excitement--beast-worshipers!The Protestant era has witnessed many wonderful reformations in whichthe true fire of God fell upon waiting souls, but this initial work ofthe Spirit has in each case been employed as an excuse for taking thenext step--making an image. Thousands of honest souls, lacking betterlight, have been induced to submit to such human organization. But thetruly saved have always loved and adored their Lord more than the humanchurch to which they were attached, therefore they should not beregarded as beast-worshipers. They are the ones whom the Lorddenominates his people when the voice is heard calling them out ofBabylon. Chap. 18:4.The "mark of the beast" next claims our attention. The beast referred tois the Papacy. How did the Papacy mark its subjects? Undoubtedly, by thefalse spirit which animated that organization, branding them all withits delusive doctrines and errors. In a previous chapter the servants ofGod were represented as receiving the seal of God in their foreheads.This was shown to signify the pure Word and doctrines of the Bible beingplanted within them by the Holy Spirit. In making the sect image inimitation of the Papal original, then, the principle of marking subjectshas also been copied. The members of every sect organization areindelibly marked. You can not become one of them without solemnlyagreeing to believe the doctrines taught in their discipline andaccepting the government of their man-made institutions. Subscribing tothe rules of faith and practise that originated with the sect shows howits members worship the image. They are also said to worship the firstbeast, the original of the image. How is this fulfilled? In the samemanner that the worshipers of the first beast worshiped the dragon thatpreceded it; namely, by accepting and believing false principles offaith that originated in the system immediately preceding. Protestantsects have transferred many of the false doctrines of Romanism to theirown creeds, hence they worship the first beast just as truly as thePapists worshiped the dragon by accepting heathenish principles. Thegreatest principle of false doctrine that originated with Catholicism,and one that has been transferred to _every Protestant sect_, is, that ahuman organization is necessary to complete the church of Christ onearth. The church of Rome has an earthly head and a human government;and Protestants, also, firmly believe the unscriptural doctrine thatthey must bow to an organization of men and thus be under a visibleheadship: they receive the mark of the beast. Many sects have alsocopied other Popish doctrines, such as infant baptism, the destructionof all outside of the pales of the church (?), infantile damnation,sprinkling, and other things too numerous to mention. Thus, they worshipthe first beast as well as his image.They also receive the "name of the beast." Here again "beast" refers tothe Papacy. The Papal beast was represented as being full of the namesof blasphemy, which blasphemy was shown to signify the usurpation ofprerogatives and rights belonging to God alone. The greatestecclesiastical usurpation reached by the Romish hierarchy was that ofclaiming to be the head of the church and the right to prescribe andenforce their doctrines, naming their organization the _Holy CatholicChurch_. In making their sect organizations in imitation, Protestants,as above stated, have transferred the same principle and make the sameblasphemous claim of a right to make disciplines to govern God's people,and then name their sect machinery a _church_ of God. The name may beMethodist, Baptist, Mennonite, Episcopalian, or what not, it is only a_beast name_, yet a name that you must accept if you desire to becomeone of them.They not only receive the name of the beast, but also receive the"number of his name." It will be necessary first to explain what ismeant by the number of a name. "The modern system of notation by thenine digits and the cipher, was not introduced until the tenth century,but on account of its superior excellence, has since superseded everyother. Previous to this great discovery, the letters of the alphabetwere used to denote numbers, each letter having the power of a _number_as well as a _sound_. The same system is still retained among us forcertain purposes. The Roman letters I. V. X. L. C. D. M., have each thepower of expressing a number. This, however, was the common and the bestmode of notation that the ancients possessed." The number of a name,therefore, was merely the number denoted by the several letters of thatname.The number of the name of the beast--the first beast--is said to be thenumber of a _man_. When we enter the Romish hierarchy and search for aman the number of whose name will be six hundred and sixty-six, wherecould we go more appropriately than to the Pope himself, its authorizedhead? The Scriptures point him out particularly as the "_man_ of sin,""the son of perdition." 2 Thes. 2:3, 4. Has the Pope of Rome a name theletters of which, used as numerals, make six hundred and sixty-six? Yes.He wears in jeweled letters upon his miter the following blasphemousinscription: _Vicarius Filii Dei_--Vicar of the Son of God. Taking outof this name all the letters that the Latins used as numerals, we havejust six hundred and sixty-six. U and V were both formerly used todenote five.    V ..... 5     F ..... 0    I ..... 1     I ..... 1    C ... 100     L .... 50    A ..... 0     I ..... 1    R ..... 0     I ..... 1    I ..... 1     D ... 500    U ..... 5     E ..... 0    S ..... 0     I ..... 1                        ---                        666In some manner the worshipers of Protestant images also receive thenumber of this name--six hundred and sixty-six. The name is that of"Vicar of the Son of God." In all Protestantism (see remarks on chapter11:7, 8) the true Vicars of Christ on earth--the Word and Spirit ofGod--have been set aside, and conferences of men have taken their placesin all the official acts relative to spiritual affairs. Hence the numberof the name applies to them as well. What that number speciallysymbolizes I do not know, unless it is, as has been explained byothers--_division_. While the policy of Romanism has been that of unity,still the false claims made by one individual can be as well made byanother, and by many, which has been the case, as just explained;therefore it would not be improper at all to make the Pope's number asymbol of the whole, since his system has been so largely copied by therest. The whole structure of sectarianism is built on the principle ofdivision, and it so happens that there is always enough left to divideagain. So this special number is perhaps the symbol of endless division,signifying the great number of human organizations claiming to bechurches of Christ. The church of God, however, is built on theprincipal of unity; division is destruction to its true nature and life,for it is Christ's body.It is further said that "no man might buy or sell, save he that had themark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name." To "buy orsell" is to engage in the ordinary pursuits of life and have intercoursewith human society. Applying this as a symbol to the analagousdepartment of the church, we have the fact set forth that those withoutthe special mark have no more recognized standing in the so-calledchurches than men that are not allowed to buy or sell have in acommunity. But _selling_, as a symbol, would specially indicate thedealing out of truth, or the preaching of the gospel. A Holy Ghostminister in the clear light of heaven's truth, independent of all thecreeds of Babylon, will not be allowed the privilege of laboring freelyamong sectarians, after the truth for which he stands becomes wellknown. And if he holds meetings in the community, the members of thesects are often warned by their leaders against "buying"--receiving--itfrom the Holy Ghost minister, because of his not having the mark or nameof the beast. Their ministers are specially marked, for they come out oftheir colleges and theological seminaries with the stamp of theirrespective doctrines upon them and a license from the sect to enter itsministry; and those not thus marked or designated have no place amongthem. This may also explain the manner in which the beast causes thosewho will not worship the image to be killed--an analagous killing;namely, an ecclesiastical cutting-off, or excommunication, as explainedin previous chapters.[9][Footnote 9: The early history of Protestantism shows that at that timethe principle of religious intolerance brought over from Romanismmanifested itself in the actual putting to death of numerous dissenters.For example see pp. 252, 291-294 of the present work. It is possiblethat the persecuting principle ascribed to the two-horned beast mayinclude both the literal and the ecclesiastical cutting-off, referencebeing made directly to the intolerant spirit.]The facts just stated are well illustrated by the followingcircumstances. A few years ago a brother in the ministry went into acertain town to find a place to conduct a series of holiness meetings.He was directed by a Presbyterian lady to their pastor, who, she said,was a believer in the doctrine of holiness. When he called on theminister and made known his errand, the first question asked him wasthis, "Are you a member of the Presbyterian church?" The brotheranswered in the negative. He did not have the _name of the beast_. Thenext question that greeted him was this, "Do you believe the WestminsterConfession of Faith to be orthodox?" He answered, "No, sir." He did nothave the _mark of the beast_. The last question asked was, "Do youbelong to any of the various orthodox Protestant denominations?" Thebrother said, "No." He did not have the _number of his name_. The answerwas, "You can not have our house."While on a missionary trip in the Near East, the writer, in company withanother brother, attended a Seventh-Day Adventist service in Bucharest,Roumania. After the sermon another brother requested that we be giventhe opportunity to speak a little, but the request was absolutelyrefused. It was explained that we would say nothing against them ortheir work but only speak about salvation; but we were not permittedeven to testify in a few words. The difficulty was that we did not haveeither the "mark of the beast" or its "name."CHAPTER XIV.    And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with    him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name    written in their foreheads.    2. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters,    and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of    harpers harping with their harps:    3. And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and    before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn    that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which    were redeemed from the earth.    4. These are they which were not defiled with women; for they    are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever    he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the    firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.    5. And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without    fault before the throne of God.There is no difficulty in identifying this company on Mount Sion as thetrue people of God in marked contrast with the worshipers of all corruptand false religion. As to the chronology of the event, it is evidentthat we have here a continuation of the same series of prophecybeginning with the apostolic period in chapter XII, describingalternately the true church and the false church.At the beginning of this series the true church, symbolized by thestar-crowned woman, fled into the wilderness and was there lost to view;while the leopard beast and the two-horned beast of chapter XIII,symbolizing the two leading forms of organized Christianity, werebrought into prominent view. It is therefore fitting that the truechurch should again appear and be given her proper position and work inthe world before the end of all earthly things.That the company here brought to view represents the true church isshown by its agreement with the church of God before the apostasy began.In the seventh chapter we have seen that before the political calamitiesbefell the Western Roman Empire the work of sealing God's servants wasaccomplished, twelve thousand from each of the twelve tribes of Israelbeing sealed, thus representing symbolically the fact that God's church,comprising the true Israel, was perfect and complete, no part beingomitted. In the chapter under consideration we have this divine sealingprocess again after the apostasy, and once more the definite number144,000 occurs, showing that the church before the end is to be perfectand complete.The contrast of this company with the ecclesiastical powers in thepreceding chapter proclaims in an unmistakeable manner the fact that wehave here described a true reformation and work of God before the end oftime. In the morning-time of the dispensation the redeemed of earth wererepresented as singing praises to Christ; so also the company herebrought to view unite in singing a song which only the redeemed canknow. This company is on Mount Sion, not in the darkness of thewilderness, they are with the Lamb, not wandering after the beast; theyare not even following the beast that was "like a lamb," but they arewith the true Lamb, the Savior of the world; they have the "Father'sname written in their foreheads," not the mark or the name of the beast.It is said of them that "these are they which were not defiled withwomen, for they are virgins." Fornication and adultery, as will beexplained later, is a symbol of spiritual idolatry; and the chastity ofthis redeemed company shows that they were free from the abominations ofthe apostasy. They "follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth." Their namesare in the book of life, and they do not worship the beast. Chap. 13:8.Here, then, we have a symbol of the church of God in the latter daysstanding distinct from the great apostasy.    6. And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having    the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the    earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,    7. Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him;    for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made    heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.    8. And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen,    is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink    of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.    9. And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice,    If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark    in his forehead, or in his hand,    10. The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which    is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation;    and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the    presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:    11. And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and    ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast    and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.    12. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep    the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.    13. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write,    Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea,    saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and    their works do follow them.Another phase of the last reformation is here brought to view--itscommunicative genius. It not only stands clear from the apostasy, but itsounds the warnings of God and proclaims his message. The firstmessenger had a very important message to deliver, even "the everlastinggospel." His message was not limited to the inhabitants of "theearth"--the Apocalyptic earth--only, but included "every nation, andkindred, and tongue, and people," showing that it was of universalimportance. It was not a new gospel, but the everlasting gospel, thesame gospel preached before the long period of apostasy. There is onephase different, however, and that is that the _nearness_ of the secondcoming of Christ is a leading feature; the messenger with loud voicewarns the people to prepare for the awful judgment just at hand byturning to "worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, andthe fountains of waters." The apostle Paul cautioned the Thessalonianbrethren not to entertain the idea that the advent of Christ was thennear at hand, for it could not come until after the great period ofapostasy that he predicted; but here is a messenger now claiming thatthe "_hour of his judgment is come_"--an event just at hand. He carrieshis special message to all people; for Jesus declared, "This gospel ofthe kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto allnations; and _then shall the end come_." Matt. 24:14. This representsthe restoration of gospel truth in the reformation that was begun aboutthe year A.D. 1880 and that is now being carried to all nations by aholy ministry.The nature of this restoration work is clearly shown. Its leadingfeature is its missionary character, the proclamation of the pure gospelto "every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people." Since the daysof the apostles the whole gospel has not been boldly declared andcarried forward with burning missionary zeal. Romanism and Protestantismhave conducted their missionary work and, according to chap. 16:14,their sphere of influence will extend throughout "the whole world"; buthere is clearly set forth the fact that God has authorized anotheruniversal message and world-wide work wholly distinguished from allothers. The contrast between the worshipers of the beast and his imageand those composing the redeemed company on Mount Sion is so clear, alsothe nature of the work done by each, that we can not possibly identifythem as being one.This work of conducting a world-wide missionary enterprise may appear tobe a gigantic task, but the seeming impossibility vanishes when weconsider the fact (to be more fully developed hereafter) that God callsinto this service all his people who are yet under the sectarian yoke.With this great host already dispersed over the world, the work ofmaking known this last message can and will be accomplished.The positive statement that the _hour_ of his judgment is come showsthat the end is exceedingly near; hence the second and third angels mustfollow the first in the closest proximity possible in order to introducetheir messages before the wrath of God is poured out upon apostateChristendom. The time is so short that these three messengers can notpossibly refer to three distinct reformations in the world; hence theymust signify three important phases in the one last reformation thatcarries the gospel to all nations in the short period of an "hour,"which time also includes the final judgment.A careful study of these three messages will show that they areinseparably connected. The second cry was against Babylon, that she hadfallen. Rev. 18:1, 2 proves this fall of Babylon to be a moral one--agiving away to ungodliness, iniquity and all manner of deception.According to chapter 16:19 the great city of Babylon is composed ofthree parts, being a confederation of the dragon[10] (heathenism), thebeast (Catholicism), and the false prophet (Protestantism). Chap. 16:13,14. It is evidently to this latter division of Babylon that this secondmessage applies; for Paganism was always a false religion, andCatholicism was always a corrupt one, during whose reign the church ofGod, as already shown, was separate. Protestantism, then, was the onlypart of the great city that could fall morally or spiritually. Duringthe space of three hundred and fifty years, from the formation of thefirst Protestant creed, she held reign and authority over the people ofGod, who were scattered among her hundreds of opposing sects.[Footnote 10: That the dragon should be a part of great Babylon seems atfirst improbable; but in this statement reference is made, not to thedragon in his original, or Pagan, state, but to the form in which he ismanifesting himself in these last days to deceive the nations, workingin conjunction with apostate Christendom. This phase of the dragon powerwhich brings him into harmony with, and, in reality, a part of, modernBabylon, will be more clearly understood when we come to consider thethree unclean spirits that come out of the mouth of the dragon, thebeast, and the false prophet (chap. 16:13, 14), and the release of thedragon in chapter 20:7-9.]In this condition the faithful children of God, although bearing themark and name of the beast, longed for restoration of the divine,primitive standard; but in the cloudy atmosphere of that period theycould not clearly discern the whole truth. Later, when the full tidingsof the everlasting gospel came, there came also a revelation thatBabylon is fallen and that God is calling his people out of confusionjust before the end of time.I call to witness every child of God who has been with the presentreformation from its beginning, if there were not three special phasesof the development of the truth, as follows: 1. A wonderful revival ofspirituality among a few of God's chosen ones, caused by the"everlasting gospel" being revealed to them as never before. 2. Theknowledge of the truth and deep experience thus obtained prepared theway for the next step, which was the discovery that the "churches" werea part of the great Babylon of Revelation and were in a fallencondition, "a hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean andhateful bird." Chap. 18:2, 3. Hence the cry went up, "Babylon is fallen,is fallen." 3. Then followed immediately the message to God's people to"flee out of the midst of Babylon and deliver every man his soul,"warning them that no one could any longer bear the mark of the beast orworship his image without forfeiting eternal salvation and that thefearful judgments of heaven would soon descend upon every one whorefused to obey the message and to walk in the light. The last twophases, which apply to Babylon, are the same and in the same order asthe description given in chapter 18:1-4. First, an angel from heavencries mightily with a strong voice, "Babylon the great is fallen, isfallen"; and then "_another voice_" from heaven says, "COME OUT OF HER,MY PEOPLE." The three successive phases of the message are now allcombined in one, and God is gathering his holy remnant "out of allplaces where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day" (Ezek.34:12) into the one body of Jesus Christ. Halleluiah! John, also, sawthis glorious result of the three messages--"And I saw as it were a seaof glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory overthe beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number ofhis name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God. And theysung the song of Moses the servant of God [a song of deliverance], andthe song of the Lamb [the song of redemption], saying, Great andmarvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways,thou king of saints." Chap. 15:2, 3. Let all the people of God rejoice!  "Hail the day so long expected,    Hail the year of full release;  Zion's walls are now erected,    And the watchmen publish peace.  "Now on Shiloh's wide dominion,    Hear the trumpets loudly roar:  Babylon's fallen, is fallen, is fallen,    Babylon's fallen to rise no more."Those of the Lord's people who through lack of sufficient light wereyoked up with unbelievers in Protestantism, labored faithfully toupbuild the very sectarian institutions that God was against and thatwere destined to be destroyed, though they themselves were saved as byfire; but from the time this reformation began the redeemed die in thetriumphs of a living faith, and their labors in upbuilding the truecause and kingdom of God are still blessed and fruitful, beingperpetuated in the works that follow them."Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep thecommandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." As before mentioned, God'speople during the reign of Romanism expected her universal supremacy tocome to an end, and their patience was greatly exercised in waiting forthe appointed time to arrive. It came with a great spiritualreformation. Then followed another period of apostasy, during which timeGod's people again looked forward to something better in the future.Many remarkable predictions of this present holiness reformation wereuttered by some of the most spiritual saints during the Protestant era,and I can not refrain from mentioning a few of them in this connection.D'Aubigne: "The nineteenth century is called to resume the work whichthe sixteenth century was unable to accomplish." History of theReformation, Book XV, Chap. 1.Fletcher: "Only He will come with more mercy, and will increase thelight that shall be at eventide, according to his promise in Zech. 14:7.I should rather think that the visions are not yet plainly disclosed;and that the day and hour in which the Lord will begin to make bare hisarm openly are still concealed from us. Oh, when will the communion ofsaints be complete? Lord, hasten the time; and let me have a place amongthem that love thee, and love one another in sincerity." This is anextract from a letter written by John Fletcher to Mr. Wesley, datedLondon, May 26, 1757, as given in Joseph Benson's life of Fletcher, pp.39, 40.D'Aubigne again: "In every age it has been seen how great is thestrength of an idea to penetrate the masses, to stir nations, and tohurry them, if required, by thousands to the battle-field and to death.But if so great be the strength of a human idea, what power must not aheaven-descended idea possess, when God opens to it the gates of theheart! The world has not often seen so much power at work; it was seen,however, in the early days of Christianity, and in the time of theReformation; and _it will be seen in future_ ages." Book VI, Chap. 12."It has been said that the three last centuries, the sixteenth, theseventeenth, and the eighteenth, may be conceived as an immense battleof three days' duration. We willingly adopt this beautifulcomparison.... The first day was the battle of God, the second thebattle of the priest, the third the battle of reason. What will be thefourth? In our opinion, the confused strife, the deadly contest of allthese powers together, to _end in the victory of Him to whom triumphbelongs_." Book XI, Chap. 9.Lorenzo Dow, comment on Rev. 14:6-11; 18:1-5: "The angel, orextraordinary messenger, with his assistants, proclaiming the fall ofBabylon will be known in his time. Also the one warning the people ofGod to come out of Babylon literally, spiritually, and practically, willbe known also, and such other threatening for the omission of complianceis not to be found in all the Bible." Dow's Works, p. 533.The following extracts are from an old book written about 1812 byTheophilus R. Gates and entitled "Truth Advocated." Through the kindnessof a sister living in Allegan County, Michigan, the writer was enabledto secure the following from the only copy of this book known to be inexistence--she having borrowed it of her neighbor, a relative of itsauthor.On Rev. 14:11: "I would here gladly drop the subject, lest I giveoffense; but duty compels me to remark, what can not be denied, that aninordinate attachment to certain systems and forms of religion, hasoccasioned all the strifes, animosities, and persecutions, that have solong agitated the Christian world; and if God be just, every one mustdrink of the cup of his indignation, according to his offense. The beastand his image, as it exists in Protestant countries, seems in this placeparticularly meant; and our own land is full of the number of his name.That such a testimony will one day go forth we must believe, or else St.John saw that which will never be: and the testimony will as certainlybe received; for a company in the next chapter are to be seen that hadgotten the victory over the beast, his image, his mark, and the numberof his name. It is also equally true that as yet it has never goneforth; and that at the time, great afflictions or suffering of some kindwill be undergone to exercise the patience of the saints.... It is atthis very time, no doubt, that the three unclean spirits, like frogs,come out of the mouth of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet;spirits of devils working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of theearth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the great battle of thegreat day of God Almighty. The greatest possible efforts, indeed willnow be made by all the sectarians to keep up their existence ... nor isit any wonder that hireling ministers and system worshipers, Demetriuslike, should be stirred up and raise no small stir about the way; for itis evident, not only their craft is in danger of being set at naught bythis testimony, but also the great Diana of systems and forms ofreligion to be despised, and their magnificence destroyed, whom nowalmost the whole Christian world worshipeth." Pp. 281-283."And now commences an era of light and suffering, when the corruptchurches (with the kings of the earth and great men united with them)being about to be wholly brought down, make one general muster againstChrist and his true worshipers. These things are clear to me as a ray oflight; and whoever lives at this time will see as great opposition andspite to the true way of righteousness then set forth from sectariansand professors generally, as there was from the Jews towards Christ andhis testimony: and also, like the Jews, at the very time they oppose thetrue way of the Lord with all their might, they will no doubt make thegreatest possible show of religion, will think they are the true church,yea will have a zeal for God, carrying on religion with great success,forming societies, sending missionaries among the heathen, etc., etc.That such an event will take place is very clear." Pp. 286-288."This happy period I never expect to see: but known unto the Lord onlyare all things. I know that such a time will be; for we are assured bythe angel, these are the true sayings of God: and I also believe that itwill take place _within two centuries_ from this time. But oh! howcorrupt doth the world now appear to me.... Help me, O Lord, I praythee, to do thy will."Whenever any body of people come into notice, establish their rules andinstitutions, and become a respectable sect, they are the people of Godthen only in name; they cease to have the nature any longer; and whoeverunites himself to the same, constitutes himself one of the beast'sparty, and so far as his influence extends, he helps to establish thekingdom of Antichrist in the earth. This is clear from the prophecies ofthe Revelation, and it will answer no purpose to take offense when thetruth is spoken. These things will, moreover, sooner or later bedeclared with great plainness by some one; and then will the man of sinput forth all his strength; then will persecution come, and the beastmuster his armies to defend himself and to destroy the assailants, butin vain; for however few their number may be at first, and howeverfurious the battle may rage against them, they are destined to conquer.And herein the words of Christ will fitly apply, 'Fear not, littleflock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.'"P. 313.Speaking of sectarianism, he says further: "The same round of thingswill continue until the evil is remedied.... When this shall take place,time only can determine with certainty. It will probably commenceslowly, and not come with any great outward observation. Few will atfirst see or embrace the way, being strange to them, and appearing onaccount of their prejudices, and the way they have been taught by thefalse prophet, to be wrong and improper: moreover, being opposed to allothers, they will have all others to oppose them. But though they aredespised and hated, and few in number, the Lord is with them." Pp. 322,323.On Rev. 16:13, 14: "I have already delivered my views with respect tothese unclean spirits ... and it is not necessary to say much here uponthe subject; only I would just observe, that this will be a time ofgreater trial to Christians in general, and in a time in which more willbe deprived of every particle of true religion through the influence offalse ministers belonging to the different societies in Christendom,than any that has ever yet been in the world. But while they are makingthese great exertions, they are only preparing themselves and theirdeluded votaries for a more awful and complete destruction. For GodAlmighty is against them, and they against Him; though they will know itnot, but think perhaps all the while they are his peculiar favorites,and that they are employed in maintaining his cause, like the Jewsbefore them, when it is only their own cause and men's traditions." P.338."I am but as the voice of one crying in the wilderness of error and ofsin, of wickedness and delusion, testifying according to the best lightgiven me; and any light that I can possibly communicate will in a littletime become as the feeble shining of the sun, by reason of the greatnessof the light that shall be hereafter." P. 354."A true and living testimony will go forth before this last period ofthe awful judgments of God comes to a close, and in consequence ofrejecting it, like the Jews of old, the wrath of God will come upon themto the uttermost. The testimony against the worshipers of the beast, bythe third angel, Rev. 14:9, is the testimony that effectually overthrowsthe kingdom of darkness and establishes the truth as it is in Jesus,pure and undefiled.... The authors of this testimony will ... unlike toall who go before them, attack the evil at its root, and expose thedeceit, hypocrisy and wickedness of the different sects in a way thathas never before been done; for which they will suffer the greatestpersecution. You may look upon these things as the reveries of my ownfancy; but some day or other, people will witness to the truth of what Inow write." Pp. 421, 422."All the reformations which go before this last great reform will onlybe partial and temporary. They will only lop off the branches, or at themost, only strike at the body of the corrupt tree, while the rootsremain untouched and uninjured. But when this last testimony goes forth,the very roots of the corrupt tree will be attacked." P. 426."Every sect is under an idea that whenever the Lord comes to establishtruth in the earth, it will be to establish their creed, raise up theirsect, and bring the whole world into their way. And when the faithfulwitnesses whom God will raise up shall openly declare that they have allgone out of the way, that the greatest professors have so much of guile,selfishness and party spirit about them as to be nothing but hypocrites,and that a person must be better than they are or be lost forever; thatsects are an abomination to the Lord; denounce eternal death upon everyadvocate and adherent of men-made establishments; ... I say when such atestimony as this goes forth, as it sooner or later will, no wonder thatthe sects, all with one accord, should set themselves against it--shouldcall it heresy--declare it will ruin the churches if it is notsuppressed.... Although, as I have before testified, I am only as thevoice of one crying in the wilderness--a mere babe in the knowledge ofthese things which are to be revealed hereafter, yet I expect to raise ahost of bigots and hypocrites against me.... Nor can it be very longbefore the true light, in a very especial manner, will shine.... Ifthese things do not come to pass, then let me be called an enthusiast ora deceiver." Pp. 444-446.    14. And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud    one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden    crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.    15. And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud    voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and    reap: for the time has come for thee to reap; for the harvest of    the earth is ripe.    16. And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the    earth; and the earth was reaped.    17. And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven,    he also having a sharp sickle.    18. And another angel came out from the altar, which had power    over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp    sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the    clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully    ripe.    19. And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and    gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great    winepress of the wrath of God.    20. And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood    came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the    space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.The special characters of this vision and their work have been verydifficult for me to identify positively. Until clearer light on thematter is received, I choose to withhold an explanation rather than toindulge in speculation. Its usual explanation is to apply the gatheringof the harvest of the earth to the work of the reformation now takingplace and the vintage scene to the final destruction of the wicked,their punishment being symbolized by the treading of the "winepress ofthe wrath of God." This may be its signification. It is certain,however, that in a subsequent chapter, the final judgment of the wickedis symbolized by the treading of "the wine-press of the fierceness andwrath of Almighty God." Beyond this I can not now speak with certainty.CHAPTER XV.    And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven    angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up    the wrath of God.    2. And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and    them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his    image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand    on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.    3. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the    song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works,    Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of    saints.    4. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for    thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship    before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest:    5. And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the    tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:    6. And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven    plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their    breasts girded with golden girdles.    7. And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven    golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and    ever.    8. And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God,    and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the    temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were    fulfilled.The scene presented to us in this vision is but an introduction to thesolemn scenes of awful judgment immediately following. The first thingthat attracted John's attention was a sign, great and marvelous, "sevenangels having the seven last plagues." The reason why these aredenominated the "last plagues" is because that "in them is filled up thewrath of God." These are the completion, then, the finishing up of thework of divine judgment against the persecutors of the church. When thelast one is poured out the work is done, the time of judgment is over.These angels are not designed to symbolize any agencies on earth, forthey do not appear on earth; they are simply the conductors of theRevelation. God never commissions his people on earth to perform suchgreat judgments upon their persecutors as the temporal judgments of theseven last plagues will be shown to be; but, on the contrary, he hasgiven them the express command not to avenge themselves, but to sufferwrong. He himself lays exclusive claim to this prerogative, saying,"Vengeance is _mine_; I will repay, saith the Lord." Rom. 12:19.As soon as the subject of the plagues is introduced and before they arepoured out, the narrative suddenly changes and a short history of God'sredeemed saints is given. This, perhaps, thus occurs for two reasons--toassist us in fixing the chronology of the events described and toencourage us with the thought that, even while the awful judgments ofGod are being "made manifest" upon the haughty oppressors of earth, Godhas a chosen people who have "gotten the victory over the beast, andover his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name."They stand upon the "sea of glass, having the harps of God"--a symbol ofmelody and praise--and sing the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb.The song of Moses was that sung by the Israelites when they had escapedto the further side of the Red Sea, thus securing perfect deliverancefrom their enemies. So, also, this company of worshipers sing a greatsong of deliverance--deliverance from the beast and his image. Inchapters 4 and 5 John saw the great host redeemed before the apostasystanding on this sea of glass, singing the song of redemption--the songof the Lamb--but this company are enabled to sing another song aswell--the song of deliverance--for they have "gotten the victory overthe beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number ofhis name." Halleluiah! "Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord GodAlmighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints."As before stated (chap. 8:3), the heavenly world as opened up to Johnappeared symbolized after the sanctuary of the temple. By "the temple ofthe tabernacle of the testimony," out of which the seven angels camefully prepared for their work, is meant the most holy place of thesanctuary, called "the tabernacle of the testimony" because there wasdeposited in it, beneath the wings of the cherubim, the ark of thetestimony, or God's covenant. It was therefore as from the most holyplace of the sanctuary--from the very presence of the Deity--that theseangels went forth commissioned to execute the seven last plagues. Thisshows that they went by the divine command as ministers of vengeance.The purity and beauty of their attire denoted both the spotlessexcellency of their characters and the justice of the work in which theywere to engage. Although theirs was a work of awful avenging judgment,still the garments they wore would not be soiled thereby; and theirflowing robes of white were girded up with a beautiful golden girdle.Therefore there is no inconsistency between the purity and love of Godand the work of his vengeance. It would seem to human reasoning that thetwo are irreconcilable, but these symbols teach differently.These angels received their vials (goblets) of wrath at the hands of oneof the four living creatures, who are symbols of the redeemed sons ofearth. Their deliverance by one of these doubtless denotes that thesejudgments were to be executed in their behalf and in answer to theirprayers. For centuries the wrath of deadly persecutors had been pouredout upon God's people, until the cry ascended from the lips of themartyrs, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge andavenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" Chap. 6:10. Now theirprayer is answered, and by their hand, as it were, the vials of wrathare delivered with the divine sanction unto the seven angels to bepoured out upon these proud oppressors of the Lord's people. Thesevials, too, were "full of wrath." What a fearful expression! _Full ofwrath_, even "_the wrath of God_, who liveth forever and ever." Therewas nothing in them but wrath and that to the very brim.As soon as the vials were delivered, "the temple was filled with smokefrom the glory of God." This symbol is taken from the Shekinah whichfilled the ancient tabernacle. We read that when the tabernacle wasfinished, "a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the gloryof the Lord filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter intothe tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and theglory of the Lord filled the tabernacle." Ex. 40:34, 35. The same thingoccurred at the dedication of Solomon's temple. "The cloud filled thehouse of the Lord, so that the priests could not stand to ministerbecause of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the house ofthe Lord." 1 Kings 8:10, 11. So, also, in the symbol before us the gloryof God filled the temple so that no man was able to enter. This isintended to set forth the fact that these avenging judgments were forthe manifestation of the divine glory and that there was no access tothe throne of God nor to his mercy-seat to alter them or to stay theirexecution. Such is the sublime scene presented to our view preparatoryto the pouring out of the seven last great plagues.CHAPTER XVI.    And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven    angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God    upon the earth.    2. And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth;    and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which    had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his    image.A great voice out of the temple, now filled with the glory of the divinepresence, commanded the seven angels to enter upon their mission. Itcame, therefore, from God, who alone fixed the time for these judgmentsto begin.Before an intelligent explanation of these plagues can be given,however, the following points must be made clear: 1. _Where_ the vialswere poured out. 2. _Upon whom_ they were emptied. 3. _Why_ they werethus poured out. 4. _When_ they were fulfilled, or, rather, at what timethey began to be fulfilled. These points we will first briefly considerin the order named, after which we will discuss the _nature_ of theplagues and their individual application.1. The place where these vials of wrath were poured out was "upon theearth"; that is, the Apocalyptic earth, or that portion of the earthmade the special subject of Apocalyptic vision; namely, the territory ofthe ten kingdoms. The last two vials, however, will be found to embracea larger territory.2. They were poured out upon those "which had the mark of the beast, andupon them which worshiped his image." It has already been shown that theimage made by the second beast of chapter 13 was the Protestantecclesiastical organizations; hence the "beast" here referred to, towhich the image was made, must signify the ecclesiastical hierarchy ofRome, the original. So the plagues fell upon the adherents of bothorganized Romanism and Protestantism in Europe.3. The reason why the judgments of the first three vials especiallydescended upon them was because "they had shed the blood of saints andprophets." Verse 6. That Romanism was a fierce oppressor of God's peoplehas already been noticed: Protestantism as their persecutor, also, mustnow be considered further. Protestant sects after they first becameestablished and got power in their own hands, acted much in the samemanner as the church of Rome did before them, persecuting, banishing,imprisoning, and even putting to death those who refused to receivetheir tenets or to conform to the system of religion they had adopted.The Lutherans, at first a pious, persecuted people, on becoming numerousand exalted by the favor of the great, established a certain system ofreligion and then, when it was in their power, persecuted, imprisoned,banished, or put to death all that dissented. As early after theReformation as 1574, in a convention at Torgaw, they established thereal presence in the eucharist and instigated the Elector of Saxony toseize, imprison, and banish all the secret Calvinists that differed fromthem in sentiment, and to reduce their followers by every act ofviolence, to renounce their sentiments and to confess the ubiquity.Peucer, for his opinions, suffered ten years of imprisonment in theseverest manner. In 1577 a form of concord was produced in which thereal manducation of Christ's body and blood in the eucharist wasestablished and heresy and excommunication laid on all that refused thisas an article of faith, with pains and penalties to be enforced by thesecular arm. Crellius, in 1601, was put to death.In Switzerland, before the city of Zurich was entirely safe itself fromthe encroachments of Romanism, its Protestant council condemned a youngman named Felix Mantz to be drowned because he insisted that thebaby-sprinkling of Romanism was not baptism and that all who hadreceived the rite ought to be immersed. This sentence was carried intoeffect. The severest laws were passed in different countries of Europeagainst the Anabaptists, and large numbers were banished or burnt at thestake. See Encyclopaedia Britannica, Art. Anabaptists. Protestants mayclaim this was because of their fanaticism on other lines; but itremains a fact, nevertheless, that the chief sentiment at the base ofthese laws was religious persecution and that Protestants sanctioned andcarried them into execution.King Henry VIII., the founder of the Established Church in England,adopted the most stringent laws to enforce its doctrines. Certainarticles of religion were drawn up, known in history as the "Bloody SixArticles." Concerning these the People's Cyclopaedia says: "The doctrineswere substantially those of the Roman Catholic Church. Whoever deniedthe first articles (that embodying the doctrine of transubstantiation)was to be declared a heretic, and burnt without opportunity ofabjuration; whoso spoke against the other five articles should, for thefirst offense, forfeit his property; and whosoever refused to abjure hisfirst offense, or committed a second, was to die like a felon." Art.Henry VIII. "The royal reformer persecuted alike Catholics andProtestants. Thus, on one occasion, three Catholics who denied that theking was the rightful head of the church, and three Protestants whodisputed the doctrine of the real presence in the sacrament,... weredragged on the same sled to the place of execution." In speaking of thatperiod of history and of the religious persecutions of the times, Myerssays: "Punishment of heresy was then regarded, by both Catholics andProtestants alike, as a duty which could be neglected by those inauthority only at the peril of Heaven's displeasure. Believing this,those of that age could consistently do nothing less than labor toexterminate heresy with axe, sword and fagot." General History, p. 553.That religious intolerance even at a later date was practised inEngland, witness the twelve years' imprisonment of John Bunyan and thehundreds confined in jails throughout that country for not conforming tothe established religion. It was such severe persecution by that earlyProtestant sect that drove the Puritans from England's fair country tothe then inhospitable shores of America, that they might have anopportunity to worship God according to the dictates of their ownconscience. In Scotland the Covenanters "insisted on their right toworship God in their own way. They were therefore subjected to mostcruel and unrelenting persecution. They were hunted by English troopersover their native moors and among the wild recesses of their mountains,whither they secretly retired for prayer and worship. The tales of thesuffering of the Scotch Covenanters at the hands of the EnglishProtestants form a most harrowing chapter of the records of the ages ofreligious persecution." This list might be considerably augmented, butit is unnecessary. However, that Protestant persecution and tyrannyshould never reach the enormous extent of the Romanists before them isproved by the fact that her horns were "like a lamb." Chap. 13:11.4. It is very important for us to ascertain the _time_ for the beginningof these plagues; for they can not be identified unless we understandthe chronology of the events described. It is a fact no one can questionthat the seventh plague is the judgment of the last day, for in theseven "is filled up" the wrath of God; hence they are denominated the_last_ plagues. It is also a fact, well-known to all who are spiritualand who understand the truth in the present reformation, that certainevents said to occur under the period of the sixth plague are _now_taking place; namely, the confederation of all false religions to opposethe people of God, led on by the "unclean spirits" that come "out of themouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of themouth of the false prophet." Verses 13, 14.Therefore five of the plagues precede the time in which we are nowliving. It is evident that the plagues could not begin before thereformation; for the vials were poured out upon the "image of thebeast"--Protestantism--also. Hence we are directed to some periodbetween the sixteenth century and the present day for theircommencement. The reason _why_ the first judgments especially werepoured out will assist us in determining the starting-point--"They haveshed the blood of saints and prophets." This expression seems toindicate that the time for the plagues to begin was after Romanism andProtestantism ceased putting people to death because of their religioussentiments. That this is the correct idea is clearly proved by what wassaid to the martyrs when they cried unto God for the avenging of theirblood on them that dwell on the earth. "And it was said unto them, thatthey should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow-servantsalso and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should befulfilled." Chap. 6:10, 11. For additional information concerning theterrible persecutions that followed the Sixteenth Century Reformation,see remarks on chapter 6:10, 11.We must now determine about what time the great persecutions referred toceased, or nearly ceased, and that will give us the right starting-pointfrom which to reckon the pouring out of the first vial. In A.D. 1685 therevocation of the Edict of Nantes, by Louis XIV. of France, took place,and in the terrible persecutions that occurred during his reign threehundred thousand are said to have lost their lives. The time that we areendeavoring to establish, then, must be later than the seventeenthcentury. Louis died in 1714. Persecutions continued from time to time inFrance, with considerable severity, until about the middle of thecentury. "Soon after this ... the flowing of heretic blood ceased,though an effort was made in 1765 by the Popish clergy to resist thetendency to toleration by a remonstrance to the king." History ofRomanism, p. 608. A few individual cases of persecution may haveoccurred later in other countries; but in the main we are safe inpointing to about the middle of the eighteenth century for the generalcessation of these religious _murders_. We will now consider the natureof the first plague.The pouring out of this vial produced the most painful malignant ulcersupon the human body. Such ulcers are evidently not political calamities;for the symbol is drawn, not from nature, but from human life. Still, itis not drawn from a human being as a whole (in which case religiousevents would be symbolized), but only from his body. What, then, is theanalagous object of which the human body may stand as a properrepresentative? Evidently, the mind. We would naturally pass from thebodily to the mental; and what painful ulcers are to the one, marringits beauty and filling it with burning anguish, such are blasphemousopinions and malignant principles to the other.Considering the time for this plague pointed out above, the student ofRevelation who is acquainted with the history of the past will scarcelyfail to discern at once, in the striking points of this symbol, thosehorrible principles of infidelity, atheism, and licentiousness, whichwere spread so extensively over Europe during the latter half of theeighteenth century, and which were the most efficient causes in bringingabout the fearful convulsions which followed in the French Revolution.That all may understand this matter in its proper light, however, itwill be necessary to state some of the facts respecting this "noisomeand grievous sore" that fell at that time upon the inhabitants ofEurope. In writing upon the causes that led up to the French Revolution,Mr. Wickes gathered the following facts of history mainly from theEncyclopaedia of Religious Knowledge, under the articles headed_Philosophists_ and _Illuminati_. I will quote his own language, as itis very pointed."Philosophists was a name given to several persons in France, whoentered into a combination to overthrow the religion of Jesus, anderadicate from the human heart every religious sentiment. The man moreparticularly to whom this idea first occurred, was Voltaire, who beingweary (as he said himself) of hearing it repeated that twelve men weresufficient to establish Christianity, resolved to prove that one mightbe sufficient to overturn it. Full of this project, he swore, before theyear 1730, to devote his life to its accomplishment, and for some timehe flattered himself that he should enjoy alone the glory of destroyingthe Christian religion. He found, however, that associates would benecessary; and from the numerous tribe of his admirers and disciples, hechose D'Alembert and Diderot, as the most proper persons to co-operatewith him in his designs. He contrived also to enlist Frederick II., kingof Prussia, who became one of his most zealous coadjutors, until hefound that Voltaire was waging war with the throne as well as the altar.This, indeed, was not originally Voltaire's intention. He was vain; fromnatural disposition an aristocrat, and an admirer of royalty. But whenhe found that almost every sovereign but Frederick disapproved of hisambitious designs, as soon as he perceived their issue, he determined tooppose all the governments on earth rather than forfeit the glory withwhich he flattered himself, of vanquishing Christ and his apostles inthe field of controversy."He now set himself, with his associates, D'Alembert and Diderot, toexcite universal discontent with the established order of things. Forthis purpose, they formed secret societies, assumed new names, andemployed an enigmatical language. In their secret meetings theyprofessed to celebrate the mysteries of _Mythra_; and their greatobject, as they professed to one another, was to confound the wretch,meaning Jesus Christ. Hence their secret watchword was 'Crush thewretch.' The following are some of their doctrines, as found in theirbooks expressly designed for general circulation. Sometimes standing outin their naked horror, at other times enveloped in sophistry anddisguise. The Universal Cause, that God of the philosophers, of theJews, and of the Christians, is but a chimera and a phantom--Thephenomena of nature only prove the existence of God to a fewprepossessed men--It is more reasonable to admit, with Manes, of atwo-fold God, than of the God of Christianity--We can not know whether aGod really exists, or whether there is any difference between good andevil, or vice and virtue--Nothing can be more absurd than to believe thesoul a spiritual being--The immortality of the soul, so far fromstimulating men to the practise of virtue, is nothing but a barbarous,desperate, fatal tenet, and contrary to all legislation--All ideas ofjustice and injustice, of virtue and vice, of glory and infamy, arepurely arbitrary, and dependent on custom--Conscience and remorse arenothing but the foresight of those physical penalties to which crimesexpose us--The man who is above the law, can commit, without remorse,the dishonest act that may serve his purpose--The fear of God, so farfrom being the beginning of wisdom, should be the beginning offolly--The command to love one's parents is more the work of educationthan of nature--Modesty is only an invention of refinedvoluptuousness--The law which condemns married people to live together,becomes barbarous and cruel on the day they cease to love one another."Such were the atrocious sentiments, though sometimes artfully veiled,which were disseminated in their books, and which, spreading all overEurope, imperceptibly took possession of the public mind, and preparedthe way for the subversion of religion, morals, and government. As soonas the sale of the works was sufficient to pay expenses, inferioreditions were printed and given away, or sold at a very low price;circulating libraries of them were formed, and reading societiesinstituted. While they constantly denied these productions to the world,they contrived to give them a false celebrity through their confidentialagents and correspondents, who were not themselves always trusted withthe entire secret."By degrees they got possession nearly of all the reviews and periodicalpublications; established a general intercourse, by means of hawkers andpedlars, with the distant provinces; and instituted an office to supplyall schools with teachers; and thus did they acquire unprecedenteddominion over every species of literature, over the minds of all ranksof people, and the education of the youth, without giving any alarm tothe world. The lovers of wit and polite literature were caught byVoltaire; the men of science were perverted, and children corrupted inthe first rudiments of learning, by D'Alembert and Diderot; strongerappetites were fed by the secret club of Baron Holbach; the imaginationsof the higher orders were set dangerously afloat by Montesquieu; and themultitude of all ranks was surprised, confounded, and hurried away byRousseau. Thus was the public mind in France completely corrupted, andthe way prepared for the dreadful scenes that followed."But there is also another chapter to the dark history of this "noisomeand grievous sore." The same author says again:"After Voltaire had broached his system of infidel philosophy, andbrought it unto perfection, it was taken up by the celebrated Dr. AdamWeishaupt, professor of canon law in the University of Ingolstadt, andby him perfected as a system of light or illuminism. On the 1st of May,1776, he founded, among the students of the above-named University, asecret society under the name of the _Illuminati_, whose avowed objectwas to diffuse the light of science, these secret societies being somany radiating centers of light. But the science taught was the mostatrocious infidelity, and its object the overturning of all governmentand religion. Free masonry, being in high repute all over Europe whenWeishaupt first formed the plan of his society, he availed himself ofits secrecy to introduce his new order, which rapidly spread, by theefforts of its founders and disciples, through all those countries, andfound its way even to the United States. It would not be possible hereto give even an outline of the nature and constitution of thisextraordinary society--of its secrets and mysteries--of the deepdissimulation, consummate hypocrisy, and shocking impiety of its founderand his associates--of their Jesuitical arts in concealing their realobjects, and their incredible industry and astonishing exertions inmaking converts--of the absolute despotism and complete system of_espionage_ established throughout the order--of the blind obedienceexacted of the _novices_, and the absolute power of life and deathassumed by the order and conceded by the novices--of the pretendedmorality, real blasphemies, and absolute atheism of the founder and histried friends. Reference can only be made to these things aswell-established facts."It is important here to bear in mind one or two facts, in order torealize what an engine of corruption this secret organization of the_Illuminati_ was. One fact is, the high popularity which these secretsocieties at that period enjoyed. It was unbounded. There is somethingwhich commends such secret organizations most powerfully to the depravedhuman nature. Men love them because they are secret, and because theycan wield such tremendous power. The other fact to be considered, is theabsence, to a such vast extent, of the controlling elements of truereligion in the European mind, and its predisposition to skepticism. TheReformation of the Sixteenth Century had broken the shackles of priestlyPapal superstition over the human mind; and [true] evangelical doctrinenot being introduced to supply the vacuum, the mass swung readily overfrom the regions of dark superstition to blank atheism. Thus were theelements ready prepared to hand for such spirits as Voltaire,D'Alembert, Diderot, Weishaupt, and others, to work upon, and by reasonof their secret powerful agencies, to mould to their own liking."It was now this damning system of infidelity, under the specious nameof philosophy, light, and science, spread with such untiring industryover the European mind, that unhinged the whole framework of society,and prepared it, like a vast magazine, for an awful explosion. All theprinciples that held society together in the fear of God and futureretribution--regard for human law--respect for magistrates, parents, andthe marriage-tie--yea, in the very distinctions of virtue and vice, hadbeen unsettled or taken away. They had been reasoned down and laughedout of the world; and when these only restraints, which God has imposedupon human selfishness and passion were removed, what was then to holdback those fierce passions and that deep selfishness from the mostunbounded excesses? God was no more feared--government was no moresacred--religion was a delusion--immorality was a lie--virtue was aname--the marriage-tie was a farce--modesty was refined voluptuousness:and when men were persuaded of these things, society began to roll andheave under the long swells of that portentous storm of wrath which wassoon to break, in all its desolating fury, over the earth."In the facts here presented it may be seen how far we are justified inapplying to them this first vial of wrath. The vial was poured out "uponthe earth"--on the inhabitants of the ten kingdoms when in a state oftranquility. This was their condition, unsuspicious of danger, when thedread infection was spread through society. According to the testimonyof Pres. Dwight, within ten years from the first establishment of theIlluminati, in 1776, "they were established in great numbers throughGermany, Sweden, Prussia, Poland, Austria, Holland, France, Switzerland,Italy, England, Scotland, and America. They spread with a rapidity whichnothing but fact could have induced any sober mind to believe."This system of infidelity is well symbolized by a noisome, greviousulcer, which is loathsome to the sight, offensive to the smell,corrupting to the body, and productive of awful pain. That it appearedso to others besides the author of the Revelation is shown by thefollowing epithets which Burke, the celebrated English orator, appliedto the spirit of the French Revolution, which was only the dischargedvirus of these ulcers. He styled it "the fever of Jacobinism;" "theepidemic of atheistical fanaticism;" "an evil lying deep in thecorruptions of human nature;" "such a plague, that the precaution of themost severe quarantine ought to be established against it." The result,he says, was "the corruption of all morals," "the decomposition of allsociety." What greater plague could fall upon Romanism and Protestantismthan this fearful scourge of infidelity?I have dwelt for a considerable length of time upon this subject,because of its deep interest, and also because I desired to verify theapplication of the symbol as much as possible, on account of its closeconnection with the pouring out of the vials which follow.    3. And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it    became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in    the sea.This vial was poured out upon the "sea." The sea is a large body ofwater within the earth, subject to violent storms and agitations. As asymbol it would denote some central power or kingdom within the symbolicearth in a state of revolution. The effects produced by this vial weretwo-fold--the waters were changed into blood as of a dead man, and allthe living creatures in the sea died. The waters of the sea representthe inhabitants of this kingdom (see a similar explanation of _water_ inchap. 17:15) as the earth does the inhabitants of the empire, or the tenkingdoms. The living creatures in the sea, therefore, could signify therulers and princes of the kingdom, as they bear an analagous relation tothe people that fishes do to the waters. The statement that the watersof the sea became "as the blood of a dead man" is doubtless intended tosignify a much more dreadful state of things than if they had simplybeen changed to blood. They were converted into black and poisonous, orcorrupt, blood. This denotes the vast slaughter and massacre of theinhabitants of this kingdom; while the death of the living creaturesdenotes the extinction of those in power.It may appear at first that making the conversion of water into blood asymbol of bloodshed is adopting the literal method of interpretation;but not so, and for the following reason: The symbol is taken fromnature, the waters of the sea representing the inhabitants of thekingdom. The waters are changed into an unnatural state or element, thatof blood, and this change denotes an analagous one passing upon theinhabitants. Their continuing in life would be their remaining aswaters: their massacre and destruction would be the waters changed toblood--a horrible and unnatural element. Likewise, the death of theliving things in the sea is a similar destruction overtaking the kings,rulers, and princes.With our understanding of the nature of the first vial, which preparedthe way for the pouring out of this one, we shall have no difficultywhatever in identifying this symbol with the terrible convulsions of theFrench Revolution. It followed as a necessary consequence of the first.Voltaire and his coadjutors had insulted and trampled in the dusteverything held sacred in human eyes, and this fully prepared the wayfor the scenes of terror that followed.In studying these vials the reader should bear in mind constantly thereason _why_ they were sent as judgments upon the nations ofEurope--because of their former oppression of God's people. From thedays when the Popes received their first temporal authority at the handsof the Carlovingian king, Pepin and Charlemagne, France[11] constitutedthe real backbone of the Papacy, the very center of her power andauthority, as all history will show. In the fourteenth century the Papalseat was removed from Rome to Avignon, in France, where it remained forabout seventy years. During this period all the Popes were French, and"all their policies were shaped and controlled by the French kings." Towrite a history of the Papacy during the Dark Ages is to outline thehistory of France, so closely are their affairs interwoven. Hence it isonly natural that she should be symbolized as the "sea" in this part ofthe Apocalypse, with the other nations as tributaries. Ver. 4-6. Thatthe French Revolution was in its effects a terrible blow to the thronesof despotism throughout Europe is shown by the following quotation fromthe Encyclopaedia Britannica: "We are coming to the verge of the FrenchRevolution, which _surpasses all other revolutions the world has seen_in its completeness, the largeness of its theatre, the long preparationfor it ... its _influence on the modern history of Europe_." Art.France.[Footnote 11: Pepin and Charlemagne were, properly speaking, simplyGerman princes reigning in Gaul. The kingdom of France is usually datedfrom the accession of the first of the Capetian kings, late in the tenthcentury, 987. However, the Frankish nation, of whom the Carlovingiankings were leaders, laid the foundation of the French kingdom and gave anew name to Gaul--France.]This revolution commenced on the fifth of May, 1789, in the Convocationof the States General, for the redress of grievances and the extricationof the government and nation from the difficulties under which they werelaboring. A conflict had been going on between despotism and popularrights, the throne and nobility contending for absolute power, and thepeople, for freedom. But when in this encounter the popular partytriumphed, there was no fear of God before the eyes of those who seizedthe reins of government. The infidelity of Voltaire and his associateshad removed the last restraint upon human passion, and the scenes ofterror that followed are without a parallel in history. The king wascondemned to death and executed. The barbarous execution of the queen,Marie Antoinette, followed in about six months, and this was immediatelysucceeded by the decree of the National Convention, of the most infamouscharacter, that of the violation of the tombs of St. Dennis and theprofanation of the sepulchres of the kings of France. I will quote fromSir A. Alison's noted History of Europe:"By a decree of the Convention, these venerable asylums of departedgreatness were ordered to be destroyed.... A furious multitudeprecipitated itself out of Paris; the tombs of Henry IV., of Francis I.,and of Louis XII., were ransacked, and their bones scattered in the air.Even the glorious name of Turenne could not protect his grave fromspoilation. His remains were almost undecayed, as when he received thefatal wound on the banks of the Lech. The bones of Charles V., thesavior of his country, were dispersed. At his feet was found the coffinof the faithful Du Gueselin, and the French hands profaned the skeletonbefore which English invasion had rolled back. Most of these tombs werefound to be strongly secured. Much time, and no small exertion of skilland labor, were required to burst their barriers. They would haveresisted forever the decay of time or the violence of enemies; theyyielded to the fury of domestic dissension. This was followedimmediately by a general attack upon the monuments and remains ofantiquity throughout all France. The sepulchres of the great of pastages, of the barons and generals of the feudal ages, of thepaladins, and of the crusaders, were involved in one undistinguishedruin. It seemed as if the glories of antiquity were forgotten, or soughtto be buried in oblivion. The tomb of Du Gueselin shared the same fateas that of Louis XIV. The skulls of monarchs and heroes were tossedabout like foot balls by the profane multitude; like the grave-diggersin Hamlet, they made a jest of the lips before which the nations hadtrembled."Having begun by waging this profane warfare upon their own gloriousdead, another scene of the fatal drama immediately succeeded. The sameauthor continues: "Having massacred the great of the present andinsulted the illustrious of former ages, nothing remained to therevolutionists but to direct their vengeance against heaven itself.Pache, Hebert, and Chaumette, the leaders of the municipality publiclyexpressed their determination 'to dethrone the God of heaven, as well asthe monarchs of earth.' To accomplish this design, they prevailed onGobet, the apostate constitutional bishop of Paris, to appear at the barof the Assembly, accompanied by some of the clergy of his diocese, andthere abjure the Christian faith. He declared 'that no other nationalreligion was now required but that of Liberty, equality, and morality.'Many of the constitutional bishops and clergy in the Convention joinedin the proposition. Crowds of drunken artisans and shameless prostitutescrowded to the bar, and trampled under their feet the sacred vases,consecrated for ages to the holiest purposes of religion. The churcheswere stripped of all their ornaments; their plate and valuable contentsbrought in heaps to the municipality and the Convention, from whencethey were sent to the mint to be melted down. Trampling under foot theimages of our Savior and the Virgin, they elevated, amid shouts ofapplause, the busts of Marat and Lepelletier, and danced around them,singing parodies on the Halleluiah, and dancing the Carmagnole."Shortly after a still more indecent exhibition took place before theassembly.... Hebert and Chaumette, and their associates, appeared at thebar and declared 'that God did not exist, and that the worship of Reasonwas to be substituted in his stead.' A veiled female, arrayed in bluedrapery, was brought into the Assembly; and Chaumette, taking her by thehand, 'Mortals,' said he, 'cease to tremble before the powerlessthunders of a God whom your fears have created. Henceforth acknowledgeno divinity but Reason. I offer you its noblest and purest image; if youmust have idols, sacrifice only to this.' When, letting fall the veil,he exclaimed, 'Fall before the august Senate of Freedom, O Veil ofReason!' At the same time, the goddess appeared personified by acelebrated beauty, the wife of Momoro, a printer, known in more than onecharacter to most of the Convention. The goddess after being embraced bythe president, was mounted on a magnificent car, and conducted, amid animmense crowd, to the cathedral of Notre Dame, to take the place of theDeity. There she was elevated on a high altar, and received theadoration of all present, while the young women, her attendants, whosealluring looks already sufficiently indicated their profession, retiredinto the chapels around the choir, where every species of licentiousnessand obscenity was indulged in without control, with hardly any veil fromthe public gaze. To such a length was this carried, that Robespierreafterward declared that Chaumette deserved death for the abominations hehad permitted on that occasion. Thenceforward that ancient edifice wascalled the _Temple of Reason_."Such horrible events are sickening to relate; but as I started out todescribe the condition of this "sea" when it became as the blood of adead man, I must be faithful to the task. God was now dethroned; theservices of religion abandoned; every tenth day set apart for thehellish orgies of atheism and Reason; Marat was deified; the instrumentof death sanctified by the name "the holy Guillotine"; on the publiccemeteries was inscribed, "Death is an Eternal Sleep"; marriage was acivil contract, binding only during the pleasure of the contractingparties. Mademoiselle Arnout, a celebrated comedian, expressed thepublic feeling when she said, "_Marriage the sacrament of adultery_."What an awful harvest would be expected of such seed! Alison continues:"A Revolutionary Tribunal was formed at Nantes, under the direction ofCarrier, and it soon outstripped even the rapid march of Danton andRobespierre. Their principle was that it was necessary to destroy _enmasse_, all the prisoners. At their command was formed a corps, calledthe Legion of Marat, composed of the most determined and bloodthirsty ofthe revolutionists, the members of which were entitled, on their ownauthority, to incarcerate any person whom they chose. The number oftheir prisoners was soon between three and four thousand, and theydivided among themselves all their property. Whenever a further supplyof captives was wanted, the alarm was spread of a counter-revolution,the _generale_ beat, the cannon planted; and this was followedimmediately by innumerable arrests. Nor were they long in disposing oftheir captives. The miserable wretches were either slain with poinardsin prison, or carried out in a vessel and drowned by wholesale in theLoire. On one occasion a hundred 'fanatical priests,' as they weretermed, were taken out together, striped of their clothes, andprecipitated into the waters.... Women big with child, infants eight,nine, and ten years of age, were thrown together into the stream, on thesides of which men, armed with sabres, were placed to cut off theirheads if the waves should throw them undrowned on the shore."On one occasion, by orders of Carrier, twenty-three of therevolutionists, on another twenty-four, were guillotined without anytrial. The executioner remonstrated, but in vain. Among them were manychildren of seven or eight years of age, and seven women; theexecutioner died two or three days after, with horror at what he himselfhad done. So great was the multitude of captives who were brought in onall sides, that the executioners, as well as the company of Marat,declared themselves exhausted with fatigue; and a new method ofdisposing of them was adopted, borrowed from Nero, but improved on theplan of that tyrant. A hundred or a hundred and fifty victims, for themost part women and children, were crowded together in a boat, with aconcealed trap-door in the bottom, which was conducted into the middleof the Loire; at a signal given, the crew leaped into another boast, thebolts were withdrawn, and the shrieking victims precipitated into thewaters, amid the laughter of the company of Marat, who stood on thebanks to cut down any who approached the shore. This was what Carriercalled his _Republican Baptisms_. The _Republican Marriages_ were, ifpossible, a still greater refinement of cruelty. Two persons ofdifferent sexes, bereft of every species of dress, were bound together,and after being left in torture in that situation for half an hour,thrown into the river. Such was the quantity of corpses accumulated inthe Loire, that the water of that river was affected, so as to render apublic ordinance necessary, forbidding the use of it to the inhabitants;and the mariners, when they heaved their anchors, frequently brought upboats charged with corpses. Birds of prey flocked to the shores and fedon human flesh; while the very fish became so poisonous, as to induce anorder of the municipality of Nantes, prohibiting them to be taken by thefishermen."The scenes in the prisons which preceded these horrible executionsexceeded all that romance had figured of the terrible. Many women diedof terror the moment a man entered their cells, conceiving that theywere about to be led out to the noyades; the floors were covered withthe bodies of their infants, numbers of whom were yet quivering in theagonies of death. On one occasion, the inspector entered the prison toseek for a child, where, the evening before, he had left above threehundred infants; they were all gone in the morning, having been drownedthe preceding night. Fifteen thousand persons perished either under thehands of the executioner, or of disease in prison, in one month: thetotal victims of the Reign of Terror at that place exceeded thirtythousand."After narrating scenes of terror in Paris, Alison says again: "Suchaccumulated horrors annihilated all the charities and intercourse oflife. Before daybreak the shops of the provision merchants were besiegedby crowds of women and children, clamoring for the food which the law ofthe _maximum_ in general prevented them from obtaining. The farmerstrembled to bring their fruits to the market, the shop-keepers to exposethem to sale. The richest quarters of the town were deserted; noequipages of crowds of passengers were to be seen on the streets; thesinister words, _Propriete Nationale_, imprinted in large characters onthe walls, everywhere showed how far the work of confiscation hadproceeded. Passengers hesitated to address their most intimate friendson meeting; the extent of calamity had rendered men suspicious even ofthose they loved most. Every one assumed the coarsest dress, and themost squalid appearance; an elegant exterior would have been the certainforerunner of destruction. At one hour only were any symptoms ofanimation seen: it was when the victims were conveyed to execution; thehumane fled with horror from the sight, the infuriated rushed in crowdsto satiate their eyes with the sight of human agony."Night came, but with it no diminution of the anxiety of the people.Every family early assembled its members; with trembling looks theygazed around the room, fearful that the very walls might harbortraitors. The sound of a foot, the stroke of a hammer, a voice in thestreets, froze all hearts with horror. If a knock was heard at the door,every one, in agonized suspense, expected his fate. Unable to enduresuch protracted misery, numbers committed suicide. 'Had the reign ofRobespierre,' said Freron, 'continued longer, multitudes would havethrown themselves under the guillotine; the first of social affections,the love of life, was already extinguished in almost every heart.'"With one more quotation from this historian I will dismiss this horribletheme: "The combination of wicked men who thereafter governed France, iswithout parallel in the history of the world. Their power, based on theorganized weight of the multitude, and the ardent co-operation of themunicipalities, everywhere installed by them in the position of power,was irresistible. All bowed the neck before this gigantic assemblage ofwickedness. The revolutionary excesses daily increased, in consequenceof the union which the constant dread of retribution produced amongtheir perpetrators. There was no medium between taking part in theseatrocities, and falling a victim to them. Virtue seemed powerless;energy appeared only in the extremity of resignation; religion in theheroism of which death was endured. There was not a hope left forFrance, had it not been for the dissentions which, as the natural resultof their wickedness, sprung up among the authors of the publiccalamities."It is impossible not to be struck, in looking back on the fate of thesedifferent parties, with the singular and providential manner in whichtheir crimes brought about their own punishment. No foreigninterposition was necessary, no avenging angel was required to vindicatethe justice of divine administration. They fell the victims of their ownatrocity, of the passions which they themselves had let loose, of theinjustice of which they had given the first example to others TheConstitutionalists overthrew the ancient monarchy, and formed a limitedgovernment; but their imprudence in raising popular ambition paved theway for the tenth of August, and speedily brought themselves to thescaffold; the Girondists established their favored dream of a republic,and were the first victims of the fury which it excited; the Dantonistsroused the populace against the Gironde, and soon fell under the axewhich they had prepared for their rivals; the anarchists defied thepower of 'heaven itself,' but scarce were their blasphemies uttered,when they were swept off by the partners of their bloody triumphs. Oneonly power remained, alone, terrible, irresistible. This was the powerof Death, wielded by a faction steeled against every feeling ofhumanity, dead to every principle of justice. In their iron hands, orderresumed its sway from the influence of terror; obedience becameuniversal, from the extinction of hope. Silent and unresisted, they ledtheir victims to the scaffold, dreaded alike by the soldiers whocrouched, the people who trembled, and the victims who suffered. Thehistory of the world _has no parallel_ to that long night of suffering,because _it has none to the guilt which preceded it_; tyranny neverassumed so hideous a form, because licentiousness never required sosevere a punishment."Prom this awful description, which might be carried to almost anyextent, the reader will understand the force of the prophecy whichdeclared that the "sea became as the blood of a dead man, and everyliving soul died in the sea."    4. And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and    fountains of waters; and they became blood.    5. And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous,    O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast    judged thus.    6. For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou    hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.    7. And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God    Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.Fountains and rivers are tributaries to the sea, and thus, theysymbolize the inferior communities and nations belonging to theApocalyptic earth. France was the great central power and the sea ofrevolution upon which the second vial descended. The surrounding nationswere the rivers and fountains upon which the third was poured. It is notsaid of them that they became as the blood of a dead man, nor that everyliving thing in them died, but only that "they became blood." Thissymbol denotes the insurrections and desolating wars in which thenations of Europe were involved for a number of years, growing out ofthe French Revolution. I shall not here take time nor space to enterinto the historical details relating to this statement; the facts arewell known. "The blood-thirsty Jacobinism of France waged war not onlyupon its own monarchy, but sought to overturn all the thrones andfabrics of despotism in Europe. The same system of infidelity andatheism had been spread through the kingdoms there, though not to sogreat an extent as in France, and prepared the elements for revolutionin them likewise." The French republic encouraged these agitations andby a unanimous decree of the Assembly, in 1792, set itself in openhostility with all the established governments of Europe. It was inthese words: "The National Convention declares in the name of the Frenchnation, that it will grant fraternity and assistance to all people whowish to recover their liberty; and it charges the executive power tosend the necessary orders to the generals, to give succor to suchpeople, and to defend those citizens who have suffered, or may suffer inthe cause of liberty." "The Revolution, having accomplished its work inFrance, having there destroyed royal despotism, ... now set itself aboutfulfilling its early promise of giving liberty to all peoples. In aword, the revolutionists became propagandists. France now exhibits whather historians call her social, her communicative genius." Napoleon wasright when he said that a revolution in France was sure to be followedby a revolution throughout Europe. "France conceived the idea that shehad a Divine mission, as the great apostle of liberty, to propagaterepublicanism through all the kingdoms of Europe. In her madness ofintoxication she undertook the work, threw down the gauntlet, and thefierce tocsin of war sounded from nation to nation, until the continentwas converted into one vast battle-field."The "angel of the waters" signifies the angel that had charge of thevial of wrath poured out upon the rivers and fountains of waters. Infull view of the awful plagues sent upon the inhabitants of earth, onegrand thought seemed to occupy his mind--the righteousness of thesejudgments. It is not such a thought as humanity would have in mind whenreading the history of these fearful convulsions of society, one sceneof terror only preparing the way for another more horrible, until theywould feel like closing the book and asking, "When will this awful nightof horror be over? When will these avenging judgments cease?" These,however, were not the thoughts of this angel clothed in spotlessgarments; for, draining his vial to the dregs and forcing the nations todrink it, he said: "Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, andshalt be, because thou hast judged thus. For they have shed the blood ofsaints and prophets, and thou hast given them _blood to drink_; for theyare worthy." Truly, in this the Word of God is fulfilled, which says,"My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways." Isa.55:8. That class of people who represent God as a kind, loving Fatheronly, one who will not take vengeance upon the objects of his owncreation--let them visit in the pages of history these nations ofEurope, scathed and blasted with the hot thunderbolts of divine wrath,until their minds sicken with horror at the sight of human agony andblood. In full view of these horrifying scenes let them hear the angelof the waters saying, "Thou art righteous, O Lord ... because thou hastjudged thus; for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, andthou hast given them blood to drink, for they are worthy"; while anothervoice from heaven, even from the altar, replies, "Even so, Lord GodAlmighty, _true and righteous_ are thy judgments"--and their theologymust here break down.The thoughts just expressed confirm with certainty our interpretation ofthe "sea" and "rivers and fountains of waters" as signifying thosenations which had been the persecutors of the saints, and show, also,the character of the divine judgments as being the shedding of theirblood. They had shed the blood of saints and prophets, and now the samecup of wrath was placed to their lips, and they were forced to drink itto the dregs. God remembered the sighs and groans of his faithfulfollowers; the cry of the martyrs for the avenging of their blood on"them that dwell on the earth" reached his ear; and now the time ofretribution began.    8. And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and    power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.    9. And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the    name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they    repented not to give him glory.The sun is the great central luminary of the earth, under whose geniallight and warmth everything rejoices and develops in forms of beauty.When, however, a scorching power is given to his rays, the earth becomesas a furnace in which every green thing is burnt up. What the sun is tothis world, such are the ruling powers to a kingdom; and power beinggiven them to scorch as with fire denotes that the government would beadministered, not for the good of the people, but for the purpose ofoppression. A scorching sun, therefore, is a proper symbol of tyrantrulers.Still keeping in view the object of God in sending these firstplagues--the punishment of the nations embraced within the territory ofthe ten former kingdoms of Europe--we are directed with certainty to thenext great scourge that followed as a result of those alreadydeveloped--the almost universal military empire of Napoleon. The successof three of the four greatest military leaders the world has everseen--Alexander, Caesar, and Charlemagne--has been so clearly predictedby inspiration that no believer in the truth of Revelation attempts todeny it; therefore it is not surprising that the fourth--Napoleon--should also be assigned a place in Apocalyptic vision: not so muchbecause of his all-powerful military genius merely, but because of hismighty influence and effects upon the very nations that were especiallymade the subject of prophecy, as they stand connected with the historyof God's people for centuries. At the close of the Revolution the Frenchnation had not virtue nor religion necessary to remedy the evils underwhich they had long been suffering from the oppression of theirmonarchs; for when they undertook the work and demolished the throne,they let loose all the wildest elements of wrath to rage withoutrestraint. The nation rejected God, and God rejected the nation. He gavethem up to their own madness, to the fury of the most atrociouswickedness that was ever developed under heaven. "From the wild excessesand intolerable calamities of blood-red republicanism, the people wererejoiced at length to find a refuge in a gigantic military despotism,which became the terror and scourge of Europe." But the hand of God wasin this thing, also. When the sun scorches the earth with burning heat,it is God that gives it its power. So Napoleon with his iron will andtowering genius was only an instrument in God's hand for scourging theguilty nations. In the ordinary sense of the term Napoleon was not atyrant to his own nation. Still, his government was a despotism toFrance; while to the Apocalyptic earth, or the ten kingdoms, he was ascorching sun, for his empire extended over the whole. It finally becamea saying that "if Napoleon's cocked hat and gray coat should be raisedon the cliffs of Boulogne, all Europe would run to arms." This agreeswith the statement of the historian Judson, concerning the monarchs ofEurope, that "the mere name of Napoleon was a dread to them." None ofthem could stand before his terrible onset. "Europe was shaken from endto end by such armies as the world had not seen since the days ofXerxes. Napoleon, whose hands were upheld by a score of distinguishedmarshals, performed the miracles of genius. His brilliant achievementsstill dazzle, while they amaze, the world." The crowns and scepters ofEurope he held as play-things in his hand, to dispose of at pleasure.Says Wickes: "Never in the history of Christendom were ancient dynastiesoverthrown, and new ones created, kings made and unmade, within so shorta period, as during the unparallelled career of this great conqueror. Hehad the crowns and kingdoms of all Europe in his gift, to settle as hepleased, or bestow as presents upon his relatives and friends. To hisbrother Jerome he gave the crown of Westphalia; to his brother Louis,the crown of Holland; to his brother Joseph, the kingdom of Spain; tohis brother-in-law and general Murat, the kingdom of Naples; and othershe conferred upon his favorite marshals."When he invaded Russia, a territory outside of the Apocalyptic earth, heexceeded his mission, and there met with the most terrible overthrow.Although he entered that kingdom with the most magnificent army that hehad ever gathered together, yet for suffering and disaster that famousretreat from burning Moscow stands without a parallel in history. It wasnot the Russian armies that prevailed against him; it was God thatfought against him with the blasts of his north wind. These speedilysilenced those tremendous parks of artillery that had thundered upon thefields of Jena, Friedland, Wagram, Marengo and Austerlitz, and scatteredthose invincible battalions that had marched triumphant over Europe.Ney, at the head of the National Guards, ever before victorious, wascompelled to beat a hasty retreat, glad to escape with the smallestremnant of his host. Napoleon failed here because God had given him nomission to perform in that territory.Concerning his ambition, the Encyclopaedia Britannica says: "With a frameof iron, Napoleon could endure any hardships; and in war, in artilleryespecially and engineering, he stands unrivalled in the world'shistory.... He could not rest, and knew not when he had achievedsuccess.... He succeeded in alienating the peoples of Europe, in whosebehalf he pretended to be acting. And when they learned by bitterexperience that he had absolutely no love for liberty, and encouragedequality only so long as it was an equality of subjects under his rule,they soon began to war against what was in fact a world-destroyingmilitary despotism." He was inspired with the most unbounded ambition,which was nothing short of despotism over all Europe, if not the world.Universal empire was his grand object, or, as it has been expressed byhistorians, a desire to concentrate "the world in Europe--Europe inFrance--France in Paris--Paris in _himself_." Says Wickes: "The empirewhich he actually reared in Europe was a vast, oppressive, centralizeddespotism.... To build it up, he desolated France through his terribleconscriptions, requiring the whole strength and flower of the nation tosupply his armies. It is stated that after the wars of Napoleon therewere three times the number of women in France that there were of men.The fathers, the husbands, the sons, the brothers, had fallen upon thebattle-field, and thus desolated almost every household in the kingdom.Similar desolation also he carried by his wars into the other kingdoms."The dread of Napoleon settled down upon all the nations of Europe. Theycould not cope with his mighty genius, and therefore his presence was aterror to them. When the allied powers secured his first abdication, in1814, and sent him to the island of Elba, the desolating results of hislong career were shown in the work that the Congress of Vienna wascalled upon to perform when it assembled in the fall of 1814. While therepresentatives of the powers were laboring to repair the damage thathad been wrought and to adjust the territorial limitations of thevarious nations that had been altered or entirely demolished, theassemblage was suddenly surprised the following spring by the news thatNapoleon had escaped from Elba and was enroute to Paris. The terror andconsternation in Europe then experienced is shown by the followingquotation from Sir James Mackintosh, a man of high reputation as ajurist, as a historian, and as a far-sighted and candid statesman:"Was it in the power of language to describe the evil! Wars which hadraged for more than twenty years throughout Europe, which had spreadblood and desolation from Cadiz to Moscow, and from Naples toCopenhagen; which had wasted the means of human enjoyment, and destroyedthe instruments of social improvement; which threatened to diffuse amongthe European nations the dissolute and ferocious habits of a predatorysoldiery ... had been brought to a close.... Europe seemed to breatheafter her sufferings. In the midst of this fair prospect and of theseconsolatory hopes, Napoleon Bonaparte escaped from Elba; three smallvessels reached the coast of Provence; their hopes are instantlydispelled; the work of our toil and fortitude is undone: the blood ofEurope is spilled in vain."The bitterest ingredients in the cup of these nations was thehumiliating overthrow of their own government and their subjection tothe hated _republican_ despotism of France. It was a scorching sun thatthey could not endure. Still, they repented not to give God glory; theycontinued as before. After Napoleon had accomplished the purpose forwhich he was intended, God permitted this stupendous genius to besubdued; but it required the combined powers of Europe to secure hisdownfall.Creasy, in his Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World, says concerningthe battle of Waterloo, "The great battle which ended the twenty-threeyears' war of the first French revolution, and which quelled the manwhose genius and ambition had so long _disturbed and desolated theworld_, deserves to be regarded by us ... with peculiar gratitude forthe repose which it secured for us and for the greater part of the humanrace."    10. And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the    beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed    their tongues for pain,    11. And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and    their sores, and repented not of their deeds.Under this vial the symbols differ somewhat. The "beast" is evidentlythe one of whom the image was made, referred to in verse 2--the Papacy.The seat that the Papacy occupied from the time the dragon resigned infavor of the beast (chap. 13:2) was his position of temporal power andauthority. In the following chapter the Papacy is described as _seated_upon a ten-horned beast, the ten horns of which symbolized the kingdomsof Europe. In this position it was able to exercise a guiding influenceover the European nations. We have already seen what great power thePopes exercised in this direction during the Dark Ages. But the "beast"of chapter 17 himself, as distinguished from his horns, symbolizes theHoly Roman Empire, which was a revival of the old empire of the Caesars.This revived "world-empire" was closely allied to the Papacy. WhenCharlemagne, the Carlovingian king, restored the empire of the West, hewas crowned "Emperor of the Romans" by Pope Leo III., A.D. 800. "ThePopes made the descendants of Charles Martel kings and emperors; thegrateful Frankish princes defended the Popes against all their enemies,imperial and barbarian, and dowering them with cities and provinces,laid the basis of their temporal sovereignty, which continued for morethan a thousand years." After the decline of the Carlovingian power theimperial authority was again revived by Otto the Great (962), who wascrowned Emperor of the Romans by the Pope. Henceforth the empire of theWest was termed the _Holy Roman Empire_. "From this time on it was therule that the German king who was crowned at Aachen had a right to becrowned ... emperor at Rome." So the general rule was that the Popesupheld the emperors, and the emperors sustained the Popes in theirposition as the spiritual heads of the church and as temporal rulersover the Papal states, which were granted them originally by thedonations of Pepin and Charlemagne.In chapter 13 the civil powers of Europe and the ecclesiastical power ofRome are not shown by a double symbol--a woman and a beast--as inchapter 17, but are there represented by a combination of symbols drawnfrom the departments of human life and animal life, which shows that apolitico-religious system is intended, as heretofore explained; hencethe term _beast_, as there used, signifies either the Papacy or thecivil power. Thus the term is used in the present chapter underconsideration, and has reference here to the beast as an ecclesiasticalpower--the Papacy--and his "seat" refers to his temporal authority.This vial, then, being poured out upon his seat, with the result thathis kingdom was filled with darkness--a symbol drawn from nature--pointsto the downfall of the Pope as a temporal ruler. Thus he would bedeprived of his "seat."We have already seen that each plague prepares the way for a succeedingone. Under the reign of Napoleon the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved(1806). This was the beginning of the end of the Pope's temporalauthority; for the two had in a great measure been for agesinterdependent upon each other. Pius VII. was made a prisoner and thetemporal sovereignty of the Roman See declared to be at an end; whilethe Pope himself was forced to disown all claim to rank as a temporalruler. Of course, this was but a temporary overthrow; for when theperiod of Reaction came, the Pope recovered also temporal authority. Butthe vast territories of Avignon, Venaissin, Bologna, Ferrara, and theRomagna--representing fully _a third_ of all the Papal dominions--whichhad been forcibly ceded to France under Napoleon, was never restored tothe Roman See. From that time the sun of the Pope's temporal kingdomrapidly approached the horizon; while the inhabitants of his dominionscontinued to blaspheme God through the atheistical Jacobinism thatinfested to so great an extent the whole mass of society--symbolized bytheir "sores"--and the firm supporters of Popery were filled withexcessive chagrin and mortification of mind--symbolized by their"pains"--because the power of their leader, who professed temporalsovereignty over the whole earth, was being suddenly destroyed and hiskingdom left in darkness. Concerning this matter the People'sCyclopaedia, after speaking of the blow the Pope's spiritual supremacyreceived at the Reformation, says: "But in her relations to the Statethe Roman church has since passed through _a long and criticalstruggle_. The new theories _to which the French Revolution gavecurrency_ have still further modified these relations." In the secondrevolution of 1848 the Pope's temporal authority was about to beentirely destroyed by the attempted establishment of the republic ofItaly; but at this juncture France, who, notwithstanding her plagues,had not repented of her former deeds, not willing to desert entirely thePapal cause after upholding it faithfully for centuries, interfered, andthe Pope was sustained in his position by a French garrison until 1870(except a short time in 1867), at which time the success of King VictorEmmanuel and his capture of the Eternal City established the freegovernment of United Italy. The temporal sun of the Pope set forever;his kingdom was left in darkness.    12. And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river    Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of    the kings of the east might be prepared.    13. And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the    mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out    of the mouth of the false prophet.    14. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which    go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to    gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.    15. Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and    keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his    shame.    16. And he gathered them together into a place called in the    Hebrew tongue Armageddon.The symbols under this vial are so different that at first they scarcelylook like anything constituting a plague. By recalling a fewcircumstances of history we shall understand why the river Euphrates wasselected as a symbol, and also, its true signification in thisconnection. This river was connected with ancient Babylon, and whilerunning in its own channel was the protection of the city and anobstacle to its capture. By turning the water of this river from itscourse, King Cyrus (according to the account given by Herodotus)succeeded in overthrowing the city, with the result that God's peoplewho were at that time in captivity there received permission to returnto their own land and to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. Ezra1:1-3. Under the sixth trumpet this symbol was applied to the fourangels as a symbol of the restraint placed upon their operations, theybeing bound in that river. As there are no agents in this vision who arerepresented as bound, we must apply it to the city itself, the name ofwhich is given in verse 19--Babylon--being a symbol of one of itsdefenses. According to verse 19 this mystical Babylon is composed ofthree parts, being made up of the dragon (in his modern form), thebeast, and the false prophet mentioned in verse 13. And its location isnot confined to the territory of the ten kingdoms; for its field ofoperations is not only that of the "earth"--the Apocalyptic earth--but"_of the whole world_." Ver. 14. In one division of this great city,that of the false prophet, God's people were long held in captivity; butits spiritual overthrow was to be accomplished by the drying up of theEuphrates of its defenses, that the way of the kings of the East mightbe prepared.[12][Footnote 12: Applying the Euphrates (an object from nature) as a symbolof ecclesiastical affairs in this manner appears to be in violation ofthe laws of symbolic language laid down; but we should bear in mind thefact that events of whatever nature connected with the history of God'schosen people in the old dispensation are of themselves proper symbolsof similar events in the New Testament dispensation. Thus the temple,altar, candle-sticks, incense, holy city, etc., of the formerdispensation, although of themselves objects from nature, arenevertheless clearly used to represent affairs of the church, because oftheir former significance as connected with the people of God. The factthat the great city of this chapter is spiritual Babylon (see verse 19)is positive proof that the river Euphrates is here applied in the propermanner.]To the Hebrews the term _east_ had a much more extensive significationthan with us, to whom its only distinction is that it is the point ofthe sun's rising. But beyond this, it was to the Jews the cardinal pointof the compass to which they naturally looked first. Their temple wasbuilt toward the east, its principal entrance being in that direction.The most powerful and enlightened kingdoms of the world lay to the eastof Judea, and they included them all under the general term, sons orchildren of the East (Orientals) and kings of the East, comprehendingnot only Arabia and the lands of Moab and Ammon, but also Armenia,Assyria, Mesopotamia, Babylonia and Chaldea. Travelers from thesecountries would all enter Judea from the east, and they were consideredOrientals. These nations were also distinguished for their proficiencyin science and learning. The Magi, or wise men of the East, came toworship the infant Jesus at Jerusalem. They were eminent in the scienceof astrology, which was considered the greatest science of that day. TheEast, therefore, was looked to for wise men; and it is a noticeable factthat the pathway of science, of literature, and of empire has ever beenfrom that direction, so as to have passed into a proverb, "westward thestar of empire holds its way." "The kings of the East," then, employedas a symbol of this sixth vial, is not intended to signify any personsliterally from that quarter of the earth, but represents the bringing inof knowledge and understanding. Thank God that we live in the time whenthe defenses of spiritual Babylon have been broken through and whenlight and knowledge on the Word of God has reached the hearts of manyredeemed souls held in bondage there! And like the Israelites of old,when Cyrus, entered the ancient Babylon through the dry river-bed of theEuphrates, they have come out with rejoicing and made their way to Zionagain. Halleluiah! That the spiritual downfall of Babylon is a realplague to sectarians there can be no doubt, and it is plainly declaredto be such in chap. 18:8, where the same event is described.At the very time when the defenses of Babylon are thrown down, the threeunclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon(Paganism), and out of the mouth of the beast (Romanism), and out of themouth of the false prophet (Protestantism), to gather together all thewicked powers throughout "the whole world" for that last great day ofGod Almighty.[13] There is no analagous object to which a _spirit_ canbe made a symbol; therefore we must regard them as being literallyspirits of devils, here appearing under their own appropriate title.Their mission is to form a confederation of all the gigantic powers ofwickedness, slimy and loathsome as the animal to which they are likened,and to array themselves against the cause of Christ.[Footnote 13: I do not suppose that these three unclean spirits shouldbe limited in their operations to Paganism, Romanism, and Protestantism;for that leaves out Mohammedanism, which is neither Pagan, Roman, norProtestant, yet is certainly "false prophecy"; and the three spiritswere to gather the "whole world."]Armageddon, where the spirits gathered all the enemies of truth andrighteousness together, means the mountain of Megiddo, the memorablefield of the overthrow of Sisera's mighty host by Barak. It was also theplace of great defeat to the Israelites in the time of Josiah and thescene of his death. The name, therefore, stands as a symbol for a fieldof slaughter or defeat and denotes that when the confederation ofwickedness is complete, the united host of God's enemies will be utterlydefeated, as by the overthrow of Megiddo. This great conflict withpowers of wickedness and spirits infernal will be further explained inchapter XX.Simultaneous with the notable events of this vial, the announcement ismade of the near-coming of Christ to the world--"Behold I come as athief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest hewalk naked, and they see his shame." The children of God that have beengathered out of old Babylon rejoice in the glad announcement and say,"Even so come, Lord Jesus."    17. And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and    there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the    throne, saying, It is done.    18. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and    there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were    upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.    19. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the    cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in    remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of    the fierceness of his wrath.    20. And every island fled away, and the mountains were not    found.    21. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every    stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God    because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was    exceeding great.The application of this vial to the judgments of the last great day isso plain that but little comment is here necessary. It was poured "intothe air," a region of vast extent, not confined to a given locality, butembracing the whole earth. Hence this plague is universal. When theseventh angel emptied his vial, "There came a great voice out of thetemple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done." All is nowfulfilled. The work of wrath is finished. The description of the plaguefollows, but it follows only _as a description_. As actuallyaccomplished, it preceded that great voice, which was uttered in view ofthe thing already brought to pass.The dissolution of the earth itself upon which we live is not heredescribed, although according to the teaching of other scriptures itoccurs at this time; but the symbols, being drawn from the department ofthe operations both of humanity and of nature, show the complete andfinal overthrow of all the great powers civil and ecclesiastical. Thedominancy of these great powers has been the chief burden of Apocalypticvision, and here their utter destruction at last is set forth undervarious symbols. The weight of the Jewish talent is said to have beenone hundred and fourteen pounds. Such a mass of ice descending fromheaven would beat down everything in its resistless, desolating fury.There is no intimation, however, of men being killed under this or theaccompanying symbols; therefore as individuals they survive, while thestorm of wrath falls upon the civil and ecclesiastical institutions ofsociety, resulting in their utter annihilation. This is the "great dayof his wrath" described under the sixth seal, to the symbols of whichthis description bears a striking resemblance, as any one can see at aglance. Well may the oppressors of earth say to the mountains and hills,"Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on thethrone, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of his wrathis come; and who shall be able to stand?" Chap. 6:16, 17.CHAPTER XVII.    And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven    vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will    show unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon    many waters:    2. With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication,    and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the    wine of her fornication.    3. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and    I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast, full of names of    blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.    4. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and    decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden    cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her    fornication:    5. And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON    THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.    6. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and    with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I    wondered with great admiration.Here again the narrative returns to take up another series of thehistory. A number of times we have been taken over the same ground. Itis this feature of the Apocalypse more than any other that has misledand perplexed commentators. Attempting to explain it as one continuousnarrative from beginning to end, they have been compelled to considernumerous passages as "digressions," "parentheses," or "episodes," etc.As already observed, however, the prophecy is not arranged after theordinary plan of histories, narrating all the contemporaneous events ina given period, whether civil, religious, literary, scientific, orbiographical, thus finishing up the history of that period; but itconsists of a number of distinct themes running over the same ground.In this chapter a more particular description of the church of Rome,"that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth" (verse 18),is given under the symbol of a drunken harlot. With this vile prostitute"the kings of the earth have committed fornication"--they haveencouraged her in her corruption and idolatries--"and the inhabitants ofthe earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication." Thislatter symbol is doubtless taken from the cup of drugged wine with whichlewd women were accustomed to inflame their lovers. So had this apostatechurch made "the inhabitants of the earth"--of the ten kingdoms--drunkenwith her wine-cup and thus rendered them willing partakers in herabominable idolatries. She is described in two positions--first, as"sitting upon many waters," which the angel informs us "are peoples, andmultitudes, and nations, and tongues" (verse 15); and second, "upon ascarlet-colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven headsand ten horns." The first position denotes her wide supremacy in theworld over distant peoples and nations; the second, the closerelationship that she sustained to the civil power. That beast carriedher in royal state. The civil powers of Europe have usually lentthemselves as a caparisoned hack for this great whore to ride upon andhave considered themselves highly honored thereby. This beast was fullof the names of blasphemy, which were the same as the blasphemousassumptions of the Papacy, as explained in chapter XIII, showing that heagreed perfectly with this apostate church in her impious claims andsupported her in them, making himself equally guilty and deserving ofthe same name. What is intended exactly by his scarlet color I do notknow. The same power under its Pagan form was represented as a reddragon.The appearance of this woman was that of the most splendid character,nor are we to suppose the contrary because she was such an infamousprostitute. She may have been, and according to the description was, allthat, but still her appearance was such as to bewitch her admirers andvotaries. Robes of purple and scarlet, with the most costly profusion ofgold and diamonds, were superb adorning, even regal splendor. All thatskill and wealth could do in magnificence of attire was bestowed uponher to set forth her charms. The "golden cup in her hand" was as torichness in harmony with her dress, while as to contents it set forthher character, for it was "full of abominations and filthiness of herfornication." This cup was an appropriate symbol of her atrociouswickedness and idolatries.This woman had also a name written on her forehead. It was not, indeed,placed there by herself nor by her admirers; but He who drew thissymbolic picture placed it there that all might know her true character."MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OFTHE EARTH." Although this apostate church was only in embryo in theapostles' day, yet the apostle who gave us a careful delineation of itsterrible characteristics declared that it was then developing anddenominated it a _mystery_. "The mystery of iniquity doth already work."2 Thes. 2:7. The same apostle regarded as an unquestionable fact that_godliness_ was a mystery (1 Tim. 3:16); but he who peruses the historyof the Papacy will be forced to declare with emphasis, "Withoutcontroversy great is the mystery of Romanism." She is also styledBabylon the Great. This name is derived from ancient Babylon. This citywas the center of the earth's idolatry and stood first of all as thedirect enemy of God's people. So, likewise, this church is the center ofearth's spiritual idolatry. There are other harlots, or corruptchurches, in the world beside her; but she is the _mother_ of them all.They are all children by her side. Some of them greatly honor her and indeep veneration call her "_our holy mother church_;" but God brands heras the "mother of harlots and abominations of the earth."But the statement that she was a harlot merely, does not entirelydescribe her character. She was a _drunken_ harlot. Drunken withwhat--wine? No indeed; that were a very small sin for her. She was"drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrsof Jesus." Romanists positively declare that their church neverpersecutes; but with the picture of this drunken prostitute before oureyes, we shall be hard to convince. To illustrate this point fully wouldbe to write a book of martyrs much larger than the present work; so, forlack of space only, we shall have to content ourselves with merelybringing forward a few of many historical proofs showing _that theythemselves_ claim the right to exterminate heretics.Innumerable provincial and national councils have issued the most crueland bloody laws for the extermination of the Waldenses and otherso-called heretics; such as the Councils of Oxford, Toledo, Avignon,Tours, Lavaur, Albi, Narbonne, Beziers, Tolosa, etc. Since Papists willassert that these had no authority to establish a doctrine of the church(although they clearly reflect its spirit), I remind the reader thatsome of their _General_ Councils have by their decrees pronounced thepunishment of death for heresy. At least six of these highest judicialassemblies of the Romish church, with the Pope at their head, haveauthoritatively enjoined the persecution and extermination of heretics.Extracts from the Acts of these Councils could be given if spacepermitted. 1. The second General Council of Lateran (1139), in itstwenty-third canon. 2. The third General Council of Lateran (1179),under Pope Alexander III. 3. The fourth General Council of Lateran(1215), under the inhuman Pope Innocent III., which exceeded in ferocityall similar decrees that had preceded it. 4. The sixteenth GeneralCouncil, held at Constance in 1414. This Council, with Pope Martinpresent in person, condemned the reformers Huss and Jerome to be burnedat the stake and then prevailed on the emperor Sigismund to violate thesafe-conduct that he had given Huss, signed by his own hand, in which heguaranteed the reformer a safe return to Bohemia; and the inhumansentence was carried out, with the haughty prelates standing by tosatiate their eyes on the sight of human agony. This council alsocondemned the writings of Wickliffe and _ordered his bones to be dug upand burnt_, which savage sentence was afterwards carried into effect;and after lying in their grave for forty years, the remains of thisfirst translator of the English Bible were reduced to ashes and throwninto the brook Swift. Well has the historian Fuller said, in referenceto this subject, "The brook Swift did convey his ashes into Avon, theAvon into Severn, the Severn into the narrow seas, and they into themain ocean. And thus the ashes of Wickliffe are the emblem of hisdoctrie, which is now dispersed all over the world." 5. The Council ofSienna (1423), which was afterwards continued at Basil. 6. The fifthGeneral Council of the Lateran (1514). The laws enacted in eachsucceeding Council were generally marked, if possible, with augmentedbarbarity.Says the learned Edgar, in his Variations of Popery: "The principle ofpersecution, being sanctioned not only by theologians, Popes andprovincial synods but also by General Councils, _is a necessary andintegral part of Romanism_. The Romish communion has, by itsrepresentatives, declared its right to compel men to renounce heterodoxyand embrace Catholicism, and to consign the obstinate to the civil powerto be banished, tortured, or killed." St. Aquinas, whom Romanists callthe "angelic Doctor," says, "Heretics are to be compelled by corporealpunishments, that they may adhere to the faith." Again, "Heretics maynot only be excommunicated, but _justly killed_." He says that "thechurch consigns such to the secular judges _to be exterminated from theworld by death_."Cardinal Bellarmine is the great champion of Romanism and expounder ofits doctrines. He was the nephew of Pope Marcellus, and he isacknowledged to be a standard writer with Romanists. In the twenty-firstand twenty-second chapters of the third book of his work entitled _DeLaicis_, he enters into a regular argument to prove that the church hasthe right, and should exercise it, of punishing heretics with death. Theheading is his, together with what follows."Chapter XXI. _That heretics, condemned by the church, may be punishedwith temporal penalties and even death._ We will briefly show that thechurch has the _power and ought_ to cast off incorrigible heretics,especially those who have elapsed, and that the secular power ought toinflict on such temporal punishments and even death itself. 1. This maybe proved from the Scripture. 2. It is proved from the opinions and lawsof the emperors, _which the church has always approved_. 3. _It isproved by the laws of the church ... experience proves that there is noother remedy;_ for the church has tried step by step all remedies--firstexcommunication alone; then pecuniary penalties; afterward banishment;_and lastly has been forced to put them to death; to send them to theirown place_.... There are three grounds on which reason shows thatheretics should be put to death: the first is, Lest the wicked shouldinjure the righteous; second, That by the punishment of a few many maybe reformed. For many who were made torpid by impunity, are _roused bythe fear of punishment_; AND THIS WE DAILY SEE IS THE RESULT WHERE THEINQUISITION FLOURISHES," etc."Chapter XXII. _Objections answered._ It remains to answer theobjections of Luther and other heretics. Argument 1. From the history ofthe church at large. 'The church,' says Luther, 'from the beginning evento this time, _has never burned a heretic_. Therefore it does not seemto be the mind of the Holy Spirit that they should be burnt!' [He surelymisunderstood Luther.] I reply that this argument proves not thesentiment, but the ignorance, or impudence of Luther; FOR AS ALMOST ANINFINITE NUMBER WERE EITHER BURNED OR OTHERWISE PUT TO DEATH, Luthereither did not know it, and was therefore ignorant; or if he knew it, heis convicted of impudence and falsehood,--for _that heretics were oftenburnt_ BY THE CHURCH may be proved by adducing a few from many examples.Argument 2. 'Experience shows that terror is not useful.' I replyEXPERIENCE PROVES THE CONTRARY--for the Donatists, Manicheans, andAlbigenses WERE ROUTED AND ANNIHILATED BY ARMS," etc.So this high dignitary of the Catholic church, a cardinal, a nephew ofone Pope and the special favorite of others, freely admits the charge sooften laid to Popery by creditable historians--the butchering of an"infinite number" of people that differed from them--and here laborshard to uphold it as a principle of righteousness. Their bloody crusadesagainst the innocent, unoffending Waldenses, Albigenses, and otherpeoples, in which thousands, and in the aggregate _millions_, wereslaughtered like venomous reptiles, stand out on the page of historywith a prominence that can not be mistaken; and they themselves can notdeny it. Dowling has well said that their "history is written in linesof blood. Compared with the butcheries of holy men and women by thePapal Antichrist, the persecutions of the Pagan emperors of the firstthree centuries sink into comparative insignificance. For not a tithe ofthe blood of martyrs was shed by Paganism, that has been poured forth byPopery; and the persecutors of Pagan Rome never dreamed of the thousandingenious contrivances of torture which the malignity of Popishinquisitors succeeded in inventing." P. 541.If any of my readers suppose that the character of Popery has changedwith the lapse of ages, I must tell you that such is not the ease.Popery is unchangeable and this her ablest advocates declare. Chas.Butler, in the work he wrote in reply to Southey's book of the church,says, "It is most true that the Roman Catholics believe the doctrines oftheir church to be unchangeable; and that it is a tenet of their creed,that what their faith ever has been, such it was from the beginning,_such it is now_, and SUCH IT EVER WILL BE." A copy of the eleventhedition of The Faith of Our Fathers, published in Baltimore, Maryland,in 1883, lies before me. It was written by Archbishop (now Cardinal)James Gibbons, the highest authority of the Roman Catholic church inthis country. In page 95 he says: "It is a marvelous fact, worthy ofrecord, that in the whole history of the church, from the nineteenthcentury to the first, no solitary example can be adduced to show thatany Pope or General Council ever revoked a decree of faith or moralsenacted by any preceding pontiff or council. Her record in the pastought to be a sufficient warrant that she will _tolerate no doctrinalvariations in the future_." So the doctrine of her inherent right topersecute and slay every one who disagrees with her, which has beenenacted by Pontiffs and General Councils and so carried out in the past,is still in vogue and would now be enforced were it in her power to doso.While this statement of Gibbons' shows the unchangeable spirit ofPopery, still it is the basest presumption upon the historical knowledgeof the reader. The facts are that the _official_ acts of some of theirPopes and General Councils have been so far wrong that Romaniststhemselves have been compelled to admit it. Thus the _sixth_ GeneralCouncil, which was held at Constantinople in 680, and which everyCatholic accepts as Ecumenical, condemned, in the strongest terms, PopeHonorius as a Monothelite _heretic_. Let them attempt to deny it, and wewill bring forward our proof. Romish authors themselves admit it, thewell-known Dupin with the rest, as appears by the following extract fromhis writings: "The Council had as much reason to censure him as Sergius,Paulus, Peter, and the other Patriarchs oL Constantinople." He adds inlanguage yet more emphatic, "This will stand for certain, then, thatHonorius _was condemned_, AND JUSTLY TOO, AS A HERETIC, by the sixthGeneral Council." Dupin's Eccl. History, Vol. II, p. 16.The Decretals of Isodore furnish another example of Papal infallibility(?). For ages these documents were the chief instrument of the Popes inextending their power and the proof of the righteousness of theirassumptions to excessive temporal authority. Wickliffe declared themfalse and apocryphal. For this he was condemned by the sixteenth_General Council_, held at Constance in 1414, and his bones ordered dugup and burnt because of his daring impudence. The spurious character ofthese false decretals have since been proved beyond the shadow of adoubt; and since it is impossible to deny it longer, it is admitted evenby Romanists. So, after all, this _infallible_ Council was wrong, thePapists themselves being the judges.Pope Benedict IX. was guilty of such flagitious crimes that he became anobject of public abhorrence, and he finally _sold_ the Popedom. One ofhis infallible (?) successors in the Papal chair, Pope Victor III.,pronounced this infallible (?) profligate a person "abandoned to allmanner of vice. A _successor of_ SIMON THE SORCERER, and NOT OF SIMONTHE APOSTLE." I do not question the truth of this assertion, but whatbecomes of their boasted uninterrupted apostolical succession? Baronius,the Popish annalist, confesses that Pope Sergius III. was "the slave ofevery vice, and the most wicked of men." Among other horrid acts Platinarelates that he _rescinded the acts_ of Pope Formosus, compelled thosewhom he had ordained to be re-ordained, dragged his dead body from thesepulchre, beheaded him as though he were alive, and then threw him intothe Tiber! This Pope cohabited with an infamous prostitute named Maroziaand by her had a son named John, who afterwards ascended the Papalthrone, through the influence of his licentious mother, under the nameof John XI. So the unlawful amours of Sergius produced this infallible,necessary link in the _holy_ chain of uninterrupted apostolicalsuccession! It must be remembered, also, that the Popes have for ageslaid claim themselves to infallibility; and in the last General Councilof that body, held at the Vatican in 1870, it was declared a dogma ofthe church. Romanists will tell us that this decree refers only to hisofficial acts, and not to his personal character; but official acts havebeen the main thing under consideration in the case of Sergius,Honorius, and Benedict. But if such monsters of vice can produce good,holy, infallible acts, as Papists declare, then Jesus Christ ismistaken; for he declared positively that "a corrupt tree _bringethforth evil fruit_ ... neither can a corrupt tree bring forth goodfruit." Mat. 7:17, 18. "God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every mana liar." Rom. 3:4. During these dark ages thousands of priests, who wereby the laws of the church denied their Scriptural right of possessing awife (1 Cor. 7:9, etc.), lived openly with concubines; and the Councilof Toledo decreed that they should not be condemned therefor, providedthey were content with one.But the devil produced his master-piece of iniquity in the person ofRoderic Borgia, who ascended the Papal throne in 1492 under the name ofAlexander VI. The utmost limits assigned to Papal depravity wererealized in him, so that the very name Borgia has come to be used as adesignation of any person unusually wicked. Says Waddington: "Theecclesiastical records of fifteen centuries ... contain no name soloathsome, no crimes so foul as his.... Not one among the many zealousannalists of the Roman church has breathed a whisper in his praise....He publicly cohabited with a Roman matron named Vanozia, by whom he hadfive acknowledged children. Neither in his manners nor in his languagedid he affect any regard for morality or decency; and one of theearliest acts of his pontificate was, to celebrate, with scandalousmagnificence, in his own palace, the marriage of his daughter Lucretia.On one occasion this prodigy of vice gave a splendid entertainment,within the walls of the Vatican, to no less than fifty publicprostitutes at once, and that in the presence of his daughter Lucretia,at which entertainment deeds of darkness were done, over which decencymust throw a veil; and yet this monster of vice was, according to Papist... the vicar of God upon earth, and was addressed by the title of HISHOLINESS!!" But why stir this cesspool of filth any longer? Is not thatchurch of which Alexander VI. was for eleven years the crowned andanointed head--a necessary link in the boasted chain of _holy_apostolical succession, the pretended vicar of Christ upon earth--is itnot, I ask, fitly described by the pen of inspiration "MOTHER OF HARLOTSAND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH," as she reeled onward in the career ofages, "drunken with the blood of the saints"?    7. And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I    will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that    carriest her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.    8. The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend    out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that    dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in    the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they    behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.    9. And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are    seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.    10. And there are seven kings; five are fallen, and one is, and    the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue    a short space.    11. And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth,    and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.    12. And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which    have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one    hour with the beast.    13. These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength    unto the beast.    14. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall    overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and    they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.The angel promises to explain "the mystery of the woman and of the beastthat carried her." The beast is the same as the secular beast with sevenheads and ten horns, described in chapter 13. An explanation of itsheads and horns has already been given. The expression "the seven headsare seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth, and there are sevenkings," requires further explanation. Many have understood the mountainsto signify the seven mountains on which the city of Rome is said to bebuilt; but that is adopting the literal mode of interpretation, and iscontrary to the laws of symbolic language. The more obvious meaning isthat the seven heads represent seven mountains and also seven kings; butthis probably is not the idea intended. The heads of a beast are not theproper symbol of mountains. The fact, too, that the woman is representedas sitting upon these mountains, shows that they are to be taken as asymbol, as well as the woman, and not the object symbolized. They are,then, the same as the heads and denote the seven kings or seven forms ofgovernment under which the Roman empire subsisted.The seventh and last head has not yet been identified. Beforeconsidering it, however, I wish to call attention to another point thathas already been referred to. The beast that John here saw, with theseven heads and ten horns, was Rome under the Papal power. Did new Romein reality have the seven heads? No. The dragon John saw in chapter 12is represented as having seven heads and ten horns, and signified Romeunder the Pagan power. Did old Rome really possess the ten horns? No.According to verse 12 in this chapter, they were to arise future ofJohn's time. But notice carefully that the seven heads, which accordingto this description, belonged to the beast sustaining the Papal power inafter years, are here explained by the angel as signifying the veryforms of government by which _Pagan_ Rome subsisted. "Five _are fallen_[a past event], one _is_ [exists at this present time], and the other_is not yet come_." So according to divine interpretation, the sameheads and horns serve for both the dragon and the beast. This could notpossibly be a true representation unless they were both in reality the_same beast_, they being represented as two only for the purpose ofdescribing the two phases of Roman history--Pagan and Papal.With this point established, that these two forms of Roman history arethe same beast, we are now prepared to understand the statement that thebeast "was and is not, and yet is." This is equivalent to saying thatthe beast existed, it ceased to exist, and then it came into existenceagain. This was exactly the history of Rome. Its downfall under thePagan form was described under the fourth trumpet as an eclipse of thesun, moon and stars, so that they shone not for a third part of the dayand night. For a time it seemed not to exist. A little later the eclipseis lifted; the beast exists again under the Papal form. In this is setforth clearly the wounding and the healing of the beast. The wound wasinflicted on its sixth, or Imperial, head (for the first five hadalready fallen, according to the historical facts just related), beingaccomplished by the hordes of Northern barbarians overturning the empireof the West. It appeared for a time that the beast was indeed woundedunto death; but not so: to the surprise of all, he survived under theform of the seventh head. At this point the question is sure to beasked, How could the beast continue to live if its seventh head was tocontinue but "a short space"? This is accounted for by the fact thatthere was what might be appropriately called an eighth head, but whichwas in reality of the seven. "And the beast that was, and is not, evenhe is the eighth, and is of the seven." Verse 11.The identification of the seventh head will now make the mattercomplete. The facts all meet in the Carlovingian empire, or the empireof Charlemagne. In the year 774 Charlemagne completed the work begun byPepin twenty years before and overthrew the kingdom of the Lombards inItaly, which was the last of the three horns plucked up before thelittle horn of Daniel. By this victory he became complete master ofItaly, and he received the title Patrician of Rome. This was not merelyan honorary title, such as had for ages been conferred upon certainindividuals; but it was a distinct form of civil government and supreme,taking the same rank with that of the Consular, the Decemvirate, theTriumvirate, etc., in the earlier history of the nation. It lasted,however, only "a short space," or twenty-six years, when Charlemagne,having extended his conquests over all the western part of Europe,assumed the Imperial title and thus revived the empire of Rome in theWest under its Gothic form. In his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,Gibbon says: "In the twenty-six years that elapsed between the conquestof Lombardy and his Imperial coronation, Rome, which had been deliveredby the sword, was subject, as his own, to the scepter, of Charlemagne.The people swore allegiance to his person and family; in his name, moneywas coined, and justice was administered, and the election of Popes wasexamined and confirmed by his authority--except an original andself-inherent claim of sovereignity, there was not any prerogativeremaining which the title of emperor could add to the Patrician ofRome." This decisive testimony by the highest authority on the subjectshows conclusively that all the power of sovereignty resided inCharlemagne as the Patrician of Rome, and that this, therefore, is aproper head to be ranked with the other six that preceded it.[14][Footnote 14: Commentators frequently identify the seventh head with theExarchate of Ravenna. After the overthrow of the kingdom of theOstrogoths in Italy by Belisarius, the general of Justinian, about themiddle of the sixth century, the territory became subject to the emperorof the Eastern empire and was ruled by him through an Exarch whose placeof residence was Ravenna. This Exarchate (sometimes called _Patriciate_)continued until about the middle of the eighth century, when it wasterminated by Astolphus, king of the Lombards, who made Ravenna thecapital of the Lombardic kingdom in 752. Three years later the Lombardswere defeated by Pepin, who made the Holy See a present of the lands heconquered from them--the origin of the temporal power of the Popes.Pepin was succeeded by his son Charlemagne, who was appointed_Patrician_ of Rome, by the Pope, in 774. During the last half centurythat the Exarchate of Ravenna remained its existence was but little morethan a name, the real power of government being usurped by the Papacy.It could hardly be considered an inconsistency were we to interpret theseventh head as signifying both the Patriciate of Ravenna and thePatriciate of Charlemagne that closely followed it; but in the presentwork I have restricted its application to the latter form because of itsdistinctive characteristic as constituting a supreme civil powerentirely independent of the empire of the East, and because of itsimportance in the revival of the empire of the West.]This head, however, continued only "a short space"; and an eighth aroseon Christmas, the first day of the year 800 (as time was then reckoned),when Charlemagne was crowned emperor of Rome, and thus revived theempire of the West. This eighth head, however, was "of the seven"; forit was the same as the sixth, both being Imperial--the first being inthe Augustan line, and the other in the Carlovingian, and separated fromeach other by the seventh, or Patriciate. Considered one way, there wereeight heads, but two of them were alike, hence only seven; for theeighth was of the seven. According to verse 11 it was under the eighthhead that the beast subsisted at the time he was carrying the woman ofthis chapter, which exactly accords with the historical facts in thecase; and the same was continued in a line of emperors reaching down tothe time of the French Revolution.The ten horns had "received no kingdom as yet." This signifies that atthe time when the Revelation was given they had not yet arisen. Whenthey did come into existence they were to receive power as kings withthe beast and were to give to it their power and strength. It is asingular fact that a distinct head should continue to exist after thesehorns had arisen and developed into powerful kingdoms; but herein theremarkable accuracy of prophecy is clearly shown. It is said that theyshould make war with the Lamb and that the Lamb should overcome them.Some think that this has reference to the persecution of the saintsduring the Dark Ages; but it seems to me that it would have been stateddifferently if such were its meaning. It may be a prophetical referenceto the battle of Armageddon, which will be terminated by the coming ofthe Son of God himself to overthrow completely all the powers ofwickedness.    15. And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where    the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and    tongues.    16. And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these    shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and    shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.    17. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to    agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of    God shall be fulfilled.    18. And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which    reigneth over the kings of the earth.The special thoughts contained in these verses have been so farexplained already that it is unnecessary to go over the same groundagain. Already the civil powers of Europe are beginning to cast thiswoman aside as an old, wrinkled, haggard prostitute is cast off by herlovers. Already they have deprived her of all temporal authority such asshe possessed in guiding this beast of chapter 17, as explained underthe fifth plague in the preceding chapter. Whether they are destined tobecome a still greater enemy to her, the future will determine.CHAPTER XVIII.    And after these things I saw another angel come down from    heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his    glory.    2. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon    the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of    devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every    unclean and hateful bird.    3. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her    fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed    fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed    rich through the abundance of her delicacies.A movement of mighty power is symbolized in these verses. The chronologyof the events described in the preceding chapter brings us down to thetime when the ten horns turn against the Papacy by depriving her of hertemporal authority. This, as we have already seen, was completelyfulfilled in 1870 and constituted the fifth plague. In the descriptionof the sixth plague which followed, it was shown that the great citywhich was invaded was composed of three parts--Paganism (the modern formof the dragon power), Catholicism, and Protestantism. The same greatcity is here brought to view, and the angel from heaven, with a mightyvoice, cries, "Babylon the Great is fallen, is fallen." This fall ofBabylon can not signify a literal destruction; for there are certainevents to take place in Babylon after her fall which entirely precludesthat idea; for instance, the calling of God's people out of her, inorder that they may not receive of her plagues. In these plagues isembraced her literal destruction, or complete overthrow. The fall istherefore a moral one; for the result of it is that Babylon becomes "thehabitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage ofevery unclean and hateful bird."Protestants who make any attempt to interpret these prophecies usuallylimit the designation "Babylon the Great" in these verses to the churchof Rome, because the woman symbolizing the apostate church in thepreceding chapter is denominated "Babylon the Great." Ver. 5. But thesame verse also declares her to be the "_Mother_ of harlots;" and if sheas a degraded woman stands as the representative of a corrupt church,her unchaste daughters, also, must symbolize churches that are herdescendants; and if the real name of the _mother_ is Babylon, as stated,the proper name of her harlot daughters must be Babylon also. Whether,therefore, the mother or the daughters are referred to, it is all"Babylon the Great," because it is all the same family and is a part ofthat "GREAT CITY which reigneth over the kings of the earth." Chap.17:18. We must, therefore, have something besides the mere title"Babylon the Great" to determine which division of the great city isreferred to in a given instance--whether Pagan, Papal, or Protestant.A careful study of the prophecy now under consideration will show thatit has particular reference to the Protestant division of Babylon. Itcontained many of God's children; whereas Paganism was always a falsereligion and never held any of God's saints. Under the reign ofCatholicism, the people of God are represented in all the symbols ofthis book relating thereto as existing entirely separate from thatcommunion. The description of this apostate church given in thepreceding chapter shows clearly that instead of being partly composed ofGod's saints, she was their most bitter and relentless persecutor, yea,was "_drunken with the blood of the saints_, and with the blood of themartyrs of Jesus." This is definite proof that the present phase ofBabylon under consideration is the Protestant division; and her moralfall is the grand signal for the escape of God's people who have partlycomposed her number, as the fall of ancient Babylon was for the escapeof the Israelites. In their younger days the Protestant organizations(symbolized by the daughters) were of much better character than themother church from whom they descended. Many of them started out onreform. While a spiritual people, God worked with them; but when theymade their image to the beast, they suddenly declined, and this voicefrom heaven finally declares them to be in a fallen condition--entirelyvoid of salvation, except a very few chosen saints that have not defiledtheir garments, contained therein.That this application of the term _Babylon_ is correct, and also, thefallen condition ascribed to her in accordance with the facts, I willprove by the following testimonies of Protestants themselves. The firstis from Vision of the Ages; or, Lectures on the Apocalypse, by B.W.Johnson, member of the Christian sect."It is needful to inquire what the term _Babylon_ means. It occursseveral times in the New Testament. Here (in the Apocalypse) it isspoken of as 'that great city,' and her fall is doomed 'because she hathmade all nations drunk with the wine of her fornication.' In Rev. 17:5,a scarlet harlot is seen sitting upon the seven-headed and ten-hornedmonster, and upon her forehead is written, 'Mystery, Babylon the Great.'With this woman the kings of the earth are said to have committedfornication. In chapter 18 the fall of the great city, Babylon isdetailed at length, and it is again said that all the kings of the earthhave committed fornication with her. The harlot with Babylon stamped onher brow, and the great city of fornication styled Babylon, in chapters14 and 18, are one and the same existence."There is an ancient city of Babylon often mentioned in the OldTestament, but ages before John wrote, it had ceased to be inhabited,the only dwellers among its lonely ruins were howling beasts and hissingserpents. It has never been rebuilt to this day and has passed awayforever. John refers therefore not to old Babylon, but to some power yetunseen (when he was upon the earth), that should be revealed in duetime, and of which old Babylon was a symbol. Let us notice some of thefeatures of ancient Babylon."1. On that site took place the confusion of tongues which divided thosewho before had been of one speech and one family, into various tribesand schisms at variance with each other and of various tongues. The wordBabylon, a memorial of this event, means confusion, and is derived fromBabel."2. Old Babylon persecuted the people of God and destroyed the temple inJerusalem."3. It carried the people of God into captivity."4. It was a mighty, resistless universal empire. The antitype, thespiritual Babylon, must correspond. There is a power that exhibits allthese characteristics. By apostasy from the truth it originated theschism which has divided the family of God into different sects andparties which speak a different spiritual language. It has carried thechurch into a long captivity by binding upon it the thralldom ofsuperstition. It has been a constant persecutor of the saints, and hasenjoyed an almost universal dominion. That power is the woman that sitsupon the seven-headed beast ... the false woman, symbolical of a falsechurch, the great apostate spiritual dominion of Rome. And we may add,out of which have come--directly or indirectly--_all the religious sectsof the present day_."Dr. Barnes says: "The word _Babylon_ became the emblem of all that washaughty and oppressive, and especially of all that persecuted the churchof God. The word here (Rev. 18:4) must be used to denote some power thatresembled the ancient and literal Babylon in these characteristics. Theliteral Babylon was no more; but the name might be used properly todenote a similar power."Wm. Kinkade, in Bible Doctrine, page 249, says, "I think Christ has atrue church on earth, but its members are scattered among the variousdenominations, and are more or less under the influence of mysteryBabylon and her daughters."Alexander Campbell says: "A reformation of Popery was attempted inEurope full three centuries ago. It ended in a Protestant hierarchy, andswarms of dissenters. Protestantism has been reformed intoPresbyterianism, that into Congregationalism, and that into Baptistism,etc., etc. Methodism has attempted to reform all, but has reformeditself into many forms of Wesleyanism. All of them retain in theirbosom--in their ecclesiastical organizations, worship, doctrines, andobservances--various relics of Popery. They are at best a reformation ofPopery, and only reformations in part. The doctrines and traditions ofmen yet impair the power and progress of the gospel in their hands." OnBaptism, p.15.Again, he says: "The worshiping establishments now in operationthroughout Christendom, increased and cemented by their respectivevoluminous confessions of faith, and their ecclesiastical constitutions,are not churches of Jesus Christ, but the legitimate daughters of thatmother of harlots, the church of Rome." How any man could possess asmuch light on this subject as did Mr. Campbell, and then build a secthimself, is more than I can understand.Lorenzo Dow says of the Romish Church: "If she be the mother, who arethe daughters? It must be the corrupt, national, established churchesthat came out of her." Dow's Life, p. 542.In the Religious Encyclopaedia, Article Antichrist, we read: "The writerof the book of Revelation tells us he heard a voice from heaven saying,'Come out of her, my people, that ye partake not of her sins, andreceive not of her plagues.' If such persons are to be found in the'mother of harlots,' with much less hesitation may it be inferred thatthey are connected with her unchaste daughters, those national churcheswhich are founded upon what are called Protestant principles."In the Encyclopaedia of Religious Knowledge we read: "An importantquestion, however, says Mr. Jones, stills remains for inquiry: IsAntichrist confined to the church of Rome? The answer is readilyreturned in the affirmative by Protestants in general; and happy had itbeen for the world had that been the case. But although we are fullywarranted to consider that church as 'the mother of harlots,' the truthis that by whatsoever arguments we succeed in fixing that odius chargeupon her, we shall, by parity of reasoning, be obliged to allow othernational churches to be her unchaste daughters, and for this plainreason, among others, because in their very constitution and tendencythey are hostile to the nature of the kingdom of Christ."One of Martin Luther's guests remarked that the world might continuefifty years, and he replied: "Pray God that it may not exist so long;matters would be even worse than they have been. There would rise upinfinite sects and schisms, which are at present hidden in men's heartsand nature. No; may the Lord come at once, for there is no amendment tobe expected."Mr. Hartly, a learned churchman, has remarked as follows: "There aremany prophecies which declare the fall of the ecclesiastical powers ofthe Christian world, and though each church seems to flatter itself withthe hope of being exempted, yet it is very plain that the propheticalcharacters belong to all. They all have left the true, pure, simplereligion, and teach for doctrines the commandments of men."Says Mr. Simpson, in Plea for Religion: "We Protestants, too, read thedeclaration of the third angel against the worshipers of the beast andhis image, and make ourselves easy under the awful denunciation byapplying it exclusively to the church of Rome; never dreaming that theyare equally applicable not only to the English, but to every churchestablishment in Christendom, which retains any of the marks of thebeast. For though the Pope and the church of Rome is at the head of thegrand twelve hundred and sixty years' delusion, yet all other churches,of whatever denomination, whether established or tolerated, whichpartake of the same spirit, or have instituted doctrines and ceremoniesinimical to the pure and unadulterated gospel of Christ, shall sooner orlater share in the fate of that immense fabric of human ordinances."Says Mr. Hopkins: "There is no reason to consider the antichristianspirit and practices confined to that which is now called the church ofRome. The Protestant churches have much of Antichrist in them, and arefar from being wholly reformed from the corruptions and wickedness, indoctrine and practice, in it. Some churches may be more pure and mayhave proceeded farther in a reformation than others; but where can thechurch be found which is thoroughly purged from her abominations? Noneare wholly clear from an antichristian spirit and the fruits of it....And as the church of Rome will have a large share in the cup ofindignation and wrath which will be poured out, so all the Christianworld will have a distinguished portion of it: as the inhabitants of itare much more guilty than others. There is great reason to conclude thatthe world, particularly that part of it called Christian and Protestant,will yet make greater and more rapid advances in all kinds of moralcorruption and open wickedness, till it will come to that state in whichit will be fully ripe and prepared to be cut down by the sickle ofdivine justice and wrath."Mr. O. Scott (Wesleyan Methodist) says: "The church is as deeplyinfected with a desire for worldly gain as the world. Most of thedenominations of the present day might be called _churches of theworld_, with more propriety than churches of Christ. The churches haveso far gone from primitive Christianity that they need a freshregeneration--a new kind of religion."Said T. DeWitt Talmage: "I simply state a fact when I say that in manyplaces the church is surrendering, and the world is conquering.... Thereis a mighty host in the Christian church, positively professingChristianity, who do not believe the Bible, out and out and in andin.... Oh! we have magnificient church machinery in this country; wehave sixty thousand American ministers; we have costly music; we havegreat Sunday-schools; and yet I give you the appalling statistics thatin the last twenty-five years, laying aside last year, the statistics ofwhich I have not yet seen,--within the last twenty-five years thechurches of God in this country have averaged _less than two conversionsa year_ each! There has been an average of four or five deaths in thechurches. How soon, at that rate, will this world be brought to God? Wegain two; we lose four. Eternal God! what will this come to?"Bishop Roberts said: "The popular religion of this country is not thereligion of the New Testament. It has some of its features but not all.It is lacking in grand fundamental elements. It answers many goodpurposes--restrains, refines, elevates, and gives to society a highgrade of civilization; but fails to secure the great end whichChristianity is designed to accomplish--the salvation of the soul. Itdazzles but to blind, it promises but to deceive; it allures by worldlyconsiderations to a heaven of purity, which no worldling can enter; itgives to its votaries, who long to eat of forbidden fruit, the assuranceof impunity from the threatened evils, and leads them on by sirenstrains from the Paradise of purity into the broad road which ends atlast in the blackness of the darkness of an eternal night of despair!"Says the Golden Rule: "The Protestants are outdoing the Popes insplendid, extravagant folly in church building. Thousands on thousandsare expended in gay and costly ornaments to gratify pride and a wickedambition, that might and should go to redeem the perishing millions!Does the evil, the folly, and the madness of these proud, formal,fashionable worshiper, stop here? These splendid monuments of Popishpride, upon which millions are squandered in our cities, virtuallyexclude the poor for whom Christ died, and for whom he came especiallyto preach."The report of the Michigan Yearly Conference, even as long ago as 1851,published in the True Wesleyan of Nov. 15, says: "The world, commercial,political, and ecclesiastical are alike, and are together going in thebroad way that leads to death. Politics, commerce, and nominal religion,all connive at sin, reciprocally aid each other, and unite to crush thepoor. Falsehood is unblushingly uttered in the forum and in the pulpit;and _sins that would shock the moral sensibilities of the heathen, gounrebuked in all the great denominations of our land_. These churchesare like the Jewish church when the Savior exclaimed, 'Woe unto you,scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites.'"Robert Atkins, in a sermon preached in London, says: "The trulyrighteous are diminished from the earth, and no man layeth it to heart.The professors of religion of the present day, in every church, arelovers of the world, conformers to the world. Lovers ofcreature-comfort, and aspirers after respectability. They are called to_suffer_ with Christ, but they shrink even from reproach. Apostasy,_apostasy_, APOSTASY, is engraven on the very front of every church; anddid they know it, and did they feel it, there might be hope; but alas!they cry 'We are rich, and increased in goods, and stand in need ofnothing.'"I have by no means exhausted the supply of similar testimonies ofProtestants now before me, but for lack of space I must conclude. In theface of these amazing facts can any one deny that Protestantism is apart of great Babylon and is in a fallen condition?"The merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of herdelicacies." A certain writer on this text has said: "Who take the leadin all the extravagancies of the age? Church-members. Who load theirtables with the richest and choicest viands? Church-members. Who areforemost in extravagance in dress, and all costly attire?Church-members. Who are the very personification of pride and arrogance?Church-members. Where shall we look for the very highest exhibition ofthe luxury, even show, and pride of life, resulting from the vanity andsin of the race? Answer, To a modern church-assembly on a pleasantSunday." Though this writer interpreted the text literally, yet he spokea vast amount of truth, as every one knows.Consider, too, the wickedness carried on everywhere in sect Babylonunrebuked, with the preachers ofttimes in the lead. Shows, festivals,frolics, grab-bag parties, cake-walk lotteries, kissing-bees, etc., etc.If the apostle were here to-day and we should inform him of a modernchurch entertainment where a bared female foot, projecting from beneatha curtain, was sold to the highest gentleman bidder, who had theprivilege of kissing its owner and taking her to supper, he wouldprobably answer, "Have I not told you, 'Babylon is fallen'?" If hisattention was called to the fact that the members of a prominent church,in a novel entertainment, displayed the likeness of a donkey, minus thetail, while the members one by one were blindfolded, and, amid theuproarous laughter of the crowd assembled, were given the detached partto see who could place it the nearest where it belonged, he would saywith double emphasis, "_Have I not told you_, 'BABYLON THE GREAT ISFALLEN, IS FALLEN, AND IS BECOME THE HABITATION OF DEVILS, AND THE HOLDOF EVERY FOUL SPIRIT, AND A CAGE OF EVERY UNCLEAN AND HATEFUL BIRD'?"The "abominations" are by no means confined to the _mother_ in theRevelation, but are also to be found in abundance in connection with herharlot daughters.    4. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of    her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that    ye receive not of her plagues.    5. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath    remembered her iniquities.    6. Reward her even as she rewarded yon, and double unto her    double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled    fill to her double.    7. How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously,    so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart,    I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.    8. Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and    mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire:    for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.Here we have a number of important truths brought before us--first, thatGod had a people in Babylon who up to this time were free from hercontaminations; second, that they received a positive call from heavento "come out"; third, that all who refused to obey the heavenly commandwould become partakers of her sins and receive of her plagues; fourth,that those who came out were to pour the strongest judgments uponBabylon--"reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto herdouble according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled, fill toher double." It is evident that the "torment and sorrow" which God'speople give Babylon after their departure is not a temporalretaliation--for they never indulge in such, and the Word of God forbidsit--but is altogether of a spiritual nature; hence the fierce judgmentthey inflict is executing the Word of truth, which brings to light allthe wickedness and abominations contained therein. "Death, and mourning,and famine" only remain. This symbolizes that all spiritual life hasdeparted, while famine and mourning are left. That such is the actualfact is shown by the following lamentation of the late Bishop R.S.Foster concerning his own sect, the Methodist Episcopal:"The ball, the theatre, nude and lewd art, social luxuries, with alltheir loose moralities, are making inroads into the sacred enclosure ofthe church; and as a satisfaction for all this worldliness, Christiansare making a great deal of Lent and Easter and Good Friday, and churchornamentations. It is the old trick of Satan. The Jewish church struckon that rock; the Romish church was wrecked on the same; and theProtestant church is fast reaching the same doom."Our great dangers as we see them, are assimilation to the world,neglect of the poor, substitution of the form for the fact of godliness,abandonment of discipline, a hireling ministry, an impure gospel, whichsummed up is a fashionable church. That Methodists should be liable tosuch an outcome, and that there should be signs of it in a hundred yearsfrom the 'sail-loft,' seems almost the miracle of history; but who thatlooks about him to-day can fail to see the fact?"Do not Methodists, in violation of God's Word and their own discipline,dress as extravagantly and as fashionably as any other class? Do not theladies, and even the wives and daughters of the ministry, put on 'goldand pearls and costly array'? Would not the plain dress insisted upon byJohn Wesley and Bishop Asbury, and worn by Hester Ann Rodgers, LadyHuntington, and many others equally distinguished, be now regarded inMethodist circles as fanaticism? Can any one going into the Methodistchurch in any of our chief cities distinguish the attire of thecommunicants from that of the theater and ball-goers? Is not worldlinessseen in the music? Elaborately dressed and ornamented choirs, who inmany cases make no profession of religion and are often sneeringskeptics, go through a cold artistic or operatic performance, which isas much in harmony with spiritual worship as an opera or theater. Undersuch worldly performances spirituality is frozen to death."Formerly every Methodist attended class and gave testimony ofexperimental religion. Now the class-meeting is attended by very few,and in many churches abandoned. Seldom the stewards, trustees and eldersof the church attend class. Formerly nearly every Methodist prayed,testified or exhorted in prayer-meeting. Now but very few are heard.Formerly shouts and praises were heard; now such demostrations of holyenthusiasm and joy are regarded as fanaticism."Worldly socials, and fairs, festivals, concerts and such like havetaken the place of religious gatherings, revival meetings, class andprayer meetings of earlier days. How true that the Methodist disciplineis a dead letter! Its rules forbid the wearing of gold or pearls orcostly array; yet no one ever thinks of disciplining its members forviolating them. They forbid the reading of such books and the taking ofsuch diversions as do not minister to godliness, yet the church itselfgoes to frolics and festivals and fairs, which destroy the spirituallife of the young, as well as the old. The extent to which this is nowcarried on is appalling. The _spiritual death it carries in its train_will only be known when _the millions it has swept into hell_ shallstand before the judgment."The early Methodist ministers went forth to sacrifice and to suffer forChrist. They sought not places of ease and affluence, but of privationand suffering. They gloried not in their big salaries, fine parsonages,and refined congregations, but in the souls that had been won for Jesus.Oh, _how changed!_ A hireling ministry will be a feeble, a timid, atruckling, a timeserving ministry, without faith, endurance, and holypower. Methodism formerly dealt in the great central truth. Now thepulpits deal largely in the generalities and in popular lectures. Theglorious doctrine of entire sanctification is rarely heard and seldomwitnessed in the pulpits."This lengthy quotation shows clearly the spiritual condition ofMethodism, and certainly she is no worse than the rest. God is callinghis people out of "all the places where they have been scattered in thecloudy and dark day." Ezek. 34:12. Those who refuse to walk in the lightwill go into darkness. God help people to "flee out of the midst ofBabylon, and deliver every man his soul."    9. And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication    and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for    her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,    10. Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas,    alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour    is thy judgment come.    11. And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over    her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:    12. The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones,    and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and    scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory,    and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and    iron, and marble,    13. And cinnamon, and odors, and ointments, and frankincense,    and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and    sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.    14. And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from    thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed    from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.    15. The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her,    shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and    wailing,    16. And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in    fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and    precious stones, and pearls!    17. For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every    shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as    many as trade by sea, stood afar off,    18. And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying,    What city is like unto this great city!    19. And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and    wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made    rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness!    for in one hour is she made desolate.In this description we have a continuation of the judgments of Babylonalready introduced. It must be borne in mind, however, that this is thespiritual judgments following her moral fall, and not her final andeverlasting literal destruction. The latter is described under anothersymbol a little further on in this series of prophecy.The symbol here is that of a great city, the grand metropolis of theworld, the mart of earth's commerce; a superb city, their [_sic_] beingno end to its luxuries and magnificence. In it everything that canminister to the appetite, gratify the taste, and feed the pride of thehuman soul is to be found in profusion, being described at length. Thisgreat city is suddenly afire, and her merchants and the great men of theworld who sustain her are overwhelmed with sorrow at the sight of alltheir wealth disappearing. Thus is great sect Babylon represented. Sheis a mighty city extending not only over the Apocalyptic earth, but, assymbolized by the ship-masters, sailors, and foreign traders, over thewhole world. Suddenly she is set on fire by heaven's truth and herspiritual magnificence destroyed. The apostle Paul describes the greatapostasy as a system that the "Lord shall _consume_ with the spirit ofhis mouth, and shall _destroy_ with the brightness of his coming." 2Thes. 2:8. That spiritual consumption is now taking place in accordancewith the symbols of this chapter, but the entire literal destruction ofold Babylon will take place coincident "with the brightness of hiscoming," as described in the following chapter.That sectarians are greatly alarmed over the sad condition of theirfallen churches is clearly shown by the many quotations already givenfrom Protestant writers. They may not be aware that it is a judgmentfrom heaven upon man-made organizations; but such we know it to be inthe light of eternal truth. Not only are they bewailing the loss ofspiritual life and the desolating famine in sectdom, as was BishopFoster and others, but they are beginning to tremble for their ownsafety and to wonder what the final outcome of it all will be. Whereverthe gospel truth has been preached in all its purity, the sectariandenominations have been left destitute of spiritual life; for thechildren of God have heard his call, "Come out of her, my people," andhave made their escape to Zion. Hence the ministers of Babylon cry outcontinually, "Stop! you are tearing our churches down," "You are takingour best members away from us," etc. But we can not withhold the truth;for the time has come when God is gathering his people together out ofall the "places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and darkday" (Ezek. 34:12) into the one church that Jesus built. "Babylon isfallen, is fallen."    20. Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and    prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.This verse is so clear that it requires no special explanation. God'speople are delivered from sect Babylon; and while the judgments ofeternal truth are being poured out upon her, all heaven and earth iscalled upon to rejoice and to give glory to God.  "We stand in the glory that Jesus has given,    The moon as the day-spring doth shine;  The light of the sun is now equal to seven,    So bright is the glory divine.  "Now filled with the Spirit and clad in the armor    Of light and omnipotent truth,  We'll testify ever and Jesus we'll honor,    And stand from sin Babel aloof.  "The prophet's keen vision transpiercing the ages,    Beheld us to Zion return;  We'll sing of our freedom, though Babylon rages,    We'll shout as her city doth burn."    21. And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone,    and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that    great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at    all.    22. And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and    trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no    craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in    thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all    in thee;    23. And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in    thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be    heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great    men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations    deceived.    24. And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints,    and of all that were slain upon the earth.Following the moral fall of Babylon and the call of God's people out ofher, a mighty angel predicts her eternal doom. "With violence shall thatgreat city Babylon be thrown down, and _shall be found no more at all_."This doubtless has reference to the entire city of Babylon in all herdivisions brought to view in this series of prophecy and shows her finaldestruction at the coming of Christ, when she shall suddenly be thrownwith terrific force, like a great millstone descending into the sea, and"shall be found no more at all." According to the symbols here given shewill be like a city completely destroyed, not one inhabitant or livingcreature remaining. Thus her eternal doom is pictured and remains to beyet fulfilled."And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of allthat were slain upon the earth." We have already shown thatProtestantism, as well as her mother Romanism, has been guilty ofshedding innocent blood; and as the term Babylon includes both thesedivisions, when the great city is thrown down with violence, Romanismand Protestantism will sink together, and then this awful treasure--theblood of prophets and of saints--shall be brought to light in that lastgreat day of God Almighty.CHAPTER XIX.    And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in    heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, and    power, unto the Lord our God:    2. For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged    the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her    fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her   hand.    3. And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever    and ever.    4. And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down    and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen;    Alleluia.    5. And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God,    all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.    6. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as    the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty    thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent    reigneth.    7. Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the    marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself    ready.    8. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine    linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness    of saints.    9. And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are    called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto    me, These are the true sayings of God.    10. And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me,    See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren    that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony    of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.The scene of this vision is laid in heaven. John heard a great voice ofmuch people saying, "Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honor, andpower, unto the Lord our God." This great song of praise doubtless camefrom the lips of the angelic throng; for immediately the four livingcreatures and the four and twenty elders reechoed the same shout ofpraise, saying, "Amen; Alleluia." Then came a voice from the thronecalling upon the servants of God, both small and great, to unite on thisoccasion in one grand and sacred song of praise; and this sublime chorusfell upon the ear of the enraptured apostle "as it were the voice of agreat multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice ofmighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotentreigneth. Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him for themarriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife [or bride] hath made herselfready." Was not here a hearty response to that call, "Rejoice over herthou heaven"? While this scene shows the interest all heaven takes inthese wondrous scenes of earth, it is doubtless intended especially torepresent the joy and thanksgiving of God's people who have "gotten thevictory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and overthe number of his name."The marriage of the Lamb which was about to take place was a specialtheme of joy on this occasion. In the Scripture the term _marriage_ isfrequently used to represent a special union between Christ and hispeople. Thus, the early church was represented as being free because ofthe death of the law, that they "should be _married_ to another, even tohim who is raised from the dead." Rom. 7:4. So, also, the eternal unionof Christ with his people is here described under the figure ofmarriage. In one sense they have been married to Christ all through thisdispensation; in another sense they have not. The church has had thepromise of this eternal union, hence she has been betrothed to Christ;but left in the world, she has been driven into the wilderness, while acorrupt and drunken prostitute and her harlot daughters have been in thepublic view. Now, however, the judgments of God have descended uponBabylon, and the bride of Christ appears in all her beauty again,"arrayed in fine linen, clean and white"; and the next great event isher public marriage to Christ when he comes to claim her as his own.The marriage scene is one of the most joyful that we witness on earth,and among Eastern nations especially was celebrated with great pomp andmagnificence, the joy and splendor of the occasion being enhancedaccording to the rank and wealth of the parties. But earth has neverwitnessed such an event as this special _marriage of the Lamb_. Well maythe inhabitants of heaven and earth, in view of this sublime spectacle,swell the song of praise--"Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor tohim: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath madeherself ready." The special preparations that the bride is makingrepresents the glorious holiness reformation that is now sweeping overthe world, gathering God's people together for the splendid event."Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of theLamb.""These are the true sayings of God." They are almost too glorious to bebelieved; still, they are no idle dreams of fancy: they are true, yea"the true sayings of God." In the contemplation of such a wonderfulevent, the beloved apostle was carried away, as it were, with holyenthusiasm, and he fell at the feet of the angel to worship. We do notknow just what the motives or impressions were that caused him to dothis. But his soul was full, full to overflowing, and he could not butadore and worship. The angel, however, refused the homage thus offered,by the declaration that he himself, also, was the servant of Christ andone of the brethren that had the testimony of Jesus; "for the testimonyof Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." The idea is: "I am a fellowservantwith you, and we both have his testimony. You bear witness to him now inthis present generation; I bear witness to those who are to come. Youwitness now of his death and resurrection; I tell of his future gloryand triumphs. We are both, therefore, engaged in the same good work. Thetestimony of Jesus and the spirit of prophecy are the same. To God,therefore, we must both bow." See remarks on chap. 1:1.    11. And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he    that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in    righteousness he doth judge and make war.    12. His eyes were as a flame _of_ fire, and on his head were    many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he    himself.    13. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his    name is called The Word of God.    14. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white    horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.    15. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he    should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of    iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath    of Almighty God.    16. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written,    KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.That the person described in this vision is Christ is questioned by noone. He is the same one who appeared to John in the beginning. Then hestood in the midst of the seven golden candle-sticks, the sure defenseof the churches, holding the seven stars in his right hand. Now,however, he appears from the opened heavens on a white horse, hismission "to judge and make war." The description of his person, hisnames, and his attributes, unmistakably proclaim him the Son of God. Heis the "faithful and true," the name by which he made himself known tothe churches of Philadelphia and Laodicea. "His eyes as a flame of fire"denotes omniscience; and as a searcher of all hearts he made himselfknown to the church of Thyatira. "Many crowns" are a symbol of supremesovereignty and doubtless signify his many victories. "And he had a namewritten which no man knew but he himself." He had names by which hemight be known to mortals; but he had one name that no createdintelligence could understand: it was known only to him. What that namewas, of course, is not given; it could not be. If the human mind couldnot conceive it, human language could not convey it. We can know him asthe Faithful and true Witness, as the Word of God, and as King of kingsand Lord of lords; but there is one name that we can not know. His"vesture dipped in blood" refers, not to the blood of atonement, but tothe blood of his enemies sprinkled upon his raiment in treading thewinepress of God's wrath, and denotes that he was going forth to thedread work of vengeance. To this I shall refer more fully hereafter. Hisname is also called "the Word of God," which, when used as a personalappellation in the Scriptures, always signifies Jesus Christ.Before considering his mission further and the armies that accompaniedhim, I wish to call special attention to the nature and the chronologyof this event. If the present series of prophetic symbols (which beginwith chap. 17) is a narrative of continuous events reaching to the end,then the vision before us is a description of the second coming ofChrist, the event which was just previously announced and for which thebride had made herself ready. The usual interpretation given it is, thatit is a sublime description of the servants of Christ going forth underhis direction to spread the truth everywhere among the nations--inshort, that it is the triumph of gospel truth over error under the_providential_ government of Christ. That such a meaning can be derivedfrom the vision by taking it in a _figurative_ sense there can be nodoubt, and this is what commentators generally do. They make the whole afigurative description of the triumph of the gospel, Christ beingpresent only by his superintending providence. It is made simply ahighly poetic description of the victory of truth and righteousness. Inthis case, however, the principles of symbolic language are clearlyabandoned and a mere ordinary figurative meaning given. If we followstrictly the laws of symbolic language, as we manifestly ought, we shallbe compelled to take another view of it.In the first place, if this does not describe the actual coming ofChrist, then his second coming is nowhere described in the Revelation.That so great an event should merely be alluded to in a few places andnowhere symbolically described seems incredible. At the judgment scenebrought to view in the following chapter the presence of Christ is_assumed_, but it is not stated. Again, there are no victories of loveand mercy described at all in the vision before us; but, on thecontrary, it is a scene of fearful judgment--a terrible treading of "thewinepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God," the completeoverthrow of every opposing power; while the beast and the false prophetare represented as taken and cast alive into a lake of fire burning withbrimstone. Surely, this is not the work of the church of God. But let itbe remembered especially that this last event takes place under the_seventh_ plague, which is the "filling up" of the wrath of God, andthat Christ previously announced under the sixth vial, "Behold, _I come_as a thief." Christ comes in reality when this seventh plague occurs. Torepresent the glorious triumphs of Christianity by the mission of thechurch, the gospel and the Holy Spirit, under the symbol of Christ,going forth to judge, to make war, and to tread the winepress of God'swrath, is at war with every principle of symbolic language.But can this vision of Christ upon a white horse denote a mereprovidential superintendence, such as Christ constantly exercises overthe church and its spiritual affairs on earth? Certainly not by anyprinciple of symbolic language. Throughout the whole prophecy thus farwe have seen that whenever any symbolic agent is brought upon thepanorama, whether horseman, or beasts, or locusts, or harlot, orwhatever else, it always denotes some corresponding agents appearing onearth and beginning their appropriate work. The symbolic agent is real.But here is a symbolic appearance of Christ. By what law could such asymbolic appearance represent merely a providential superintendence? Andif his appearance was necessary in this case, why was it not necessaryin every event, to show that it was done under his direction? Again, ifthis symbolic appearance of Christ is not his real appearance, how canwe tell that there is any reality in the appearance of the horsemen ofthe first four seals, the ten-horned beast, or the harlot woman? Whatright have we to remove one agent from the panorama as an actual agentthere any more than another? And if this is not his real appearance,upon what principle of interpretation can we ever establish the fact ofhis second coming? It is evident to all that, if we can turn this agentinto a mere providential one, we can do the same with another, and thusset aside his second coming altogether. Then, what shall we say in thenext chapter when some one steals our weapons and declares that thegreat white throne before which all the dead, small and great, stand isnothing but that providential government of God under which all sinnerspass condemnation upon themselves and their sins find them out? If wecan deal thus with symbols, we can do anything with them and can makeout any meaning we please.The laws of symbolic language require us to take the appearance ofChrist in this vision just as we do the appearance of any other agent,as a real event. We can not consistently give it any other meaning. His_symbolic_ appearance must represent his _real_ appearance; otherwise,it can never be represented by anything. Jesus appears in his own nameand person because there is no other that can represent his infinitedignity and majesty. And the symbols connected with him denote theobject of his mission and the work which he performs. His white horseshows him now a glorious conqueror; his crowns denote his supremedominion; the sword of his mouth and his vesture dipped in blood denotethe dread work of vengeance upon his enemies; while the army followinghim doubtless denotes the "ten thousands of his saints" that accompanyhim when he comes. Jude 14. The bride has already prepared herself forhis coming, and now the eternal union takes place. "Blessed are theywhich are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb."    17. And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a    loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of    heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of    the great God;    18. That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of    captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses;    and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both    free and bond, both small and great.    19. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their    armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on    the horse, and against his army.    20. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that    wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that    had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his    image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning    with brimstone.    21. And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat    upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all    the fowls were filled with their flesh.The foregoing explanation so nearly covers this ground that littleremains to be said. The symbol is that of vast slaughter on abattle-field, which gathers all the birds of heaven and the beasts ofthe forest to the prey. The enemies gathered for this battle were "thebeast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies," together with thefalse prophet. This is the grand confederacy of wickedness formed underthe mission of the three unclean spirits that went forth, not only untothe kings of the earth, but also into the whole world. This is not aliteral collecting of armies, hence not a literal slaughter upon abattlefield, nor a literal assembling of carrion birds; but it is asymbolic representation of the final and eternal destruction of theallied powers of sin. As will be further described in the followingchapter, they were gathered together for the purpose of overthrowing thechurch of God and anticipated a complete victory in the battle ofArmageddon; but the sudden appearance of Jesus Christ to rescue hisbride results in their complete overthrow. The special theme of thisseries of prophecy has been the history of apostate Christendom; hencethe beast and the false prophet are represented as being taken andthrown into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. "The remnant" thatwere slain refers to the other powers of wickedness not embraced inCatholicism and Protestantism This series being now traced to its close,the narrative returns to take up another important theme of prophetictruth.CHAPTER XX.    And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the    bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.    2. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is    the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years.    3. And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and    set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more,    till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he    must be loosed a little season.It is commonly supposed that the events here described are to occur atthe second advent; but by considering carefully the different thingsenumerated in this chapter--the binding of the dragon; then a thousandyears; after that the Armageddon battle; and last of all the judgmentscene, in which all the dead, both small and great, are rewarded, andall the powers of wickedness cast into the lake of fire--it will be seenat once that this is not a continuation of the series of prophecyimmediately preceding, but an entirely new theme, running partlyparallel with that series, and both ending at the same point--the secondcoming of Christ and the general judgment, in which the lake of fire isthe final doom of the combined powers of wickedness. In that series thebeast and the false prophet--Romanism and Protestantism--were the chiefpowers of evil under consideration; in this series the dragon featurepredominates. If this be not true, then there will be two judgmentscenes and the wicked cast into the lake of fire twice. Positive proofof the position here taken will be given as we proceed.The power here referred to as "the Devil and Satan" is also denominated"the dragon." This use of the definite article shows clearly that aparticular character is designated--_the_ dragon--and implies that theobject has already been introduced. In his first appearance upon thesymbolic panorama (chap. 12:3) he is simply styled _a_ dragon, but inevery subsequent instance he is called _the_ dragon, which proves thatthe same character is meant. In addition to the former remarks onchapter 12:9 relative to the terms applied to this antichristian power,the following quotation from the People's Cyclopaedia will throw somelight on the subject: "In the mythical history and legendary poetry ofalmost every nation, the dragon appears as the emblem of the destructiveand anarchistic principle.... Like the serpent, the dragon is always aminister of evil ... the object of which is to fight order, harmony, andprogress. In Christian art, the dragon is the emblem of sin.... It isoften represented as crushed under the feet of saints and martyrs....Sometimes its prostrate attitude signifies the triumph of Christianityover Paganism." Art. Dragon. Considering this usage of these terms forages, it is not strange that they were applied also to that greatantichristian, persecuting system of Paganism, which stood beforeChristianity as its greatest barrier to "order, harmony, and progress."The angel that overthrew this public system of Pagan infidelitysymbolizes the primitive host of Christians, the ministers inparticular. Some have supposed that he represented Christ; but, asalready shown conclusively, Christ can not be symbolized by an inferiorintelligence, hence always appears upon the scene in his own character,proclaiming his own eternal name. The fact that this angel possessed thekey of the bottomless pit is no proof that he is Christ, even though inchapter 1:18 Jesus is said to have certain keys; for in chapter 9:1 wefind that a _fallen star_--the symbol of Mohammed--is said to have "thekey of the bottomless pit" also. At the most, this expression is only asymbol of power and authority, be it good or bad. In the gospel the samefigure is applied to God's ministers, where they are given authority tobind the powers of wickedness on earth. Mat. 16:19; 18:18. The chain isa symbol of the power to bind.When Christianity first commenced its warfare with this huge system oferror, almost the entire then-known world was under its deceptiveinfluence; but by a long conflict, in which thousands of the noblefollowers of the Lamb were slaughtered, this antichristian public systemof Pagan infidelity was at last completely overthrown, and the finalresult was, that the civilized world became as completely Christian(nominally at least) as it ever had been Pagan. This greattransformation could never have been effected without the undyingheroism and whole-hearted consecration of the first disciples of Christ.From this time the dragon _as such_--as a public deceiver of the nationsthroughout the Apocalyptic earth--was overthrown. This marks thebeginning of the thousand years mentioned.Since many of the principles of heathenism were copied by the church ofRome, it may be difficult for some to understand at first why it is saidthat the dragon no longer deceived the nations after being cast down byprimitive Christianity; but this becomes clear when we consider what thedragon really was and what the church of Rome was understood to be. Atime came when the entire civilized world knew that heathenism as suchwas wrong and rejected the very idea of a plurality of gods; but theywere led to believe that they could adapt many of their former rites andceremonies to the worship of the one true God in whom they believed andthereby render acceptable service to him, and were sure that the Romishchurch was the one true apostolic church. It was not the dragon, orheathenism, that then deceived them; it was Christianity--_a falseChristianity_. The manner in which the people were deceived during thetime following the casting down of heathenism in the beginning hasalready been considered in chapters XII, XIII, XVII, XVIII, etc.,covering the same period of time included in the one thousand years inthe vision before us.We can not apply this period specified as literally one thousand yearswithout varying from every principle of time prophecy in the Revelation,for they are all symbolic; neither can we apply it according to theusual year-day method, which, signifying three hundred and sixtythousand years, would throw this series of events out of harmony withthe time-periods allotted to the other themes of truth running over thesame ground and terminating at the same point--the general judgment.Therefore, to be consistent, we shall have to apply it as (so far ashuman knowledge of the exact dates is concerned) an indefinite length oftime, on the same principle that "the hour of temptation" in chapter3:10, the three and one-half days in chapter 11:9, and the "hour" inwhich the ten kingdoms receive power with the beast (chap. 17:12), etc.,are applied.    4. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was    given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded    for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had    not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had    received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and    they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.    5. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand    years were finished. This is the first resurrection.    6. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first    resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they    shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him    a thousand years.We have in this description another division of the subjectintroduced--a history of God's people, or one phase of the church,during the same thousand years following the casting down of the dragon."They lived and reigned with Christ." It was those who had "part in thefirst resurrection" that were exalted to this honored position withChrist. Millenarians always _assume_ that this refers to a literalresurrection at the second coming of Christ, but no such thing is hintedat. Not one word is said about literally resurrected saints reigning.John says, "I saw the _souls_ of them which were beheaded for thewitness of Jesus ... and _they_ lived and reigned with Christ a thousandyears." Nothing whatever is said about any reign on earth at all; butthe description shows plainly that it was disembodied spirits that werereigning with Christ in Paradise during the period that followed thecasting down of the dragon, which was in reality one of long apostasyand darkness on earth. Before and during this conflict with Paganism thechurch of God was publicly triumphant on earth. Afterward, during theapostasy, a false church was, in the public view, triumphant, while thechurch of God was crowded out of sight into the wilderness. However, thereign of God's saints did not cease; for when they were slaughtered bytheir relentless persecutors and deprived of their reign on earth, theywere, as symbolized by the man-child, caught up to God and to his throneand there "lived and reigned with Christ" during the thousand yearsunder consideration.This same thought concerning the reign of the martyrs in Paradise whilethe powers of evil triumphed on earth, was brought to view on theopening of the fifth seal in chapter 6:9-11. "And when he had opened thefifth seal, I saw under the altar the _souls of them that were slain_for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: and theycried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dostthou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? Andwhite robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said untothem, that they should rest yet for a little season, until theirfellowservants also and their brethren, _that should be killed as theywere_ should be fulfilled." This quotation will make clear one pointconcerning the refusal of the martyrs to worship the beast and hisimage. We are not to understand that every soul of the martyrs John sawin these visions reigned during the entire period under consideration;but he beheld the reign of the saints above during the one thousandyears, and he saw there the souls of all the martyrs--such as had beenslain in the early days of Christianity (chap. 12:11); such as refusedto worship the beast and were martyred therefor (chap. 13:7); and also,such as "should be killed as they were" (chap. 6:11) and were put todeath shortly after the formation of the image of the beast. Chap.13:15; 16:6.This company of souls that the apostle saw reigning with Christ abovewere those who had had part "in the first resurrection," which had madethem "blessed and holy." They were not on earth; they were disembodiedspirits above, hence had not been literally resurrected. The Scripturesclearly teach that mankind in their ordinary condition are "_dead_ intrespasses and in sins," and that through salvation, which makes them"blessed and holy," they are "quickened" to a new life in Christ. Eph.2:1. That this is Scripturally "the first resurrection" is proved mostpositively by the words of Christ--"Verily, verily, I say unto you, thehour is coming, _and now is_, when the _dead_ shall hear the voice ofthe Son of God: and they that hear _shall live_. He that heareth myword, and believeth on him that sent me, _hath_ everlasting life, andshall not come into condemnation, but is _passed from death unto life_."John 5:25, 24. Although many other proofs could easily be given, this ofitself is sufficient to establish the point that the host of earlyChristians who had "passed from death unto life" in Christ and who gavetheir lives gladly for the sake of Christ, constituted the ones referredto as having had "part in the first resurrection." According to verse 6it was only on those who had part in the first resurrection that thesecond death had no power. The church at Smyrna received the surepromise from Christ himself that they should "not be hurt of the seconddeath" (chap. 2:11); and this shows beyond all question that even atthat early date they had had part in this first resurrection that makesmen blessed and holy.It is the trick of Beelzebub to deceive souls by causing them tooverlook the fact that this first resurrection that made men blessed andholy is of a spiritual nature and to fix their hopes in two literalresurrections at the end. There will be but one literal resurrectionthen, as is clearly shown by the account given of the judgment in thischapter, verses 11-15. The writer of the Revelation declared positively,"Behold, he cometh with clouds: and _every eye_ shall see him, and theyalso which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail becauseof him." Chap. 1:7. If this does not prove that there is but one literalresurrection when Christ comes, then I would not know how to state sucha fact if I desired. Furthermore, Jesus himself, in the same chapter inwhich he described "the first resurrection," says most positively thatall the literal dead shall be resurrected at the same time. "Marvel notat this," he says: "the _hour_ is coming, in the which all that are inthe graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that havedone good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil,unto the resurrection of damnation." John 5:28, 29. This _hour_certainly can not signify more than a short period of time. In theirefforts to prove two literal resurrections, millenarians always quotewith emphasis, "The dead in Christ shall rise first." 1 Thes. 4:16. Indoing so they, either ignorantly or wilfully, wrest the Scriptures totheir own destruction; for any one can see at a glance that no suchthing as two resurrections is even hinted at. Verses 15-17 simply teachthis, that the righteous who are living on the earth at the time Christappears will not ascend to heaven _before_ the righteous dead areresurrected, but the dead will rise first, then they will all be caughtup together at one and the same time. The wicked are not mentioned inthis connection; for, as stated, Paul was writing this only for thecomfort and the edification of the church. In the following chapter,however, their "sudden destruction" at the second coming of Christ ismentioned as a warning to the church.It is evident that the first resurrection as applied in this connectionspecified particularly that phase of the church which, as symbolized bythe man-child, was caught up to God through martyrdom and there "livedand reigned with Christ." The other phase of the church, symbolized bythe woman, is not said to reign with Christ a thousand years, but, onthe other hand, is represented as driven into the wilderness, her publicreign on earth being ended by the holy city being trodden under foot ofa profane multitude of apostate beast-worshipers; and the two witnesses,clothed in sackcloth, were prophesying only in a few isolated,individual hearts.A careful study of this scripture, taken in connection with others inthe Revelation applying to the same object, will show that all God'speople, both those here brought to view during the thousand years andthose following that period, are spoken of as dead people resurrectedand reigning. They are considered under two phases--those who, assymbolized by the man-child, were caught up to God through martyrdom andthere lived and reigned with Christ; and those who, as symbolized by thewoman, were deprived of their public reign on earth and were driven intothe wilderness during the same period. The first phase were "priests ofGod and of Christ" and reigned with him in Paradise (chap. 6:9-11); but"the rest," the phase symbolized by the woman, did not live and enjoytheir public reign again, as in the early days of Christianity, untilthe expiration of the thousand-year period. It is true that individualson earth received life from God and were thus spiritually resurrectedduring the thousand-year period; but the dominant beast-power martyredthem by thousands, the two witnesses were then in their sack-clothstate, and thus the public triumphal reign of the saints on earthceased. The statement of verse five that "the rest of the dead lived notagain until the thousand years were finished" should be applied not inan individual, but in a general sense, the same as the reign aboveduring the same period is considered. There is also some doubt as to theauthenticity of this sentence. It is not found in the VaticanManuscript, which is one of the oldest in existence; and the SyriacVersion, which has come down to us from early days through an entirelyseparate channel, does not contain it. However, it is evident that thephase of the church symbolized by the woman actually reigns triumphantlyon earth after the thousand years is finished; for verses 7-9 of thischapter show that the dragon, combined with Gog and Magog, goes forth onthe breadth of the earth to compass the camp of the saints just beforethe end of time.The fact that the reign of God's people on earth is divided into twodistinct periods is shown also by other prophecies. In the seventhchapter of Daniel is recorded a vision of four great beasts, symbolizingthe Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Grecian, and Roman empires. Verse 18,connected with Dan. 2:31-44, shows that the saints were to possess thekingdom of God before the overthrow of all these four kingdoms, whichwas actually fulfilled by Jesus Christ appearing during the reign of theRoman empire and planting the kingdom of God in the earth. See Mark1:15; Luke 12:32; 16:16; Col. 1:13. Then follows a description of therise of the Papacy, which was to "_wear out the saints of the mostHigh_" for a time, times, and the dividing of times--three and one-halftimes, or forty-two months, or, prophetically, twelve hundred and sixtyyears. This, as before explained, reaches to the year A.D. 1530. Duringthis period the public reign of the saints on earth ceased. Thenimmediately following it is said, "The judgment shall sit, and theyshall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it _unto theend_." This does not refer to the final judgment; it is a spiritualjudgment that commences before that time and continues "_unto the end_."For example of a similar _judgment_ see Acts 7:7.God had a people during the Protestant era who walked in all the lightthey possessed and who were filled with judgment against the beast-powerthat had worn out the saints for ages. And though in places some wereput to death for refusing to worship the image of the beast thatlifeless professors had set up, yet there were from time to timereformations that resurrected many people to life in Christ. A littlelater, however, the real spiritual reign of the saints is perfectlyrestored in the pure gospel light of the evening time, and now the nextverse is fulfilled, which says, "And the kingdom and dominion, and thegreatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to thepeople of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlastingkingdom." It is only reasonable to suppose that the public reign onearth would commence gradually and would finally reach its perfectfulfilment, just the same as it ceased gradually in the beginning.Therefore we can not point to a definite date exactly marking the end ofthe thousand years, any more than we can locate exactly the time of itscommencement; but we must be satisfied just to consider this symbolicexpression as covering a long period of time during which theseimportant phases of deep truth are considered merely from a generalstandpoint.This special reign of a thousand years above is doubtless brought to ourview for the express purpose of making the history of the triumph ofChristianity continuous. When interrupted on earth, the scene issuddenly transferred to Paradise; then when the woman comes out of thewilderness and the public reign on earth begins again, while the womanis being prepared as a bride for the coming of the Lamb, the scene, asthe following description in verse 9 also will show, is againtransferred to earth. The reign above does not in reality cease with theexpiration of the thousand years, but we are permitted to obtain a viewof it only for that length of time during the down-trodden state of thechurch on earth. This reign of the martyrs' above is placed in directcontrast with the public reign on earth during the same time, whichconsisted of multitudes of people worshiping the beast, recieving hisimage and his mark. What the "thrones" on which they sat and the"judgment" given them signifies, I do not know for certain, but it isdoubtless the same exalted privilege and authority which Christ promisedto all his over-comers--to sit with him on his throne. Chap. 3:21.    7. And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be    loosed out of his prison,    8. And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four    quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to    battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.    9. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed    the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire    came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.    10. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of    fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are,    and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.The loosing of Satan, or the dragon, is the first important point to beconsidered. Before this matter can be rightly understood, however, wemust take into account carefully certain facts regarding his binding. Itwas not the dragon as a political power that Christianity attacked (itdid not labor to that end), but it was its huge public system of falsebelief that was overthrown. This great system, as opposed toChristianity, can all be summed up under the one word _infidelity_._Infidel_ signifies "a heathen; one who disbelieves in Christ, or thedivine origin and authority of Christianity."--Webster. This system waspositively an antichristian power that sought by every possible means todestroy the religion of Jesus and to blot out his very name. It failedin the attempt. It was bound. During the long reign of Popery, when thedoctrine was be-a-Catholic-or-die, infidelity could not publicly liftits head in the sense in which it was cast down by the early Christians.It had no power over the nations of the Apocalyptic earth to thendeceive them; but they were greatly deceived by a false Christianityuntil almost all the world wondered after the beast. The release of thedragon, then, in order to be entirely satisfactory and consistent, mustembrace the following points: First, it must at least include thedevelopment of a great public antichristian power whose avowed object isto destroy the whole fabric of Christianity. Second, being bound bydivine power, his release must be the result of divine permission for aspecial purpose. Third, the scene of his imprisonment must necessarilybe the place of his release; namely, the earth--the Apocalypticearth--the territory of the Roman empire.We find all these requirements meeting a most perfect fulfilment in theevents described under the pouring out of the first vial, which was doneby the direction of Him that sat upon the throne. A sufficient historyof that fearful system of infidelity which, through the labors ofVoltaire and his coadjutors, spread throughout all Europe has alreadybeen given. The very object of the leaders of this movement was theextermination of the Christian religion, and their secret watchword was"Crush the wretch," meaning Jesus Christ. The dragon was loose in allhis terrible features. The Pagans upheld a false belief; these modernworshipers of the dragon did likewise and publicly exalted the "Goddessof Reason" as an object of devotion, setting aside every tenth day fortheir hellish orgies in her honor. The former endeavored to overthrowthe Christian religion; the latter had for its special aim the utterdestruction of everything Christian either in name or in character. Thisdevilish system spread over all Europe and almost undermined the wholefabric of society, and threatened to convert the world from Christianityto the worship of the Goddess of Reason. Its foothold gained was soextensive and its effects so far-reaching that prominent historians,D'Aubigne among the number, have denominated the period of its greatesttriumph "the day of Reason." It is one of the three and one-half dayscovered by the prophecy in Rev. 11:9.I do not wish to be understood, however, as limiting the release of thedragon and his work to the system of infidelity that had its origin inFrance. I merely refer to that unfortunate system as the beginning ofthe dragon's release and work--the re-introduction to the world of thoseprinciples of public hostility to Christianity which had lain buriedsince the days of Pagan Rome. The dragon in the beginning was adeceptive system, one that "deceived the whole world"; but itsdeceptions were uncovered by the light of Christianity, and then itbecame the bitter public opposer of the religion of Christ. In therelease of the dragon the order is reversed. He first appears as thepublic enemy of Christianity in the form already mentioned, butafterwards changes his tactics to milder methods in order the better to"deceive" the people, as we shall see hereafter.But there is another chapter in the history of the dragon's career thatwe must not overlook--his partnership with Gog and Magog. The originalsignification of the terms _Gog and Magog_ is difficult to ascertain, asall known accounts are conflicting. The terms occur in Ezek. 38 and 39also. In the Revelation, however, it is clear that these terms areapplied to Romanism and Protestantism, and under the special leadershipof this spirit of antichrist they are gathered together to battleagainst the saints of the most High. I will again quote the descriptionof this union as given under the sixth vial, which refers to the presenttime: "And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouthof the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouthof the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, workingmiracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the wholeworld, to gather them to the battle of that great day of GodAlmighty.... And he gathered them into a place called in the Hebrewtongue Armageddon." Chap. 16:13-16. It will be noticed that the field ofoperations under this grand confederation of the three unclean spiritsis enlarged so that it includes not merely the Apocalyptic earth, but"the whole world."In order to form a confederation of powers each of which holds its owndistinctive principles, it is necessary that each make certainconcessions, in outward appearance at least, so that they can worktogether in harmony against a common foe. In this case it will benecessary that three points be conceded before the dragon, the beast,and the false prophet can agree. First, the dragon must not appear inhis true character as antichristian; he must be clothed in somedifferent attire in order to "deceive." Second, Catholicism must stopher work of slaying those who disagree with her and cover up her trueprinciples. Third, Protestantism must cease protesting against theabominations of Catholicism. We are living in the time when thisconfederation of the powers of wickedness is being effected; thereforewe must not expect to see the dragon as a terrible creature with headsand horns standing as the open adversary of God, but we must look forhim dressed up in a garb "to deceive." If necessary he can place himselfunder a Christian garb without violating his conscience--of which he hasnone.It will perhaps be beneficial to give the reader a short account of someof the forms under which the dragon is manifesting himself at thepresent time in order to "deceive" the people. It will be rememberedthat, in the description of the first vial, which represented the awfulsystem of infidelity that was spread over Europe, Dr. Adam Weishaupt ofthe University of Ingolstadt, formed a secret society under the name ofthe Illuminati in order the better to spread these wicked principles. Aquotation was also made showing that "_Freemasonry_ being in high reputeall over Europe when Weishaupt first formed the plan of his society, heavailed himself of its secrecy to introduce his new order, which rapidlyspread, by the efforts of its founders and disciples, through all thosecountries." Now, if Freemasonry was such an excellent channel for thedragon to begin his work through, is it not reasonable to suppose thathe would still retain his position in that order, and especially since_the very name of Christ_ is barred from its rites, rules, andceremonies? And this thought is especially convincing when we considerthe fact that Freemasonry is in its very nature and constitution only aform of Paganism. This vast body is founded on what they call the"ancient mysteries." The following is taken from Masonic Salvation byFred Husted:"Warburton says: 'Each of the Pagan gods had (beside the public andopen) a secret worship paid unto him, to which none were admitted butthose who had been selected by preparatory ceremonies called initiation.This secret worship was called "the mysteries."'"Mackey, another member of this order, says: 'These mysteries existed inevery country of heathendom, in each under a different name, and to someextent under a different form, but always and everywhere with the samedesign of inculcating (teaching) by allegorical and symbolical teachingsthe great Masonic doctrines of the unity of God and the immortality ofthe soul. This one important proposition and the fact which itenumerates (states) must never be lost sight of, in any inquiry into theorigin of Freemasonry; for the Pagan mysteries were to the spuriousFreemasonry of antiquity precisely what the Masters' lodges are to theFreemasonry of the present day.'"This is certainly a frank statement, coming as it does from a man whois an acknowledged and highly esteemed authority in matters pertainingto the craft. Daniel Sickles says, 'In Egypt, Greece, and many otherancient nations Freemasonry, that is, the Mysteries, was one of theearliest agencies employed to effect the improvement and enlightenmentof man.' Pierson says, 'The identity of the Masonic institutions withthe ancient Mysteries is obvious,' which means clearly to be seen,manifest to any and all."Masons say that the order is founded on the Bible--that is, unlearnedMasons say so. Geo. Wingate Chase, in the Digest of Masonic Law, says:'The Jews, the Turks, each reject either the New Testament or the Old orboth, and yet we see no good reasons why they should not be made Masons.In fact, Blue Lodge [first three degrees] Masonry has nothing whateverto do with the Bible. It is not founded on the Bible. If it were, itwould not be Masonry; it would be something else.'"Sickles says in speaking of the third, or Master Mason's degree, 'Thereare characters impressed upon it which can not be mistaken. _It isthoroughly Egyptian_.' He further says that the tradition is older by athousand years than Solomon. 'That our [Masonic] rites embrace all thepossible circumstances of man, moral, social, and spiritual, and have ameaning high as the heavens, broad as the universe, and profound aseternity.' Sickles in Gen. Chiman Rezon."The writer was informed when the charges were given him 'that ourancient brethren worshiped in high hills and in low vales, and thatguards were placed to keep off cowans or eves-droppers.' By referring toScripture we at once find the character of those who worshiped in highhills and low vales, and why they needed a guard to keep offeves-droppers. 'Thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every highhill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.'Jer. 2:20; 3:6. 'Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein thenations which ye shall possess served other gods, upon the highmountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree.' Deut. 12:2.'Enflaming themselves with idols under every green tree, slaying thechildren in the vales under the clifts of the rocks.... Even thitherwentest thou up to offer sacrifice.' Isa. 57:5-7. They were not afraidof Ahab and Jezebel (2 Kings 7:10; 1 Kings 14:23), and they grew andmultiplied in their reigns, and in the reigns of all those of whom it isrecorded that 'they did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.'Some of the kings of Israel and of Judah destroyed their high places forthem and were highly favored of God for so doing."Again, 'The precepts of Jesus could not have been made obligatory upona Jew. A Christian would have denied the sanction of the Koran. AMohammedan must have rejected the law of Moses, and a disciple ofZoroaster would have turned from all, to the teaching of hisZend-Avesta. The universal law of nature, which the authors of the oldcharges have properly called the moral, is therefore the _only law_suited in every respect to be adopted as the Masonic code.' Mackeys'Textbook, Masonic Jurisprudence. If the statements just quoted do notplace the secret society of Masonry on a footing decidedly Pagan, it isdifficult to say just where it does stand...."Tammuz, or Osiris of Egypt, who is declared to be the original of HiramAbiff the temple-builder, is still mourned for. Ezek. 8:14. See Young'sAnalytical Concordance or any standard Greek Mythology. Now seePiersons' Traditions of Freemasonry. 'The Masonic legend stands byitself, unsupported by history, or other than its own traditions. Yet wereadily recognize in Hiram Abiff the Osiris of the Egyptians, theMithras of the Persians, the Bacchus of the Greeks [god of drunkenness,or feasts and the like], the Dionysis of the fraternity of artificers,and the Atys of the Phrygians, whose passions, deaths, and resurrectionswere celebrated by these people respectively.' Thus it is clearly shownthat each of these ancient nations had its counterfeit Savior andRedeemer, and it is here proved by the words of Masonic Grand Masters,authors, and authorities, that Masonry is of Pagan origin."When we think of the millions of devotees of this form of Paganism,multitudes of church-members and preachers, surely it is not difficultto see that the dragon is loose in deceiving power again. That he ismeeting with great success in forming his confederation of all falsereligions, is obvious. The world's Parliament of Religions, held inChicago in the year 1893, is an illustration of this statement. Thedragon, the beast, and the false prophet met in "mutual confidence andrespect," a "brotherhood" of religions. Theism, Judaism, Mohammedanism,Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Shintoism, Zoroastrianism,Catholicism, the Greek Church, and Protestantism in many forms--allthese were represented. And the devotees of these religions met, as theysaid, "To unite all religion against all irreligion; to make the goldenrule the basis of this union; and to present to the world _substantialunity of many religions_." The following are a few extracts fromaddresses made before the Parliament.President Charles Carroll Bonney, in the opening address, said:"Worshipers of God and lovers of man: Let us rejoice that we have livedto see this glorious day.... That we are permitted to take part in thissolemn and majestic event of a World's Congress of Religions. Theimportance of this event can not be overestimated. Its influence on thefuture relations of the various races of men, can not be too highlyesteemed. If this Congress shall faithfully execute its duties withwhich it has been charged, it shall become the joy of the whole earth,and stand in human history like a _new Mount Zion_, crowned with glory,and marking the actual beginning of a _new epoch of brotherhood_ andpeace. _For when the religious faiths of the world recognize each otheras brothers, children of one Father_, whom all profess to love andserve, then, and not until then, will the nations of the earth yield tothe spirit of concord and learn war no more.... We meet on the mountainheight of absolute respect for the religious convictions of eachother.... This day the sun of a new era of religious peace and progressarises over the world, dispelling the dark clouds of sectarian strife._It is the brotherhood of religions._"Chairman John Henry Barrows, in his address, said: "We are here not asBaptists and Buddhists, Catholics and Confucians, Parsees andPresbyterians, Methodists and Moslems; we are here as members of aParliament of Religions, over which flies no sectarian flag, ... butwhere for the first time in large council is lifted up the banner oflove, fellowship, brotherhood.... Welcome, one and all, thrice welcometo the world's first Parliament of Religions! Welcome to the men andwomen of Israel, the standing miracle of nations and religions! Welcometo the disciples of Prince Siddartha, the many millions who worshiptheir lord Buddha as the light of Asia! Welcome to the high-priests ofthe national religion of Japan! This city has every reason to begrateful to the enlightened ruler of 'the sunrise kingdom.' Welcome tothe men of India, and all faiths! Welcome to all the disciples ofChrist! ... It seems to me that the spirits of just and good men hoverover this assembly. I believe the spirit of Paul is here. I believe thespirit of the wise and humane Buddha is here, and of Socrates thesearcher after truth.... When a few days ago I met for the first timethe delegates who have come to us from Japan, and shortly after thedelegates who have come to us from India, I felt that the arms of humanbrotherhood had reached almost around the globe." World's Parliament ofReligions, Chap. III. Similar congresses have since been held. While Inever expect to see all these principles of evil under one organizedform, yet it is evident that the spirits of devils that have gone forthinto "all the world" are uniting them all under one _spirit_--that ofAntichrist.Another form in which the old dragon is manifesting himself and unitingthousands of people against the truth, and one in which the "miracles"ascribed to this latest confederation of Satan are performed, is that of"Christian Science." Attracted by its healing doctrine, multitudes arelured into this deceptive communion of Mrs. Eddy's. At the very best hersystem is, as every historian knows, only a slight revision of theOriental Philosophy; and notwithstanding its forged name _Christian_, itis truly subversive of the doctrine of Christ. Her grand centraldoctrine of the "allness" of mind and the unreality of matter is a truecopy of the "fantastic idealism" of the Gnostics. Gnosticism was basedon "speculative knowledge." So is Mrs. Eddy's theory. Gnosticism deniedthe "_true humanity_ of the Redeemer, and made his person a merephantom, and his work a mere illusion." So does Christian Science.Although Mrs. Eddy clamours loudly that her work is _Christian_ and hermultitude of followers believe her claim, still a careful study of herwork Science and Health will convince any unprejudiced person that sheutterly repudiates the atonement-work of Jesus Christ by denying hisperson and the reality of sin and matter. Though the system may containsome good moral principles, yet it has no power to save men from sin,since it denies the existence of actual sin. Her denial of the onepersonal God--"all is infinite mind, and its infinite manifestations,"--is but a swing of the pendulum from the godless and graceless system ofthe materialistic philosophy propounded by Darwin and Haeckel and is asabsurd and unscriptural (although opposite) as the rankest Pantheism.The salvation of the soul through faith in Jesus Christ has absolutelyno place in the Christian Science creed. It is nothing but a species ofuniversalism. Individuals of every evil class and character--self-lovers, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient toparents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers,false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,profane, murderers of fathers and mothers, man-slayers, whoremongers,liars, drunkards, sorcerers, perjured persons, backbiters, haters ofGod, despiteful, inventors of evil things, implacable, unmerciful,abominable, and those unto every good work reprobate--any and all ofthese characters can and do come to the healers of Christian Science,and _not one word is said to them about getting salvation_ throughrepentance and living faith in the Savior; but, on the other hand, theyare received as follows: "As _children of God_ you have a right to thehealing of your bodies"! The dragon is in it! I warn people to beware."They are the spirits of devils, working miracles," and form animportant proof that we are near the end of time.Another form in which the dragon is manifesting his power on thedeceptive and miracle-working line is modern Spiritualism. Multitudes ofpeople of all classes are believers in this soul-destroying doctrine.The system is generally acknowledged to be but a modern form of what wasanciently styled witchcraft, necromancy, magic, etc., while the mediumsof to-day are of the same class as those formerly known as "witches,""sorcerers," "magicians." This they themselves often admit. The systemis so well known both in doctrine and in its pernicious effects that Iwill not devote further space to the matter.[15] In many other forms thedragon is working his deceptions upon the people.[Footnote 15: For further consideration of this subject read the book"Modern Spiritualism Exposed," by the publishers of this work.]Millions of church-members and thousands of preachers are numbered amongthese antichristian organizations of Freemasonry, Christian Science,Spiritualism, etc., etc., gathered together under the influence of thespirits of devils working miracles, mighty signs, and wonders. On theother hand, the churches are filled with persons who in spirit arenothing but skeptics and infidels. Said T. De Witt Talmage on oneoccasion, "There is a mighty host in the Christian church, positivelyprofessing Christianity, who _do not believe the Bible_, out and out, inand in, from the first word of the first verse of the first chapter ofthe Book of Genesis, down to the last word of the last verse of the lastchapter of the Book of Revelation." Is it any wonder that such is thecase when a large number of the preachers themselves are in realityskeptics? A newspaper clipping before me contains the following, utteredon March 28, 1905, by the Rev. B.A. Green, pastor of the First BaptistChurch, of Evanstown, Ill., before about a hundred of his fellowministers: "All the truth in the world is not contained in one book, norin books of theology, God was too big for one temple and he is also toobig for one book. God is everywhere. His truth is found in all goodbooks. The pastor of to-day should read the modern psychology and modernliterature, _especially the works of fiction_ which deal with religiousor social phases of modern life." A large portion of the sectarianministry reject entirely the Mosaic account of the creation, and acceptinstead the modern theory of evolution.The following quotation is from the Rev. Minton J. Savage, pastor of theChurch of the Messiah, New York, N.Y., who is an acknowledged leader inthe "higher criticism." This was in answer to an attack made on thehigher critics by a convention of the American Bible League. "The menwho are leading in the higher criticism of the Bible and who are nowbeing assailed so bitterly by the American Bible League, arerepresentative scholars of the world, scientific thinkers, leaders,teachers, who have given us a new universe, a new conception of God, anew idea concerning the origin and nature of man. They are not seekingto support or to undermine anything. They are seeking for the truth asthe only sacred thing on earth."I would like to consider what this book is about over which all thiscontroversy is raging. It is really not one book, but sixty-six smallvolumes. They were written during a period of nearly a thousand years,in different countries, by different people. The first book was writtenabout eight hundred years before Christ. The first five books of theBible were written between five and six hundred years before Christ. Thehistorical books tell us about the day of Judges, then of Kings, thewars of Israel, until the time of captivity. Then the book of Job,purely anonymous, and no one knows who wrote it. Then the book of thePsalms, the hymn-book of the people of Israel, and the books of theprophets. It would be more proper to call them preachers, for they makeno effort to foretell anything, but merely told the people that if theyfollowed certain lines of conduct certain things would happen."No book was placed in the Bible by anything that claimed to be divineauthority. No law concerning the Biblical canon was ever issued by thechurch earlier than the sixteenth century and that changed nothing; itsimply recognized what had come to be a fact. These books driftedtogether and came to be bound as one, by force of gravity, by commonconsent, and there are one or two books in the New Testament whichscholars could miss without feeling any the poorer."Nobody, then, is assaulting the Bible, for the simple reason that theBible as such has never made any claim. The Bible does not claim to beinspired; it does not claim to be infallible. No writer of one book isauthorized to speak for the author of any other book. One verse issometimes referred to as meaning something. The writer of the last bookin the Bible utters a curse against anybody who should presume to add toor take from the words of that book. He does not say that the book isinfallible; he simple curses anybody that interferes with it, asShakespeare uttered a curse against anybody who interfered with hisbones. I suppose that God might have given us an infallible book, if hehad chosen, and if he had given us such a book he would have made ussure that it was infallible.""If I were compelled to believe that God holds me responsible for Adam'ssin and that the immense majority of the world is doomed to everlastingtorment, and that only a selected few here and there are to entereternal felicity, I might bow my head and accept it, but I could notrejoice in it. It is barbarous. Men who try to make us accept suchdogmas are the real infidels of the world, and it is infidelity whichthey are creating--infidelity a hundred times worse than that which theycall by the name. If you would blot out every Bible in the world to-dayyou would not even endanger its life, nor would you destroy religion."From _The Toledo News-Bee_, May 14, 1904.All these allied powers of wickedness in conflict with the few of God'ssaints who serve him acceptably, constitute the battle ofArmageddon--that battle of the last great day. It is not a literalcollecting of armies nor a literal conflict, but a fierce battle betweentruth and error. The outward indications are that the enemies of Godwill triumph; but let us remember that it is destined to "end in thevictory of Him unto whom triumph belongs." Fire will come down from Godout of heaven and devour them. This symbol is doubtless taken from thecircumstance of Elijah where he commanded fire to come down and destroyhis enemies; and it will be as with such an overthrow that the powers ofwickedness shall meet their doom in that last great day of God Almighty.    11. And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from    whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was    found no place for them.    12. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and    the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the    book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which    were written in the books, according to their works.    13. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and    hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were    judged every man according to their works.    14. And death and hell were cast, into the lake of fire. This is    the second death.    15. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was    cast into the lake of fire.This series of events, as far as it pertains to the doom of evil men,ends properly with verse 10, where the combined powers of wickedness arerepresented as being cast into the lake of fire. This last event,however, is in the present scene more fully described. It is fittingthat the judgment scene should be more fully described; for with thischapter we have the last special history of the powers of evil given.Many times we have been led up to the time of the final overthrow of allthe powers of wickedness, but the manner in which that great eventoccurs has not been perfectly detailed.Here we have another illustration of that principle of symbolic languagelaid down in the beginning--that objects and events whose nature forbidstheir symbolization appear under their own names or titles and theirdescription must of necessity be literal. The appearance of the greatGod must be considered an actual event; for, as clearly shown, he cannot be symbolized, neither can he appear as the symbol of some otherobject, from the fact that there is no other object of analagous natureof which he could stand as the representative. The resurrection ofitself is an event of such a peculiar nature as to forbid itssymbolization. What is there analagous to it which could here beemployed? There are, perhaps, analagous changes in the vegetable andanimal kingdoms; but symbols drawn from that quarter would indicate somepolitical change instead. Paul may, indeed, speak of the decay and thegrowth of seeds to _illustrate_ the resurrection; but the decay of aseed does not _symbolize_ the death of a saint, neither does itsgermination _symbolize_ his resurrection. Nor is there any change thatcan do it. There is the same necessity of speaking of the resurrectionin its literal meaning as there was of representing the spirits of themartyrs under their own appropriate titles.The earth and the heaven fleeing away from before God's presence so thatno place is found for them, must be understood as describing the literaldissolution of this world when Christ comes; for it is clear from theScriptures that such an event will occur at that time. Peter says that"the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which_the heavens shall pass away_ with a great noise, and the elements shallmelt with fervent heat, _the earth also_ and the works that are therein_shall be burned up_." 2 Pet. 3:10. Nothing can be found to symbolizeperfectly such a mighty event; hence it appears as a literal descriptionof the final catastrophe of this old world.It is evident that there are symbols connected with this appearance ofGod, as truly as there were symbols connected with Christ in hisappearance in chap. 19. The _throne_ is a symbol of judgment and ofsupreme sovereignty, its dazzling whiteness indicating the impartialityand justice of the proceedings. The _books_, likewise, are symbols. Weare not to suppose that there are literal books in heaven, in whichChrist or some angelic secretary notes down all the affairs of earth.The language and the symbols of Scripture are accommodated to the humanunderstanding, hence books are used as a symbol to denote that thecharacter and the actions of men are all as perfectly known andremembered as if they had been recorded in the archives of heaven. The_book of life_, in which the names of the faithful are often said to beinscribed, denotes that God knows all his chosen people. In thefollowing chapter it is called the Lamb's book of life.This scene, then, as a whole, is a sublime description of theresurrection and the final judgment of all men and the dissolution ofthe earth on which we now live. That the righteous will be judged atthis time is shown by the fact that the book of life, in which the namesof the righteous only are recorded (Chap. 21:27; Exod. 32:33), will alsobe opened; and verse fifteen implies that the names of some during thisjudgment scene were found recorded in that book. The wicked receivetheir eternal portion by being cast into the lake of fire; while thereward of the righteous is described in the remaining part of thisseries, contained in the two following chapters.CHAPTER XXI.    And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and    the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.    2. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from    God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.    3. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the    tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and    they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them,    and be their God.    4. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there    shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither    shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed    away.The events of this chapter are a continuation of the series of prophecyconsidered in the preceding one, only describing an entirely differentphase--the final reward and eternal home of God's people. We have tracedmany series of prophecies through the long weary pathway of centuries,only to find the termination of the powers of wickedness in the lake offire at the end of time or their overthrow otherwise set forth underappropriate symbols; but in no instance has the final reward of God'speople after the judgment been fully described. That glorious event ofthe future was referred to in chap. 7 as the final in-gathering of theredeemed "of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues." Thedescription however, was incomplete. Since the eternal abode of thewicked is referred to often, the subject would seem incomplete without adescription of the final glories and triumphs of the redeemed in theirfuture and eternal home. Though their earthly pilgrimage is fraught withsorrow, death, pain, wretchedness, and misery, by the hands of theirviolent oppressors, yet they shall witness the complete overthrow of alltheir enemies in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, and theythemselves shall be rewarded eternally; for "God shall wipe away alltears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow,neither crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the formerthings are passed away." It is fitting that such a sublime theme shouldbe reserved as the grand climax of the book of Revelation.With the dissolution of the earth on which we live, which event has justbeen described, it is evident that the many lines of prophecy leading upto that great event are no longer under special consideration, but thata new theme subsequent to the judgment scene is introduced with thewords of the Revelator immediately following--"I saw _a new heaven and anew earth:_ for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away;and there was no more sea." The heaven, earth, and sea that passed awaycertainly refers to the earth that now is and to the aerial heavensurrounding it; therefore the new heaven and the new earth brought toview must signify the future and eternal home that Jesus went toprepare. We could not consistently make the one literal and the othersymbolical. This accords perfectly with the teaching of the apostlePeter where he says: "The day of the Lord will come as a thief in thenight; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, andthe elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the worksthat are therein shall be burned up.... Nevertheless we, according tohis promise, look for _new heavens and a new earth_, wherein dwellethrighteousness." 2 Pet. 3:10-13.The holy city of God, the New Jerusalem, is next introduced. Since thismeets its fulfilment in the new order of things subsequent to thejudgment scene, it must have special reference to the future abode ofthe saints in the new earth. Many of the symbols here describing the NewJerusalem, and even New Jerusalem itself, are often used to set forththe church of God in the New Testament dispensation. The church on earthand the church of God in heaven are in one important sense the samething, as they constitute but one family (Eph. 3:15); yet in anothersense there is a difference, and the proper distinction must be observedeven when the same symbols or titles are used to describe or designateboth phases. A similar two-foldness is seen in many lines of truth. InHeb. 12:22, 23, we are represented as dwelling in the city of God inthis dispensation; yet verse 27 of this chapter and the fourteenth ofthe following chapter plainly show our entrance into the city at theend. The Scriptures represent God as dwelling on earth in his church,which, of course, is considered in a spiritual sense; but his actualthrone and place of abode is in heaven. A new creation brought about byChrist in his first advent is set forth by various texts; still, itremains a fact that a new creation will actually be brought to viewafter the present world is no more and that the same will be our eternalhome. We obtain spiritual life through Christ now, hence have right tothe tree of life; yet in another sense our access to the tree of life isat the end and we then enter in through the gates into the city. Chap.22:14. Hence it is proper to speak of the city of God as both presentand future, by observing the proper distinction, just as the Scripturesspeak of the church in a twofold sense as being both on earth and inheaven, or of the spiritual kingdom in the present and the eternalkingdom in the end. It is Scriptural to speak of God's throne as beingon earth in the midst of his saints in a spiritual sense and also of itsbeing located in heaven. The tree of life is a present realizationspiritually and also a future reality. We dwell in the city of Godnow--in the suburbs, as it were--but we shall "have a right" to it inthe future state when we are ushered into the very heart of the greatmetropolis and stand before the actual throne of the Deity, in thepresence of his August Majesty.In the New Testament dispensation the heavenly elements of the NewJerusalem have descended to earth in the form of the new covenant, andGod's people obtain a foretaste of heaven's glory and are made pure evenas Christ is pure, and are therefore represented as having "come untoMount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem"(Heb. 12:22, 23); and God dwells with them in a very important sense. 2Cor. 6:16. They are one with the redeemed above, and together theyconstitute one "family in heaven and earth," all loving the same Father,adoring the same King, drinking from the same fountain of life eternal,and all basking in the same divine light that beams from the throne ofGod. In another sense, however, there is a difference between them; forthey are separated by the line of mortality, one phase being located onearth and the other in heaven. But when at the last day the redeemed ofearth have access to the tree of life in its perfect sense, there willbe henceforth only one phase to the New Jerusalem, or church of God,which will be in its relation to the new earth, as specially describedin the prophecy under consideration, when "_all things_" are made newand "the former things are passed away."    5. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all    things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true    and faithful.    6. And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the    beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of    the fountain of the water of life freely.    7. He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be    his God, and he shall be my son.    8. But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and    murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and    all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with    fire and brimstone: which is the second death.The declarations contained in these verses proceed from God himself andannounce the fact that he hath now fulfilled all that he designed. Hispromises to his faithful children are brought to pass, as well as histhreatening to his foes. All things are made new and the former thingsare passed away. Not only has the strife, the commotion, and the sin inthe old order of things passed away, but the new creation, whereindwelleth righteousness, has been introduced, the grand long-looked-forera of eternal blessedness to the saints. Oh, halleluiah! "And he saidunto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.""And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginningand the end." When the seventh angel of chap. 16:17 poured out his vial,the voice of God from the throne said, "It is done," signifying that thelast judgments were complete. Here again the same voice is heard asbefore, referring to the same thing--the accomplishment of God's greatpurposes. The enemies of the church have been overthrown, her longperiod of warfare has ended, and the eternal day of Zion's glory hascome. Then follow his blessed promises held out to the faithful, andalso the reward to the wicked. These are to be understood as referringto these classes, not at the day of judgment, but when the Revelationwas given to John and therefore to us. "I will give unto him that isathirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcomethshall inherit all things [in the margin, _these things_]: and I will behis God, and he shall be my son." "This is the reward in reserve forthose who endure through this period of trial and overcome at last. Theyshall drink of living waters, which will be sweet and refreshing indeedto those who have toiled through this fight; and they shall inheritthese things--these new heavens and earth. God shall be their God, andthey his sons. Oh, what an honor! what a destiny in reserve for thefaithful! with what glorious anticipations may the believer look forwardto the revelations of that day, and with Paul say, 'If by any means Imay attain unto the resurrection of the dead.'"What warning also to the wicked! The same voice that utters thepromise, pronounces also the threatening. 'The fearful, and unbelieving,and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, andidolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake whichburneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.' God says,'These words are true and faithful.' They came from him who sat upon thethrone, the Alpha and Omega. He has put his everlasting seal to them,and pledged his veracity to their truth." Dear reader, will you acceptthe word of Him who can not lie and choose to suffer affliction with thepeople of God until our Lord shall come to call his ransomed home? Orwill you decide to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, only to beresurrected at the last great day to "shame and everlasting contempt"?There is no intimation of future salvation for the transgressor. Thelake of fire still stands as the symbol of eternal destruction, and intoit the fearful and unbelieving and wicked of every name are cast.    9. And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the    seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me,    saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's    wife.    10. And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high    mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,    descending out of heaven from God,    11. Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone    most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;    12. And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at    the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are    the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:    13. On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the    south three gates; and on the west three gates.    14. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them    the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.    15. And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the    city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.    16. And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as    the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve    thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of    it are equal.    17. And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and    four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the    angel.    18. And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the    city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.    19. And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished    with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was    jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the    fourth, an emerald;    20. The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,    chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a    chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.    21. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate    was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as    it were transparent glass.    22. And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and    the Lamb are the temple of it.    23. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to    shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb    is the light thereof.    24. And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the    light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and    honor into it.    25. And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for    there shall be no night there.    26. And they shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into    it.    27. And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that    defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a    lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.We have here a magnificent description of the New Jerusalem,representing the home of the redeemed. The various symbols employed inits description must of course he understood as symbolical. We have nomeans of knowing just what our future home will be like; but that itwill be a place of wondrous beauty and transcendent glory is shown bythe fact that everything which is considered grand and glorious in thisworld is here chosen to represent the home of the redeemed. The symbolsselected to describe it are objects of such priceless worth, evenexceeding royal splendor, that we pause in astonishment and exclaim,"What must the reality be?" The conditions upon which entrance to thiscity may be obtained (ver. 27; chap. 22:14) show clearly that our futureand eternal home is the chief burden of this vision and not merely ourspiritual inheritance in this world."In approaching Jerusalem, the traveller is not aware of its proximity,until, ascending an eminence, the glorious city bursts upon hisastonished vision, when he is ready to exclaim with thePsalmist--'Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth is MountZion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great king.'" Psa.48:2. John was carried to "a great and high mountain," from whichcommanding point of view he was enabled to survey in all its boundlessextent the surpassing glories of the New Jerusalem. Never didimagination conceive anything approaching the sublimity and grandeur ofthe scene here described by the pen of inspiration. It was "a greatcity"--how great we shall soon discover--the _holy_ Jerusalem,descending out of heaven from God.The ancient city of Jerusalem was regarded as sacred because in it Godhad recorded his name, and it contained his holy temple, his place ofresidence on earth. Thither the tribes of Israel went up to worship;"Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship." So, also, this NewJerusalem was "_the holy city_," an antitype of the former. It isdescribed as "having the glory of God, and her light was like unto astone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal." "Theglory of God" was that visible manifestation, called the Shekinah, whichJehovah made of himself in the tabernacle of his ancient people. Thefollowing facts concerning it will give us an understanding of itssignification as connected with the New Jerusalem:"Jehovah was the accepted King and Lawgiver of his people Israel, and hehad his tabernacle among them, where he abode by his presence, where hemight be approached and consulted, and make communications of his will.That visible presence was 'the glory of God' or the Shekinah; and theJews regarded it with the highest possible veneration, as the embodimentof the Deity. The sacred writers often speak of it in the same terms asof Jehovah himself. They refer to this when they speak of _seeing God_.'Then went up Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of theelders of Israel, _and they saw the God of Israel_.' Ex. 24:9, 10. 'Isaw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and histrain filled the temple.' Isa. 6:1. And again in verse 5: 'For mine eyes_have seen_ the King, the Lord of hosts.' The spiritual essence of Godcan not, of course, be revealed to mortal vision, yet there was amanifestation of the Deity which was made visible to the eyes of men,and which Moses and Isaiah speak of as _seeing God_. It is spoken of asthe _presence_ and _face_ of Jehovah. 'And he said, _My presence_ shallgo with thee, and I will give thee rest.' Ex. 33:14. 'And the Lord spakeunto Moses _face to face_, as a man speaketh unto his friend.' Ex.33:11."The New Jerusalem that John saw descending from God--which denotes itsheavenly origin--had "the glory of God: and her light was like unto astone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal." Itdazzled as the purest diamond. In verse 23 we are informed that itilluminated the whole city so that there was "no need of the sun,neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the _glory of God did lightenit, and the Lamb is the light thereof_." In ancient times "the glory ofGod" filled the _tabernacle_, the place of his abode; but here it filled_the whole city_. In that tabernacle the Shekinah was the manifestationof the divine glory of Jehovah. In the New Jerusalem Jesus Christ, whois "the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person,"illuminates the entire city of God. Oh, halleluiah!In olden times the cities were surrounded with walls, designed as adefense against all enemies. The more important the city, the higher andstronger were the walls built. Having walls, it was necessary also tohave gates to furnish ingress and egress to the inhabitants. These gateswere in charge of faithful guardians, who had authority to open and toclose them according to the regulations of the city. In accordance withthis idea the city of God is represented as having "a wall great andhigh." This wall represents the security of Zion, whose inhabitantswithin can rest in peace and safety. The three gates on each siderepresent the free and easy access into the city from every quarter.Anciently, it was customary to give names to the gates of a city, justas we now do to our streets. The gates of this holy city were namedafter the twelve tribes of the children of Israel, which embraced allGod's ancient covenant people, and which denotes the perfection andcompleteness of our heavenly home as including all the spiritual Israel."And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the namesof the twelve apostles of the Lamb." The twelve foundations, or ratherthe twelve courses of stone in the foundation, are more fully describedhereafter. The names of the twelve tribes were on the gates to denotethat the city was composed of God's true and complete Israel, and thenames of the twelve apostles are on the foundation to denote that thiscontains the church which was "built upon the foundation of the apostlesand prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone." Eph.2:20. The system of truth that they preached to the world forms thedoctrinal basis of the church of God, they having received it fromheaven "by inspiration of God," and their names all appear; and togetherthey constitute one harmonious, solid foundation upon which the churchshall stand forever.The dimensions of the city as measured by the angel are next given astwelve thousand furlongs, or one thousand five hundred miles. By thestatement that the length, the breadth and the height are equal, somehave supposed that the city was one thousand five hundred miles high. Toquote the words of a certain commentator: "The language, however, willbear another meaning, which is far more natural. It is not that thelength and breadth and height were severally equal to _each other_, but_equal with themselves_; that is the length was everywhere the same, thebreadth everywhere the same, and the height the same. It was perfect andsymmetrical in all its proportions. This is confirmed by the factdistinctly stated, that the wall was one hundred and forty and fourcubits high, or two hundred and sixteen feet, a proper height for awall; while it is said only that 'the length is as large as thebreadth.'" This writer reckoned but eighteen inches for a cubit, whereassome figure twenty-two. A city one thousand and five hundred miles highwith a wall only two hundred and sixteen or two hundred and sixty fourfeet high, would be altogether out of proportion.The wondrous dimensions of this city set forth the fact that our futurehome far exceeds in grandeur and extent everything that is looked uponas glorious upon earth. Who ever heard of a city one thousand and fivehundred miles square? We have had empires so large, but no such cities.In this representation the city does not encompass the entire earth asshe in one sense really does, because it would be impossible thus torepresent her and at the same time she be represented as a city withinthe earth, into which the nations bring their "glory and honor." Theancient city of Babylon with its beautiful hanging-gardens, the verytriumph of human skill, and the city itself lying in a foursquare, beingfifteen miles on each side, was unsurpassed in human loveliness. But thecity of God is represented as _fifteen hundred_ miles square, whichdimensions are out of all proportion with anything existing on earth;hence its beauty and magnificence must be ascribed to God only."And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was puregold like unto clear glass." The jasper is the same crystal gem beforementioned. What a wondrous wall it must have been! It was not made ofsuch common material as granite, freestone, or marble, which can makethe most imposing structures that human pride can rear, and which arefit for the residence of lofty kings; but it was of jasper, clear ascrystal. Think of the wall of this holy city being nearly three hundredfeet high and stretching around the city six thousand miles, all builtof the purest diamond! No stretch of the human imagination can properlycompass such a vision. In rearing earthly structures men seek suchmaterial as combine durability, cheapness, beauty, and ease of beingwrought. Look at this wall! For _durability_, it has the mostindestructible material that can be found on earth. For _beauty_, thelanguage of man can not even convey a meagre description of its amazingloveliness. For _cheapness_--God's riches were inexhaustible, hence itwas not necessary to take this into consideration. For _ease of beingwrought_--think of the vast amount of labor it requires to cut and shapeeven one large diamond, it being said to require in some cases years ofincessant toil; yet God could afford to build the wall of this city ofsuch material. Oh, wonders of God's handiwork! How inexpressiblyglorious! This, my dear reader, symbolizes the priceless worth of oureternal home, secured through the atonement. Study the plan ofredemption. There is nothing equal to it in the universe. "What is a manprofited, if he gain the whole world, and _lose his own soul_?"Men become greatly agitated over the announcement of the discovery ofgold in the Klondyke, in the Australian continent, in California, andwith feverish excitement they abandon their homes and rush headlong tothe reputed El Dorado, fearing neither famine, storms, deserts, nor theicy northern blasts. But all the gold ever mined from the bowels of theearth is insignificant and forms no comparison with the representationof this city. Its streets and mansions were built, not of common cement,lumber, nor even granite and marble, but _of pure gold_.The twelve courses of stone in the foundation of the wall have alreadybeen mentioned. It is here particularly described. One might supposethat, according to human custom, rougher material would be selected forthe foundation. Not so, however. The most brilliant and costly gems werechosen to lay these courses. Nothing cheap nor common had anything to doin the construction of this marvelous city. It was altogether beyond thereach of men to imitate: it was God's own handiwork; and we can not butadmire its wondrous beauty. It is unnecessary to give a minutedescription of the gems of which these foundation-courses were composed.They were the most beautiful and costly of which men possess anyknowledge. In appearance they represent various colors of the mostdelicate shades. Royal persons wear even the smallest of these gems upontheir persons and imagine themselves richly adorned; but in this city ofGod they appear in such abundance that they are even selected to formthe basis, or foundation, of the wall. "And the twelve gates were twelvepearls; every several gate was of one pearl." We have rich necklaces ofpearl; but where is the individual that was ever blessed with such aprofusion of wealth that he could ornament the gates of a city withpearls? The gates of the New Jerusalem, however, were not merelyornamented or studded with pearls--that were a very small thing forher--but each gate was of one solid pearl. To conceive the immensity ofthis representation we must consider the size of the gates required toaccommodate the multitudes constantly entering and departing from acity. To be in proportion to the wall they would have to be of immensesize, and also of prodigious strength in order to resist the assaults ofenemies, as they would be the first places attacked. The gate of thetemple called Beautiful, mentioned in the Book of Acts, which was in thewall surrounding the temple, is said to have been seventy-five feet highand sixty in width, built of Corinthian brass. Yet immense as they were,those in the New Jerusalem were each of one solid pearl. Oh, beautifulcity of God, the home of the saints!The most prominent object within the walls of the ancient Jerusalem wasthe magnificent temple on Mount Zion. It was the chief ornament andglory of the city. In the New Jerusalem, however, no temple is seen.Alas! is not this a great defect? What is Jerusalem without a templewhere the tribes may go up and worship before the Lord? Oh, they need notemple in this glorious city of God; for there is one there greater thanthe temple: "the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it."This doubtless sets forth the fact that the worship of God is pure andspiritual and of free access to all. Under the old dispensation the highpriest alone, and he but once a year, was permitted to enter the sacredprecincts of the Deity as limited to the inner sanctuary of the temple.Now God's people need no mediating priest to offer up a specialsacrifice that the will of God might be known; but all are kings andpriests who offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by JesusChrist (1 Pet. 2:5); yea, as saith the prophet, "they _shall all knowme_ from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord."Jer. 31:34. No temple is needed that the Shekinah of the divine presencemay take up its abode between the cherubim in the most holy place, but"the glory of the Lord" fills the entire city. It can not be confined toa given locality. "The Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple ofit," and they constitute the glory of the New Jerusalem as did thetemple on Mount Zion that of the old."The nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it." Canany one conceive the grandeur and the sublimity of the scene when alight that eclipses the sun and the moon is reflected from streets andmansions of gold, or comes streaming through a wall composed of the mostbrilliant gems of different hues, with gates of solid pearl? No wonder,then, that the poet has denominated it "the beautiful light of God"! Thegates are open continuously, for they are not closed by day, and "thereshall be no night there." But "there shall in no wise enter into itanything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, ormaketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of Life."This, my dear reader, is the reward of the New Testament church, "thechurch of God."CHAPTER XXII.    And he showed me a pure river of water of life, dear as crystal,    proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.    2. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the    river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of    fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the    tree were for the healing of the nations.    3. And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and    of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:    4. And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their    foreheads.    5. And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle,    neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light:    and they shall reign for ever and ever.The description of the New Jerusalem continues in the first five versesof this chapter. By the "river of the water of life" is doubtless meantfull salvation, which as a mighty flowing stream issues "out of thethrone of God and of the Lamb." To this fountain of living waters aninvitation is now given to all to come and partake to theirsatisfaction. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him thatheareth say, Come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of lifefreely." Verse 17. As a defense to God's people in this world salvationis represented as a great wall surrounding them (Isa. 26:12); but as asource of joy, holiness and happiness, it is a living stream whereof allmay partake. While this symbol meets an appropriate fulfilment in thepresent dispensation, yet salvation will also be the eternal possessionof the saints in the world to come, when "they shall hunger no more,neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor anyheat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst thereof, shall feed them, andshall _lead them unto living fountains of waters_; and God shall wipeaway all tears from their eyes." Chap. 7:16, 17.In a most appropriate place, upon the banks of the river, grew "the treeof life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit everymonth: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."The tree of life in the garden of Eden was a symbol of man's immortalityor incorruption, or rather the _means_ of it; for after his fall it wassecurely guarded and he driven from the garden, "lest he put forth hishand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever"(Gen. 3:22) and thus frustrate the decree of God just uttered--that heshould return unto dust and corruption. In the New Jerusalem, however,that tree of life blooms again and bears fruit abundantly, yeacontinuously, as symbolized by "every month," and no cherubim withflaming sword are placed to guard all approach to it. The privilege isopen; for it is added immediately, "There _shall be no more curse_."This, then, symbolizes the removal of spiritual death and theimpartation of everlasting life in this world and immortality in thenext. The tree of life grew on both sides of the river. On this side ofthe line of mortality we have access to it in one important sense, whilethose in the future world are preserved also by its healing benefits.The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit abide in this city. God revealshimself, not to a few chosen priests only through the Shekinah of hispresence, but to all his servants--"they all see his face." As in theancient tabernacle he manifested himself by "the glory of the Lord," orthe Shekinah, which was represented as "seeing his face"; so, also, the"glory of the Lord" abides in the New Jerusalem, filling the entire citywith the holy manifestation of the divine presence. His people are"sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise," by which they possess thename of their Father--not the name of the beast nor of his image, but_the name of the Father_."And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neitherlight of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shallreign forever and ever." This city has no need of natural or artificiallight, "for the Lamb is the light thereof." Chap. 21:23. The light ofthe sun stands connected with the light of a candle and both arerepresented as unnecessary, which denotes that "there shall be no nightthere," but one clear eternal day.    6. And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and    the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show unto    his servants the things which must shortly be done.    7. Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the    sayings of the prophecy of this book.The language of symbols is discontinued. With the description of the NewJerusalem closes the grand panoramic scene of this book. Wondrous indeedhave been the events of earth prophetically outlined, but we have theassurance that "these things are faithful and true." A continuouspolitical and ecclesiastical history of that portion of the earth madethe subject of Apocalyptic vision, from the dawn of Christianity untilthe last day, was here written down in advance. After the permanentdivision of the empire, which occurred under Valens and Valentinian[16]in A.D. 364, it was necessary that the political and the ecclesiasticalhistory of the empire should be divided in the prophecy. Thisinspiration has done. The downfall of the Western empire is clearlypredicted in the symbols under the first four trumpets; but the eclipseis afterwards lifted, and the same Western empire again appears inImperial form under the control of the Papacy. After giving their powerand strength unto the beast during the Dark Ages, the horns afterwardturn against the Papacy and rob her of all her temporal authority andpower, thus pointing us clearly to the history of modern Europe, inwhich the prophecy has been actually fulfilled. They themselves end atthe judgment of the last day. Thus, the political history of the Westernempire is carried through to the end. The Eastern division of the empireis also made a subject of prophecy, and its overthrow is described underthe sixth trumpet. This was effected by the second woe, or the rise ofthe Ottoman power, and that woe is represented as continuing until afterthe death and the resurrection of the two witnesses and terminatingshortly before the end of time. Therefore the political history of theEastern empire, which has been under the power of the Turks forcenturies, is outlined until the end. The ecclesiastical history of theEastern empire is also given, its most prominent feature being the riseand the development of that pest of Mohammedanism, which rests like adark cloud over that fair country until this day. In the Westerndivision the rise of the Papacy, its continuation, the rise ofProtestantism and its duration, are all clearly outlined, reaching downto these last days. Then the scene is suddenly enlarged and is carriedbeyond the limits of the earth--the Apocalyptic earth--into "the wholeworld," when the powers of wickedness are combined in spirit toantagonize the reformation of holiness and truth which God is using togather his faithful ones together in preparation for the coming of theSon of God to judgment. In view of these wonderful events of the lastdays, how comforting the words of the text before us--"Behold, _I comequickly:_ blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of thisbook"![Footnote 16: Some historians give A.D. 395 as the date of the permanentdivision of the empire. The government of the Eastern and Westerndivisions was separate from the accession of Valens and Valentinian, in364, until during the reign of Theodosius the Great, when the West,through the jealous rivalries of different competitors for the throne,had fallen into great disorder. Theodosius twice interposed to rightmatters and finally took the government into his own hands for the spaceof four months, in 395, when he died, after arranging for the divisionof the empire between his two sons Arcadius and Honorius.]    8. And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had    heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the    angel which showed me these things.    9. Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy    fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them    which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.The mind of the apostle was so enraptured with the visions he beheldthat he could not but adore and worship; but the angel that had been thechosen instrument to reveal these prophecies refused his act of homageand instructed him to "worship God." Created intelligences are notworthy of such respect; to God alone all honor and praise belongs. JesusChrist our Redeemer is God--God over all, blessed forever. As such he isworthy of the homage supreme of all our hearts, the praises of all ourlips.    10. And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy    of this book: for the time is at hand.    11. He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is    filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let    him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy    still.    12. And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to    give every man according as his work shall be.    13. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first    and the last.    14. Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may    have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the    gates into the city.    15. For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and    murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.The popular opinion is that this book of the Revelation is sealed; butJohn received the direct command, "_Seal not_ the sayings of theprophecy of this book." The majority of the teachers of Babylon to-dayare fulfilling Isaiah 29:9-11, and that is the reason why it has becometo them a sealed book. God makes known the blessed truths of theprophecies of this book to his own beloved children, who walk before himin sincerity and truth. A blessing is pronounced upon us if we keepthem. His coming is near at hand, and his reward is with him to renderunto every man according as his work shall be. No offers of salvationwill be extended when Christ appears to give us access to the tree ofimmortal life and an abundant entrance into the eternal city beyond; butit will then be said, "He that is unjust, _let him be_ unjust still: andhe which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous,let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.""Dogs" are left without. This term as applied to a person is one ofgreat reproach. It is so among us, and much more so among the Jews, bywhom that animal was regarded as unclean. It signifies evil workers.Evil characters of every class will have no part in the heavenly realm,but will be cast into the lake of fire. It will be the perfection ofmisery to be banished forever from the presence of God and thecompanionship of all that is good and holy. "Blessed are they that dohis commandments, that they may have right to the tree of Life, and mayenter in through the gates into the city."    16. I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these    things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of    David, and the bright and morning star.    17. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that    heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And    whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.The statements of these verses have been considered heretofore, hencethere is no necessity of further comment on them in this connection.    18. For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the    prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things,    God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this    book:    19. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of    this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of    life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are    written in this book.Here is the most solemn warning against any one who should presume tocorrupt the prophecies of the Revelation by adding to or taking awayfrom them. Nor was such a warning needless. This book contains the longhistory of God's church, and also the history of all her persecutors,painted in colors of deepest infamy, and the final doom that awaitsthem. These enemies were to ride in triumph over the earth during a longcareer of centuries, when the children of God should be trodden downbeneath their feet, as it were, while they boasted themselves as beingthe true church, the anointed of heaven. These Revelations were to behanded down to succeeding generations through these very persecutors.The great whore of Babylon had her likeness taken and then committed toher for preservation. Would she not falsify them? Nearly all the earlyrecords of the church have been corrupted by the church of Rome. Forages it has been a doctrine of that institution that pious fraud wasconsistent and even commendable when practised to further the influenceof that church. Yea, she has proclaimed openly and unblushingly that ifher cause could be promoted by deception and lies they were perfectlyjustifiable; and her practise has been consistent with her teachings. Inview of the fact that God's Word was to pass through the depths of this"mystery of iniquity," it is not surprising that we find annexed to thisconcluding portion of Holy Writ the awful anathema: "If any man shalladd unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that arewritten in this book: and if any man shall take away from the words ofthe book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the bookof life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are writtenin this book."    20. He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come    quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.    21. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.What importance is attached to the second coming of Christ! Over andover again it is stated distinctly. It is the grand climax unto whichall the series of events in this book leads.  "Are you ready, waiting for the Lord?    See, the signs proclaim him near;  In the awful thunders of his Word,    Now his coming steps we hear.  "Now are many running to and fro,    Spreading holiness around;  And the evening light begins to glow,    Soon we'll hear the trumpet's sound.  "Hark! the solemn warning unto all,    Judgment's coming, oh, how soon!  Flee, O man, at Mercy's final call,    Heaven trembles at your doom.  "Christ is coming, oh, the heavenly sight!    Our Beloved can't delay,  For his bride is robed in snowy white,    Ready for the marriage-day."Amen. "Even so come, Lord Jesus." Then will appear the great "Alpha andOmega, the beginning and the ending." In the beginning he "created theheaven and the earth." In the end, John said, "I saw a new heaven and anew earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away;and there was no more sea." In the beginning Satan entered the domain ofGod's people to deceive and destroy. In the end he is cast out, and willdeceive the nations no more. In the beginning sickness, pain, sorrow,and wretchedness found entrance to the world. In the end "God shall wipeaway all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more sorrow, norcrying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things arepassed away." In the beginning the people of earth were placed under theiron hand of death, who has claimed his teeming millions. In the end, "Isaw the dead, small and great, stand before God.... And the sea gave upthe dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the deadwhich were in them ... and death and hell were cast into the lake offire." In the beginning was a blooming garden containing the tree ofimmortal life. In the end we find the tree of life again "in the midstof the Paradise of God." In the beginning a curse was placed upon thisearth. In the world to come "there shall be no more curse: but thethrone of God and of the Lamb shall be in it." In the beginning thefirst Adam lost his universal dominion over the earth. In the end wefind Jesus Christ, the second Adam, crowned King of kings and Lord oflords, and reigning in triumph and glory forever. In the beginning manwas barred from the tree of life and driven from the garden of Eden. Inthe end, "Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may haveright to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into thecity."INDEXAAachen, 326.Abaddon, 162.Abubekr, first caliph, 155.Aegean Sea, 36, 46.Africa, conquered by Saracens, 160.Ahab, 53.Alani, 145.Alans, 146, 215.Alaric, invades Italy, 136-141, 149.Ala-Shehr, 63.Albi, council of, 339.Albigenses, 113, 161, 196, 270, 342.Aleppo, 165.Alexander I., 172.Alexander the Great, 320.Alexander VI., Pope, 346, 347.Alexandria, 109, 110.Alison, A., quoted, 307-315.Ammianus Marcellinus, quoted, 188.Amiens, 140.Ammon, 330.Anabaptists, 292.Anglo-Saxons, 215.Anthony, founder of monasticism, 189, 190.Antioch, 104, 109, 110.Antioch Epiphanes, 230.Antipas, 49.Apollo, 241.Apollyon, 162.Aquinas, Thos., 340, 341.Arabia, 330; conquered by Saracens, 160.Arras, 140.Arcadius, Roman emp., 137, 138, 440, n.Argos, 137.Armageddon, 332.Armenia, 330; conquered by Turks, 165.Arnout, Mme., quoted, 310.Asbury, Bishop, 368.Assyria, 330.Astolphus, k. of Lombards, 352, n.Athanasius, 190.Athens, 137.Attalus, 139.Atkins, Robert, quoted, 365.Attica, 137.Attila, 142, 145, 146, 149.Atys, 407.Augsburg, 191.Augsburg Confession (A.D. 1530), 191, 247, 252, 253.Augustine, 96.Augustines, Order of, 246, 251.Augustulus, Roman emp., 148.Augustus Caesar, first Roman emp., 222.Aurelian, Roman emp., 189.Aurelius, Marcus, Roman emp., 46, 98.Austerlitz, battle of, 322.Avignon, 327; removal of Papal chair to, 305, 306;  council of, 339.BBabylon, taken by Cyrus, 166, 329, 331;  great edifices of, 432.Babylonian empire, 330, 397.Bacchus, 407.Bagdad, founded (A.D. 762), 160, 165.Balaam, 49, 50.Balak, 50.Barak, 332.Barnes, Dr., quoted, 359.Baronius, quoted, 345.Barrows, John Henry, quoted, 409, 410.Basil, council of, 340.Bayazid, Sultan, 61.Bedford jail, 36Beethoven, 88.Behiston rock, noted inscription on, 18, n.Belisarius, general of Justinian, 148, 236, 351, n.Bellarmine, Cardinal, quoted, 341, 342.Benedict IX., Pope, 345, 346.Bernard, 197; quoted, 199.Beziers, council of, 339.Boetia, 137.Bohemia, 244, 339.Bologna, 327.Bonaparte, Jerome, 321.Bonaparte, Louis, 321.Bonaparte, Joseph, 321.Bonaparte, Napoleon, 172, 317, 320-325, 327.Boniface IV., Pope, 240.Bonney, Chas.

"These funny streets, with their dear old-fashioned houses, allseem, so much alike! And if there are any names stuck up at the cornersthey must hide around behind the post when I come by like squirrels in thewoods."I declare, there is a queer little shop stuck right in there between twoof those refined-looking, if poverty-stricken, boarding-houses. Dear me!how many come-down-in-the-world families have to take 'paying guests' tohelp out. Not like the Peabodys, but really needy people. What is it Bobbycalls 'em? 'P.G.s'--'paying guests.'"I was a paying guest at Bramble Farm," ruminated Betty, still staring atthe little shop and the houses that flanked it on either side. "And Icertainly had a hard time there. Bobby says that these people inGeorgetown are the remains of Southern aristocracy that were cast up onthis beach as long ago as the Civil War. Unlike the castaways on cannibalislands that we read about, Bobby says these castaways live off the'P.G.s'--and that's what Joseph Peabody tried to do! He tried to live offme. There! I knew he was a cannibal."Oh! Isn't that sweet?"Her sudden cry had no reference to the army of boarding-house keepers inthe neighborhood, nor to any signpost that pointed the way back to thelittle square where the soldiers' monument stood and where Betty was tomeet Carter, the Littells' chauffeur, and the big limousine. For she wasstill staring at the window of the little shop."What a lovely orange color! And that starburst pattern on the front! It'slovely! What a surprising thing to see in a little neighborhood store likethis. I'm going to buy it if it fits me and I've money enough left in mypurse."Impetuous as usual, Betty Gordon marched at once to the door of the littleside-street shop. The most famous of such neighborhood shops, as describedby Hawthorne, Betty knew all about. She had studied it in her Englishreadings at Shadyside only the previous term. But there was noGingerbread Man in this shop window!In the middle of the display window, which was divided into four not verylarge panes, was arranged on a cross of bright metal a knitted over-blouseof the very newest burnt orange shade. The work was exquisitely done, asBetty could see even from outside the shop, and she did hope it would fither.On pushing open the door a silvery bell--not an annoying, janglingbell--played a very lively tune to attract the attention of a girl who satat the back of the shop, her head bent close above the work on which shewas engaged. Although the bell stopped quivering when Betty closed thedoor, the girl did not look up from her work.Sharp-eyed Betty saw that the stranger was knitting, and she seemed to beengaged upon another over-blouse like that in the window, save that thesilk in her lap was of a pretty dark blue shade. Betty saw her full, redlips move placidly. The girl was counting over her work and she actuallywas so deeply immersed in the knitting that she had not heard the bell orrealized that a possible customer had entered."Ahem!" coughed Betty."And that's twenty-four, and--cross--and two--and four----" The girl wascounting aloud."Why," murmured Betty Gordon, her eyes dancing, "she's like LibbieLittell when she is somnambulating--I guess that is the right word.Anyway, when Libbie walks in her sleep she talks just like that----"_Ahem!_"This time Betty almost shouted the announcement of her presence in theshop and finally startled the other girl out of her abstraction. Thelatter looked up, winked her eyes very fast, and began to roll up her workin a clean towel. Betty noticed that her eyes were very blue and wereshaded by dark lashes."I beg your pardon," said the shopgirl. "Have you been waiting long?" Shecame forward quickly and with an air of assurance. Her look was not ahappy one, however, and Betty wondered at her sadness. "What can I showyou?" asked the shopgirl.She was not much older than Betty herself, but she was more self-possessedand seemed much more experienced than even Betty, much as the latter hadtraveled and varied as her adventures had been during the previous yearand a half. But now the stranger's questions brought Betty to a renewedcomprehension of what she had actually entered the shop for."I'm just crazy about that blouse in the window--the orange one," shecried. "I know you must have made it yourself, for you are knittinganother, I see, and that is going to be pretty, too. But I want thisorange one--if it doesn't cost too much.""The price is twelve dollars. I hope it is not too much," said theshopgirl timidly. "I sold one for all of that before I left Liverpool."Betty was as much interested now in the other girl as she was in theorange silk over-blouse."Why!" she exclaimed, "you are English, aren't you? And you and yourfamily can't long have been over here.""I have been here only two months," said the girl quietly.There was a certain dignity in her manner that impressed Betty. She hadvery dark, smoothly arranged hair and a beautiful complexion. She wasplump and strongly made, and she walked gracefully. Betty had noted thatfact when she came forward from the back of the shop."But you didn't come over from England all alone?" asked the curious youngcustomer, neglecting the blouse for her interest in the girl who spreadout its gossamer body for approval."It took only seven days from Liverpool to New York," said the other girl,looking at Betty steadily, still with that lack of animation in her face."I might have come alone; but it was better for me to travel withsomebody, owing to the emigration laws of your country. I traveled asnursemaid to a family of Americans. But I separated from them in New Yorkand came here.""Oh!" Betty exclaimed, not meaning to be impertinent. "You had friendshere in Georgetown?""I thought I had a relative in Washington. I had heard so. I failed tofind her so--so I found this shop, kept by a woman who came from mycounty, and she gave me a chance to wait shop," said the English girlwearily."Mrs. Staples lets me knit these blouses to help out, for she cannot paylarge wages. The trade isn't much, you see. This one, I am sure, will looklovely on you. I hope the price is not too much?""Not a bit, if it will fit me and I have that much money in my purse,"replied Betty, who for a girl of her age had a good deal of money to spendquite as she pleased.She opened her bag hastily and took out her purse. The purse was made ofcut steel beads and, as Betty often said, "everything stuck to it!"Something clung to it now as she drew it forth, but neither Betty nor theshopgirl saw the dangling twist of tissue paper."And I'll buy that other one you are knitting," Betty hurried to say asshe shook the purse and dug into it for the silver as well as the billsshe had left after her morning's shopping. "I know that pretty blue willjust look dear on a friend of mine."She was busy with her money, and the English girl looked on hopefully. Soneither saw the twist of tissue paper fly off the dangling fringe of beadsand land with a soft little "plump" on the floor by the counter."Dear me!" breathed the shopgirl, in reply to Betty's promise, "I shalllike that. It will help a good bit--and everything so high in thiscountry. A dollar, as you say, goes hardly anywhere! And this one will fityou beautifully. You can see yourself.""Of course it will. Do it up at once," cried the excited Betty. "Here isthe money. Twelve dollars. I was afraid I didn't have enough. And be sureand keep that blue one for my friend. Maybe she will come for it herself,so give me a card or something so she can find the place. Shall she askfor you?""If you please," and the English girl ran to write a card. She brought itback with the neatly made parcel of the over-blouse and slipped it intoBetty Gordon's hand. The latter thanked her and looked swiftly at the namethe other had written."Good-bye, Ida Bellethorne," she said, smiling. "What a fine name! I hopeI can sell some more blouses for you. I'll try."The shopgirl made a little bow and the silvery bell jangled again as Bettyopened the door. Betty looked back at the English girl, and the latterlooked after Betty. They were both interested, much interested, the one inthe other, and for reasons that neither suspected. Ida Bellethorne was notmuch like the girls Betty knew. She seemed even more sedate than theseniors at Shadyside where Betty had attended school with the Littellgirls since the term had opened in September.Ida Bellethorne was not, however, in any such happy condition as the girlsBetty Gordon knew. She might have told the warm-hearted customer who hadbought the over-blouse a story that would indeed have spurred Betty'sinterest to an even greater degree. But the English girl was naturally ofa secretive disposition, and she was among strangers.She turned back into the store when Betty had gone and the door, swingingshut, set the bell above it jingling again. A door opened at the end ofthe room and a tall, aggressive woman in a long, straight, gingham frockstrode into the room. She had very black, heavy brows that met over hernose and this, with the thick spectacles she wore, gave her a very sternexpression."What's the matter with that bell, Ida?" she demanded, in a sharp voice."It seems to ring enough, but it doesn't ring any money into mycash-drawer as I can see.""I sold my over-blouse out of the window, Mrs. Staples," said the girl."Humph! What else?""Er--what else? Why--why, she said she might come back for the one I ammaking.""Humph!" ejaculated Mrs. Staples a second time. "I don't see as that willfill my cellar with coal. Couldn't you sell her anything else out of theshop?""She didn't say she wanted anything else," said Ida timidly."Oh! She didn't? You'll never make a sales-woman till you learn to sell'em things they don't want but that the shop wants to sell. And I wasfoolish enough to tell you that you could have all you could make out ofthose blouses. Oh, well! I'm always being foolishly generous. Come! What'sthat on the floor? Pick it up."Mrs. Staples was very near-sighted, yet nothing seemed to escape herobservation. She pointed to the twist of white tissue paper on the floorwhich had been twitched out of Betty Gordon's bag. Ida stooped as she wascommanded and got the paper. She was about to toss it into thewaste-basket behind the counter when she realized that there was some hardobject wrapped in the paper."What is it?" asked Mrs. Staples, in her quick, stern way, as she saw Idaopen the twist of paper."Why, I--Oh, Mrs. Staples! look what this is, will you?"She held out in the palm of her hand a little, heart-shaped platinumlocket with a tiny but very beautiful diamond set in the center of itsface, and when she turned it over on the back was engraved the intertwinedletters "E.G.""For the land's sake!" ejaculated Mrs. Staples, coming nearer and grabbingthe locket out of Ida's hand. "Where did you get this?""Why, Mrs. Staples, you saw me pick it up.""But how did it come there?""Oh, I know!" Ida Bellethorne cried, with sudden animation. "That girlstood right there. She opened her bag to get out her purse and she musthave flirted it out to the floor.""Humph!" said the storekeeper doubtfully."Give it to me, Mrs. Staples, and I'll run after her," cried the Englishgirl anxiously."Humph!" This was Mrs. Staples' stock ejaculation and expressed a varietyof emotions. Just now it expressed doubt. "And then you'd come back andtell me how thankful she was to get it, while maybe it doesn't belong toher at all. No," said Mrs. Staples, "let her come looking for it if shelost it.""Oh!" murmured Ida Bellethorne doubtfully."Perhaps she will never guess she dropped it here.""That's no skin off your nose," declared the vulgar shopwoman. "You've norights in this thing, anyway. What's found on the floor of my shop is justas much mine as what's on the counter or in the trays behind the counter.I know my rights. Until whoever lost this thing comes in and provesproperty, it's mine.""Oh, Mrs. Staples!" cried her employee. "Is that the law in this country?It doesn't seem honest.""Humph! It's honest enough for me. And who are you, I'd like to know, agreenhorn fresh from the old country, trying to tell me what's honest andwhat ain't? If that girl comes back----""Yes, Mrs. Staples?""You sell her that other blouse if you want to, or anything else out ofthe shop. But you keep your mouth shut about this locket unless she asksfor it. Understand? I won't have no tattle-tales about me; and if youdon't learn when to keep your mouth open and when to keep it shut, I'llhave no use at all for you in my shop. Remember that now!"CHAPTER IITHE FRUITS OF TANTALUSBetty Gordon had glanced hastily at her wrist watch as she went out of thelittle store. It was very near the minute appointed for her to meet Carterat the square. And she had forgotten to ask that girl, Ida Bellethorne(such an Englishy name!), how to find her rendezvous with the Littells'chauffeur.She hesitated, tempted to run back. Had she done so she would have been intime to see Ida pick up the little locket that Uncle Dick had given Bettythat very Christmas and which she carried in her bag because it seemed thesafest place to treasure it while she was visiting. Her trunk was atShadyside.So it is that the very strangest threads of romance are woven in thisworld. And Betty Gordon had found before this that her life, at least, waspatterned in a very wonderful way. Since she had been left an orphan andhad found her only living relative, Mr. Richard Gordon, her father'sbrother, such a really delightful guardian the girl had been to so manyplaces and her adventures had been so exciting that her head wassometimes quite in a whirl when she tried to think of all the happenings.Uncle Dick's contracts with certain oil promotion companies made itimpossible as yet for him to have what Betty thought of as "a real,sure-enough home." He traveled here, there and everywhere. Betty loved totravel too; but Uncle Dick was forced to go to such rough and wild placesthat at first he could not see how Betty, a twelve year old, gently bredgirl, could go with him.Therefore he had to find a home for his little ward for a few months, andremembering that an old school friend of his was married to the owner of abig and beautiful farm, he arranged for Betty to stay with the Peabodys atBramble Farm. Her adventures as a "paying guest" in the Peabody householdare fully related in the first book of the series, entitled "Betty Gordonat Bramble Farm," and a very exciting experience it was.In spite, however, of the disagreeable and miserly Joseph Peabody, Bettywould not have missed her adventures at the farm for anything. In thefirst place, she met Bob Henderson there, and a better boy-chum a girlnever had than Bob. Although Bob had been born and brought up in apoorhouse, and at first knew very little about himself and his relatives,even a girl like Betty could see that this "poorhouse rat" as he wasslurringly called by Joseph Peabody, possessed natural refinement and avery bright mind.Betty and Bob became loyal friends, and when Betty, in the second volume,called "Betty Gordon in Washington," had fairly to run away from BrambleFarm to meet her Uncle Dick in the national capital, badly treated Bob ranaway likewise, on the track of somebody who knew about his mother'srelatives. Betty's adventures in Washington began with a most astonishingconfusion of identities through which she met the Littells--a charmingfamily consisting of a Mr. Littell, who was likewise an "Uncle Dick"; amotherly Mrs. Littell, who never found young people--either boys orgirls--troublesome; three delightful sisters named Louise, Roberta, andEsther Littell; and a Cousin Elizabeth Littell, who good-naturedly becomes"Libbie" instead of "Betty" so as not to conflict in anybody's mind with"Betty" Gordon.The fun they all had in Washington while Betty waited for the appearanceof her real Uncle Dick, especially after Bob Henderson turned up and waslikewise adopted for the time being by the Littell family, is detailed tothe full in that second story. And at last both Betty and Bob got newsfrom Oklahoma, where Mr. Richard Gordon was engaged, which set themtraveling westward in a great hurry--Betty to meet Uncle Dick at FlameCity and her boy chum hard on the trace of two elusive aunts of his, hismother's sisters, who appeared to be the only relatives he had in theworld.Betty and Bob discovered the aunts just in time to save them from sellingtheir valuable but unsuspected oil holdings to sharpers, and in "BettyGordon in the Land of Oil" one of the most satisfactory results that Bettysaw accomplished was the selling of the old farm for Bob and his aunts forninety thousand dollars.Uncle Dick decided that Betty must go to a good school in the fall, andthey chose Shadyside because the Littells and their friends were goingthere. Bob, now on a satisfactory financial plane, arranged to attend theSalsette Military Academy which was right across the lake from the girls'boarding school, Uncle Dick, who was now Bob's guardian, having advisedthis.Hastening back from Oklahoma, while Uncle Dick was called to Canada toexamine a promising oil field there, Betty and Bob met the girls and boysthey previously got acquainted with in Washington and some other friends,and Betty at least began her boarding school experience with considerableconfidence as well as delight.It was not all plain sailing as subsequent events prove; yet in "BettyGordon at Boarding School," the fourth volume of the series, Betty hadmany; pleasant adventures as well as school trials. She was particularlyinterested in the fortunes of Norma and Alice Guerin, who had been Betty'sfriends when she was living at Bramble Farm; and it was through Betty'sgood offices that great happiness came to the Guerin girls and theirparents.The hospitable Littells had invited their daughters' school friends (and,to quote Bob, there was a raft of them!) to come to Fairfields for theChristmas holidays, and at the close of the first term they bade good-byeto Shadyside and Salsette and took the train for Washington.Fairfields, which was over the river in Virginia, was one of the mostdelightful homes Betty Gordon had ever seen. It was closer to Georgetownthan to the nation's capital, and that is why Betty on this brisk morningwas shopping in the old-fashioned town and had come across the orange silkover-blouse in the window of the neighborhood shop.It was really too bad that Betty did not run back to the shop to ask fordirections to the soldiers' monument square. She would have been just inseason to interrupt the scene between Ida Bellethorne and Mrs. Staples andbefore the latter had threatened Ida with dismissal if she told Bettyabout the tiny locket. When she came to find it out, this loss of UncleDick's present, was going to trouble Betty Gordon very much."Where in the world can that soldiers' monument be?" murmured Betty toherself as, after hurrying on for a distance and having turned twocorners, she found herself in a neighborhood that looked stranger thanever to her.Not a soul was in sight at that moment, but presently she saw a smallnegro boy shuffling along, drawing a piece of chalk on the various housesand stoops as he passed."Boy, come here!" called Betty to the little fellow.At once the colored boy stopped the use of his piece of chalk and staredat her with wide-open eyes."I ain't done nuffin, lady, 'deed I ain't," he mumbled, and then began toback away."I only want to know where the soldiers' monument is," she returned. "Doyou know?""Soldiers' monument am over that way," and the boy waved his hand to oneside, where there was a hilly street, and then hurried out of sight."Oh, dear! that's not very definite," sighed Betty.But now she ran down the hilly street at a chance, turned a crooked cornerand came plump upon the square and the soldiers' monument. There was theLittells' big, closed car just turning into the square from anotherstreet."What luck! Fancy!" gasped Betty, running swiftly to the place where thebig car stopped."You're better than prompt, Miss Betty," said the driver of the car. "I amglad I hadn't to wait for you, for Mister Bob told me particular to getyou home for luncheon. You'll be wanted.""What for? Do tell me what for, Carter!" Betty cried. "I thought BobHenderson was awfully mysterious this morning at breakfast. Do you knowwhat is in the wind, Carter?""Not me, Miss Betty," said the chauffeur, and having tucked the robesabout her he shut the door and got into his own place. But before hestarted the car he said through the open window: "I have to delay alittle, Miss. Must drive around by the bank and pick up Mr. Gordon. But Iwill hurry home after that.""Oh! Uncle Dick did go to the bank here," murmured Betty, nestling backinto the cushions and robes. "I wonder if he is going to stop off atMountain Camp on his way back to Canada. Oh!" and she sighed more deeply,"if we could only go up there with him----"The car stopped before the gray stone bank building. Uncle Dick seemed tohave been on the watch for them, he came out so promptly. Although hishair was graying, especially about the temples, Mr. Richard Gordon was byno means an old looking man. He lived much out of doors and spent suchphysical energy only as his out-of-door life yielded, instead of living onhis reserve strength as so many office-confined men do. Betty had learnedall about that in physics. She was thoroughly an out-of-door girl herself!"Oh, Uncle Dick!" she cried when he stepped into the car, "are you reallyand truly getting ready to go north again?""Must, my dear. Have still some work to do in spite of the ice and snow inCanada. And, as I told you, I mean to stop and see Jonathan Canary.""That is what I mean, Uncle Dick," she cried. "Will you go to that lovelyMountain Camp all alo-o-one?""Mercy me, child, you never saw it--and in winter! You do not know whetherit is lovely or not.""It must be," said Betty warmly, "You have explained it all so beautifullyto us. The lovely lake surrounded by hills, and the long toboggan slide,and the skating, and fishing for pickerel through the ice, and--Oh, dearme! if we can't go----""If who can't go?" demanded her uncle in considerable amazement."Why, me. And Bob. And Bobby Littell and Louise, and the Tuckertwins, and all the rest. We were talking about it last night.It--would--be--won--der--ful!""Well, of all the--Why, Betty!" exclaimed Mr. Gordon, "you know you mustgo right back to school.""Yes, I know," sighed Betty. "It is like the fruits of Tantalus, isn't it?We read about him in Greek mythology--poor fellow! He stood up to his chinin water and over his head hung the loveliest fruits. But when he stoopedto get a drink the water receded, and when he stood on tiptoe to reach thefruit, they receded too. It was dreadful! And Mountain Camp, where yourfriend Mr. Canary lives, is just like that. Uncle Dick. For us it is thefruits of Tantalus."Uncle Dick stared at her for a moment, then he burst out laughing. ButBetty Gordon remained perfectly serious until they arrived at Fairfields.CHAPTER IIIOFF FOR A GALLOPThe crowd at the Littell lunch table (and it was literally a "crowd"although the Guerin girls and some of the other over Christmas visitorshad already gone home) hailed Betty's arrival vociferously."How do you stand it?" asked Uncle Dick, smiling at Mrs. Littell whopresided at one end of the table. "I should think they would drive youdistracted."Mrs. Littell laughed jovially and beamed at her young company. "I am onlydistracted when Mr. Littell and I are here alone," she rejoined. "This iswhat keeps us young.""You've only a shake to eat in, Betty," exclaimed Bobby Littell, who wasvery dark and very gay and very much alive all of the time. "Do hurry.We're 'most through.""Dear me! what can I eat in a shake?" murmured Betty, as the soup wasplaced before her. "And I am hungry.""A milk-shake should be absorbed in a shake," observed Bob Henderson,grinning at her from across the table."I need more than that, Bob, after what I have been through this morning.Such a job as shopping is! And oh, Bobby! I've got the loveliest thing toshow you. You'll just squeal!""What is it?" cried Bobby, eager and big-eyed at once. "Do hurry yourluncheon, Betty. We've all got to change, and it's almost time.""Time for what?" demanded Betty, trying to eat daintily but hurriedly.But Mrs. Littell called them to order here. "Give Betty time to eatproperly. Whatever it is, Betty, it can't begin until you are ready.""I'm through, Mother," said Bobby. "May I be excused? I'll have to helpEsther, you know. You'd better forget your appetite, Betty," she whisperedas she passed the latter on her way out of the room. "Time and tide waitfor no man--or girl either.""What does she mean?" wondered Betty, and became a little anxious as theothers began to rise, too, and were excused. "Have we got to change? Whatis it--the movies? Or a party? Of course, it isn't skating? Even if therewas a little scale of ice last night, it would never in this world bearus," added Betty, utterly puzzled.Bob Henderson had slipped around to her side of the table and leaned overher chair back to whisper in Betty's ear:"You've got to be ready in twenty minutes. The horses won't stand thiscold weather--not under saddle.""Saddle! Horses!" gasped Betty Gordon, rising right up from the table withthe soup spoon in her hand. "I--I don't believe I want any more luncheon,Mrs. Littell. Really, I don't need any more. Will you please excuse me?""Not if you run away with my spoon, Betty," laughed her hostess. "It wasthe dish that ran away with the spoon, and you are not a dish, dear.""She'll be dished if she doesn't hurry," called Bob from the door, andthen he disappeared."Sit down and finish your luncheon, Betty," advised Mrs. Littell. "Iassure you that they will not go without you. The men can walk the horsesabout a little if it is necessary.""I haven't been in a saddle since I left the land of oil and my own dearClover-pony!" cried Betty later, as she ran upstairs. "I know just wheremy riding habit is. Oh, dear! I hope I have as spirited a horse as dearClover was. Are you all ready, Bobby? And you, too, Louise--and Esther?Goodness me! suppose Carter had broken down on the road and hadn't broughtme back in time----"Libbie! For goodness' sake don't sit down in that chair. That package hasgot the loveliest orange silk over-blouse in it. Wait till you see it,Bobby."She fairly dragged the plump girl, Libbie, away from the proximity of thechair in question and then began to scramble into her riding dress. Theclatter of hoofs was audible on the drive as she fixed the plain gold pinin her smart stock."Of course," Betty said with a sigh, "one can't wear a locket, with orwithout a chain, when one is riding. That dear locket Uncle Dick gave me!I suppose it is safe enough in my bag. Well, I'm ready."They all ran down to the veranda to see the mounts. Betty's was abeautiful gray horse named Jim that she had seen before in the Fairfieldsstables."He's sort of hard-bitted, Miss," said the smiling negro who held thebridle and that of Bobby's own pony, a beautiful bay. "But he ain't got abad trick and is as kind as a lamb, Miss.""Oh, I'm not afraid of him," declared Betty. "You ought to see my Clover.All right, Uncle Dick, I'm up!"They were all mounted and cantering down the drive in a very few minutes.Even plump little Libbie sat her steed well, for she had often ridden overher own Vermont hills."I don't know where we're going, but I'm on my way!" cried Betty, who wasdelighted to be once more in the saddle."We're going right across country to Bolter's stock farm," Louise toldher. "Here's where we turn off. There will be some fences. Can you jump afence, Betty?""I can go anywhere this gray horse goes," declared Betty proudly.But Bob rode up beside her before they came to the first jump. "Look outfor the icy places, Betsey," he warned her. "None of these horses aresharpened. They never have ice enough down here in Virginia to worryabout, so they say."Which was true enough on ordinary occasions. But the frost the nightbefore had been a hard one and the air was still tingling with it. In theshady places the pools remained skimmed over. A gallop over the fields andthrough the woodland paths put both the horses and riders in a glow ofexcitement.Perhaps Betty was a little careless--at least too confident. Her gray gotthe lead and sped away across some rough ground which bordered a ravine.Bob shouted again for her to be careful, and Betty turned and waved herhand reassuringly to him.It was just then that Jim slipped on the edge of the bank. Both of hisfront feet slid on an icy patch and he almost came to his knees. Bettysaved herself from going over his head by a skillful lunge backward,pulling sharply on the reins.But the horse did not so easily regain his foot-hold. The edge of the bankcrumbled. Betty did not utter a sound, but the girls behind her screamedin unison."Stop! Wait! She'll be killed!"Betty knew that Bob was coming at a thundering pace on his brown mount;but the gray horse was on its haunches, sliding down the slope of theravine, snorting as it went. Betty could not stop her horse, but she clungmanfully to the reins and sat back in her saddle as though glued to it.Just what would happen when they reached the bottom of the slope was avery serious question.CHAPTER IVA SECOND IDA BELLETHORNEThe ravine was forty feet deep, and although the path, down which the grayhorse slid with Betty Gordon on his back, was of sand and gravel only,there were some boulders and thick brush at the bottom that threateneddisaster to both victims of the accident.Swiftly and more swiftly the frightened horse slid, and the girl had noidea what she should do when they came, bumpy-ti-bump to the bottom.She heard Bob shouting something to her, but she did not immediatelycomprehend what he said. Something, she thought it was, about herstirrups. But this was no time or place to look to see if her stirrupleathers were the proper length or if her feet were firmly fixed in theirons, which both Bob and Uncle Dick had warned her about when first shehad begun to ride.Although she dared not look back, Betty knew that Bob had galloped to thevery edge of the ravine and had now flung himself from his saddle. Sheheard his boots slam into the sliding gravel of the hill. He shoutedagain--that cheery hail that somehow helped Betty to hold on to her fastvanishing courage."Kick your feet out of the stirrups, Betty!"What he meant finally seeped into Betty's clouded brain. She realized thatBob Henderson, her chum, the boy she had learned to have such confidencein, was coming down that bank in mighty strides, prepared to save her ifit was possible.The gray horse was struggling and snorting; he was likely to tumblesideways at any moment. If he did, and Betty was caught under him----But she was not caught in any such crushing pressure. It was Bob's armaround her waist that squeezed her. She had kicked her feet loose of thestirrups, and now Bob, throwing himself backward, tore her out of thesaddle. He fell upon his back, and Betty, struggling and laughing andalmost crying, fell on top of him."All right, Betty! All right!" gasped Bob. "No need to squeal now.""Who's squealing?" she demanded. "Let me up, do! Are you hurt, Bob?""Only the wind knocked out of me. Woof! You all right?""Oh, my dear!" shrieked Bobby at the top of the bank. "Are you killed,Betty?""Only half killed," gasped Betty. "Don't worry. Spread the news. ElizabethGordon, Miss Sharpe's prize Latin scholar, will yet return to Shadysideto make glad the heart of----""She's all right," broke in Tommy Tucker, having dismounted and lookingover the brink of the bank. "She's trying to be funny. Her neck isn'tbroken.""I declare, Tommy!" cried Louise Littell admonishingly, "you sound asthough you rather thought her poor little neck ought to be dislocated.""Cheese!" gasped Teddy, Tommy's twin. "You got that word out of a book,Louise--you know you did.""So I did; out of the dictionary. There are a lot more of them there, ifyou want to know," and Louise laughed."Oh!" at this point rose a yearning cry. "Oh!" I just think he is too dearfor anything!""Cracky! What's broke loose now?" demanded Tommy Tucker, jerking back hishead to stare all around at the group on the brink of the high bank."Who is too expensive, Libbie?" asked Bobby, glancing at her cousin with alook of annoyance displayed in her features."Robert Henderson. He is a hero!" gasped the plump girl."I know that hero has torn his coat," Louise said, still gazing down intothe ravine.Of course Bob had played a heroic part; but the rest of those presentwould have considered it almost indecent to speak of it as Libbie did. Shecontinued to clasp her hands and gaze soulfully into the ravine. Bob,having made sure that Betty was all right, had gone down to the bottom ofthe slope and helped the gray horse to its feet. The animal was morefrightened than hurt, although its legs were scratched some and it favoredone fore foot when Bob walked it about."Dear me!" cried Betty, coming closer. "Poor old Jim! Is he hurt much,Bob?""I don't believe so," her friend replied."Can we get him up the bank?""I won't try that if there is any outlet to this ravine--and there mustbe, of course. Say! do you hear that silly girl?""Who? Libbie?" Betty began to giggle. "She is going to make a hero of you,Bob, whether you want to be or not. And you are----""Now, don't you begin," growled Bob."I never saw such a modest fellow," laughed Betty, giving his free hand alittle squeeze."Huh! Libbie will want to put a laurel wreath on my brow if I climb upthere. See! There is a bunch of laurels right over there--thoseglossy-leaved, runty sort of trees. Not for me! I am going to lead Jim outahead, and you climb up, if you want to, and come along with the rest ofthe bunch. Ride my horse, if you will, Betty.""So you'd run away from a girl!" scoffed Betty, but laughing. "You are nohero, Bob Henderson.""Sure I'm not," he agreed cheerfully. "And I'd run away from a girl likeLibbie any day. I wonder how Timothy Derby stands for her. But he's almostas mushy as a soft pumpkin!"With this disrespectful observation Bob started off with the gray horseand Betty scrambled up the bank down which she had plunged so heedlessly.Bobby was one of those who had dismounted at the brink of the ravine, andshe held out a brown hand to Betty as the latter scrambled up the lastyard or two of the steep bank and helped her to a secure footing."Are you all right, Betty dear?" she cried."No. One side of me is left," laughed Betty. "Wasn't that some slide?""Now, don't try to make out that you did it on purpose!" exclaimed Esther,the youngest Littell sister."It was too lovely for anything," sighed Libbie."I'm glad you think so," said Betty. "Oh! you mean what Bob did. I see. Ofcourse he is lovely--always has been. But don't tell him so, for itutterly spoils boys if you praise them--doesn't it Bobby?""Of course it does," agreed Betty's particular chum, whose real name,Roberta, was seldom used even by her parents."I like that!" chorused the Tucker twins. "Wait till we tell Bob, Betty,"added Tommy Tucker, shaking his head."If you try to slide downhill on horseback again, we'll all just let youslide to the very bottom," said Teddy."Don't fret," returned Betty gaily. "I don't intend to take another suchslide----""Not even if your Uncle Dick takes you up to Mountain Camp?" asked Bobby."There's fine tobogganing up there, he says. Mmmm!""Don't talk about it!" wailed Betty. "You know we can't go, for schoolbegins next week and Uncle Dick won't hear to anything breaking in on myschooling.""Not even measles?" suggested Tommy Tucker solemnly. "Two of the fellowswere quarantined with it when we left Salsette," he added."Oh! don't speak of such a horrid thing," gasped Libbie, who did notconsider measles in the least romantic. "You get all speckled like--like azebra if you have 'em."The twins uttered a concerted shout and almost rolled out of their saddlesinto which they had again mounted after assisting the girls, Betty beingastride Bob's horse."Speckled like a zebra is good!" Bobby Littell said laughingly to herplump cousin. "I suppose you think a barber's pole is speckled, Libbie?"These observations attracted the deluded Libbie sufficiently from herhero-worship, so that when Bob Henderson came up out of the ravine to jointhem a mile beyond the scene of the accident, he was perfectly safe fromLibbie's romantic consideration.The boy and girl friends were then in a deep discussion of the chances,pro and con, of Betty's Uncle Dick taking her with him to Mountain Campdespite the imminent opening of the term at Shadyside."Of course there is scarcely a possibility of his doing so," Betty saidfinally with hopeless mien. "Mr. Canary--Uncle Dick's friend is namedJonathan Canary, isn't that a funny name?" she interrupted herself to ask."He's a bird," declared Teddy Tucker solemnly."Nothing romantic sounding about that name," his brother said, with a lookat Libbie. "'Jonathan Canary'--no poetry in that.""He, he!" chuckled Ted wickedly. "Talking about poetry----""But we weren't!" said Bobby Littell. "We were talking about going toMountain Camp in the Adirondacks. Think of it--in the dead of winter!""Talking about poetry," steadily pursued Teddy Tucker. "You know TimothyDerby is always gushing.""A 'gusher,'" interposed Betty primly, "is an oil well that comes in witha bang.""Don't you mean it comes out with a bang?" teased Louise."In or out, Betty and I have seen 'em gush all right," cried Bob, as theycantered on together along a well-defined bridle-path."Say! I'm telling you something," exploded Teddy Tucker, who did notpurpose to have his tale lost sight of. "Something about Timothy Derby.""Oh, dear me, yes!" exclaimed Bobby. "Do tell it and get it over, Ted."The twins both began to chuckle and Teddy had some difficulty in going onwith his story. But it seemed they had been at the Derby place the eveningbefore and Timothy had been "boring everybody to distraction," Ted said,reading "Excelsior" to the family."And believe me!" interjected Tommy Tucker, "that kid can elocute.""And he's always been at it," hurried on his twin, giggling. "Here's whatMr. Derby says Timothy recited the first time he ever spoke a piece at aSunday School concert. You know; the stuff the little mites cackle.""How elegant are your expressions, Teddy!" remarked Louise, sighing.But she was amused as well as the others when Ted produced a paper onwhich he had written down the verse Mr. Derby said his son had recited,and just as Timothy had said it!"Listen, all of you," begged Teddy. "Now, don't laugh and spoil it all,Tom. Listen:    "'Lettuce denby uppan doing      Widow Hartford N E fate,    Still H E ving, still pursuing,      Learn to label Aunty Waite.'"Libbie's voice rose above the general laughter, and she was quite warm.For Libbie's was a loyal soul."I don't care! I don't believe it. His father is always making fun ofTimothy. He--he is cruel, I think. And, anyway, Timothy was only a littleboy then.""What did he want to label his Aunty Waite for?" demanded Bob."You all be pretty good," called Betty, seeing that Libbie was reallygetting angry. "If you aren't I'll ask Timothy and Libbie to my party atMountain Camp and none of the rest of you shall go.""Easy enough said, that, Betty," Bob rejoined. "You haven't very muchchance of going there. But, crimpy! wouldn't it be great if Uncle Dickdid take us?""Remember our school duties, children," drawled Louise. "'Still H E ving,still pursuing.' We must not cry for the moon."Thus, with a great deal of laughter and good-natured chatter, thecavalcade trotted on and came finally to what Louise and Bobby said wasthe entrance to Bolter's Farm."All our horses were raised on this farm," explained Louise. "Daddy saysthat Lewis Bolter has the finest stock of any horseman in Virginia. Muchof it is racing stock. He sells to the great stables up north. One of hismen will know what to do for your gray's scratched legs, Betty."For Betty had changed with Bob again and rode Jim, the horse that had sliddown into the ravine. Betty was really sorry about the scratches and feltsomehow as though she were a little to blame for the accident. She shouldhave been more careful in guiding the gray.Once at the great stables and paddocks, however, Betty's mind was relievedon this point. Louise had an errand from her father to Mr. Bolter and wentaway with Esther to interview the horse owner. Mr. Littell was a builderand constructor and he bought many work horses of Mr. Bolter's raising, aswell as saddle stock.If there was anything on four feet that Betty and Bob loved, it was ahorse. In the west they had ridden almost continually; their mounts out atFlame City had been their dearest possessions and they would have beenglad to bring them east, both Betty's Clover-pony and Bob's big whitehorse, had it been wise to do so.At Shadyside and Salsette, however, there had been no opportunity forhorseback riding. They had found pleasure in other forms of outdoorexercise. Now, enabled to view so many beautiful and sleek horses, Betty,as well as Bob and the others, dismounted with delight and entered thelong stables.While her gray was being examined by one of the stablemen, Betty wentalong a whole row of box stalls by herself, in each of which a horse wasstanding quietly or moving about. More than one came to thrust a softmuzzle over the door of the stall and with pointed ears and intelligentgaze seemed to ask if the pretty, brown-eyed girl had something nice inher pocket."Hi, Miss!" croaked a hoarse voice behind her. "If you want to see abang-hup 'orse--a real topper--come down 'ere."Betty turned to see a little crooked man, with one shoulder much higherthan the other, who walked a good deal like a crab, sideways. He grinnedat her cheerfully in spite of his ugly body and twisted features. Hereally was a dreadfully homely man, and he was not much taller than Bettyherself. He wore a grimy jockey cap, a blue blouse and stained whitetrousers, and it was quite evident that he was one of the stable helpers."This 'ere is the lydy for you to see, Miss," continued the little maneagerly. "She's from old Hengland, Miss. I come with her myself and I'veknowed her since she was foaled. Mr. Bolter ain't got in 'is 'ole stable,Miss, a mare like this one."He pointed to a glossy black creature in the end box. Before the animalraised her head and looked over the gate, Betty knew that the mare fromEngland was one of the most beautiful creatures she had ever seen."Hi, now, 'ow's that for a pretty lydy, Miss?" went on the rubber proudly."Oh! See! She knows you! Look at the beauty!" gasped Betty, as the blackmare reached over the gate and gently nipped the blue sleeve of thecrooked little man."Knows me? I should sye she does," he said proudly. "Why, she wouldn'ttake her meals from nobody but me. I told 'em so w'en I 'eard she was soldto Hamerica. And they found Hi was right, Miss, afore hever they got 'eraboard the ship. They sent for me, an' Mr. Bolter gave me a good job with'er. I goes with Ida Bellethorne wherever she goes. That's the----""Ida Bellethorne?" interrupted Betty in amazement"Yes, Miss. That's 'er nyme. Ida Bellethorne. She comes of the trueBellethorne stock. The last of the breed out o' the Bellethorne stables,Miss.""Ida Bellethorne!" exclaimed Betty again. "Isn't that odd? A horse and agirl of the same name!"But this last she did not say audibly. The cockney rubber was fondling themare's muzzle and he did not hear Betty's comment. The discovery of thissecond Ida Bellethorne excited Betty enormously.CHAPTER VMEASLESBetty Gordon's active mind could not let this incident pass withoutfurther investigation. Not alone was she interested in the beautiful blackmare and the girl in the neighborhood shop, but she wanted to know howthey came to have the same name.Betty was a practical girl. Bob often said it was not easy to fool Betty.She had just as strong an imagination as any other girl of her age andloved to weave fancies in her own mind when it was otherwise idle. But sheknew her dreams were dreams, and her imaginings unreal.It struck her that the name "Ida Bellethorne" was more suitable for ahorse than for a girl. Betty wondered all in a flash if the English girlwho had sold her the silk sweater in the neighborhood shop that morningand who confessed that she had come from England practically alone had notchosen this rather resounding name to use as an alias. Perhaps she had runaway from her friends and was hiding her identity behind the name of ahorse that she had heard of as being famous on the English turf.This was not a very hard thing for Betty to imagine. And, in any case, herinterest was stirred greatly by the discovery she had made. She was aboutto speak to the little, crooked man regarding the name when somethingoccurred to draw her attention from the point of her first surprise.The mare, Ida Bellethorne, coughed. She coughed twice."Ah-ha, my lydy!" exclaimed the rubber, shaking his head and stepping awayfrom the door of the stall that the mare should not muzzle his clothing."That's a fine sound--wot?""Is it dust in her poor nose?" asked the interested Betty."'Tis worse nor dust. 'Tis wot they call 'ere the 'orse distemper, Miss.You tyke it from 'Unches Slattery, the change in climate and crossin' thehocean ain't done Ida Bellethorne a mite of good.""Is that your name? 'Hunches Slattery'?" Betty asked curiously."That's wot they've called me this ten year back. You see, I was a jockeywhen I was a lad, and a good one, too, if Hi do say it as shouldn't. But Igot throwed in a steeplechase race. When they let me out o' the 'orspitalI was like this--'unchbacked and crooked. I been 'Unchie ever since,Miss.""I am so sorry," breathed Betty Gordon softly.But the crooked little rubber was more interested in Ida Bellethorne'shistory than he was in his own misfortune, which was an old story."I was working in the Bellethorne stables when this mare was foaled. I wasalways let work about her. She's a wonnerful pedigree, Miss--aw, yes,wonnerful! And she was named for an 'igh and mighty lydy, sure enough.""Named for a lady?" cried Betty. "Don't you mean for a girl?""Aw, not much! Such a lydy, Miss! Fine, an' tall, and wonnerful to lookat. They said she could sing like a hangel, that she could. Miss IdaBellethorne, she was. She ought've been a lord's daughter, she ought.""What became of her?" asked the puzzled Betty."I don't know, Miss. I don't rightly know what became of all the family. Ikept close to the mare 'ere; the family didn't so much bother me. Butthere was trouble and ruin and separation and death; and, after all,"added the rubber in a lower tone, "for all I know, there was cheating andswindling of the fatherless and orphan, too. But me, I kept close to thislydy 'ere," and he fondled the mare's muzzle again."It's quite wonderful," admitted Betty. But what seemed wonderful to her,the stableman did not know anything about. "I suppose the pretty mare isworth a lot of money?""Hi don't know wot Mr. Bolter would sell 'er for, if at all. But 'e paidfour thousand pun, laid down at the stables where she was kep' after thesmash of the Bellethorne family. She's got a pedigree longer than somelord's families, and 'er track record was what brought Mr. Lewis Bolter toHengland when she was quietly put on the market."Maybe they couldn't 'ave sold 'er to Henglish turfman," he added,whispering softly in Betty's ear, "for maybe the title to 'er would beclouded hand if she won another race somebody might go into court aboutit."Betty did not understand this; and just then the mare began to cough againand she was troubled by Ida Bellethorne's condition."Is that the black mare, Slattery?" demanded a voice behind them."Yes, sir," said the crooked little man respectfully, touching his cap.Betty turned to see a gentleman in riding boots and a short coat with adog-whip in his gloved hand, whom she believed at once to be Mr. Bolter.Nor was she mistaken."She's a beauty, isn't she, my dear?" the horseman said kindly. "But I donot like that cough. I've made up my mind, Slattery. She goes to-morrow toCliffdale, and of course you go with her. Pack your bag to-night. I havealready telephoned for a stable-car to be on the siding in the morning.""Yes, sir. Wot she needs is dry hair, an' the 'igher the better," said thecrooked man, nodding."They will put her on her feet again," agreed Mr. Bolter. "The balsam airaround Cliffdale is the right lung-healer for man or beast."He went out and Betty heard the girls calling to her. She thanked HunchieSlattery, patted Ida Bellethorne's nose, and ran out of the stable.But her head was full of the mystery of the striking name of "IdaBellethorne." She felt she must tell somebody, and Bobby of course, whowas her very closest chum, must be the recipient of her story as thecavalcade started homeward. It was Bobby whom Betty wanted to have theblue blouse just as soon as the shopgirl finished it."Now, what do you think of that?" Betty demanded, after she had delivered,almost in a breath, a rather garbled story of the strange girl and theblack mare from England."Goodness, Betty, how wonderful!" exclaimed her friend. "I do so want tosee that over-blouse you bought. And you say she is making another?""Is that all you've got to say about it?" demanded Betty, staring."Why--er--you know, it really is none of our business, is it?" askedBobby, but with dancing eyes. "You know Miss Prettyman told us that thegreatest fault of character under which young ladies labor to-day isvulgar curiosity. Oh, my! I can see her say it now," declared naughtyBobby, shaking her head."But, Bobby! Do think a bit! A girl and a horse both of the same name, andjust recently from England! I'm going to ask right out what it means.""Who are you going to ask--the horse?" giggled Bobby."Oh, you! No, I can't ask the pretty black mare," Betty said, shaking herhead. "For she is going to be sent away for her health. She's got whatthey call 'distemper.' She has to be acclimated, or something.""It sounds as though it might hurt," observed Bobby gravely."Something ought to hurt you," said Betty laughing. "You are forever andever poking fun. But I am going to see Ida Bellethorne in the shop andfind out what she knows about the pretty mare.""Well, I'm sorry I didn't see the horse," confessed Bobby. "But I'll gowith you to see the girl. And I do want to see the blouse."That, Betty showed her the moment they arrived at Fairfields and could runupstairs to the room the two girls shared while Betty visited here. Thelatter unfolded the orange-silk blouse and spread it on the bed. Bobbywent into exstacies over it, as in duty bound."Wait till you see the one she is making for you," Betty said. "You'lllove it!""What is that you are going to love?" asked a voice outside the open door."Measles?""Oh, Bob! Who ever heard the like?" demanded Betty. "Love measles, indeed.Why--What makes you look so queer?""Greatest thing you ever heard, girls!" cried Bob, his face very red andhis eyes shining. "I didn't really understand how much I had come to hatebooks and drill these last few weeks.""What do you mean?" demanded Roberta Littell. "If you don't tell us atonce!""Why, didn't you hear? Telegrams have come. To all our parents andguardians. Measles! Measles! Measles!"He began to dance a very poor imitation of the Highland Fling in the hall.The girls ran out and seized him, one on either side, and big as Bob wasthey managed to shake him soundly."Tell us what you mean!" commanded Betty."Who has the measles?" cried Bobby."Everybody! Or, pretty near everybody, I guess. The chaps who had it andwere quarantined when we came away from Salsette, gave it to the servants.And it has spread to the village. And Miss Prettyman's got it and a lot ofthe other folks at Shadyside. Oh, my eye!""Are you fooling us, Bob?" demanded Betty."Honor bright! It is just as I say. Of course, it all isn't in themessages the two schools have sent out to 'parents and guardians.' That isthe way the messages are headed, you know. But the Shadyside _Mirror_ hascome, too, and tells all about it. Opening is postponed for a fortnight.What do you know about that?" and Bob began his clumsy dance again.Betty broke away and darted down the stairs. She scarcely touched thesteps with her feet she flew so fast, and if it had not been for thebanister she surely would have come to the bottom in a heap.She ran out on the porch to find her Uncle Dick smoking a cigar andreading the paper in a warm corner. Like a stone from a catapult she flungherself into his arms."Oh, Uncle Dick! Uncle Dick! Now we can go!" she cried, seizing himtightly around the neck."Goodness, child!" choked Uncle Dick, fairly throttled by her exuberance."What is it? Go where, Betty?""To Mountain Camp! With you! All of us! No school for more than two weeks!Oh, Uncle Dick!" Then she suddenly stopped and her glowing face lost itscolor and her excitement subsided. "Dear me!" she quavered, "I 'member nowI had 'em when I was six, and they say you can't have 'em but once.""What can't you have but once?""Measles," said Betty, sighing deeply. "I suppose after all I can go backto Shadyside. Maybe Mrs. Eustice will expect all of us that have had 'emto come."CHAPTER VIA DISAPPEARANCEThere was an exciting conclave at Fairfields that evening. Perhaps Ishould say two. For in one room given over by the good-natured Mrs.Littell to the young folks there was a most noisy conclave while the oldermembers of the household held a more quiet if no less earnest conferencein the library.There were eight in the young folks' meeting for Mrs. Littell insistedupon Esther's going to bed at a certain hour every evening "to get herbeauty sleep.""And I'll say she is sure to be a raving beauty when she grows up, if shekeeps going to bed with the chickens," giggled Bobby."You know she can't go to Mountain Camp anyway," Louise said quietly, "forher school isn't measly and it begins again day after to-morrow.""Poor Esther!" sighed Betty. "We must make it up to her somehow. I wasafraid she would cry at dinner this evening.""She's a good kid," agreed Bobby. "But are you sure, Betty, that we cango to the mountains? Just think! Eight of us!""Some contract for Mr. Gordon," observed Tommy Tucker with unusualreflection."How about it's being some contract for Mr. and Mrs. Canary?" suggestedBob Henderson. "Maybe they will shy at such a crowd.""I asked Uncle Dick about that," Betty said eagerly. "He told me all aboutMr. and Mrs. Canary. He has known them for years and years. They must beawfully nice people and they have got a great, big, rambling bungalow sortof house, all built of logs in the rough. But inside there is a heatingplant, and electric lights, and shower baths, and everything up-to-date.Mr. Canary is very wealthy; but his money could not keep him from gettingtuber--tuber----""'Tubers,'" said Bob with gravity, "are potatoes, or something of thatkind.""Now, Bob! you know what I mean very well," cried Betty. "His lungs wereaffected. But they have healed and he is perfectly well as long as hestays up there in the wilderness. The air there has wonderfulcur--curative properties. There!""Look! Will it cure such a bad attack of poetry?" interrupted Bobby,drawing the attention of the others to Timothy Derby and Libbie who, withheads close together, were absorbed in a volume of verses the boy hadbrought with him from home."It might help," said Bob. "It ought to be cold enough up there atMountain Camp to freeze romance into an icicle.""I hope we all go then," Teddy Tucker agreed. "Our folks have said wecould--haven't they, Tom?""With suspicious alacrity," agreed his twin. "How's that for a finephrase, Louise? Do you know, I think mother and dad were almost shockedwhen they got the telegram from Salsette and knew our vacation was to beprolonged. The idea of Mountain Camp seems to please them.""Goodness! I know dear Mrs. Littell doesn't feel that way about it," criedBetty."She's got girls," said Ted dryly. "You know it is us boys who are notappreciated in this world.""Yes," said Bob, "you fellows are terribly abused, I'll say. But, now! Arewe all sure of going? That's what I want to know.""Timothy----" began Louise; but Bob held up his hand to stop her."I know from his father that Tim can go. Uncle Dick is sure to take us,Betty, isn't he?""He sent off a telegram to Mrs. Canary this evening. If she sends backword 'Yes' we can go day after to-morrow.""That's all right then," said Bob, quite as eagerly. 'The thing to do thenis to plan what to take and all that. It is cold up there, but dry. Muchcolder than it was at school before we came down. Furs, overcoats, boots,mittens--not gloves, for gloves are no good when it is really cold--andunderthings that are warm and heavy. We don't want to come back with nosesand toes frozen off.""Humph!" said Bobby scornfully, "what kind of underwear should you adviseour getting for our noses, Bob Henderson?""Aw--you know what I mean," said the boy, grinning. "Don't depend on a furpiece around your neck and a muff to keep the rest of you warm. Us fellowshave all got Mackinaws and boots and such things. And we'll want 'em."And so they excitedly made their plans. At least, six of them did whileTimothy and Libbie bent their minds upon the book. One thing about thosetwo young romanticists, they agreed to the plans the others made and werequite docile.At ten Timothy and the Tucker twins went home and the others wentcheerfully up to bed. While Betty Gordon remained at Fairfields Bobbyinsisted on sharing her own room with her. They were never separated atShadyside, so why should they be here?When she was half undressed Betty suddenly went down on her knees beforethe tall chiffonier and opened the lower drawer. She dug under everythingin the drawer until she came to her handbag, and drew it forth."I declare!" chuckled Bobby, "I thought you were digging a new burrow likea homeless rabbit. What did you forget?""Didn't forget anything," responded Betty, smiling up at her friend. "Iremembered something.""Oh!""My locket. Uncle Dick's present. I wanted to see that it was safe.""Goodness! Do you carry it in your bag?""I've got a lovely chain at Shadyside, you know. I told Uncle Dick not tobuy a chain. And I don't believe Mrs. Eustice will object to a simplelittle locket like mine, will she?""M-m-m! I don't know," replied Bobby. "You know she is awfully opposed tous girls wearing jewelry. And your locket is lovely. Just think! Platinumand a real diamond. Why! what is the matter, Betty?"For Betty had begun scrambling in her bag worse than she had in the bureaudrawer. Everything came out--purse, tickets, gloves, handkerchief, thetiniest little looking-glass, a letter or two, a silver thimble, twocoughdrops stuck together, a sample of ribbon which she had failed tomatch, a most disreputable looking piece of lead-pencil----But no twist of tissue paper with the locket in it!"What is the matter?" repeated Bobby, frightened by the expression of theother girl's face."I--I----Oh, Bobby! It's gone!" wailed Betty."Not your locket?""Yes, my locket!" sobbed Betty, and she sat down on the floor and wept."Why, it can't be! Who would take it? When did you see it last? Nobodyhere in the house would have stolen it, Betty.""It--it must have dropped out of my bag. Oh! what shall I do? I can't tellUncle Dick.""He won't punish you for losing it, will he?""But think how he'll feel! And how I'll feel!" wailed Betty. "He advisedme to put it somewhere for safe keeping until I got my chain. And Iwouldn't. I--I wanted it with me.""You should have put it downstairs in daddy's safe," said Bobbythoughtfully."But that doesn't do me a bit of good now," sobbed Betty Gordon."Don't you remember where you had it last?" asked her friend slowly."In my bag, of course. And I carried my bag to town to-day. Yes! Iremember seeing the paper it was in at the bottom of my bag more thanonce while I was shopping. Oh, dear! what shall I do?""Then you are quite sure it was not stolen?" Bobby suggested."No. I don't suppose it was. It just hopped out somehow. But where? Thatis the question, Bobby. I can't answer it."She rose finally and finished her preparations for bed. Bobby was verysympathetic; but there did not seem to be anything she could say thatwould really relieve Betty's heart, or help in any way. The locket wasgone and no trace of how it had gone had been left in Betty's mind.When the light was out Bobby crept into Betty's bed and held her tightlyin her arms."Don't cry, Betty dear!" the other girl whispered. "Maybe your Uncle Dickwill know how to find the locket.""Oh, Bobby! I can't tell him. I'm ashamed to," sighed Betty. "It looks asthough I had not cared enough about his present to be careful with it. AndI thought if I carried it about with me that there would be no chance ofmy losing it. And now----""Then tell Bob," suggested her chum, hugging Betty tightly."Bob?""Tell him all about it," said Bobby Littell. "Perhaps he will know whatto do. You can't really have lost that beautiful locket forever, Betty!""Oh, I don't know! It's gone, anyway!" sobbed Betty."Don't give up. That isn't like you, Betty," went on Bobby. "Maybe Bob canhelp. We can ask him, at least.""Yes, we can do that," was Betty's not very hopeful reply.CHAPTER VIIALL MRS. STAPLES COULD SAYThe two girls sought out Bob Henderson before breakfast and told him ofthe disappearance of Betty's beautiful little locket. Betty's eyes, were alittle swollen and even Bobby seemed not to have passed a very agreeablenight. Bob was quite shrewd enough to see these evidences of trouble andhe refrained from making any remark even in fun to ruffle the girls."Here's a pretty mess!" exclaimed Bob, but cheerfully. "And we all goingto Mountain Camp to-morrow if Mrs. Canary telegraphs 'Yes,' Huntedeverywhere, I suppose?""Yes, Bob," Betty assured him. "And there was but one place to hunt. In mybag.""Sure?""Pos-i-tive!""Carried it loose in your bag, did you?" he asked reflectively."Wrapped up in white tissue paper. You know, the box it came in gotbroken.""I remember. Gee, Betty! that's an awfully pretty locket. You don't wantto lose it.""But I have lost it!""For keeps, I mean," rejoined Bob, smiling encouragingly. "Come on! Let'ssee the bag. Where did you carry it? When was the last time you saw thelocket in the bag and where?""Oh!" Betty cried suddenly. "I remember it was in the bag when I wasshopping yesterday.""Shopping where? Let's hear about the last place you remember seeing it."Betty remembered very clearly seeing the twist of paper with the locket init while she was at Purcell's where she had bought some veiling."Then, Betty," said Bobby, "you went to that little store afterward, yousaid, where you got the over-blouse.""Ye--es. But I didn't notice it while I was there. I was so excited overthe blouse and so interested in Ida Bellethorne that I don't remember oflooking in my bag to see if my locket was safe.""'Ida Bellethorne'?" repeated Bob in surprise. "Why! that's the name ofMr. Lewis Bolter's new mare from England. I heard Mr. Littell and UncleDick talking about her.""And I met a girl named Ida Bellethorne. I'll tell you all about herlater, Bob," said Betty. "Just now I want to know what to do about thelocket.""I should say you did! And I'll tell you what," Bob said promptly. "Rightafter breakfast we'll borrow the little car and I'll take you over toGeorgetown and we'll go to every place you went to yesterday, Betty, andinquire. I'm allowed to drive in the District of Columbia, you know.""Will you, Bob?" cried Betty. "Do you think there is any chance of ourfinding it?""Why not? If it was picked up in one of the stores you went to. There arelots more honest people in the world than there are dishonest. Come onnow, don't cry.""I'm not going to cry," declared Betty. "I've cried enough already. Don'ttell the others, Bob. Nor Uncle Dick. I don't want him to know if I canhelp it. It looks just as though I didn't prize his present enough to takecare of it."Somehow, Betty felt encouraged by Bob's taking hold of the matter. Thesmall car was secured after breakfast and Bob and the two girls set offfor the other side of the river. It was not alone because of Bob's advicethat they stopped first at the little neighborhood shop on the hilly sidestreet where Betty had bought her sweater. Bobby was anxious to see herblue sweater, and the two girls ran in as soon as the car halted beforethe door.The little bell over it jingled pleasantly at their entrance; but it was atall and rather grim-looking woman who came from the back of the shop tomeet them instead of the English girl with whom Betty had dealt on herformer visit."Humph!" said Mrs. Staples, for it was she, when she spied the over-blouseunder Betty's coat. "You are the young lady who was to purchase the blueblouse when it was finished?""For my friend here," said Betty, bringing Bobby forward. "I know she willlike it.""I hope so," said Mrs. Staples. "It is finished. Ida sat up most of thenight to finish it. Here it is," and she displayed the dark blue blousefor the girls to see."How lovely!" ejaculated Bobby eagerly. "I like it even better than I doyour orange one, Betty. It's sweet.""It's twelve dollars, Miss," said the shop woman promptly. "You can pay meand take the blouse. I paid Ida for it.""Isn't the girl who made it here?" asked Betty anxiously."No, she ain't," said Mrs. Staples in her blunt way. "She left an hourago.""Oh! Will she come back?""I don't expect her. I am sure I cannot be changing help all the time. Sheleft me very abruptly. I did not ask her to come back.""Why," said Betty, wonderingly, "I thought you were her friend. Isn't sheall alone in this country?""She is a girl who seems quite able to take care of herself," the grimshopwoman said. "Or she is determined to try. I advised her to write toher aunt----""Then she has an aunt over here?" cried Betty eagerly."So she thinks. An aunt for whom Ida was named. There was some familytrouble, and Ida's father and her father's sister seem to have had nothingto do with each other for some years. The aunt is a singer--quite a notedconcert singer, it seems. Ida came to Washington expecting to find her.She did not find the elder Ida Bellethorne----""Then there are three Ida Bellethornes!" whispered Bobby in Betty's ear."So she came here to help me," continued Mrs. Staples, all the timewatching Betty with a rather strange manner. "She would better haveremained with me, as I told her. But she found in the paper last nightthis notice," the woman produced a torn piece of paper from the counterand handed it to Betty, "and nothing would do but Ida must go right awayto find the place and the person mentioned here."The two girls in great interest bent their heads above the piece of paper.The marked paragraph was one of several in the column and read asfollows:    "It is stated upon good authority that the great Ida Bellethorne    will arrive at Cliffdale, New York, within a day or two, and will    remain for the winter.""Why, how odd," murmured Betty. "And did this make Ida go away?""She has gone to Cliffdale to meet her aunt. That was her intention," saidMrs. Staples. "Are either of you young ladies prepared to buy this blueblouse?""Oh, yes, indeed!" cried Bobby, who had taken a fancy to the blouse. "I'vegot money enough. And it was nice of Miss Bellethorne to finish it for mebefore she went. I wish I might thank her personally.""I do not expect to see Ida again," the shopwoman repeated in her mostsevere manner, wrapping up the over-blouse. "Twelve dollars--thank you,Miss. Can I show you anything else?""Wait!" gasped Betty. "I want to ask you--I wanted to ask Ida Bellethorneif she saw me drop anything here in the store yesterday?""I am sorry she is not here to answer that question," said Mrs. Staples."I was not here when you came, Miss.""No, I know you weren't. But somewhere while I was shopping yesterday Ilost something out of my bag. If it dropped out here----""I can assure you I picked up nothing, Miss," declared the shop woman."If Ida----""If Ida Bellethorne did, she is not here, unfortunately, to tell you,"said Mrs. Staples in her same manner and without a change of expression onher hard face."Oh, dear!" sighed Betty."But you don't know that you dropped it here," Bobby said to encourageher. But perhaps it encouraged Mrs. Staples more!"I have nothing more to say, Miss," the woman declared. "Ida not beinghere----""Oh, well," said Betty, trying to speak more cheerfully, "it is true I donot remember having seen it while I was here at all. So--so we will go tothe other places. Of course, if Ida had found anything she would have toldyou?""I cannot be responsible for what Ida Bellethorne would do or say,"replied the shopwoman grimly. "Not having been here myself when you came,Miss----""Oh, yes! I understand," said Betty hastily. "Well, thank you for keepingthe blouse for us. Good-bye."She and Bobby were not greatly pleased with Mrs. Staples. But they had noreason for distrusting her. When they had gone the shopwoman smiled a mostwintry smile."Well, I am not supposed to tell people how to go about their own affairs,I should hope," was her thought. "That chit never told me what she hadlost. It might have been a pair of shoes or a boiled lobster! Humph! Folkswould better speak plain in this world. I always do, I am sure."CHAPTER VIIIUNCLE DICK MUST BE TOLDThe two girls did not tell Bob Henderson all that had happened in thelittle shop when they first came out. They were in too much haste to getto the other places where it might be possible that Betty had dropped herlocket. Of all things, they did not suspect that Mrs. Staples knew thefirst thing about it.But they did tell the boy that Ida Bellethorne had gone away."Where's she gone?" asked the inquisitive Bob. "Couldn't be that she foundthe locket and ran off with it?""Why, you're almost horrid!" declared Betty, aggrieved. "You don't knowwhat a nice girl Ida is.""Humph!" (Could he have caught that expression from waiting outside Mrs.Staples' shop?) "Humph! I don't believe you know how nice she is, orotherwise. You never saw her but once.""But she's seen the horse," giggled Bobby."What horse?" demanded Bob."Mr. Lewis Bolter's black mare, Ida Bellethorne.""Oh!""And, oh, Bob!" cried Betty, "there's another Ida Bellethorne, and thisIda has gone away to see her. She's her aunt.""Who's her aunt?" grumbled Bob, who was having some difficulty just thenin driving the car and so could not give his full attention to the matterthe girls were chattering about."Why, see!" cried Betty, rummaging in her bag. "Here's the piece ofnewspaper with the society item, or whatever it is, in it that made Ida goaway so suddenly this morning. It's about her aunt, the great concertsinger. Ida's gone to meet her where that says," and she put the piece ofpaper into Bob's hand."All right," he said. "Here's Markham and Boggs' place. You said you werein this store yesterday, Betty.""So I was. Come on, Bobby," cried the other girl, hopping out of the car."I suppose we shall have to go to the manager or the superintendent orsomebody. Dear me! if we don't find my locket I don't know what I shalldo."When Betty and Bobby came out of the store, much disappointed, they foundBob grinning--as Bobby declared--"like a Cheshire cat.""But never mind the cat," continued Bobby. "What is the matter with thatboy? For boys will laugh at the most serious things. And this is serious,my poor, dear Betty.""Indeed it is," agreed her friend, and so they crossed the walk to thegrinning Bob Henderson who had the scrap of newspaper Betty had given himin his hand."Say," he drawled, "who did you say this aunt of Ida Bellethorne is?""Mrs. Staples says she is a concert singer--a prima donna," replied Betty."She's a prima donna all right," chuckled Bob. "Where now? Oh! To Stone'sshoe shop? Well, what do you know about this notice in the paper?" and hissmile grew broader."What do you mean, Bob?" demanded Betty, rather vexed. "You can read theparagraph yourself. 'The great Ida Bellethorne'. That means she is a greatsinger of course.""Yes, I see," replied Bob, giving some attention to the steering of thecar. "But there is one thing about you girls--you never read the sportingpage of the newspaper.""What is that?" gasped Bobby Littell."This string of items you handed me is torn out of the sporting page. Allthe paragraphs refer to racing matters. That particular one deals with Mr.Bolter's black mare, Ida Bellethorne. Cliffdale is the place he wasshipping her to far her health.""Never!" cried Bobby."Oh, Bob! Is that so?" gasped Betty.Bob burst into open laughter. "That's a good one on you and on yourfriend, Ida," he declared. "If she has gone to meet her aunt up in NewYork State she'll meet a horse instead. How's that for a joke?"Betty Gordon shook her head without smiling. "I don't see the joke atall," she said. "Poor Ida! She will be sadly disappointed. And she haslost her position here with Mrs. Staples. We could see that Mrs. Stapleswas angry because she went away.""Why," cried Bobby, likewise sympathetic, "I think it is horrid--actuallyhorrid! You needn't laugh, Bob Henderson.""Shucks!" returned the boy. "I can't cry over it, can I? Of course it istoo bad the girl has made such a mistake. But our weeping won't help her.""No," confessed Bobby, "I suppose that is so.""And our weeping won't find my locket," sighed Betty. "Dear me! If I diddrop it in Stone's place I hope they have saved it for me."But the locket was not to be found in that shop, either. Nor in the twoothers which Betty Gordon had visited the previous day. This indeed was aperfectly dreadful thing! The plainer it was that the locket could not befound, the more repentent and distracted Betty became."I shall have to tell Uncle Dick--I shall have to," she wailed, when Bobdrove them away from the last place and all hope was gone glimmering. "Oh,dear! It is dreadful.""Don't take on so, Betty!" Bob begged gruffly, for he could not bear tosee the girl actually cry. "I'll tell him if you are afraid to.""Don't you dare!" she flared out at him. "I'm not afraid. Only I dread it.It was the nicest present he ever gave me and--and I loved it. But I didnot take proper care of it. I realize that now, when it is too late."Bob remained serious of aspect after that. That his mind was engaged withthe problem of Betty's lost trinket was proved by what he said on the wayback to Fairfields:"I suppose you spoke to all the clerks you traded with in those stores,Betty?""Why, yes. All but Ida Bellethorne, Bob.""And Mrs. Staples said she didn't know anything about Betty's locket,"Bobby put in.Of course, this was not so; but Bobby thought she was telling the exacttruth. The two girls really had not explained Betty's loss to Mrs. Staplesat all."The English girl going off so suddenly, and on such a wild-goose chase,looks kind of fishy, you know," drawled Bob."She thinks she is chasing her aunt!" Bobby cried."Maybe.""You don't even know her, Bob," declared Betty haughtily. "You can't judgeher character. I am sure she is honest.""Well," grumbled Bob, "being sure everybody is honest isn't going to getyou that locket back, believe me!""That's horrid, too! Isn't it, Betty?" demanded Bobby."It's sort of, I guess," said Betty, much troubled, "But, oh, Bob! I don'twant to think that poor girl found my locket and ran away with it. No, Idon't want to believe that. And, anyway, it doesn't help me out a mite.I've got to tell Uncle Dick before he notices that I don't display hispretty present any more. Oh, dear!""It's a shame," groaned Bobby, holding her chum's hand tightly."Guess there are worse things than measles in this world," observed Bob,as he stopped the small car under the _porte cochere_ at Fairfields.CHAPTER IXTHE LIVE WIRE OCTETTEIt was not an easy thing to do; but Betty Gordon did it. She confessed thewhole wretched thing to Uncle Dick and was assured of his forgiveness. Butperhaps his serious forgiveness was not the easiest thing for the girl tobear."I am sure, as you say, that you did not mean to be careless," Mr. RichardGordon said gently. It was hard for him to be strict with Betty; but heknew her impulsiveness sometimes led her into a reckless path. "But markyou, Betty: The value of that locket should have, in itself, made youparticularly careful of it.""I--I valued it more because you gave it to me, Uncle Dick," she sobbed."And yet that did not make you particularly careful," the gentlemanreminded her. "The main trouble with you, Betty, is that you have no veryclear appreciation of the value of money.""Oh, Uncle Dick!" and she looked at him with trembling chin and tearswelling into her eyes."And why should you?" he added, laughing more lightly and patting herhand. "You have never been obliged to earn money. Think back to the timeyou were with the Peabodys. The money my lawyer sent you for your own usejust burned holes in your pinafore pockets, didn't it?""I didn't wear pinafores, Uncle Dick," Betty said soberly. "Girls don'tnowadays.""No, I see they don't," he rejoined, smiling broadly again. "But they didin my day. However, in whatever pocket you put that money as you got it,the hole was figuratively burned, wasn't it?""We--ell, it went mostly for food. Mr. Peabody was such a miser!And--and----""And so when you wanted to come away from Bramble Farm you actually had toborrow money," went on Uncle Dick. "Of course, you were fortunate enoughfinally to get the lawyer's check and pay your debts. But the fact remainsthat you seem unable to keep money.""Oh, Uncle Dick!""Now," continued her guardian still soberly, "a miser like Mr. Peabody forinstance is a very unpleasant person. But a spendthrift often does evenmore harm in the world than a miser. I don't want my Betty-girl to be aspendthrift.""Oh, Uncle Dick!""The loss of your pretty locket, my dear, has come because of that traitin your character which ignores a proper appreciation of the value ofmoney and what can be bought with it. Now, I can buy you anotherlocket----""No, no, Uncle Dick! I don't deserve it," she said with her face hiddenagainst his shoulder as she sat in his lap."That is true, my dear. I don't really think you do deserve another--notright at once. And, anyway, we will advertise for the locket in thenewspapers and may recover it in that way. So we will postpone thepurchase of any other piece of jewelry at present."What I have in my mind, however, and have had for some time, is thereorganization of your financial affairs," and now he smiled broadly asshe raised her head to look at him. "I think of putting you on a monthlyallowance of pocket money and asking you to keep a fairly exact account ofyour expenditures. Not an account to show me. I don't want you to feel asthough you were being watched.""What do you mean, Uncle Dick?""I want you to keep account for your own satisfaction. I want you to knowat the end of the month where your money has gone to. It is the besttraining in the world for a girl, as well as a boy, to know just what shehas done with the money that has passed through her hands. And in thiscase I am sure in time that it will give you a just comprehension ofmoney's value."If we do not recover the locket, why, in time, we will look about foranother pretty trinket----""No, Uncle Dick," Betty said seriously. "I loved that locket. I shouldhave been more careful of it. I hope it will be found and returned to me.I do! I do! But I don't want you to give me another.""Why not?" he asked, yet giving her quite an understanding look."I guess you know, Uncle Dick," she sighed. "I don't really deserve it.And it wouldn't be that locket that you gave me for Christmas, you see.""Well, my dear----""Wait, dear Uncle Dick! I want to say something more," said the girl,hugging him tightly again. "If you give me a certain sum of money to spendfor myself every month I am going to save out of it until I have enough tobuy a locket exactly like that one I lost--If it isn't found, I mean.""Ah!""You approve, Uncle Dick?""Most assuredly. That would be following out my suggestion of learning totake care of money in the fullest sense, my dear.""Then," said Betty, bouncing happily on his knee, "that is what I am goingto try to do. But I do hope my locket will be found!"This serious conference was broken up at this point by the arrival of thetelegram Uncle Dick had been expecting from Mountain Camp. Mrs. JonathanCanary had signed it herself and it was to the effect that the youngfriends of Mr. Richard Gordon would be as welcome as that gentlemanhimself.Bob immediately saddled a horse and galloped to the Derbys and the Tuckersto carry the news. Final plans were made for departure the next morningand in spite of a rather threatening change in the weather the party leftFairfields on time and in high spirits for upper New York State.A few flakes of snow had begun fluttering down as the train pulled out ofWashington; and as it raced across the Maryland fields and through thehills which grace that State the snow blew faster and faster and thickerand thicker. But even in midwinter snow storms do not much obstructtraffic so far south, and the gay party from Fairfields had no suspicionthat it was being borne into any peril or trouble. What was a little snowwhich scarcely, at first, caught upon the brown fields?They had engaged two whole sections for the young folks and an extra placefor Uncle Dick. The latter did not interfere at all with the fun andfrolic of his charges. He was--he should have been--used by now to theridiculous antics of the Tucker twins and the overflowing spirits of therest of the octette. Bachelor as he was, Mr. Richard Gordon consideredhimself pretty well acquainted with young folks of their age.The two sections occupied by the eight girls and boys were opposite eachother and they had that end of the car pretty much to themselves. Ofcourse, people sometimes had to go through the aisle--and others besidesthe conductor and the porter; but after running the gauntlet of thatlively troop once the restless passenger usually tried to keep out of the"line of fire."The fun the party had was good-natured sport for the most part. Theirpractical jokes were aimed at each other rather than at their fellowpassengers. But it was a fact that there was very little peace for anervous person in that Pullman coach."We're the live-wire octette, and we are going to let everybody know it,"proclaimed Tommy Tucker vociferously. "Say! there's a chap up at the otherend of the car, sprawled all over his seat--fresh kid, he is. Did younotice him?""I did," replied his twin. "I fell over his foot twice when I went for adrink.""Why didn't you look where you were walking?" grinned Bob Hendersoncraning his neck to see up the aisle and mark the passenger in question."Huh!" grumbled Ted, "he stuck it out for me to tumble over bothtimes--and you know this train is joggling some.""Ill say so," agreed Bob.But Betty had jumped up to look and she said eagerly:"Do you mean the man with the silk handkerchief over his head? He must beasleep, or trying to sleep.""I tell you he is just a fresh kid," said Tommy Tucker. "And I'm going tofix him.""Now, boys, be careful what you do," advised Louise, who occasionallyconsidered it her duty to put on a sober, admonishing air.Tommy, however, started for the nearest exit to the platform of the car.He was gone some time, and when he reappeared he carried in both hands agreat soggy snowball, bigger than the biggest grapefruit."Gee, folks!" he whispered, "it's snowing, and then some! I never saw sucha snow. And the porter says it is likely to get worse the farther north wego. Suppose we should be snowbound?"There was a chorus of cries--of fearful delight on the part of the girls,at least--at this announcement."Never mind," Bob Henderson said, "we have a dining car hitched to thistrain, so we sha'n't starve I guess, if we are snowed up. What are yougoing to do with that snow, Tommy?"The Tucker twin winked prodigiously. "I'm going to take it up the aisleand show it to Mr. Gordon. He doesn't know it's snowing like this," saidthe boy quite soberly."Why, Tommy Tucker!" cried Betty, "of course Uncle Dick knows it issnowing. Can't he see it through the window?"But when she looked herself at the window beside her she was amazed to seethat the pane was masked with wet snow and one could scarcely see throughit at all. Besides, evening was falling fast."I do hope," Teddy remarked, watching his brother start up the aisle, "hetumbles in the right place.""What is he going to do with that snowball?" demanded Louise."I know! I know!" giggled Bobby, in sudden delight. "That man with thesilk hander chief over his head is going to get a shower.""He isn't a man. He's just a fresh kid," declared Ted, but he said itsomewhat anxiously now."Stop him, somebody!" cried Louise. "He'll get into trouble.""If you ask me," drawled Bob Henderson, "I think that somebody else isgoing to get into trouble. I saw that chap stick his foot out and tripTed before.""He did it unknowingly," cried Betty, under her breath. "He's asleep.""If he is he won't be long," whispered Bobby, clutching at Betty andholding her into the seat. "Let Tommy Tucker be. If that fellow tripshim----"The next instant Tommy did trip. Without any doubt the well shod foot ofthe man lolling in the seat slid into the aisle as the boy with thesnowfall approached, and Tommy pitched over it with almost a certainty offalling headlong. Indeed, he would have gone to the floor of the car hadhe not let go of the mass of snow in his hands and clutched at the seatarms."Whoo!" burst out Teddy Tucker in delight. "Now that fresh kid's got his!"For the soft snowball in Tommy's hands landed plump upon thehandkerchief-covered crown of the person sprawling so ungracefully in thePullman seat! The victim uttered a howl audible above the drumming of thecar wheels. And he leaped upright between the seats of his section, beatthe fast-melting snow off his head and face, and displayed the latter tothe young peoples' amazement as that of a very stern looking gentlemanindeed with a bald head and gray side whiskers."Oh, my aunt's cat and all her kittens!" gasped Bob Henderson. "Now Tommyhas done it! See who it is, Ted?"Teddy Tucker was as pale as the snow his brother had brought in fromoutside and which now showered about the victim of the ill-timed jest."Ma--Major Pater! From Salsette! He has an artificial leg, and that's whyit was sticking out in the aisle whenever he nodded off. Oh,Jimminy-beeswax! what's going to become of Tommy?"CHAPTER XBEAUTIFUL SNOWThe girls had heard the boys who attended Salsette Academy mention thatmartinet, Major Pater. Although his infirmity--or injury--precluded hishaving anything to do with the drilling of the pupils of the academy, inthe schoolroom he was the most stern of all the instructors at Salsette."Oh, poor Tommy!" gasped Betty, wringing her hands."Served him right," declared Louise. "He should not have played thattrick. A lame man, too!""Oh, Louise!" exclaimed her sister Bobby, "Tommy didn't know it was anartificial limb he was stumbling over.""And I'm sure I didn't know it was his old peg-leg I tripped on twice,"declared Teddy Tucker in high dudgeon. "What did he want to go to sleepfor, spraddled all over the aisle?"He said this in a very low voice, however; and be kept well behind Bob andthe girls. As for Timothy Derby and Libbie Littell they actually neverheard a word of all this! They sat side by side in one of the sections andread together Spenser's _Faerie Queene_--understanding, it must beconfessed, but an infinitesimal part of that poem.The other passengers near Major Pater, without any doubt, were vastlyamused by his condition. The melting snow cascaded off his head andshoulders, and not a little of it went down his neck. Such a militarylooking and grim-faced man, standing so stiff and upright, seemed all themore ridiculous under these conditions."H-r-r-rrp!" barked Major Pater, glaring at Tommy Tucker as though hiseyes would burn holes right through that boy's jacket.Tommy sprang to attention. He was in citizen's dress, as was the major;but Tommy was sure the martinet knew him."What do you mean, young man, by pouring a bucket of slush over my headand shoulders?" demanded the angry Major."Please, sir, if you'll let me wipe it off----"Tommy had produced his own handkerchief and made a feeble attempt toattack the melting snow on the Major's shoulders."H-r-r-rrp!" barked the Major again, and Tommy translated it as meaning"as you were" and came once more to attention in the middle of the aisle.One could not really help the angry gentleman, if one was kept standing inthat ridiculous position. And the passengers near by were more amused thanbefore by the attitude and appearance of the two engaged in thecontroversy."Are you aware of what you have done?" demanded Major Pater, at last"Humph! Tucker of the Fourth, isn't it?""Ye--ye--yes, sir," gasped Tommy. Then: "One of the Tuckers, sir.""Oh! Ah! Can there be two such awkward Tuckers?" demanded Major Paten"Humph! Is this your father, Tucker?"For by this time Uncle Dick saw what was going on and he approached,smiling it must be confessed, but with a towel secured from the men'slavatory."I am acting in the capacity of guardian for the present, sir," said Mr.Gordon frankly. "This is a ridiculous thing; but I do not think the boyquite intended all that happened."At once he began flicking away the melted snow, and then rubbed MajorPater's bald head dry. All the time he continued to talk to the militaryacademy instructor:"I grant you that it looks very awkward on Tucker's part. But, you see,Mr.--er--?""Ma--Major Pater!" stammered Tommy Tucker."Quite so. Major, of course. Major Pater, you will realize that the boy incoming along the aisle--Er, by the way, Tommy, what were you coming for?""I was coming to you, Mr. Gordon, to show you how fast the snow wasgathering. I--I scraped that ball of it off the step. The porter openedthe door for me just a moment. I say, Mr. Gordon, it's a fierce storm!"Tommy came through this explanation pretty well. Uncle Dick'sunderstanding smile helped him a good bit."Quite so," said Mr. Gordon, and looking at Major Pater again. "Of course,I would never have known it was snowing if you had not undertaken to showme. But you see, Major Pater, your foot was sticking out into the aisle. Isaw it. You have the misfortune to----""Artificial leg, sir," growled Major Pater."Quite so. Well, accidents will happen, you know. There! You are quite dryagain. I don't think you will get much sleep here until the porter makesup the berths. Suppose we go into the smoking compartment and soothe ourminds, Major?""Ah--Humph! Thank you, Mr.--er----?""Mr. Gordon," explained Tommy Tucker still standing as though he hadswallowed a very stiff poker indeed."Ah! Glad to meet you, Mr. Gordon." They shook hands. Then Major Patershot another command at Tommy: "H-r-r-rrp!" (or so it sounded) and the boywith vast relief dropped his stiff military pose.The rest of the "live wire octette"--even Timothy and Libbie--were highlydelighted by the outcome of Tommy's joke. For, if there is fun in such apractical joke as Tommy had tried to carry through, they thought there wasdouble fun in seeing the biter bitten!"Now will you be good?" crowed his brother, Ted. "See what you get forbeing so fresh! Tumbling over his game leg and pitching a wilted snowballat the Major's head. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?""Oh, hush!" grumbled Tommy. "You needn't say anything. He doesn't knowwhich of the Tucker twins it was crowned him with that snowball, and youare just as much in his bad books as I am. Remember that.""Listen to him!" cried Ted, at once feeling abused. "And Major Pater isnear-sighted, too, although he scorns to wear glasses. You've got me intoa mess, too, Tommy Tucker.""There! There!" said Betty Gordon, soothingly. "Never mind. Uncle Dickwill smooth him down. But I do think, boys, that you need not have gotinto trouble at all.""Huh! that's our natural state," observed Teddy. "Boys out of trouble arelike fish out of water. So my dad says. And he ought to know," he grinned."He has twins."Tommy considered, however, that he had got out of a bad box pretty easily."Your Uncle Dick is fine, Betty," he observed. "Think of his getting onthe blind side of Major Pater so easy. But cracky! how that snow didsquash all over him," and he ended with a wicked giggle."One of your instructors, too!" exclaimed Louise. "For shame!""My!" chuckled Bobby, "what we'd like to do to Miss Prettyman atShadyside!""I am afraid Miss Prettyman is no more beloved than Major Pater is.""Never mind, you girls!" interrupted Tommy, with renewed interest in thestorm and trying to peer through the window. "It's a regular blizzard.When the porter opened the door of the vestibule for me to get that snow,I thought he wouldn't get it shut again.""Suppose we get stalled?" questioned Louise, inclined to be the mostthoughtful of the party."Well, suppose we do?" returned Bob. "I tell you we are all right forfood, for the dining car----""Oh, I forgot to tell you," Tommy put in. "The porter let me into asecret. The diner was dropped about thirty miles back. Broken flange ofone wheel and no time, of course, to put on a new wheel.""Goodness!" exclaimed Betty. "I begin to feel hungry already.""Of course, we'll pick up another diner?" asked Libbie, though ratherdoubtfully."We'll hope so!" Bobby cried."If we get through to Tonawanda, yes," said Tommy Tucker. "That's what theporter told me. But we don't get there, if we are on schedule, until eighto'clock.""There! I knew I was perishing of hunger," exclaimed Betty. "It's halfpast four already," she added, looking at her wrist watch."Three and a half hours to dinner time?" wailed Bobby. "Oh!That--is--tough!""That is, if we make the regular time," Bob said thoughtfully. "And rightnow, let me tell you, this train is just about crawling, and that's all.Humph! The soup sure will get cold in that dining car at Tonawanda, if itwaits there to be attached to our train.""Oh! Oh!" cried Bobby. "Don't let's think of it. I had no idea that snowcould be so troublesome.""Beautiful snow!" murmured Betty. "Say, Libbie. Recite that for us, willyou? You know: the poetry about 'Beautiful Snow.' You or Timothy shouldremember it.""Pah!" exclaimed Bobby, grumblingly. "I'll give you the proper version:    "Beautiful snow! If it chokes up this train,     It certainly will give me a pain!""Goodness me, Bobby!" retorted her cousin, Libbie, "your versifyingcertainly gives me a pain."CHAPTER XISTALLED, AND WITHOUT A DOCTORThe rapidity with which the storm had increased and the drifts had filledthe cuts through which the rails were laid was something that none of theparty bound for Mountain Camp had experienced. Unless Uncle Dick beexcepted. As Betty said, Mr. Richard Gordon had been almost everywhere andhad endured the most surprising experiences. That was something thathelped to make him such a splendid guardian."Yes," he agreed, when Betty dragged him down the car aisle to the twosections which he had wisely abandoned entirely to his young charges, "wehad considerable snow up there in the part of Canada where I have beenthis fall. Before I came down for the Christmas holidays there was aboutfour feet of snow on the level in the woods and certain sections of therailroad up there had been entirely abandoned for the winter. Horse sledsand dog sleighs do all the transportation until the spring thaw.""Oh, do you suppose," cried Libbie, big-eyed, "that we may be snowbound atMountain Camp so that we cannot get back until spring?""Not a chance," replied Uncle Dick, laughing heartily. "But it does lookas though we may have to lay by for a night, or perhaps a night and a day,before we can get on to Cliffdale, which is our station.""In a hotel!" cried Betty. "Won't that be fun?""Perhaps not so much fun. Some of these country-town hotels up here in thewoods are run in a more haphazard way than a lumber camp. And what you getto eat will come out of a can in all probability."The boys groaned in unison at this, and even Betty looked woebegone."I wish you wouldn't talk about eating, Uncle Dick. Do you suppose we willcatch up with that dining car?""I do not think we shall. But there is an eating room at the junction weare coming to. We can buy it out. I only hope there will be milk to be hadfor the little folks. There is at least one baby aboard. It's in the nextcar.""But we'll get to this place we're going to by morning, shan't we?" criedBobby, very much excited."We're two hours late already I understand," said Mr. Gordon. "We havelittle to fear, however I fancy if the storm does not hold up they willnot try to push past the junction until morning. We've got to sleep in thecar anyway; and if we are on short rations for a few hours it certainlywill do you boys and girls little harm. At Cliffdale----""Oh, Uncle Dick!" suddenly exclaimed Betty, "that is where Mr. Bolter hassent that beautiful black horse that he bought in England.""Oh, indeed? I heard of that mare. To Cliffdale? I believe there is astockfarm there. It is some distance from my friend Canary's camp,however.""Do you suppose that girl got there?" whispered Bobby to Betty."Even if she did, how disappointed she must be," Betty rejoined. "I amawfully sorry for Ida Bellethorne.""I don't know," said Bobby slowly. "I've been thinking. Suppose she didfind your beautiful locket and--and appropriate it for her own use,"finished Bobby rather primly."You mean steal it," said Betty promptly. "No. I don't think she did. Shedidn't seem to be that sort of person. Do you know, the more I think ofher the more I consider that Mrs. Staples would be capable of doing that.""Oh, Betty! Finding and keeping your locket?"Betty nodded with her lips pursed soberly. "I didn't like that woman," shesaid."Neither did I," cried Bobby, easily influenced by her friend's opinion."I didn't like her a bit.""But, of course, we don't know a thing about it," sighed Betty. "I do notsuppose we should blame either of them, or anybody else. We have noevidence. I guess, Bobby, I am the only one to blame, after all.""Well, don't mind, Betty dear," Bobby said comfortingly. "I believe thelocket will turn up. I told Daddy and he will telephone to the stores oncein a while and see if it has been found. And, of course, we have noparticular reason to think that you dropped it in Mrs. Staples' shop.""None at all," admitted Betty more cheerfully. "So I'll stop worryingright now. But I would like to know where Ida Bellethorne is in thisblizzard.""Girl or horse?" chuckled Bobby."Girl. I fancy that little cockney hostler, or whatever he is, will lookout carefully for the mare. But who is there to care anything about poorIda?"Gradually even Betty and Bobby were convinced that there were severalother matters to worry about that were connected with neither IdaBellethorne the girl nor Ida Bellethorne the horse. The belated trainfinally got to the junction where there was an eating place. But anothertrain had passed, going south, less than an hour before and the lunchcounter had been swept almost bare.Uncle Dick and Major Pater were old travelers, however; and they werefirst out of the train and bought up most of the food in sight. Others ofthe passengers purchased sandwiches and coffee and tea to consume at once.Uncle Dick and the military man swept the shelves of canned milk andfruit, prepared cocoa and other similar drinks, as well as all the loavesof bread in sight, a boiled ham complete, and several yards offrankfurters, or, as the Fairfields folks called them, "wienies.""We know what Mrs. Eustice and Miss Prettyman would say to suchprovender," said Louise when the party, the boys helping, returned withthe spoils of the lunch-room. "How about calories and dietetics, and allthat?""We may be hungry enough before we see a regular meal in a dining-car or ahotel to forget all about such things," Uncle Dick said seriously. "There!We are starting already. And we're pushing straight into a blizzard thatlooks to me as though it would continue all night.""Well, Uncle Dick," Betty said cheerfully, "we can go to bed and sleep andforget it. It will be all over by morning of course."Uncle Dick made no rejoinder to this. They had a jolly lunch, getting hotwater from the porter for their drink. Bob and the Tucker twins prettynearly bought out the candy supply on the train, and the girls feltassured that they were completely safe from starvation as long as thecaramels and marshmallows held out.By nine o'clock, with the train pushing slowly on, the head locomotiveaided by a pusher picked up at the junction, the berths were made up andeverybody in the Pullman coach had retired.Betty, as she lay in her upper berth with Libbie, heard the snow, orsleet, swishing against the side and roof of the car, and the sound lulledher to sleep. She slept like any other healthy girl and knew nothing ofthe night that passed. The lights were still burning when she awoke. Not agleam of daylight came through the narrow ground-glass window at her head.And two other things impressed her unfavorably: The train was standingstill and not a sound penetrated to the car from without.Libbie was sound asleep and Betty crept out of the berth without awakeningthe plump girl. She got into her wrapper and slippers and stole along theaisle to the ladies' room. Nobody as yet seemed to have come from theberths.She could not hear the wind or snow when she got into the dressing room.This convinced her at first that the storm was over. But she dropped oneof the narrow windows at the top to see out, and found that a wall ofhard-pack snow shrouded the window. She tried to break through this driftwith her arm wrapped in a towel. But although she stood on a stool andthrust her arm out to her shoulder, her hand did not reach the open air!"My goodness me!" gasped Betty Gordon. "We're stalled! We're snowbound!What shall we ever do if the snow doesn't melt pretty soon, or they don'tcome and dig us out?"She washed in haste, and having brought her clothes with her, she dressedpromptly. All the time she was considering what was to be done if, as itseemed, the train could not go on.Just as she opened the door of the dressing room excited voices sounded atthe end of the car. The conductor and the porter were talking loudly. Theformer suddenly shouted:"Ladies and gentlemen! is there a doctor in this coach? We want a doctorright away! Day coach ahead! Child taken poison and must have a doctor."A breathless gabble of voices assured him that there was no physician inthe coach. He had already searched the other cars. There was no doctor onthe train."And we're stalled here in this cut for nobody knows how long!" groanedthe conductor. "That woman is crazy in the next car. Her two year oldchild got hold of some kind of poison and swallowed some of it. The childwill die for sure!"Betty was terribly shocked at this speech. She wriggled past the conductorand the troubled porter, and ran into the car ahead. At first glance shespied the little group of mother and children that was the center ofexcitement.CHAPTER XIITHE TUNNELThe baby was screaming, the little boy of four or five looked miserablyunhappy, and the worn and meager-looking mother was plainly frightened outof her wits. She let the baby scream on the seat beside her while she heldthe little girl in her lap.That youngster seemed to be the least disturbed of any of the party. Shewas a pretty child, and robust. She kicked vigorously against being heldalmost upside down by her mother (as though by that means the dose ofpoison could be coaxed out of the child) but she did not cry."The little dear!" cooed Betty, pushing through the ring of otherpassengers. "What has happened to her?""She'll be dead in five minutes," croaked a sour visaged woman who bentover the back of the seat to stare at the crying baby without making aneffort to relieve the mother in any way."What is the poison?" demanded Betty excitedly."It--it's----I don't know what the doctor called it," wailed the poormother. "I had it in my handbag with other drops. Nellie here is alwaysplaying with bottles. She will drink out of bottles, much as I can do orsay."Betty was sniffing--that may not be an elegant expression, but it isexactly what she did--and looking all about on the floor."Something's been spilled here," she said. "It's a funny odor. Seems to meI remember smelling it before.""That's the poison," groaned the woman over the back of the seat. "Her maknocked it out of the young one's hand. Too bad. She's a goner!"This seemed to Betty very dreadful. She darted an angry glance at thewoman. "A regular Mrs. Job's comforter, she is!" thought Betty.But all the time she was looking about the floor of the car for thebottle. Finally she dropped to her knees and scrambled about among theboots of the passengers. She came up like a diver, with an object heldhigh in one hand."Is this it?" she asked."That is the bottle, Miss," sobbed the mother. "My poor little Nellie!Isn't there a doctor, anywhere? They say milk is good for some kinds ofpoison, but I haven't any milk for baby even. That is what makes him cryso. Poor little Nellie!"Betty had been staring at the label on the bottle. Now she smelled hardat the mouth of it She held the bottle before the woman's eyes."Are you sure this is the bottle the child drank out of?" she demanded."Yes, Miss. That is it. Poor little Nellie!""Why! can't you smell?" demanded Betty. "And can't you see? There is noskull and cross-bones on this label. And all that was in the bottle wassweet spirits of niter. I'm sure that won't do your Nellie any lastingharm."The mother was thunderstruck for a moment--and speechless. The gloomywoman looking over the back of the seat drawled:"Then it wasn't poison at all?""No," said Betty. "And I should think among you, you should have found itout!"She was quite scornful of the near-by passengers. The mother let thestruggling little girl slip out of her lap, fortunately feet first ratherthan head first, and grabbed up the screaming baby."Dear me! You naughty little thing, Nellie! You are always scaring me todeath," she said scoldingly. "And if we don't come to some place where Ican buy milk pretty soon and get it warmed, this child will burst hislungs crying."Betty, however, considered that the baby was much too strong and vigorousto be in a starving state as yet. She wondered how the poor women expectedto get milk with the train stalled in the snow. She had in her pocketsome chocolate wafers and she pacified the two older children with theseand then ran back to the sleeping car.She was in season to head off a procession of excited Pullman passengersin all stages of undress starting for the day coach with everything in theline of antidote for poison that could be imagined and which they haddiscovered in their traveling bags."Baby's better. She wasn't poisoned at all," Betty told them. "But thosechildren are going to be awfully hungry before long if we have to stayhere. Do you know we're snowbound, girls?"This last she confided to the three Littell girls."Won't they dig us out?" asked the practical Louise."What a lark!" exclaimed Bobby, clapping her hands."Just think! Buried in the snow! How wonderful!" murmured Libbie."Cheese!" exclaimed Tommy Tucker, overhearing this. "You'll think it'swonderful. The brakeman told me that the drivers were clogged at sixo'clock and the wheels haven't turned since. We're completely buried insnow and it's still snowing. Head engine's an oil-burner and there isplenty of fuel; but there isn't a chance of our being dug out for days.""How brutal you are," giggled Bobby, who could not be frightened by anymisadventure. "How shall we live?""After we eat up the bread and ham we will draw lots and eat up eachother," Bob observed soberly."But those little children can't eat each other," Betty declared withconviction. "Come on Bobby. You're dressed. Let's see what we can do forthat poor mother and the babies."The two girls had to confer with Uncle Dick first of all. He had charge ofthe supplies. Betty knew there was some way of mixing condensed milk withwater and heating the mixture so that it would do very well at apinch--the pinch of hunger!--for a nursing child. Uncle Dick supplied thecanned milk and some other food for the older children, and Betty andBobby carried these into the day coach where the little family had spentsuch an uncomfortable night and were likely to spend a very uncomfortableday as well.For there was no chance of escaping from their present predicament--allthe train crew said so--until plows and shovelers came to dig the trainout of the cut.Of course the conductors and the rest of the crew knew just where theywere. Behind them about three miles was a small hamlet at which the trainhad not been scheduled to stop, and had not stopped. Had the train pulleddown there the situation of the crew and passengers would have been muchbetter. They would not have been stalled in this drifted cut.Cliffdale, to which Uncle Dick and his party were bound, was twenty milesand more ahead. The roadbed was so blocked that it might be several daysbefore the way would be opened to Cliffdale."The roads will be opened by the farmers and teams will get through themountains before the railroad will be dug out," Mr. Gordon told the boys."If we could get back to that station in the rear we might findconveyances that would take us on to Mountain Camp. If I had a pair ofsnowshoes I certainly could make it over the hills myself in a shorttime.""You go ahead, Mr. Gordon," said Tommy Tucker, "and tell 'em we'recoming.""I'll have to dig out of here and get the webs on my feet first," repliedUncle Dick, laughing.His speech put an idea in the head of the ingenious Tommy Tucker. Whilethe girls were attending to the children in the car ahead, the twins andBob and Timothy Derby went through the train to the very end. Theobservation platform was banked with snow, and the snow was packed prettyhard. But there were some tools at hand and the boys set to work with thetwo porters and a brakeman to punch a hole through the snowbank to thesurface.It was great sport, although the quartette from Salsette Academy enjoyedit more than the men did. It was fun for the boys and work for the men,and the latter would have given it up in despair if the younger diggershad not been so eagerly interested in the task.They sloped the tunnel so that it was several yards long before it reachedthe surface. The snow underneath, they tramped hard; they battered theirway through by pressing a good deal of the snow into solid walls on eitherside. When the roof at the end finally fell in on them, they found that itwas still snowing steadily and the wind was pouring great sheets of itinto the cut and heaping it yard upon yard over the roofs of the cars.They could barely see the top of the smokestack of the pusher a few feetaway.That locomotive had been abandoned by its crew when the train was stalled.Keeping the boiler of the head engine hot was sufficient to supply thecars with heat and hot water."Cricky!" cried Bob. "We've found the way out; but I guess even Uncle Dickwouldn't care to start out in this storm, snowshoes or not. Fellows, we'rein a bad fix, just as sure as you live.""All right," said Teddy Tucker. "Let's go back and get something to eatbefore somebody else gets ahead of us. I suppose those girls have givenall the milk to those kids up front, and maybe the ham sandwiches too.""Dear me!" sighed Timothy, "it is like being cast away on a desert island.We are Robinson Crusoes.""And haven't got even a goat!" chuckled Tommy Tucker.CHAPTER XIIIAN ALARMMr. Richard Gordon was not minded to allow the young folks to portion outthe little store of food as they pleased. He and Major Pater, who had nowjoined the party from Fairfields quite as a matter of course, hadconsidered the use of the supplies to the best advantage. There was notmuch else to eat on the train, for even the crew had devoured theirlunches, and most trainmen when obliged to carry food at all are suppliedwith huge tin buckets that hold at least three "square meals.""Though why meals should be 'square' I can't for the life of me see,"Betty observed. "Why not 'round' meals? I am sure we manage to get aroundthem when we eat them.""Quite a philosopheress, aren't you?" joked Bob."These rations are not to be considered with philosophy," complainedBobby. "They are too frugal."In truth, when the bread and meat and crackers and hot drink had beenportioned to those needed food most, the amount each received was nothingto gorge upon."If it stops snowing--or as soon as it does," Bob declared, "we've got toget out and make our way back to that station the brakeman says is onlythree miles away.""Uncle Dick won't let us try it, I am sure," sighed Betty. "How could wewade through such deep snow?""If you had helped dig that tunnel," said Teddy Tucker confidently, "you'dknow that the snow is packed so hard you wouldn't sink in very deep inwalking.""But of course, you girls can't go," Tommy said. "We fellows will have togo for supplies."The girls did not much like this statement. Betty and Bobby at leastconsidered that they were quite as well able to endure the hardships of atramp through the snow as the boys."I'd just like to see that tunnel, and see how hard it is snowingoutside," said Betty privately to her chum."Let's go look," exclaimed Bobby, equally curious.Libbie and Timothy had their heads together over a book. Louise and theboys were engaged socially with some of the other passengers in theircoach. So Betty and Bobby were able to slip away, with their coats andcaps, without being observed.There were two Pullman coaches and but one day coach besides the expressand baggage and mail cars to the train. The passengers in the day coachwere confined to that or to the smoker's end of the baggage car ahead. Theoccupants of the Pullman coaches could roam through both as they pleased;and had the weather been fine it is certain that the young folks fromFairfields would have occupied the observation platform at the rear of thetrain a good part of the daytime.They had been shut in by the storm the afternoon before, and now they weredoubly shut in by the snow. The doors of the vestibules between the carscould not be opened, for the snow was banked up on both sides to theroofs. That tunnel the boys and train hands had made from the rearplatform was the only means of egress for the passengers from thesubmerged train.Betty and Bobby passed through the rear car and out upon the snow-bankedplatform. They saw that several people must have thrust themselves throughthe tunnel since the boys had made it. Probably these explorers hadwished, like the two girls, to discover for themselves just what state theweather was in."Dear me!" gasped Bobby, "dare we poke through that hole? What do youthink, Betty?""The snow is hard packed, just as the boys say. I guess we can risk it,"declared the more daring Betty. "Anyway, I can go anywhere Bob Hendersoncan, my dear. I will not take a back seat for any boy.""Hear! Hear!" chuckled Bobby. "Isn't that what they cry at politicalmeetings? You have made a good speech, Bettykins. Now go ahead and do it.""Go ahead and do what?""Lead the way through that chimney. My! I believe it has stopped snowingand the boys don't know it.""Come on then and make sure," Betty cried, and began to scramble up thesloping tunnel on hands and knees.Both girls were warmly dressed, booted, and mittened. A little snow wouldnot hurt them--not even a great deal of snow. And that a great deal hadfallen and blown into this railroad cut, Betty and Bobby soon realizedwhen they had scrambled out through what the latter had called "thechimney."Only a few big flakes drifted in the air, which was keen and biting. Butthe wind had ceased--at least, it did not blow here in the cut between thehills--and it seemed only an ordinary winter day to the two girls from theother side of the Potomac.Forward they saw a thin stream of smoke rising into the air from the stackof the front locomotive. The fires in the pusher were banked. It was notan oil-burner, nor was it anywhere near as large a locomotive as the onethat pulled the train.Rearward they could scarcely mark the roadbed, so drifted over was it.Fences and other landmarks were completely buried. The bending telegraphpoles, weighted by the pull of snow-laden wires, was all that marked theright of way through the glen."What a sight!" gasped Betty. "Oh, Bobby! did you ever see anything soglorious?""I never saw so much snow, if that is what you mean," admitted theVirginia girl. "And I am not sure that I really approve of it."But Bobby laughed. She had to admit it was a great sight. It was nowmid-afternoon and all they could see of the sun was a round, hazy ballbehind the misty clouds, well down toward the western horizon which theycould see through the mouth of this cut, or valley between the hills. Atfirst they beheld not a moving object on the white waste."It is almost solemn," pursued Betty, who possessed a keen delight in allmanifestations of nature."It looks mighty solemn, I admit," agreed Bobby. "Especially when youremember that anything to eat is three miles away and the drifts arenobody knows how many feet deep."Betty laughed. She was about to say something cheerful in reply when asudden sound smote upon their ears--a sound that startled the two girls.Somewhere from over the verge of the high bank of the cut on their lefthand sounded a long-drawn and perfectly blood-curdling howl!"For goodness' sake!" gasped Bobby, grabbing her friend by the arm. "Whatsort of creature is that? Hear it?""Of course I hear it," replied Betty, rather sharply. "Do you think I amdeaf?"Only a very deaf person could have missed hearing that mournful howl. Itdrew nearer."Is it a dog?" asked Bobby, almost in a whisper, as for a third time thehowl sounded."A dog barks, doesn't it? That doesn't sound like a dog, Bobby," saidBetty. "I heard one out West. I do believe it is one!""One what?" cried Bobby, almost shaking her in alarm and impatience."A wolf. It sounds just like a wolf. Oh, Bobby! suppose there should be apack of wolves in these hills and that they should attack this train?""Wolves!" shrieked Bobby. "_Wolves_! Then me for in-doors! I am not goingto stay here and be eaten up by wolves."As she turned to dive into the tunnel there was a sharper and more eageryelp, and a shaggy animal came to the edge of the bluff to their left and,without stopping an instant, plunged down through the drifts toward thetwo girls where they stood on the hard-packed snow at the mouth of thetunnel."It is a wolf!" wailed Bobby, and immediately disappeared, head first,down the hole in the snow drift.CHAPTER XIVTHE MOUNTAIN HUTIf Bobby had not gone first and had not stuck half way down the hole withher feet kicking madly just at the mouth of the tunnel, without doubtBetty Gordon would have been driven by her own fears back into the Pullmancoach.That shaggy beast diving from the top of the embankment, plunging, yelpingand whining, through the softer drifts of snow, frightened Betty just asmuch as it had Bobby Littell. The latter had got away with a flying start,however, and her writhing body plugged the only means of escape. So Bettyreally had to face the approaching terror."Oh! Oh!" cried Betty, turning from the approaching beast in despair."Hurry! Hurry, Bobby Littell! Do you want me to be eaten up?"But Bobby had somehow cramped herself in the winding passage through thesnow, and her voice was muffled as she too cried for help.However, Bobby's demands for assistance were much more likely to bring itthan the cries of the girl outside. The porter heard Bobby first, andwhen he opened the door of the coach several men who were near heard thegirl."Help! Help! A wolf is eating her!" shrieked the frightened Bobby."Ma soul an' body! He must be a-chawin' her legs off!" cried the darkeyand he seized Bobby by the wrists, threw himself backward, and the girlcame out of the tunnel like an aggravating cork out of a bottle."What's this?" demanded Mr. Richard Gordon, who happened to be coming backto the end of the train to look for his niece and her chum."Oh, Mr. Gordon!" sputtered Bobby, scrambling up, "it's got her! A wolf!It's got Betty!""A wolf?" repeated Uncle Dick. "I didn't know there were any wolves leftin this part of the country."Major Pater was with him. Mr. Gordon grabbed the latter's walking stickand went up that tunnel a good deal quicker than Bobby had come down it.And when he got to the surface he found his niece, laughing and crying atonce, and almost smothered by the joyful embraces of a big Newfoundlanddog!"A wolf indeed!" cried Mr. Gordon, but beating off the animalgood-naturedly. "He must be a friend of yours, Betty.""Oh, dear me, he did scare us so!" Betty rejoined, getting up out of thedrift, trying to brush off her coat, and petting the exuberant dog at thesame time. "But it is a dear--and its master must be somewhere about,don't you think, Uncle Dick?"Its master was, for the next moment he appeared at the top of the bankdown which the "wolf" had wallowed. He hailed Uncle Dick and Betty with agreat, jovial shout and plunged down the slope himself. He was a young manon snowshoes, and he proved to be a telegraph operator at that stationthree miles south."Wires are so clogged we can't get messages through. But we knew thatNumber Forty was stalled about here. Going to be a job to dig her out.I've got a message for the conductor," he said when he reached the top ofthe drift that was heaped over the train."Wasn't it a hard task to get here?" Mr. Gordon asked."Not so bad. My folks live right over the ridge there, about half a mileaway. I just came from the house with the dog. Down, Nero! Behaveyourself!""We are going to be hungry here pretty soon," suggested Mr. Gordon."There will be a pung come up from the station with grub enough beforenight. Furnished by the company. That is what I have come to see theconductor about.""I tell you what," said Betty's uncle, who was nothing if not quick inthinking. "My party were bound for Cliffdale.""That's not very far away. But I doubt if the train gets there this week.""Bad outlook for us. We are going to Mountain Camp--Mr. Canary's place.""I know that place," said the telegraph operator. "There is an easy roadto it from our farm through the hills. Get there quicker than you can bythe way of Cliffdale. I believe my father could drive you up thereto-morrow.""In a sleigh?" cried Betty delightedly. "What fun!""In a pung. With four of our horses. They'd break the road all right.Ought to start right early in the morning, though.""Do you suppose you could get us over to your house to-night?" asked Mr.Gordon quickly. "There are a good many of us----""How many in the party?" asked the young man. "My name's Jaroth--FredJaroth."Mr. Gordon handed him his card and said:"There are four girls, four boys, and myself. Quite a party.""That is all right, Mr. Gordon," said Fred Jaroth cheerfully. "We oftenput up thirty people in the summer. We've a great ranch of a house. And Ican help you up the bank yonder and beat you a path through the woods tothe main road. Nothing simpler. Your trunks will get to Cliffdale sometimeand you can carry your hand baggage.""Not many trunks, thank goodness," replied Mr. Gordon. "What do you think,Betty? Does it sound good?""Heavenly!" declared his niece.Just then a brakeman came up through the tunnel to find out if the wolfhad eaten both the gentleman and his niece, and the telegraph operatorwent down, feet first, to find the conductor and deliver his message."Then the idea of going on to Mountain Camp by sledge suits you, does it,young lady?" asked Mr. Gordon of Betty."They will all be delighted. You know they will, Uncle. What sport!"The suggestion of the telegraph operator did seem quite inspired. Mr.Gordon and Betty reentered the train to impart the decision to the others,and, as Betty had claimed, her young friends were both excited anddelighted by the prospect.In half an hour the party was off, Betty and her friends bundled up andcarrying their bags while Mr. Gordon followed and Fred Jaroth led the wayon his snowshoes and carrying two suitcases. He said they helped balancehim and made the track through the snow firmer. As for Nero, he cavortedlike a wild dog, and that, Bobby said, proved he was a wolf!Once at the top of the bank they found it rather easy following Jaroththrough the woods. And when they reached the road--or the place where thehighway would have been if the snow had not drifted over fences andall--they met the party from the station bringing up food and othercomforts for the snowbound passengers. As the snow had really stoppedfalling it was expected that the plow would be along sometime the next dayand then the train would be pulled back to the junction."But if this man has a roomy sled and good horses we shall not be cheatedout of our visit to Mountain Camp," Mr. Gordon said cheerfully.The old farmhouse when they reached it certainly looked big enough toaccommodate them all. There was a wing thrown out on either side; butthose wings were for use only in the summer. There were beds enough and tospare in the main part of the house.When they sat down to Mrs. Jaroth's supper table Bob declared that quiteevidently famine had not reached this retired spot. The platters wereheaped with fried ham and fried eggs and sausages and other staplearticles. These and the hot biscuit disappeared like snow before a hot sunin April.Altogether it was a joyous evening that they spent at the Jaroth house.Yet as Betty and Bobby cuddled up together in the bed which they shared,Betty expressed a certain fear which had been bothering her for some time."I wonder where she is, Bobby?" Betty said thoughtfully."Where who is?" demanded her chum sleepily."That girl. Ida Bellethorne. If she came up here on a wild goose chaseafter her aunt, and found only a horse, what will become of her?""I haven't the least idea," confessed Bobby."Did she return before this blizzard set in, or is she still up here inthe woods? And what will become of her?""Gracious!" exclaimed the sleepy Bobby, "let's go to sleep and think aboutIda Bellethorne to-morrow.""And I wonder if it is possible that she can know anything about mylocket," was another murmured question of Betty's. But Bobby had gone fastasleep then and did not answer.Under the radiance of the big oil lamp hanging above the kitchen table,the table itself covered with an old-fashioned red and white checkedcloth, the young folks bound for Mountain Camp ate breakfast. And such abreakfast!Buckwheat cakes, each as big as the plate itself with "oodles of butterand real maple syrup," to quote Bob."We don't even get as good as this at Salsette," said Tommy Tucker grimly."Oh, cracky!""I want to know!" gibed his twin, borrowing a phrase he had heard NewEngland Libbie use on one occasion. "If Major Pater could see us now!"Libbie and Timothy forgot to quote poetry. The fact was, as Bobby pointedout, buckwheat cakes like those were poems in themselves."And when one's mouth is full of such poems, mere printed verses lackvalue."Romantic as she was, Libbie admitted the truth of her cousin's remark.A chime of bells at the door hastened the completion of the meal. The boysmight have sat there longer and, like boa-constrictors, gorged themselvesinto lethargy.However, adventure was ahead and the sound of the sledge bells excited theyoung people. They got on their coats and caps and furs and mittens andtrooped out to the "pung," as the elder Jaroth called the low, deep,straw-filled sledge to which he had attached four strong farm horses.There were no seats. It would be much more comfortable sitting in thestraw, and much warmer. For although the storm had entirely passed thecold was intense. It nipped every exposed feature, and their breath hunglike hoar-frost before them when they laughed and talked.During the night something had been done to break out the road. Mr.Jaroth's horses managed to trample the drifts into something like a hubblypath for the broad sled-runners to slip oven They went on, almost alwaysmounting a grade, for four hours before they came to a human habitation.The driver pointed his whipstock to a black speck before them and higherup the hill which was sharply defined against the background of purewhite."Bill Kedders' hut," he said to Mr. Gordon. "'Tain't likely he's therethis time o' year. Usually he and his wife go to Cliffdale to spend thewinter with their married daughter.""Just the same," cried Bob suddenly, "there's smoke coming out of thatchimney. Don't you see it, Uncle Dick?""The boy's right!" ejaculated Jaroth, with sudden anxiety. "It can't bethat Bill and his woman were caught by this blizzard. He's as knowingabout weather signs as an old bear, Bill is. And you can bet every bear inthese woods is holed up till spring."He even urged the plodding horses to a faster pace. The hut, buried in thesnow to a point far above its eaves, was built against a steep hillsideat the edge of the wood, with the drifted road passing directly before itsdoor. When the pung drew up before it and the horses stopped with a suddenshower of tinkling bell-notes, Mr. Jaroth shouted:"Hey, Bill! Hey, Bill Kedders!"There was no direct reply to this hail. But as they listened for a replythere was not one of the party that did not distinguish quite clearly thesound of weeping from inside the mountain hut.CHAPTER XVTHE LOST GIRL"That ain't Bill!" exclaimed Jaroth. "That's as sure as you're a foothigh. Nor yet it ain't his wife. If either one of them has cried sincethey were put into short clothes I miss my guess. Huh!"He hesitated, standing in the snow half way between the pung and thesnow-smothered door of the hut. Sheltered as it had been by the hill andby the woods, the hut was not masked so much by the drifted snow on itsfront. They could see the upper part of the door-casing."By gravy!" ejaculated Mr. Jaroth, "it don't sound human. I can't make itout. Funny things they say happen up here in these woods. I wouldn't be amite surprised if that crying--or----"He hesitated while the boys and girls, and even Mr. Gordon, staredamazedly at him."Who do you think it is?" asked Uncle Dick finally."Well, it ain't Bill," grumbled Jaroth.The sobbing continued. So engaged was the person weeping in the sorrowthat convulsed him, or her, that the jingling of the bells as the horsesshook their heads or the voices of those in the pung did not attractattention.Jaroth stood in the snow and neither advanced nor retreated. It really didseem as though he was afraid to approach nearer to the hut on themountain-side!"That is a girl or a woman in there," Bob declared."Huh!" exclaimed Bobby sharply. "It might be a boy. Boys cry sometimes.""Really?" said Timothy. "But you never read of crying boys except inhumorous verses. They are not supposed to cry.""Well," said Betty, suddenly hopping out of the sleigh, "we'll never findout whether it is a girl or a boy if we wait for Mr. Jaroth, it seems."She started for the door of the hut. Bob hopped out after her in a hurry.And he took with him the snow-shovel Jaroth had brought along to use inclearing the drifts away if they chanced to get stuck."You'd better look out," said Jaroth, still standing undecided in thesnow."For what?" asked Bob, hurrying to get before Betty."That crying don't sound natural. Might he a ha'nt. Can't tell.""Fancy!" whispered Betty in glee. "A great big man like him afraid of aghost--and there isn't such a thing!""Don't need to be if he is afraid of it," returned Bob in the same lowtone. "You can be afraid of any fancy if you want to. It doesn't need toexist. I guess most fears are of things that don't really exist Come on,now. Let me shovel this drift away."He set to work vigorously on the snow heap before the door. Mr. Gordon,seeing that everything possible was being done, let the young people goahead without interference. In two minutes they could see the frozenlatch-string that was hanging out. Whoever was in the hut had not takenthe precaution to pull in the leather thong."Go ahead, Betty," said Bob finally. "You push open the door. I'll standhere ready to beat 'em down with the shovel if they start after you.""Guess you think it isn't a girl, then," chuckled Betty, as she pulled thestring and heard the bar inside click as it was drawn out of the slot.With the shovel Bob pushed the door inward. The cabin would have beenquite dark had it not been for a little fire crackling on the hearth. Overthis a figure stooped--huddled, it seemed, for warmth. The room was almostbare."Why, you poor thing!" Betty cried, running into the hut. "Are you hereall alone?"She had seen instantly that it was a girl. And evidently the stranger wasin much misery. But at Betty's cry she started up from the hearth andwhirled about in both fear and surprise.Her hair was disarranged, and there was a great deal of it. Her face wasswollen with weeping, and she was all but blinded by her tears. At Betty'ssympathetic tone and words she burst out crying again. Betty gathered herright into her arms--or, as much of her as she could enfold, for the othergirl was bigger than Betty in every way."You?" gasped the crying girl. "How--how did you come up here? And in allthis snow? Oh, this is a wilderness--a wilderness! How do people ever livehere, even in the summer? It is dreadful--dreadful! And I thought I shouldfreeze.""Ida Bellethorne!" gasped Betty. "Who would ever have expected to find youhere?""I know I haven't any more business here than I have in the moon," saidthe English girl. "I--I wish I'd never left Mrs. Staples.""Mrs. Staples told us you had come up this way," Betty said.Immediately the other girl jerked away from her, threw back her damp hair,and stared, startled, at Betty."Then you--you found out? You know----""My poor girl!" interrupted Betty, quite misunderstanding Ida's look, "Iknow all about your coming up here to find your aunt. And that wasfoolish, for the notice you saw in the paper was about Mr. Bolter's blackmare.""Mr. Bolter's mare?" repeated Ida."Now, tell me!" urged the excited Betty. "Didn't you come to Cliffdale tolook for your aunt?""Yes. That I did. But she isn't up here at all."By this time Uncle Dick and the others were gathered about the door of thehut. Jaroth, with a glance now and then at his horses, had even steppedinside."By gravy!" ejaculated the man, "this here's a pretty to-do. What you beendoing to Bill Kedders' chattels, girl?""I--I burned them. I had to, to keep warm," answered Ida Bellethornehaltingly. "I burned the table and the chairs and the boxes and thenpulled down the berths and burned them. If you hadn't come I don't knowwhat I should have done for a fire.""By gravy! Burned down the shack itself to keep you warm, I reckon!"chuckled Jaroth. "Well, we'd better take this girl along with us, hadn'twe, Mr. Gordon? She'll set fire to the timber next, if we don't, aftershe's used up the shack.""We most surely will take her along to Mountain Camp," declared Betty'suncle. "But what puzzles me, is how she ever got here to this, lonelyplace.""I was trying to find the Candace Farm," choked Ida Bellethorne."I want to know!" said Jaroth. "That's the stockfarm where they pasture somany sportin' hosses. Candace, he makes a good thing out of it. But it'seight miles from here and not in the direction we're going, Mr. Gordon.""We will take her along to Mountain Camp," said Uncle Dick. "One more willnot scare Mrs. Canary, I am sure."Ida brought a good-sized suitcase out of the hut with her. She hadevidently tried to walk from Cliffdale to the stockfarm, carrying thatweight. The girls were buzzing over the appearance of the stranger and theboys stared."Oh, Betty!" whispered Bobby Littell, "is she Ida Bellethorne?""One of them," rejoined Betty promptly."Then do you suppose she has your locket?" ventured Bobby.To tell the truth, Betty had not once thought of that!CHAPTER XVITHE CAMP ON THE OVERLOOKMountain Camp was rightly named, for it was built on the side of onemountain and was facing another. Between the two eminences was a lake atleast five miles long and almost as broad. The wind had blown so hardduring the blizzard that the snow had not piled upon the ice at all,although it was heaped man-high along the edges. The pool of blue icestretched away from before Mountain Camp like a huge sheet of plate glass.The two storied, rambling house, built of rough logs on the outside, stoodon a plateau called the Overlook forty feet above the surface of the lake.Indeed the spot did overlook the whole high valley.The hills sloped down from this height in easy descents to the plains.Woods masked every topographical contour of the surrounding country. Suchwoods as Betty Gordon and her friends had never seen before."Virginia forests are not like this," confessed Louise Littell. "The pinesare never so tall and there is not so much hardwood. Dear me! see thatdead pine across the lake. It almost seems to touch the sky, it is sotall."This talk took place the next morning when they had all rested and, likeall healthy young things, were eager for adventure. They had been welcomedby Mr. and Mrs. Canary in a way that put the most bashful at ease.Even Ida Bellethorne had soon recovered from that sense of strangenessthat had at first overpowered her. The girls had been able to help her outa little in the matter of dress. She appeared at the dinner table quite asone of themselves. Betty would not hear of Ida's withdrawing from thegeneral company, and for a particular reason.In truth, Betty felt a little condemned. She had considered a suspicion ofIda's honesty, and afterward she knew it could not be so! The English girlhad no appearance of a dishonest person. Betty saw that Uncle Dick wasfavorably disposed toward Ida. If he did not consider her all right hesurely would not have introduced her to Mr. and Mrs. Canary as one of hisparty.Nor did Uncle Dick allow Ida to tell her story the evening they arrived atthe camp on the Overlook. "To-morrow will do for that," he had said.At breakfast time there were so many plans for exciting adventurediscussed that Betty surely would have forgotten all about IdaBellethorne's expected explanation had it not been for the lost locket.The possibility that Ida knew something about it had so impressed Bettythat nothing else held her interest for long.Every one had brought skates from Fairfields, and the great expanse ofblue ice--no ice is so blue as that of a mountain lake--was unmarked.Naturally skating was the very first pleasure that beckoned."Oh, I'm just crazy to get on skates!" cried Bobby."I think I'll be glad to do some skating myself," came from Libbie, whohad been reading a book even before breakfast."What do you say to a race on skates?" came from Tommy Tucker."I think we had better get used to skating up here before we talk about arace," said Bob. "This ice looks tremendously hard and slippery. You won'tbe able to do much on your skates unless they are extra sharp.""Oh, I had 'em sharpened.""Don't forget to wrap up well," admonished Mrs. Canary. "Sometimes it getspretty cold and windy.""Not to say anything about its being cold already," answered Bobby. "My,but the wind goes right through a person up here!"While the other seven ran off for skates and wraps, Betty nodded to UncleDick and then, tucking her arm through that of Ida Bellethorne, urged herto follow Mr. Gordon from the breakfast room to a little study, or "den,"that was possibly Mr. Canary's own."Now, girls," said Uncle Dick in his quiet, pleasant way and smiling withequal kindness upon his niece and the English girl, "let us getcomfortable and open our hearts to each other. I think you know, Ida, thatBetty and I are immensely interested in your story and we are hungry forthe details. But not altogether out of mere curiosity. We hope to give youaid in some way to make your situation better. Understand?""Oh, Mr. Gordon, I quite understand that," said the English girl seriouslyand without smiling. "I never saw such friendly people as you are. And youboth strangers to me! If I were at home I couldn't find better friends, Iam sure.""That's fine!" declared Uncle Dick. "It is exactly the way I want you tofeel. Betty and I are interested. Now suppose you sit down and tell us allabout it.""Where shall I begin?" murmured the girl thoughtfully, hesitating."If I were you," returned Uncle Dick, with a smile, "I would begin at thebeginning.""Oh, but that's so very far back!""Never mind that. One of the most foolish mistakes which I see ineducational methods is to give the children lessons in modern historywithout any reference to ancient history which comes to them in highergrades. Ancient history should be gone into first. Suppose, Ida, you beginwith ancient history.""Before Ida Bellethorne was born, do you mean?" asked the English girldoubtfully."Which Ida Bellethorne do you mean?" asked Mr. Gordon, while Betty stared."I was thinking of my beautiful black mare. The darling! She is sevenyears old now, Mr. Gordon; but I think that in those seven years enoughhas happened to me to make me feel three times seven years old.""Go ahead, Ida," said the gentleman cheerfully. "Tell it in your own way."Thus encouraged, the girl began, and she did tell it in her own way. Butit was not a brief way, and both Mr. Gordon and Betty asked questions andthat, too, increased the difficulty of Ida's telling her story.She had been the only living child of Gwynne Bellethorne, who had been ahorse breeder and sometimes a turfman in one of the lower Englishcounties. She had been motherless since her third birthday. Her onlyliving relative was her father's sister, likewise Ida Bellethorne, who hadbeen estranged from her brother for several years and had made her ownway on the continent and later in America on the concert stage.Ida, the present Ida, remembered seeing her aunt but once. She had come toBellethorne Park the very week the black mare was foaled. When they allwent out to see the little, awkward, kicking colt in the big box stall,separated from its whinnying mother by a strong barred fence, the owner ofthe stables had laughingly named the filly after his sister."But," Ida told them, "father told Aunt Ida that the filly was to be myproperty. He had, I think, suffered many losses even then. He made a billof sale, or something, making the filly over to me; but I was a minor, andafter father died my guardian had that bill of sale. He showed it to meonce. I don't see how Mr. Bolter could have bought my lovely mare when Igot none of the money for her."This was not, however, sticking to the main thread of the story. Ida knewthat although her aunt had come to the Park in amity, there was a quarrelbetween her father and aunt before the haughty and beautiful concertsinger went away, never more to appear at Bellethorne, not even to attendher brother's funeral.Before that sad happening the mare, Ida Bellethorne, had come to fullgrowth and as a three-year-old had made an astonishing record on theEnglish race tracks. The year Mr. Bellethorne died he had planned to shipher to France for the Grand Prix. Her name was in the mouths of everysportsman in England and her fame had spread to the United States.The death of her father had signaled the breaking up of her home and thesevering of all home ties for Ida. Like many men of his class, Mr.Bellethorne had had no close friends. At least, no honorable friends. Theman he had chosen as the administrator of his wrecked estate and theguardian of his unfortunate daughter, Ida felt sure had been dishonorable.There seemed nothing left for Ida when the estate was "settled." One dayIda Bellethorne, the mare, had disappeared, and Ida the girl could learnnothing about her or what had been done with her. At that she had run awayfrom her guardian, had made her way to Liverpool, had taken service withan American family sailing for the United States, and so had reached NewYork."I found a letter addressed to Aunt Ida after my father died," explainedthe girl, choking back a sob. "On the envelope in pencil father hadwritten to me to find Aunt Ida and give it to her. He hoped she wouldforgive him and take some interest in me. I've got that letter safe inhere." She touched the belt that held her blouse down so snugly. "I hopeI'll find Aunt Ida and be able to give her the letter. I remember her as amost beautiful, tall woman. I loved her on sight. But, I don't know----""Cheer up!" exclaimed Mr. Gordon, beamingly. "We'll find her. I take itupon myself to say that Betty and I will find her for you. Sha'n't we,Betty?""Indeed we will. If she is singing in this country of course it will becomparatively easy to find her.""Do you think so?" asked Ida Bellethorne doubtfully. "I have not found itso, and I have been searching for her for three months now. This is such abig country! I never imagined it so big until I began to look for AuntIda. It seems like looking for a needle in a haystack."CHAPTER XVIIOFF ON SNOWSHOESMr. Gordon encouraged the English girl at this point in her story byassuring her that he would, before returning to Canada, put the matter inthe hands of his lawyers and have the search for the elder Ida Bellethorneconducted in a more businesslike way."How did you expect to find your aunt," he asked, "when you first landedin New York?""I knew of a musical journal published there which I believed kept trackof people who sang. I went to that office. The last they knew of my auntshe was booked to sing at a concert in Washington," Ida said sadly. "Thedate was the very day I called at the office. I hurried to buy a ticket toWashington. But the distance was so great that when my train got intoWashington the concert was over and I could do nothing more until the nextday.""And then?" asked Uncle Dick."She had gone again. All the company had gone and I could find nobody whoknew anything about her. I--I didn't have much money left," confessed thegirl. "And things do cost so much here in your country. I was frightened.I walked about to find a cheap lodging and reached that street inGeorgetown where Mrs. Staples has her shop.""I see," commented Uncle Dick."So I asked Mrs. Staples. She was English too, and she offered me lodgingsand a chance to serve in her shop. I took it. What else could I do?""You are a plucky girl, I must say. Don't you think so. Betty?" said UncleDick."I think she is quite wonderful!" cried his niece. "And think of hermaking those blouses so beautifully! You know, Ida, Bobby bought the blueone of Mrs. Staples.""I am glad, if you like them," said the other girl, blushing faintly. "Ihad hard work to persuade Mrs. Staples to pay for that one on the chanceof your coming back for it.""Well," interposed Uncle Dick, "tell us the rest. You thought you heard ofyour Aunt Ida up here, in the mountains?""Yes, Mr. Gordon," said Ida. "I read it in the paper. But the notice musthave referred to my dear little mare. I never dreamed she had been sentover here. I never dreamed of it!""No?""Of course I didn't! And when I got to Cliffdale there was nobody who hadever heard of my aunt. There are two hotels. One of them is closed atthis time of year. At the other there was no such guest.""Dear me! How disappointed you must have felt," murmured Betty."You can't imagine! But in talking with the clerk at the hotel I got newsof my little darling.""Meaning the mare, of course?" suggested Uncle Dick."Yes. She had arrived the night before and had been taken directly toCandace Farm. The clerk told me how to get there. I did not feel that Icould afford to hire anybody to take me there. And I knew nobody. So I setout to walk day before yesterday morning.""Before it began to snow?" asked Betty."Yes, Miss Gordon.""Oh, please," cried Betty, "call me Betty. I'm not old enough to be MissGordon. To a girl, anyway," she added. "With a strange boy it would bedifferent."The English girl consented, and then went on with her story."It was cloudy but I did not know anything about such storms as you havehere. Oh, dear me, how it snowed and blew! I got to that little house andI could open the door. If I had had to go many yards farther I would havefallen down and been covered by the snow.""You poor dear!" murmured Betty, putting an arm around the other girl.Ida gave her a tearful smile, and Betty kissed her. And then the lattersuddenly remembered again her lost locket. She gave a little jump in herchair. But she did not speak of it.Not for a moment did she believe Ida Bellethorne would be guilty ofstealing her trinket. Uncle Dick evidently did not think of thatpossibility, either. Could Betty suggest such a matter when already Idawas in so much trouble? At least, she would wait and see what came of it.So she hugged Ida more closely and said:"Go on. What else?""Not much else, Betty," said the English girl, wiping her eyes again andsmiling. "I just stayed there in that house until you came along and savedme. There was nothing to burn but the furniture in the house, and I burnedit. I suppose the poor man who owns it will want to be paid. Oh, dear!""I wouldn't worry about that," said Mr. Gordon, cheerfully. "You seem tohave come through a good deal. I'd take it easy now. Mrs. Canary and thegirls are glad to have you here. When we go back to town we will take youwith us and see what can be done.""Thank you, Mr. Gordon. You are very kind. I should like to know about mylittle mare. She is a darling! How this Mr. Bolter came to get her----""Oh, Ida!" cried Betty, breaking in suddenly, "do you know a little man, acrooked little man, named Hunchie Slattery?""My goodness, Betty! Of course I remember Hunchie. He worked in ourstables.""He is with Ida Bellethorne, your pretty mare. He takes care of her. Italked with him at Mr. Bolter's farm in Virginia. The mare has a cough,and she was sent up here to get well. And I heard Mr. Bolter himself tellHunchie Slattery that he was to go with her.""Dear me, Betty! if I could find Hunchie, too, I'd feel better. He mightbe able to tell me how it came that my mare was taken away and sold. Shereally did belong to me, Mr. Gordon. Mr. Jackwood, father's administratorand my guardian, showed me the bill of sale making me Ida's owner. Andeven if I was a minor, wouldn't that be a legal transfer paper?""I am not sure of the English law, my dear. But it seems to me it would bein this country. At any rate, that will be another thing to consult mylawyers about. I understand Bolter paid somewhere near twenty thousanddollars for the mare. It would be quite a fortune for you, Ida.""Indeed it would. And the mare is worth all of four thousand pounds, Iknow. Father always said there was no better mare in all England than IdaBellethorne, and Aunt Ida might be proud to have such a horse named afterher.""We are not far from the Candace Farm and perhaps we can get over therebefore we leave Mountain Camp," Mr. Gordon said kindly. "Then you can seeyour horse and the man from home. I will get a statement from this jockey,or hostler, or whatever he is, and it may aid my lawyers in their searchfor the facts regarding the sale of the mare to Mr. Bolter.""Thank you very kindly, Mr. Gordon."The conference broke up and Betty ran out to join her mates on the lake.Ida could not skate. And, anyway, she preferred to sit indoors with Mrs.Canary. Ida had the silk for another sweater in her bag, and that veryhour she began to knit an over-blouse for Libbie, who had expressed adesire to possess one like those Betty and Bobby had bought.The skating was fine, but the wind had risen again and this time it was awarm wind. The snow grew soft on the surface, and when the party came upthe bluff for luncheon it was not easy to walk and they sank deeply intothe snow."This is a weather breeder," said Mr. Canary, standing on the porch togreet them. "I fear you young folks have come to Mountain Camp at thebeginning of the roughest part of the winter.""Don't apologize for your weather, Jack," laughed Uncle Dick. "If it growstoo boisterous or unpleasant outside, these young people must find theirfun indoors."And this is what they did for the next two days. The temperature moderateda good deal, and then it rained. Not a hard downpour, but a drifting"Scotch mist" that settled the snowdrifts and finally left them saturatedwith water.Then back came the frost--sharp, snappy and robust. The air cleared likemagic. The sun shone out of a perfectly clear sky. Just to put one's headout of the door make the blood tingle.Meanwhile both the girls and boys had found plenty of interesting thingsto do indoors, as Uncle Dick had prophesied. Especially the boys. Underthe teaching of Uncle Dick and Mr. Canary they had learned to stringsnowshoes. Mr. Canary had the frames and the thongs of which the webs arewoven. Even Timothy neglected the library to engage in this fascinatingwork.Of course, the girls must have webs as well. Betty and Bobby wereparticularly eager to learn to walk on snowshoes and, as Bob Hendersonsaid, they "pestered" the boys until sufficient pairs of webs were made toenable the entire party to try walking on them when the time was ripe.On the third morning, just at dawn, there was a heavy snow squall for anhour. It left about four inches of downy snow upon the hard-packed andslippery surface of the drifts."This is an ideal condition," said Mr. Gordon with enthusiasm. "My feetitch to be off on the webs myself. After breakfast we will try them out.Now remember the rules I have been telling you, and see how well you canall learn to shuffle over this snow."Thoughtful Bob had strung an extra pair of shoes for Ida. He knew thatBetty did not want the English girl left out of their good times. And allthe crowd liked Ida. Although she was in the main a very quiet girl, asone grew to know her she proved to possess charming qualities both of mindand heart.Ida was not as warmly dressed for venturing into the open as the othergirls. But Mrs. Canary, one of the kindest souls in the world, mended thisdefect. She furnished Ida with a fur coat and gloves that secured her fromfrostbite.The whole party turned out gaily. Having been confined to the house foralmost forty-eight hours, they were as full of life as colts. But in a fewminutes the nine of them were on snowshoes and watched and instructed byUncle Dick were learning their first lesson in the rather ticklish art ofscuffling over the soft snow without tripping and plunging headlong intoit.Not that there were not many laughable accidents. The capers both boysand girls involuntarily cut led to shouts of laughter, and sometimes to alittle pain. For the frozen crust underneath the light surface snowoffered a rather hard foundation when one fell flat.The necessary falls incident to learning the right trick of handling one'sself on snowshoes soon cured the first enthusiasm of several of the party.Louise, for instance, found it too strenuous for her liking. And Timothygot a bump on the back of his head that no phrenologist could have easilydescribed.The second day, however, Betty, Bobby and Ida, with Bob and Tommy Tucker,were just as enthusiastic on the subject of snowshoeing as at first. Whilethe others swept off a part of the lake just below the Outlook, thesnowshoeing party set off on their first real hike through the woods; andthat hike led to an unexpected adventure.CHAPTER XVIIIGREAT EXCITEMENTMr. Richard Gordon was, as Betty and Bob often declared, the very bestuncle that ever lived! One good thing about him they thought was that henever "fussed.""He isn't always wondering what you are going to do next and telling younot to," explained Bob to Ida Bellethorne as the party started out fromMountain Camp. "Not like a woman, oh, no!""Hush, bad boy!" cried Bobby. "What do you mean, throwing slurs at women?""You know even if Mrs. Canary had seen us start off she would have givenus a dozen orders before we got out of earshot. And she's a mighty nicewoman, too. Almost as nice as your mother, Bobby," finished Bob."Bob doesn't like chaperons," giggled Betty."Nor me," said Tommy Tucker, sticking close to Bobby Littell as he alwaysdid when Roberta would let him. "Uncle Dick suits me as a chaperon everytime."Uncle Dick had let the party troop away on their snowshoes withoutadvising them when to return or asking where they were going, andpresently Betty and Bob formed a sudden plan about their hike.From one of the men working about the camp Bob had got directionsregarding the nearest way to Candace Farm. Ida longed to go there. It wasbut seven miles away in a direct line, and now, when Betty spoke of goingthere, Bob said that, with the aid of his compass, he knew he could findit without difficulty."We didn't mention it to Uncle Dick, but he won't be bothered about it,"said Bob. "We've got all day. We can tell him where we have been when weget back, which will be just the same.""Will it, Bob?" the girl asked doubtfully. "But of course there is nothingreally wrong in going.""I--should--say--not!" exploded Bob. "I'm sure it will be all right withUncle Dick, Betty. Remember how he let us roam and explore in Oklahoma?"The others in the party were not troubled by doubts in the least. Theywent hurrying through the snow with shouts and laughter; and if any forestanimals were astir that day they must have been frightened by the noisethe party made scrambling along on snowshoes. Not one of them but fell attimes--and the very "twistiest" kind of falls! But nobody was hurt;although at one point Bobby fell flat on her back at the verge of a steepdescent and there was no stopping her until she plunged into a deep driftat the bottom.Tommy kicked off his snowshoes and ran down to haul her out while theothers, seeing that she was unhurt, shouted their glee. Bobby was notoften in a fix that she could not get out of by her own exertions. Beingsuch an energetic and independent girl, she would not often accept help ofher boy friends, especially of Tommy who hovered around her like a motharound a candle.But when she had lost her snowshoes she found the soft snow so much deeperthan she expected at the bottom of that hill that she was glad indeed toaccept Tommy's aid. He dragged her out of the drift and set her upright.Even then she found that she could not climb up again by herself to whereher friends were enjoying her discomfiture."Come on!" cried Tommy, who had kicked his own snowshoes off at the top ofthe slide. "Give us your hand, Bobby. We'll make it somehow."But they did not "make it" easily. It seemed as though they could climbonly so high and then slide back again. Under the shallow top snow thefrozen crust was like pebbled glass. Tommy could barely kick the toes ofhis boots into it to make steps, and just as he had secured a footing in aparticularly slippery place, Bobby would utter a shriek and slide to thebottom again.Even Betty was almost ill with laughter as this occurred over and overagain. But the Tucker twin finally proved himself to be master of thesituation. He was determined to get Bobby to the top of the hill, and hesucceeded.Tom Tucker was a strong lad. Stooping, he commanded the girl to put herarms over his shoulders so that he could seize both wrists with one hand.Then he bent forward, carrying Bobby on his back and her weight upon hisaided in breaking through the snow-crust and getting a footing.He plodded up the slope, a little at a time, and after a while Betty andBob helped them to the level brink of the hill. Tommy fell to the snowpanting, and Bobby was inclined to scold for a minute. Then she gave Tommyone of her rare smiles and helped him up. She was not often so kind tohim."You are a good child, Tommy Tucker," she proclaimed saucily, as she beatthe loose snow off his coat. "In time you may be quite nice."Betty and Ida Bellethorne praised him too; but Bob continued to laugh andwhen the party started on again the others learned why he was so amused.The way to Candace Farm lay right down that slope to the bottom of whichBobby had tumbled, and all the exertion Tommy had put forth to save herwas unnecessary. Bob led them along a lane right past the spot whereTommy had pulled the girl out of the snowbank!"That's the meanest trick that was ever played on me!" declared Bobby, inhigh wrath at first. Then she began to appreciate the joke and laughedwith the others. "I was going to tell the folks at home how Tommy saved mefrom the peril of being buried in the snowbank; but I guess I'd betternot," she observed. "Don't blame me, Tommy. Give it to Bob.""Ill get square with Bob," grumbled the Tucker twin. "No fear of that."Bobby remained kind to him however; and as Tommy frankly admired her hewas repaid for his effort. But every time Bob looked at Tom he burst outlaughing.They had struck into a straight trough in the snow, with maples on eitherside standing gaunt and strong, and a windrow of drifted snow where thefences were supposed to be--a road which Bob said the man at Mountain Camphad told him led straight to Candace Farm."Wish we had brought a sled with us," Tommy said. "We could have riddenthe girls on it. Aren't you tired, Bobby?""Not as tired as you are, I warrant," she said, laughing at him. "PoorTommy!""Aw, you go fish! I could carry you a mile and not feel it. Gee! What'sthis coming?"Far down the snow-covered road they first heard shouts, then a cloud ofsnow-dust spurted into the air and hid whatever it was coming along theway toward them. Bob immediately drew Betty and Ida to one side of theroad and Tommy urged Bobby to follow.Suddenly out of the cloud of flying snow appeared a horse's head andplunging fore feet. Then another and another! They came along the road ata plunging, blundering pace, snorting and neighing. Behind them were men,evidently trying to stop the runaways."Colts!" shouted Bob. "Yearlings. All young horses. And just about wild.Remember that bunch we saw in Oklahoma, Betty, that was being driven tothe shipping station? They are wild as bears."Ida Bellethorne did not seem to be much disturbed by the possibility ofthe horses doing them any harm. She stood out before her companions andstared at the coming herd eagerly. The black mare she loved so, however,was not in this bunch of runaways.The young stock swept past the watching party from Mountain Camp, theirpace rapid in spite of the hard going. They kept to the snow-covered road,however. Behind them came half a dozen men, wind-spent already and not alittle angry."Why didn't you stop 'em?" bawled one red-faced fellow. "If they spreadout in some open pasture we'll be all day gathering them.""Easy to stop 'em, I guess," returned Tommy. "They'd have trampled usdown.""Could stop a snowslide easier, I guess," Bob suggested. "But I tell you:We'll give you a hand collecting them. How did they get away?""Went over the paddock fence like a flock of sheep. Snow is so deep, youknow," said the red-faced man. "Come on, you boys, if you will. The girlscan go on to the house and Mrs. Candace will let 'em warm up. It's only alittle way."The "little way" proved to be a good two miles; but the three girls didnot falter. They saw the big farmhouse and the great barns and snow-filledpaddocks a long way ahead."I'll be glad of that 'warm'," confessed Betty, as they turned in at theentrance to the lane. "And maybe Mrs. Candace will give us a cup of tea."At that moment Bobby clutched her arm and pointed up the lane. "See there!He'll fall! Oh, look!"Betty was as startled as her chum when she spied what Bobby had firstseen. A little, crooked man was crawling out above the hay door of themain barn upon a timber that was here thrust out from the framework and towhich was attached a block and fall. The rope had evidently fouled in theblock and he was trying to detach it."That's Hunchie Slattery!" gasped Betty, "What a chance he is taking!"For everything was sheathed in ice from the effect of the rain and frostof the night before. That timber was as slippery as glass.Ida Bellethorne set off on a run for the barn; but unlike Bobby she didnot say a word. Had she thought of any way to help the crooked little man,however, she was too late. Hunchie suddenly slipped, clutched vainly atthe rope, which gave under his weight, and he came down "on the run."The rope undoubtedly broke his fall. He would have been killed had heplunged immediately to the frozen ground beneath.As it was, when the three girls reached him, he was unconscious and it wasplain by the attitude in which he lay that his leg was broken.CHAPTER XIXTHE EMERGENCY"Poor Hunchie!" murmured Ida Bellethorne, "I hope it wasn't because he wassurprised to see me that he fell.""His surprise did not make that timber slippery with ice," said Betty,looking up. "Oh! Here's a lady!"A comfortable looking woman with a shawl over her head was hurrying fromthe kitchen door of the Candace farmhouse."What has happened to that poor man? He's been battered and kicked aboutso much, it would seem, there ain't much can happen to him that he hasn'talready suffered."Ah! Poor fellow!" she added, stooping over the senseless Hunchie. "What adeal of trouble some folks seem bound to have. And not another man on theplace!"She stood up again and stared at the three girls. Her broad, florid facewas all creased with trouble now, but Betty thought she must ordinarily bea very cheerful woman indeed."They've gone chasing the young stock that broke away. Dear me! what isgoing to happen to this poor fellow? Bill and the rest may be gone forhours, and there's bones broke here, that's sure.""Where's a doctor?" asked Bobby eagerly."Eleven miles away, my dear, if he's an inch. Dr. Pevy is the only man fora broken bone in these woods. Poor Hunchie!""Can't we get him into his bed?" asked Betty. "He'll freeze here.""You're right," replied the woman, who afterward told them she was Mrs.Candace. "Yes, we'll take him into the house and put him into a good bed.Can you girls lift him?"They could and did. And without too much effort the three transported theinjured man, who was but a light weight, across the yard, into the house,and to a room which Mrs. Candace showed them. He began to groan and mutterbefore they managed to get him on the bed.There was an old woman who helped Mrs. Candace in the house, and the tworemoved Hunchie's outer garments and made him as comfortable as possiblewhile the girls waited in much excitement in the sitting room."He saw one of you girls and knows you," said Mrs. Candace, coming out ofthe bedroom. "But he talks about that mare, Ida Bellethorne.""This is Ida Bellethorne," said Betty, pointing to the English girl."I declare! I thought Hunchie was out of his head. How comes you are namedafter that horse, girl?"Ida explained her connection with the black mare and with Hunchie."You'd better go in and talk to him. Maybe it will case his pain. But thatshin bone is sticking right through the flesh of his leg. It's awful! Andhe's in terrible pain. If Bill don't come back soon----""Isn't there any man on the place?" asked Betty, interrupting."None but them with Bill hunting the young stock.""And the boys--our friends--have gone with them," explained Betty."Somebody must get the surgeon.""How are we going to do it? The telephone wires are down," explained Mrs.Candace. "And there ain't a horse properly shod for traveling on this ice.I fear some of that young stock will break their legs.""We saw them skating all over the road," said Bobby. "But how gay andexcited they were!""A ridin' horse would have to go at a foot pace," explained Mrs. Candace,"unless it was sharpened. I don't know----"Ida had gone into the bedroom to speak with the injured man. She lookedout at this juncture and excitedly beckoned to Betty. Betty ran in to findthe crooked little man looking even more crooked and pitiful than everunder the blankets. He was groaning and the perspiration stood on hisforehead. That he was in exceeding pain there could be no doubt."He says Ida Bellethorne is sharpened," gasped Ida."Oh! You mean she is fixed to travel on ice on frozen ground?""I 'ad to lead 'er up 'ere from the station, Miss. Ain't I saw you before,Miss?" said Hunchie, staring at Betty. "At Mr. Bolter's?""Yes, yes!" cried Betty. "Can the mare travel on this hard snow?""Yes, ma'am. I didn't draw the calks for I exercised 'er each d'y, I did.I didn't want 'er to fall. An' now I failed myself!"The two girls looked at each other significantly. Ida was easily led outof the room. Betty put the question to her."That's just it, Betty," said the English girl, almost in tears. "I neverlearned to ride. I never did ride. My nurse was afraid to let me learnwhen I was little, and although I love horses, I only know how to drivethem. It's like a sailor never having learned to swim."Betty beat her hands together in excitement. "Never mind! Never mind!" shecried. "I can ride. I can ride any horse. I am not afraid of your IdaBellethorne. And none of the boys or men is here. I'll go for the doctor.""I don't know if it is best for you to," groaned Ida."Call Mrs. Candace." They were in the kitchen, and Ida ran to summon thefarm woman while Betty got into her coat. Mrs. Candace came, hurrying."What is this I hear?" she demanded. "I couldn't let you ride that horse.You will be thrown or something.""No I shan't, Mrs. Candace. I can ride. And Hunchie says the mare issharpened.""So she is. I had forgotten," the woman admitted thoughtfully."And the poor fellow suffers so. Some lasting harm may be done if we don'tget a surgeon quickly. Where does Dr. Pevy live?" demanded Betty urgently.The fact that the injured hostler was really in great pain and possibly insome danger, caused Mrs. Candace finally to agree to the girl's demand.Betty ran out with Ida to get the mare and saddle her. Betty was notdressed properly for such a venture as this; but she wore warmundergarments, and stout shoes.The black mare was so gentle with all her spirit and fire that Betty didnot feel any fear. She and Ida led the beautiful creature out upon thebarn floor and found saddle and bridle for her. In ten minutes Betty wasastride the mare and Ida led her out of the stable.Mrs. Candace had already given Betty clear directions regarding the way toDr. Pevy's; but she now stood on the door-stone and called repetitions ofthese directions after her.Bobby waved her fur piece and shouted encouragement too. But IdaBellethorne ran into the house to attend the injured Hunchie and did notwatch Betty and the black mare out of sight as the others did.CHAPTER XXBETTY'S RIDEWhen Betty Gordon and her young friends had set out from Mountain Camp ontheir snowshoe hike the sun shone brilliantly and every ice-covered branchand fence-rail sparkled as though bedewed with diamond dust. Now that itwas drawing toward noon the sky was overcast again and the wind, had Bettystopped to listen to it, might be heard mourning in the tops of the pines.But Ida Bellethorne, the black mare, gave Betty no opportunity of stoppingto listen to the wind mourn. No, indeed! The girl had all she could do forthe first mile or two to keep her saddle and cling to the reins.When first they set forth from the Candace stables the mare went gingerlyenough for a few rods. She seemed to know that the frozen crust of the olddrifts just beneath the loose snow was perilous.But her sharpened calks gave her a grip on the frozen snow that the wisemare quickly understood. She lengthened her stride. She gathered speed.And once getting her usual swift gait, with expanded nostrils and erectears, she skimmed over the frozen way as a swallow skims the air. Bettyhad never traveled so fast in her life except in a speeding automobile.She could easily believe that Ida Bellethorne had broken most of the trackrecords of the English turf. She might make track history here in theUnited States, if nothing happened to her!Betty was wise enough to know that, had Mr. Candace been at home, even inthis earnest need for a surgeon he would never have allowed the beautifuland valuable mare to have been used in this way. But there was no otherhorse on the place that could be trusted to travel at any gait.Ida Bellethorne certainly was traveling! The speed, the keen rush of thewind past her, the need for haste and her own personal peril, all servedto give Betty a veritable thrill.If Ida made a misstep--if she went down in a heap--Betty was pretty surethat she, herself, would be hurt. She retained a tight grip upon thereins. The mare was no velvet-mouthed animal. Betty doubted if she had thestrength in her arms to pull the creature down to a walk now that she wasstarted.The instructions Mrs. Candace had given the girl pointed to a descent intothe valley for some miles, and almost by a direct road, and then around asharp turn and up the grade by a branch road to the village where Dr. Pevylived. Betty was sure she would not lose her way; the question was, couldshe cling to the saddle and keep the mare on her feet until the firstexuberance of Ida's spirit was controlled? The condition of the road didnot so much matter, for once the mare found that she did not slip on thecrust she trod the way firmly and with perfect confidence."She is a dear--she undoubtedly is," Betty thought. "But I feel just asthough I were being run away with by a steam engine and did not know howto close the throttle or reverse the engine. Dear me!"She might well say "dear me." Uncle Dick would surely have been muchworried for her safety if he could know what she was doing. Betty by nomeans appreciated in full her danger.Indeed, she scarcely thought of danger. Ida Bellethorne seemed assure-footed as a chamois. Her calks threw bits of ice-crust behind her,and she never slipped nor slid. There was nobody on the road. There wasnot even the mark of a sledge, although along the ditch were the shufflingprints of snowshoes. Some pedestrian had gone this way in the earlymorning.This was not the road by which Betty and her friends had been transportedby Mr. Jaroth. There was not even a hut like Bill Kedders' beside it. Inplaces the thick woods verged right on the track on either side and inthese tunnels it seemed to be already dusk.It flashed into Betty's mind that there might be savage animals in thesethick woods. Bears, and wild cats, and perhaps even the larger Canadianlynx, might be hovering in the dark wood. It would not be pleasant to haveone of those animals spring out at one, perhaps from an overhanging limb,as the little mare and her rider dashed beneath!"Just the same," the girl thought, "at the pace Ida Bellethorne iscarrying me, such wild animals couldn't jump quick enough to catch me.Guess I needn't be afraid of them."There were perils in her path--most unexpected perils. Betty would neverhave even dreamed of what really threatened her. For fifteen minutes IdaBellethorne galloped on and the girl knew she must have come a third ofthe way to Dr. Pevy's office.The mare's first exuberance passed. Of her own volition she drew down to acanter. Her speed still seemed almost phenominal to the girl riding her,but Betty began to feel more secure in the saddle.They reached the top of a steep hill. The hedge of tall pines andunderbrush drew closer in on either side. The road was very narrow. Asthe mare started down the incline it seemed as though they were going intoa long and steep chute.Before this Betty had noted the ice-hung telephone and telegraph wiresstrung beside the road. Sheeted in the frozen rain and snow the heavywires had dragged many of the poles askew. Here and there a wire wasbroken.It never entered the girl's mind that there was danger in those wires.And, perhaps, in most of them there was not. But across this ravine intowhich the road plunged, and slantingly, were strung much heavierwires--feed cables from the Cliffdale power station over the hill."Why, look at those icicles!" exclaimed Betty, with big eyes and watchingthe hanging wires ahead. "If they fell they would kill a person, I dobelieve!"She tugged with all her might at Ida Bellethorne's reins, and now, wellbreathed, the mare responded to the unuttered command. She came into awalk. Betty continued to stare at the heavily laden wires spanning theroad, the heavier power wires above the sagging series of telephone andtelegraph wires.In watching them so closely the girl discovered another, and even morestartling fact. One of the poles bearing up the feed wires was actuallypitched at such an angle from the top of the bank on the right hand thatBetty felt sure the wires themselves were all that held the pole fromfalling."There is going to be an accident here," declared the girl aloud. "Iwonder the company doesn't send out men to fix it. Although I guess theycould not prop up that pole. It has gone too far."Even as she spoke the mare stopped, snorting. Her instinct was more keenthan Betty's reasoning.With a screeching breaking and tearing of wood and wire the trembling polefell! Betty might, had she urged her mount, have cleared the place andescaped. But the girl lacked that wisdom.The pole fell across the deep road and its two heavy cables came incontact with the wires strung from the other poles below. Instantly theravine was lit by a blinding flash of blue flame--a flame that ran fromwire to wire, from pole to pole, melting the ice that clung to them,hissing and crackling and giving off shooting spears of flame thatthreatened any passer-by.The mare, snorting and fearful, scrambled back, swerved, and tried toescape from the ravine; but Betty had her under good control now. She hadno spurs, but she yanked savagely at the bit and wheeled Ida Bellethorneagain to face the sputtering electric flames that barred the road.Only a third of the way to the doctor's and the way made impassable! Whatshould she do? If she turned back, Betty did not know where or how tostrike into the thick and pathless forest. Hunchie, suffering from hisinjured leg, must be aided as soon as possible. Her advance must not bestayed.Yet there before her the sparking, darting flames spread the width of theravine. Burning a black hole already in the deep drifts, the crossed wiresforbade the girl to advance another yard!CHAPTER XXIBETTY COMES THROUGHBetty admitted that she was badly frightened. She was afraid of thecrossed wires, and would have been in any case. The spurting blue flamesshe knew would savagely burn her and Ida Bellethorne if they touched them,and the wires might give a shock that would kill either girl or horse.But seven miles or so beyond those sputtering flames was Dr. Pevy'soffice. And Dr. Pevy was needed right away at Candace Farm.A picture of poor Hunchie lying white and moaning in the bed rose inBetty's memory. She could not return and report that it was impossible forher to reach the doctor's office. Afraid as she was of the crossed wires,she was more afraid of showing the white feather.If Bob Henderson were here in her situation Betty was sure he would notback down. And if Bob could overcome difficulties, why couldn't Betty? Thethought inspired the girl to do as Bob would do--come through."I must do it!" Betty choked, holding the mare firmly headed toward thewrithing, crackling wires. "Ida! Get up! You can jump it.You--just--must!"The black mare crouched and snorted. Betty would have given a good dealfor tiny spurs in the heels of her shoes or for a whip to lay along themare's flank. Spirited as the creature was, and well trained, too, herfear of fire made her shrink from the leap.There was a width of six feet of darting flames. The electricity in theheavy cables was melting the other wires, and from the broken end of eachwire the blue light spurted. The snow was melting all about, turning blackand yellow in streaks. Betty did not know how long this would keep up; butevery minute she delayed poor Hunchie paid for in continued suffering."We must do it!" she shrieked to the horse. "You've got to--there!"She whipped off her velvet hat and struck Ida Bellethorne again and again.The mare crouched, measured the distance, and leaped into the air. Wellfor her and for Betty that Ida Bellethorne had a good pedigree; had comeof a long line of forebears that had been taught to jump hedges, fences,water-holes and bogs. None of them had ever made such a perilous leap asthis!The mare landed in softening snow, for the scathing flames were meltingthe drifts on either side. Betty had felt the rush of heat rising fromthe cables and had put her hat over her face.Ida Bellethorne squealed. Without doubt she had been scorched somewhere.And now secure on her feet she darted away through the ravine, runningfaster than she had run while Betty had bestrode her.Betty could not glance back at the sputtering wires. She must keep hergaze fixed ahead. Although at the speed the mare was now running it isquite doubtful if the girl could have retarded her mount in any degree.They came to the forks that Mrs. Candace had told her of, and Bettymanaged to turn the frightened mare up the steeper road to the left. Therewere few landmarks that the snow had not hidden; but the way to Dr. Pevy'swas so direct that one could scarcely mistake it.Ida Bellethorne began to cool down after a while and Betty could guide hermore easily. She had begun to talk to the pretty creature soothingly, andleaned forward in her saddle to pat the mare's neck."I don't blame you for being scared, Ida Bellethorne," crooned Betty. "Iwas scared myself, and I'm scared yet. But don't mind. Just be easy. Yourpretty black apron in front is all spattered with froth, poor dear! Iwonder if this run has done your cough any harm--or any good. Anyway, youhaven't coughed since we started."But Betty knew that if the mare stood for a minute she must be covered andrubbed down. She had this in her mind when she came to the blacksmith shopand the store, directly opposite each other. Dr. Pevy's, she had beentold, was the second house beyond on the blacksmith side of the road.It proved to be a comfortable looking cottage with a barn at the back, andshe urged Ida Bellethorne around to the barn without stopping at thehouse. The barn door was open and a man in greasy overalls was tinkeringabout a small motor-car. He was a pleasant-looking man with a beard andeyeglasses and Betty was sure he must be the doctor before he even spoketo her."Hullo!" exclaimed the amateur machanic, rising up with a wrench in onehand and an oil can in the other. "Whew! That mare has been travelingsome. And such a beauty! You're from Bill Candace's I'm sure. Did she runaway with you? Here, let me help you."But Betty was out of the saddle and had led the mare in upon the floor,although Ida Bellethorne looked somewhat askance at the partly dismantledcar."Needn't be afraid of the road-bug, my beauty," said Dr. Pevy, putting outa knowing hand to stroke the mare's neck. "She must be rubbed down and acloth put on her----""I know," said Betty hastily. "I'll do it if you'll let me. But can you goback with me, Doctor?""To the Candace Farm?""Yes, sir. A man has been seriously hurt and there was nobody else tocome.""Wonder you got here without having a fall," said Dr. Pevy."She is sharpened. And she is a dear!" gasped Betty. "But I hope you canstart right away. Hunchie is suffering so.""Can't use the road-bug, that's sure," said Dr. Pevy, glancing again atthe car. "That's why I was doctoring her now while the snow is too deep.But I still have old Standby and the sleigh. I'll start back with you in afew minutes and we'll lead the mare. The exercise will do her good. My!What a handsome creature she is.""Yes, sir. She is quite wonderful," said Betty; and while they gave IdaBellethorne the attention she needed Betty told the doctor all aboutHunchie and her ride through the forest. When Dr. Pevy heard about thebroken wires in the road, he went to the house and telephoned to theCliffdale power house to tell them where the break was. The linemen werealready searching for it."That peril will be averted immediately," he said coming back with hisoveralls removed, a coat over his arm and carrying his case in his otherhand. "That's it, my dear. Walk her up and down. Such a beauty!"He got out his light sleigh and then led Standby, a big, red-roan horse,out on the floor to harness him."These automobiles are all right when the snow doesn't fly," Dr. Pevyremarked. "But up here in the hills we have so much snow that one has tokeep a horse anyway or else give up business during the winter. You were aplucky girl to come so far on that mare, my dear. A Washington girl, yousay?""We just came from Washington," Betty explained. "But I can't really claimto belong there. I--I'm sort of homeless, I guess. I do just love thesemountains and this air.""This air," commented Dr. Pevy, "smells just now of a storm. And I thinkit may drizzle again. Now, if you are ready, my dear."He unbuckled Ida Bellethorne's bridle rein and made it a leading rein. Hehelped Betty into the sleigh and gave her the rein to hold. The mare ledeasily, and merely snorted when Standby leaned into the collar and startedthe sleigh.The roan was heavy footed, and his shoes, too, were calked. They startedoff from the village at a good jog with the blanketed black mare trottingeasily behind the sleigh.Betty tried to mould her velvet hat into shape. It had been a hat that shevery much prized, and was copied after one Ada Nansen wore, and Ada setthe fashions at Shadyside. But that little hat would never be the sameagain after being used as a goad for Ida Bellethorne. Betty sighed, andgave up her attempt.When they came to the place in the ravine where the wires were down Dr.Pevy drew up Standby. The mare snorted, recognizing the spot. But theelectrical display was over, for the power had been turned off."You certainly must have had a narrow squeak here," remarked thephysician, as he looked at the fallen wires."Oh, Doctor, it was awful!" breathed Betty. "I thought sure that we weregoing to have the worst kind of accident.""The company ought really to put up a new line of poles, so many of theseare getting rotten," was the doctor's reply. "But I suppose they are hardup for money these days, and can afford only the necessary repairs."The sleigh climbed the mountain after that to the Candace Farm. As theycame in sight of it Betty saw the troop of young stock being driven inthrough the lane, and saw Bob and Tommy with the stock farmer and his men.It was well she had ventured for the doctor on the black mare, or poorHunchie Slattery would have suffered much longer without medicalattention.Bobby ran out to meet them when the sleigh came into the yard. Mrs.Candace stood at the back door explaining to the red-faced man, herhusband. It was Bob who came to take the leading rein of the black marefrom Betty's hand."Cricky!" he exclaimed. "What have you been up to now, Betsey? Is thisthat English mare? Isn't she a beauty! And you've been riding her?""I've been flying on her," sighed Betty, "Don't talk, Bob! I never expectto travel so fast in the saddle again unless I become a jockey. And I knowI am growing too fat for that."CHAPTER XXIION THE BRINK OF DISCOVERYThe three girls and their boy friends remained at the farm until Dr. Pevyhad set the bad fracture that Hunchie had suffered and the poor little manhad been made as comfortable as he could be made at the time. He had beenbadly shaken in falling so far at the barn, and the surgeon declared hewould be confined to his bed for some weeks."And oo's to take care of Ida Bellethorne, I ask you?" demanded Hunchiefaintly. "Mr. Bolter hexpects me to give hundivided hattention to 'er.""She shall have the best of care," said Candace, the farmer, warmly. "Amare like her ought to be bedded down in roses. The way she took thislittle girl over the drifts was a caution. She is some horse, she is! Wewill give her the best of attention, Hunchie, never you fear."The cockney was so much troubled about his charge that he seemed to haveforgotten Ida Bellethorne, the girl. But Betty heard him say one thing toIda before they left."You ought to be 'appy, Miss Ida, even if the mare was sold. She brought agood price, and ev'rybody about Bellethorne Park knows as Mr. Bellethornegive 'er to you when she was a filly. I 'ope you'll come to see usagain--me and the mare.""I surely will, Hunchie," said the English girl.But when they came out of the house and bade the family good-bye, Bettysaw that Ida was very grave. Hunchie's words seemed to have beensignificant.It was late in the afternoon when the quintette arrived at Mountain Camp.Mrs. Canary had expressed some anxiety about them, but Uncle Dick hadscouted any peril that might threaten the young folks. He admitted that hehad overlooked some possibilities when he heard the full account of theiradventures--and especially of his niece's adventures--at the dinner table."I declare, Betty," he said with some little exasperation, "I believe ifyou were locked inside a trunk with only gimlet holes to breathe throughyou would manage to get into trouble.""I think I'd be in trouble fast enough in that case," answered Betty,laughing."I don't know," said Louise thoughtfully. "Locked up in a box, you reallycouldn't get into much harm, Betty.""Sure she could get into trouble," declared Bobby. "Bees could crawl inthrough the gimlet holes and sting her.""I'd like to have seen her jumping that fire on horseback," sighed Libbie."It must have been wonderful!"Mr. Gordon looked rather disturbed as he stared at his niece."That's exactly what I shouldn't want to see her do," he said. "I do notknow what I am going to do if, as she gets older, she grows moreenergetic," he added to Mr. and Mrs. Canary. "Betty is more than a handfulfor a poor bachelor uncle, I do believe!"He forbade any more excursions away from the camp after that unless theexcursionists took some adult person with them. He went himself to CandaceFarm to see Hunchie Slattery; but he took only Ida Bellethorne with him.They went on their snowshoes. During this trip Mr. Gordon won the abidingconfidence of the girl.Meanwhile the youthful visitors at Mountain Camp allowed no hour to beidle. There was always something to do, and what one could not think of inthe way of fun another could.Mr. Canary's men had smoothed a coasting course down the hillside to thelake not a quarter of a mile from the Overlook. There was a nest oftoboggans in one of the outhouses. Tobogganing afforded the nine youngpeople much sport.For the others insisted that Ida Bellethorne share in all their goodtimes. She declared she never would get Libbie's blouse done in time; butLibbie said that she could finish it afterward and send it on toShadyside. Just now the main thing was to crowd as much fun as possibleinto the remaining days of their vacation.The young folks from Fairfields were paired off very nicely; but they didnot let Ida feel that she was a "fifth wheel," and she really had a goodtime. These snow-sports were so unfamiliar to her that she enjoyed themthe more keenly."I do think these boys are so nice," she said to Betty as they climbed thehill from the lakeshore, dragging the toboggan behind them by its rope."Of course they're nice," said the loyal Betty. "Especially Bob Henderson.He's just like a brother to me. If he wasn't nice to you I should scoldhim--that I should, Ida.""I never can repay you for your kindness," sighed the English girl, quiteserious of visage. "And your uncle, too."Betty flashed her a penetrating look and was on the verge of speaking ofsomething that she, at least, considered of much importance. Then shehesitated. Ida had never mentioned the possibility of Betty's havingdropped anything in Mrs. Staples' store. Betty shut her lips tight againand waited. If Ida did know anything about her lost locket, Betty wantedthe English girl to speak of it first.They went in to dress for dinner that afternoon just before a change inthe weather. A storm had been threatening for some hours, and flakes ofsnow began to drift down before they left the slide."Let's dress up in our best, girls," Louise said gaily. "Put on our bestbibs and tuckers. Make it a gala occasion. Teddy, be sure and scrub behindyour ears, naughty boy!""I feel as though I ought to be in rompers the way you talk," said theTucker twin, but he laughed.The boys ran off to "primp," and what the girls did to make themselveslovely, Libbie said "was a caution!" One after the other they came intoBetty's and Bobby's room and pirouetted to show their finery. Ida had beendecked out very nicely by her friends, and her outfit did not seem shabbyin the least.But the English girl noted one thing about Betty, and it puzzled her. Theother girls from Shadyside School wore their pieces of jewelry while Bettydisplayed not a single trinket. As the other girls were hurrying out tojoin the boys and descend to the big hall, Ida held Betty back."Where is it, Betty?" she asked. "Don't you wear it at all? Are youafraid of losing it again?""What do you mean?" asked Betty, her heart pounding suddenly and her eyesgrowing brighter. Ida Bellethorne placed her hand upon Betty's chest,looking at her closely as she asked the question:"Didn't Mrs. Staples give it to you? That beautiful locket, you know.Aren't you allowed to wear it?"CHAPTER XXIIICAN IT BE DONE?"Dear me!" exclaimed Betty. "How curious you are. I am not allowed to wearmy diamond earrings that Doctor and Mrs. Guerin gave me, of course. Theyare the old-fashioned kind for pierced ears, and would have to be reset,and diamonds are too old for me anyway. But Uncle Dick lets me wear anything else I own----""That locket," questioned Ida. "That pretty locket. It did fall out ofyour bag in the shop, didn't it, Betty?""My goodness!" stammered Betty, "did you find it?""I picked it up," said Ida soberly. "Mrs. Staples would not let me runafter you with it. But she promised to give it to you when you came andasked for it.""She did? She never----"Then Betty hesitated a moment. She remembered clearly just what had beensaid in the little neighborhood shop when she and Bobby had called thereto get Bobby's blue over-blouse."It's a fact, I never asked her for it," she said slowly. "No, I never. Ijust asked her if she had found anything, and she said 'No.'""She would! That would be like her!" cried Ida Bellethorne. "She is aperson who prides herself upon being exactly honest; and I guess thatmeans barely honest. Oh, Betty Gordon!""Well, now what's the matter?" asked Betty."Did--did you know you lost it in Mrs. Staples' shop?""No. I didn't know where I lost it. I only thought----""That I might have picked it up and said nothing about it?" demanded IdaBellethorne."Why Ida! I would not have hurt your feelings by saying anything about itfor the world," said Betty honestly. "That was why I didn't tell you. Yousee, if you really had known nothing about the locket when I asked you,all the time you would be afraid that I suspected you. Isn't that so?""You dear, good girl!" gasped Ida, dabbling her eyes with herhandkerchief. "And I didn't say anything because I thought you would thinkI wanted a reward for returning it.""So, you see, I couldn't speak of it. But now, of course, we'll get itaway from Mrs. Staples. I think she's horrid mean!"Betty expressed her opinion of the shopwoman vigorously, but she put herarms around the English girl at the same time and kissed her warmly."You're a dear!" repeated Ida."You're another!" cried Betty gaily. "Now come on! Maybe those boys willeat up all the dinner, and I am so hungry!"One of the men arrived from Cliffdale during dinner with the mail and theinformation that another cold rain was falling and freezing to everythingit touched."The whole country about here will be one glare of ice in the morning,"said Mr. Canary. "You young folks will have all the sledding you care for,I fancy. I have seen the time when, after one of these ice storms, onemight coast from here to Midway Junction on the railroad, and that's amatter of twenty miles.""What a lark that would be," cried Tommy Tucker. "Some slide, eh, Bob?""How about walking back?" asked the other boy promptly, grinning.Letters and papers were distributed. There was at least one letter foreverybody but Ida, and Betty squeezed her hand under the table in acomforting way.When they all retired from the table and gathered in groups in the bigliving room where the log fire roared Uncle Dick beckoned Betty to him. Heput a letter from Mrs. Eustice into the girl's hand and at one glance she"knew the worst.""Oh Betty!" gasped Louise, "what's the matter?"For Betty had emitted a squeal of despair. She shook the paper beforetheir eyes."Come on, Betty!" cried Bob. "Get it out--if it's a fishbone.""It's all over!" wailed Betty. "Measles don't last as long as we thoughtthey did. Shadyside opens two days from to-morrow, and we have got to bethere. That's Monday. Oh, dear, dear, dear!""Say a couple more for me, Betty," growled Teddy Tucker. "I supposeSalsette will open too. Back to Major Pater and others too murderous tomention.""And the Major's got it in for you Tucker twins," Bob reminded himwickedly."That's Tom's fault," grumbled Teddy. "If he hadn't sprung that snowballstunt--Oh, well! What's the use?""Life, Ted believes," said Louise, "is just one misfortune after another.But I do hate to leave here just as we have got nicely settled. Mygoodness! what's the matter with Ida? Something's happened to her, too."Ida had sprung to her feet with one of the recently arrived New Yorkpapers in her hand. Actually she was pale, and it was no wonder thecompany stared at her when her cheeks were usually so ruddy."What is the matter, dear?" asked Mrs. Canary.Betty went to the English girl at once and put an arm about her shoulders."Did you see something in the paper that frightened you, Ida?" she asked."It doesn't frighten me," replied the girl, with trembling lips. "See.Read it. This time I am sure it is my aunt. See!"Uncle Dick joined the group about the excited girl. Her color had comeback into her cheeks now and her eyes shone. She was usually soself-contained and quiet that Mr. Gordon now thought perhaps they had notreally appreciated how much the hope of joining her aunt meant to Ida."Read it aloud, Betty," said her uncle quietly."Oh! Here's her name! It must be right this time!" cried Betty; and thenshe obeyed her uncle's request:    "'The Toscanelli Opera Company, Salvatore Toscanelli manager,    which has made a very favorable impression among the music lovers    of the East and Middle West during the last few months, will sail    for Rio Janeiro on Sunday on the _San Salvador_ of the Blue Star    Line. The company has been augmented by the engagement of    several soloists, among them Madam Ida Bellethorne, the English    soprano, who has made many friends here during the past few    years.'""Day after to-morrow!" exclaimed Bobby, the first to speak. "Why! maybe ifyou can go to New York you will see her, Ida.""Day after to-morrow," repeated Ida, anxiously. "Can I get to New York bythat time? I--I have a little money----""Don't worry about the money, honey," Betty broke in. "You will have tostart early in the morning, won't she, Uncle Dick?""If she is to reach the steamer in time, yes," said the gentleman ratherdoubtfully."Oh! if I don't get there what shall I do?" cried Ida. "Rio Janeiro, why,that is in South America! It would cost hundreds of your dollars to pay mypassage there. I must get to Aunt Ida before she sails. I must!""Now, now!" put in Mrs. Canary soothingly. "Don't worry about it, child.That will not help. We will get you to the train to-morrow----""If we can," interrupted her husband softly.He beckoned Uncle Dick away and they went out through the hall to look atthe weather, leaving the young folks and Mrs. Canary to encourage theEnglish girl.Outside the two men did not find much in the appearance of the weather toencourage them. It was raining softly, for there was no wind; and it wasfreezing as fast as it fell."And that old shack-a-bones I keep here during the winter isn't sharpened.Ought to be, I know. But he isn't," grumbled Jonathan Canary."No use to think of snowshoes if it freezes, Jack," rejoined Mr. Gordon."It is too far to the railroad anyway. I doubt if these children get toschool on time.""Telephone wires are down again. I just tried to get Cliffdale beforedinner. This is a wilderness up here, Dick.""I am sorry for that young English girl," mused Mr. Gordon. "She is fairlyeaten up with the idea of getting in touch with her aunt. Good reason,too. She has told me all about it. She carries a letter from her deadfather to the woman and he begged the girl to be sure to put it into hissister's hands. Family troubles, Jack.""Well, come on in. You're here without your hat. Want to get your death ofcold?" growled Mr. Canary.The young folks did not dream at this time that nature was doing her bestto make it impossible for Ida Bellethorne to reach New York by Sundaymorning when the steamship _San Salvador_ would leave her dock. It was,however, the general topic of conversation during the evening. Whenbed-time came they went gaily to bed, not even Betty doubting thefeasibility of their getting to the train on the morrow.Her uncle, however, put his head out of the door again when the others hadgone chamberward and seeing the shining, icy waste of the Overlook,muttered with growing anxiety:"Can it be done?"CHAPTER XXIVTWENTY MILES OF GRADEIda slept in the room with Betty and Bobby that night. Betty had confidedto her chum, as well as to Uncle Dick, the outcome of the mystery of herlocket. Because of Ida's information, Uncle Dick had assured his niecethey would recover the trinket."If Mrs. Staples is not a dishonest woman, she shades that characterpretty closely. There are people like that--people who think that a foundarticle is their own unless absolutely claimed by the victim of the loss.A rather prejudiced brand of honesty to say the least."The two Shadyside girls made much of Ida Bellethorne on this evening afterthey had fore-gathered in the bedroom. Just think! her Aunt Ida might takeher to South America. Ida already had traveled by boat much farther thaneven Betty had journeyed by train."Although I am not at all sure how my aunt will meet me," the English girlsaid. "She was very angry with my father. She wasn't fair to him. She isimpulsive and proud, and maybe she will think no better of me. But I mustgive her father's letter and see what comes of it."The main difficulty was to get to New York in time to deliver the letterbefore the _San Salvador_ sailed. When the girls awoke very early and sawa sliver of moon shining low in the sky, they bounced up with glad ifmuffled cries, believing that everything was all right. The storm hadceased. And when they pushed up the window a little more to stick theirheads out they immediately discovered something else."Goodness me!" gasped Bobby. "It's one glare of ice--everything! And so-ocold! Ugh!" and she shivered, bundled as she was in a blanket robe.First Betty and then Ida had to investigate. The latter looked verymournful."The horse can never travel to-day," she groaned. "You saw how he slippedabout in the soft snow the other day when they had him out. He is not shodproperly.""If you only had Ida Bellethorne here!" cried Betty."But she is a long way off, and in the wrong direction. Why, none of uscould walk on this ice!""How about skating?" cried Bobby eagerly."Mr. Canary says it is all downhill--or mostly to the railroad station,"Betty said. "I would be afraid to skate downhill."They dressed quickly and hastened to find Uncle Dick. He had long been upand had evidently canvassed the situation thoroughly. His face was verygrave when he met his niece and her friends."This is a bad lookout for our trip," he said. "I don't really see how anyof you will get to school on Monday, let alone Ida's reaching New Yorkto-morrow morning.""Oh, Uncle Dick, don't say that!" cried Betty. "Is it positive that wecannot ride or walk?""Walk twenty miles downhill on ice?" he exclaimed, "Does it seemreasonable? We can neither ride nor walk; and surely we cannot swim orfly!""We could fly if we had an aeroplane. Oh, dear!" sighed Bobby. "Why didn'twe think of that? And now the telephone wires are down."But Betty was thoughtful. She only pinched Ida's arm and begged her tokeep up her courage--perhaps something would turn up. She disappeared thenand was absent from the house, cold as the morning was, until breakfasttime.The whole party had gathered then, excited and voluble. It was not onlyregarding Ida's need that they chattered so eagerly. In spite of the funthey were having at Mountain Camp, the thought that Shadyside and Salsettemight begin classes before they could get there was, after all, rathershocking."Measles is one thing," said Bob. "But being out of bounds when classesreally begin is another. The other fellows will learn some tricks that wedon't know.""And somebody else may be put in our room, Betty!" wailed Bobby, as herchum now appeared.Betty was very rosy and full of something that was bound to spill over atonce. As soon as she had bidden Mr. and Mrs. Canary good morning she criedto all:"What do you think!""Just as little as possible," declared Tommy Tucker. "Thinking tires medreadfully.""Behave, Tommy!" said Louise admonishingly."There's a big two-horse pung here. I found it in the barn. Like Mr.Jaroth's. It has a deep box like his. And a tongue. It's like adouble-runner sled, Bob--you know. The front runners are independent ofthe rear.""I know what it is, Betty," said Bob, while the others stared at her."I've seen that pung.""Your observations are correct, Miss Betty," said Mr. Canary, smiling atthe girl. "I own such a pung. But I do not own two horses to draw it. AndI am sorry to say that the horse I have got cannot stand on this ice.""Gee!" exclaimed Teddy, "if we got old Bobsky started down that hill he'dnever stop till he got to the bottom. How far do you say it is to thestation, Mr. Canary?""It is quite twenty miles down grade. Of course there are several placeswhere the road is level--or was level before the snow fell. But oncestarted there would not be many places where you would have to get out andpush," and the gentleman laughed.Betty's mind was fixed upon her argument. Her face still glowed and shescarcely tasted her breakfast."I believe we can do it," she murmured."What under the sun do you mean, Betty?" asked Louise."I hope it is something nice we can do," said Libbie dreamily. "I lookedout the window and it is all like fairyland--isn't it, Timothy?""Uh-huh!" said Timothy Derby, his mouth rather full at the moment. "It isthe most beautiful sight I ever saw. Will you please pass me anothermuffin?"But Bob gave Betty his undivided attention. He asked:"What do you believe we can do, Betty?""Make use of Mr. Canary's pung.""Cricky! What will draw it? Where is the span of noble steeds to be found?Old Bobsky would break his neck.""One horse. One wonderful horse, Bob!" cried Betty clapping her handssuddenly. "I am sure I'm right. Uncle Dick!""What do you mean, Betty?" cried Bobby, shaking her. "What horse?""Gravitation," announced Betty, her eyes shining. "That's his name.""Great goodness!" gasped Bob. "I see a light. But Betty, how'd we steerit?""The front runners are attached to the tongue. Tie ropes to the tongue andsteer it that way," Betty said, so eagerly that her words tumbled overeach other. "Can't we do it, Uncle Dick? We'll all pile into the pung,with a lot of straw to keep us warm, and just slide down the hills to therailroad station. What say?"For a while there was a good deal said by all present. Mr. and Mrs. Canaryat first scouted the reasonableness of the idea. But Mr. Gordon, being anengineer and, as Bob said, "up to all such problems," considered Betty'ssuggestion carefully.In the first place the need was serious. Especially for the much troubledIda. If she could not reach the dock on New York's water-front by eleveno'clock the next morning, her aunt would doubtless sail on the _SanSalvador_, and then there was no knowing when the English girl would beable to find her only living relative.The party had ridden over the mountain road in coming to Mountain Camp,and Uncle Dick remembered the course pretty well. Although it was acontinual grade, as one might say, it was an easy grade. And there werefew turns in the road.Drifted with snow as it was, and that snow crusted, the idea of coastingall the way to the railroad station did not seem so wild a thought. Theroad was fenced for most of the way on both sides. And over those fencesthe drifts rose smoothly, making almost a trough of the road."When you come to think of it, Jack," Uncle Dick said to Mr. Canary, "itis not very different from our toboggan chute yonder. Only it is longer.""A good bit longer," said Mr. Canary, shaking his head.However, it was plain that the idea interested Uncle Dick. He hastened outto look at the pung. Bob followed him, and they were gone half an hour ormore. When they returned Bob was grinning broadly."Get ready for the time of your lives, girls," he whispered to Betty andBobby. "The thing is going to work. You wait and see!"Uncle Dick called them all into the living room and told them to pack atonce and prepare for a cold ride. There was plenty of time, for the trainthey had to catch did not reach the station until noon."If our trip is successful--and it will be, I feel sure--it will not takean hour to reach the station. But we shall give ourselves plenty of time.Now off with you! I guess Mrs. Canary will be glad to see the last of us."But their hostess denied this. The delight of having young people at thelonely camp in the hills quite counterbalanced the disturbance they made.But she bustled about somewhat anxiously, aiding the girls and the boys tomake ready for departure. The Canarys, being unused to roughing it, evenif they did live in the Big Woods, were much more afraid of thepossibility of an accident arising out of this scheme Betty had conceivedthan was Uncle Dick.A little after ten o'clock they all piled out of the bungalow with theirbaggage. The two men working at the camp had filled the box of the pungwith straw and had drawn it out to the brow of the hill where the roadbegan. The tongue was raised at a slant, as high as it would go, and halfof it had been sawed off. Ropes were fastened from this stub of the tongueto ringbolts on either side of the pung-box."It will take two of us to steer," said Uncle Dick, "and we must worktogether. Get in here, Bob, and I'll show you how it works."It worked easily. The girls and the baggage were piled into the pung. TheTucker twins were each handed an iron-shod woodsman's peavey and wereshown how the speed of the pung might be retarded by dragging them in thecrust on either side."You boys are the brakes," sang out Uncle Dick, almost as excited as theyoung people themselves. "When we shout for 'Brakes!' it is up to youtwins to do your part.""We will, sir!" cried Tommy and Teddy in unison."And don't hang your arms or legs over the sides," advised Uncle Dick."Farewell, Jack! Take care of him, Mrs. Canary. And many, many thanks fora jolly time."The boys and girls chorused their gratitude to the owner of Mountain Campand his wife. The men behind gave the pung just the tiniest push. Therunners creaked over the ice, and the forward end pitched down the slope.They had started.And what a ride that was! It is not likely that any of them will everforget it. Yet, as it proved, the danger was slight. They coasted theentire down-grade to the little railroad station where Fred Jaroth wastelegraph operator with scarcely more peril than as though they had beenriding behind the Jaroth horses.But they were on the _qui vive_ all the time. Bobby declared her heart wasin her mouth so much that she could taste it.There were places when the speed threatened disaster. But when Uncle Dickshouted for "Brakes!" the twins broke through the crust with their peaveysand the hook broke up the thick ice and dragged back on the pung so thatthe latter was brought almost to a stop. The handles of the peaveys werebraced against the end staffs of the pung, and to keep them in positiondid not exceed the twins' strength.Once Ted's peavey was dragged from his hands; but he jumped out andrecovered it, and then, falling, slid flat on his back down the slipperyway until he overtook the slowly moving pung again amid the delightedshouts of his chums.Otherwise there were no casualties, and the pung flew past the Jarothhouse a little before eleven to the great amazement of the whole family,who ran out to watch the coasting party."I don't know how Jonathan Canary will recover his pung," said Mr. Gordonwhen they alighted on the level ground. "But I will leave it in Jaroth'scare, and when the winter breaks up, or before, it can be taken back toMountain Camp."Now how do you feel, young folks? All right? No bones broken?""It was delightful," they cried. But Ida added something to this. "I feelrather--rather dazed, Mr. Gordon," she said. "But I am very thankful. AndI know whom I have most to thank.""Who is that; my dear?" asked Uncle Dick smiling."Betty."CHAPTER XXVON THE DECK OF THE SAN SALVADORMr. Richard Gordon sent several telegrams before the train arrived, andthey were all of importance. One recovered Betty's locket, for, informedof the circumstances by this telegram, the lawyer in Washington sent hisclerk to Mrs. Staples and showed her in a very few words that she wascoasting very close to the law by keeping the little platinum and diamondlocket."So," said Betty to Bobby, "if the lawyer gets it--and Uncle Dick says hewill--I can wear the locket to parties at the school.""If Mrs. Eustice allows it," said her chum grimly. "You know, she's downon jewelry. Remember how she got after Ada Nansen and Ruth Gladys Royalfor wearing so much junk?""My goodness!" giggled Betty, "what would she say to you if she heard youuse such an expression? Anyway, I am going to show her Uncle Dick'spresent and ask her. I know the beautiful diamond earrings Doctor and Mrs.Guerin sent me can't be worn till I grow up a bit. But my locket is justright."It was a noisy crowd that boarded the train; and it continued to be anoisy crowd to the junction where it broke up. All the young folks wouldhave been glad to go with Uncle Dick and Ida Bellethorne to New York; buthe sent all but Betty and Bob on to school. They would reach the Shadysidestation soon after daybreak the next morning, and Mr. Gordon hadtelegraphed ahead for the school authorities to be on the look-out forthem.Betty and Bob, with Uncle Dick and the English girl, left the train at thejunction and boarded another for New York City in some confidence ofreaching their destination in good season.The train, however, was late. It seemed merely to creep along for milesand miles. Luckily they had secured berths, and while they slept thedelayed train did most of its creeping.But in the morning they were dismayed to find that they were already twohours late and that it would be impossible for the train to pick up thosetwo hours before reaching the Grand Central Terminal in New York City."Now, hold your horses, young people!" advised Mr. Gordon. "We are notbeaten yet. The _San Salvador_ does not leave her dock until eleven at theearliest. It may be several hours later. I have wired to Miss Bellethorneaboard the ship and in care of the Toscanelli Opera Company as well. I donot know the hotel at which Miss Bellethorne has been staying.""But, Uncle Dick!" cried Betty, who seemed to have thought of every chancethat might arise, "suppose Ida's aunt wants to take her along to Brazil?Her passport----""Can be vised at the British consulate on Whitehall Street in a very fewminutes. I have examined Ida's passport, and there is no reason why thereshould be any trouble over it at all. She is a minor, you see, and if heraunt wishes to assume responsibility for her no effort will be made tokeep her in the country, that is sure.""Then it all depends upon Ida's aunt," sighed Betty."And our reaching the dock in time," amended Uncle Dick. "I would not wishto interfere with Miss Bellethorne's business engagement in Rio Janeiro;but I am anxious for her to authorize me, on behalf of her niece, to getlegal matters in train for the recovery of that beautiful mare. I believethat she belongs--every hair and hoof of her--to our young friend here.There has been some trickery in the case.""Oh, Uncle Dick!" shrieked Betty."When I went to see that poor little cripple Hunchie Slattery he told methat the very papers that were given to Mr. Bolter with the horse mustprove Ida's ownership at one time of the mare. There was some kind of aquit-claim deed signed by her name, and that signature must be a forgery."The horse could never have been sold in England, for the Bellethornestable was too well known there. The men who grabbed the string of horsesleft when Ida's father died are well-to-do, and Mr. Bolter will be able toget his money back, even if he has already paid the full price agreed uponfor Ida Bellethorne."I am convinced," concluded Uncle Dick, "that the girl has somethingcoming to her. And it may even pay Miss Bellethorne to remain in theUnited States instead of going to Rio Janeiro until the matter of theblack mare's ownership is settled beyond any doubt."When the train finally reached New York, Uncle Dick did not even delay totry to reach the dock by telephone. He bundled his party into a taxicaband they were transported to the dock where the _San Salvador_ lay.A steward seemed to be on the look-out for the party, and addressed UncleDick the moment he alighted from the cab."Mr. Gordon, sir? Yes, sir. Madam Bellethorne has received your wire andis waiting for you. I have arranged for you all to be passed through theinspection line. The steamship, sir, is delayed and will not sail untilnext tide.""And that is a mighty good thing for us," declared Mr. Gordon to hischarges.His business card helped get them past the inspectors. It is not easy toboard a ship nowadays to bid good-bye to a sailing friend. But in tenminutes or so they stood before the great singer.She was a tall and handsome woman. Betty at first glance saw that Ida, theniece, would very likely grow into a very close resemblance to MadamBellethorne.The woman looked swiftly from Betty to Ida and made no mistake in heridentification of her brother's daughter. Ida was crying just a little,but when she realized how close and kindly was her aunt's embrace sheshook the drops out of her eyes and smiled."Father wanted I should find you, Aunt Ida," she said. "He wrote a letterto you and I have it. I think it was the principal thing he thought ofduring his last illness--his misunderstanding with you.""My fault as much as his," Madam Bellethorne said sadly. "We were bothproud and high-tempered. But no more of this now. Something in thisgentleman's long telegram to me----"She bowed to Mr. Gordon. He quickly stated the matter of the black mare'sownership to the singer."If you will come to the British consulate where Ida's passport must bevised, and sign there a paper empowering me to act in your behalf, youassuming the guardianship of Ida, I can start lawyers on the trail of thisswindle."Miss Bellethorne was a woman of prompt decision and of a business mind,and immediately agreed. She likewise saw that her niece had made powerfulfriends during the weeks she had been in America and she was content toallow Mr. Gordon to do the girl this kindness.It was a busy time; but the delay in the sailing of the _San Salvador_made it possible for everything necessary to be accomplished. Uncle Dickand Betty and Bob accompanied the Bellethornes aboard the ship again andhad luncheon with them. Ida cried when she parted with Betty; but it wouldbe only for the winter. When the opera company returned to New York it wasalready planned that the younger Ida Bellethorne should join the friendsof her own age she had so recently made at Shadyside School.It was an astonishing sight for Betty and Bob to see the great shipworried out of her dock by the fussy little tugs. It was growing dark bythat time and the great steamship was brilliantly lighted. They watcheduntil she was in midstream and was headed down the harbor under her ownsteam."There! It's over!" sighed Betty. "I feel as if a great load had beenlifted from my mind. Dear me, Bob! do you suppose we can ever again haveso much excitement crowded into a few hours?"As Betty was no seeress and could not see into the future she of coursedid not dream that in a very few weeks, and in very differentsurroundings, she would experience adventures quite as interesting as anywhich had already come into her life. These will be published in the nextvolume of this series, entitled: "Betty Gordon at Ocean Park; or, GayDoings on the Boardwalk."Bob shook his head at Betty's last observation. "Does seem as though wemanage to get hooked up to lots of strange folks and strange happenings.Certain metals attract lightning, Betty, and I think you attractadventures. What do you say, Uncle Dick?"Mr. Gordon only laughed. "I say that you young folks had better havesupper and a long night's rest. I shall not let you go on to school untilto-morrow. For once you will be a day late; but I will chance explainingthe circumstances to your instructors."They got into the taxicab again and bowled away up town. The lights cameup like rows of fireflies in the cross streets. When they struck into thefoot of Fifth Avenue at the Washington Arch the globes on thatthoroughfare were all alight. It was late enough for the traffic to havethinned out and their driver could travel at good speed save when the redlights flashed up on the traffic towers."Isn't this wonderful?" said Betty. "Libbie is always enthusing aboutpretty views and fairylike landscapes. What would she and Timothy say tothis?""Something silly, I bet," grumbled Bob. "Cricky! but I'm hungry," provingby this speech that he had a soul at this moment very little above mundanethings.Uncle Dick chuckled in his corner of the car, and made no comment. AndBetty said nothing further just then. The brilliant lights of the avenuewere shining full in her face, but her thoughts were far away, with IdaBellethorne on that ocean-going steamer bound for South America. What awonderful winter of adventures it had been!"And the best of it is, it all came out right in the end," murmured thegirl softly to herself.***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BETTY GORDON AT MOUNTAIN CAMP********** This file should be named 14546.txt or 14546.zip *******This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/4/5/4/14546Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Menwalk on it on every side just like flies crawling over a watermelon andthey do not fall off either. On the next page you can see how they travelall around the world; some in steamships, some in carriages or on horses,some in jinrickshaws and some in the railway coaches. In Topsy-turvy Landthey have no railroads and not even waggon-roads or waggons. A horse or acamel or a donkey is used for passengers and the camel caravan is afreight train.Or if you wish, the camel is a topsy-turvy ship which sails in the sandinstead of in the water. It is called the ship of the desert. The mastspoint down instead of up; there are four masts instead of three; andalthough there are ropes the desert-ship has no sails and norudder--unless the rudder be the tail. When the ship lies at anchor to beloaded it feeds on grass and the four masts are all snugly tucked awayunder the hull. In Arabia you generally see these ships of the desert in along line like a naval procession, each battleship towing its mate by apiece of rope fastened from halter to tail! But not only is the mode oftravel strange in Topsy-turvy Land, even the time of the day is all upsidedown. When the boys and girls of America are going to bed the boys andgirls of Arabia are thinking of getting up. As early as four o'clock bywestern time the muezzin calls out loud from the top of the minaret (forMoslem churches have no steeples and no bells) to come and pray. Arabscount the hours from sunrise. It is noon at six o'clock and they breakfastat one; at three o'clock in the evening all good boys and girls areasleep.[Illustration: MODES OF TRAVEL.]In Topsy-turvy Land all the habits and customs are exactly opposite tothose in America or England. For instance when a boy enters a room hetakes off his shoes but leaves his hat on his head. I do not know whetherwe should call it a _hat_, however. His hat has no rim and is not made offelt or straw, but is just a folded handkerchief of a large size andbright colour with a piece of cord to hold it wound round his head--a sortof a hat in two pieces. The girls go without shoes but carefully covertheir pretty (or ugly) faces with a black veil.At home you eat with a spoon or use a knife and fork. Here the Arabs eatwith their fingers; nor do they use any plates or butter dishes, but alarge piece of flat bread serves as a plate until it is all eaten. So yousee in Arabia the children not only eat their rice and meat but theirplates also. You read a book from left to right but in Arabia everybodybegins at the right-hand cover and reads backward. Even the lines readbackward and in Arabic writing there are no commas or capitals and thevowels are written not next to the consonants but stuck up above them._Potato_ in Arabic would be written with English letters this way:    O A O    T T PCan you read it?In your country a carpenter stands at his bench to work, but here they siton the ground. With you he uses a vise to hold the board or stick he isplaning; here he uses his bare toes. With you he _pushes_ the saw or,especially, the plane away from him to cut or to smooth a piece of wood,but in Topsy-turvy Land he _pulls_ his tools towards him. Buttons are onthe button-hole side and the holes are where you put the buttons. Doorkeys and door hinges are made of wood, not of iron as in the Occident. Thewomen wear toe-rings and nose-rings as well as earrings and bracelets.Everything seems different from what it is in a Christian country.One strange sight is to meet people out riding. Do you know that the menride donkeys side-saddle, but the women ride as men do in your country?When a missionary lady first came to Bahrein in Eastern Arabia and theboys saw her riding a donkey they called out: _"Come and see, come andsee! The lady has no feet!"_ Because they saw only one side of her. Thenanother one called out and said: _"Yes she has, and they are both on thisside!"_[Illustration: EUROPEAN VISITORS ON DONKEYS.]Another odd custom is that Arabs always turn the fingers of the hand downas we turn them up in beckoning or calling anybody. Many other gesturesseem topsy-turvy as well.In your country boys learn the lesson of politeness--ladies first; but itis not so over here. It is _men first_ in all grades of society; and notonly men first but men last, in the middle, and all the time. Women andgirls have a very small place given them in Topsy-turvy Land. The Arabssay that of all animal kinds the female is the most valuable except in thecase of mankind! When a girl baby is born the parents are thought veryunfortunate. How hard the Bedouin girls have to work! They are treatedjust like beasts of burden as if they had no souls. They go barefootcarrying heavy loads of wood or skins of water, grind the meal and makefresh bread every morning or spin the camel's hair or goat's hair into onecoarse garment. They are very ignorant and superstitious, the chiefremedies for sickness being to brand the body with a hot iron or wearcharms--a verse from the Koran sewn up in leather or a string of bluebeads, which are supposed to drive away evil influences.How very thankful girls should be that in all Christian lands they have ahigher place and a better lot than the poor girls and women of Arabia! Forthe greatest contrast is the religion of the inhabitants of Topsy-turvyLand. That is all upside down too. The Lord Jesus teaches us to pray insecret not to be seen of men; we are to go quietly alone and tell Godeverything. But Mohammed, the prophet of Arabia, taught his followers topray openly on any street corner, or on the deck of a ship, in public,just like the Pharisees whom Jesus condemns. And when these people fast,as they are supposed to for a whole month, they do not really go withoutfood, but each day at _sunset_ they begin to eat in larger quantity thanusual!--because they think by such fasting to gain favour with God and donot know that to fast from sin and evil habits is the fast God wants.Another thing very sad in this land of Topsy-turvy is that there are noSunday-schools--they do not observe our Sabbath--and the boys and girls donot have bright Sunday-school lesson leaves or a picture-roll. They spendSunday and every other day in learning all the evil they see in those thatare grown up. Poor children! They have never heard the sweet words ofJesus, "Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not: for ofsuch is the kingdom of God." We tell you all this about them that you maypray for them that God may soon send more missionaries to preach to themthese precious words. We want you all by prayer and offerings to help puta silver lining in the dark clouds of their lives.The other chapters in this little book will tell you more about the landand its people and as you read them do not forget to pray for them.If you are faithful and true, always shining for Jesus, your bright lightwill reach as far as dark Arabia, and will help to turn that land ofTopsy-turvy right side up. When joy and gladness will take the place ofsorrow and sadness, and ignorance give way to the knowledge of the Truth.In one place in the Bible it tells how to make these topsy-turvy landsright side up again. Do you know where that is? Acts 17:6-7. "_These thathave turned the world upside down are come hither also ... saying thatthere is another King, even_ JESUS."IIA LESSON IN GEOGRAPHYIn the atlas Arabia looks like a big mail-pouch hung up by the side ofsome railway station, pretty empty of everything. But this queermail-pouch country is not as empty as people imagine. It is a countrylarger than all of the United States east of the Mississippi. It is longerthan the longest mail-pouch and much wider. From north to south you canride a camel one thousand miles and from east to west more than sixhundred. But the geography of the country is topsy-turvy altogether andthat is why it has been so long a neglected peninsula. People kept onwondering at the queer exterior of the mail-pouch and never opened thelock to its secrets by looking into the interior.First of all, Arabia is perhaps the only land that has three of itsboundaries fixed and the other always shifting. Such is the case with thenorthern boundary of Arabia. It is different on every map and changesevery year because the inhabitants go about as nomads; that is, they "haveno continuing city."Arabia has no rivers except underground. It has no railroad and very fewroads at all. Some parts of the country are very green and fertile and inother parts there is not enough grass the year around to give one squaremeal to a single grasshopper. Arabia has four thousand miles of coast andyet only six harbours where steamers call. There are better maps of theNorth Pole and of Mars and of the moon than of southeastern Arabia. Thereason is that men have spent millions of dollars to find the North Poleand telescopes are all the time looking at the moon; but no one has everspent time or money to explore this part of Arabia. The Greek geographershad a better knowledge of Arabia than we have to-day.[Illustration: MAP OF ARABIA.]There are no lakes in Arabia, but there is a large sea of sand called _AlAhkaf_, in which the traveller Von Wrede threw a lead and line and foundno bottom! No one has been there since to see whether his story was true.At Bahrein, in eastern Arabia, there are salt-water wells on shore andfresh-water springs in the midst of the salt sea from which water isbrought to shore. Arabia has no postage-stamps and no political capitaland no telegraph system. Different coins from different parts of the worldare used in different provinces. It is a land of contradictions and eventhe waters that bound it are misnamed. The Red Sea is blue; the PersianGulf has no Persian ships and should be called an English lake; and the_Straits_ of Hormuz are crooked. This topsy-turvy land has no politicaldivisions. Some say it has five and some seven provinces; no one knowswhat is its population as no census was ever taken. In nearly allcountries the mountain ranges run north and south, but in Arabia they runnearly east and west. There are desert sands six hundred feet deep andmountain peaks nine thousand feet high. On the coasts it is fearfully hotand the climate is often deadly. On the highlands it is often bitterlycold; and yet the people are all of the same race and speech and customand language and religion.[Illustration: READY FOR A CAMEL RIDE.]There are no pumps in Arabia, but plenty of wells. There are no woods inArabia, but plenty of trees. The camel is a topsy-turvy ship and theostrich a topsy-turvy bird. The Arabs call the former the ship of thedesert; and the latter they say is half camel and half bird. In some partsof Arabia horses and cows are fed on boiled fish because that is cheaperthan grass! In other parts of the country donkeys are fed on dates. Arabiahas more sultans and princes than any other country of the same size andyet it is a land without a settled government. The people never meet oneanother without saying "Peace to you"; yet there has never been any peaceover the whole land since Christ's birth or even since the days ofIshmael.Every one carries a weapon and yet there are very few wild animals. It ismore dangerous to meet a Bedouin than a lion when you are a stranger onthe road. The Arabs are a nation of robbers. Now you will wonder how wecan also say that Orientals are the most hospitable of any people in theworld for the Arabs are Orientals. And yet it is strictly true that theserobbers are more hospitable, in a way, than you people of Westerncountries. They have a proverb which says that "Every stranger is aninvited guest"; and another which says, "The guest while in the house isits lord." If an Arab gets after you to rob or kill you, it is onlynecessary to take refuge in his tent for safety. He is bound then, by therules of Oriental hospitality, to treat you as his guest. But you must notstay there too long and you must be careful how you get away! You willfind instances of this respect for the duty of hospitality all through theBible story. It was in the earliest Bible times, as later and as now, agrievous sin to be inhospitable. The cradle of the Mohammedan religion isArabia, and yet in no country are they more ignorant of their religion.How sad to think that when they do worship God they do it in such anignorant and idolatrous way! In our next chapter we shall see more aboutthis.Arabia has no national flag, no national hymn and no national feeling.Every one lives for himself and no one cares for his neighbour. This doesnot sound strange of robbers but it does of people who are so hospitable.This queer country we are about to visit together and talk over with eachother.You will not grow weary by the way, we hope. If the desert tracks are longand tiresome through the following chapters, just refresh yourself in theoasis of a picture.IIITHE SQUARE-HOUSE WITH THE BLACK OVERCOATYou think I am making fun but it is really true that in western Arabiathere is a house that always wears an overcoat. This is a large, squarestone house without windows and with only one door to let in the light andthe air; it is empty inside, although crowds gather around it as you seein the picture. Yet this house always has on an overcoat of black silk,very heavy and richly embroidered. Every year the old coat is taken offand a new one put on. A few days ago a Moslem pilgrim showed me a piece ofthe cloth of last year's overcoat and he was very proud of it. It wasindeed a fine piece of heavy silk and the names of God and Mohammed wereprettily woven into the cloth. This man had just come from visiting thesquare-house and I will tell you what he saw.The place he visited with hundreds and thousands of other pilgrims iscalled Mecca and the square-house is the _Beit Allah_ or house of God toall Mohammedans. It is also called the _Kaaba_, which is the Arabic wordfor a cube.The Moslems believe all sorts of foolish things about the Kaaba. They sayAdam built it as soon as he fell down on the earth out of Paradise, andthat Abraham repaired it after it had been ruined by the flood in the daysof Noah. They even show a large white stone on which Abraham and Ishmaelstood when they plastered the walls; the stone still bears the impress ofAbraham's feet, they say. Did you ever hear such a topsy-turvy story?The building is about twenty-four cubits long and wide and nearly twentycubits high. It has no ornaments or beauty except one rain-spout to carrythe water off the flat roof; you can see it on the right side of the Kaabaon the picture. This spout is said to be of pure gold. In one corner ofthe building is a large black stone which is also an object of worship.The Mohammedans say it came down from heaven with Adam and was once purewhite. By the many kisses of sinful worshippers it has turned black. Notonly is it black but broken. For about three hundred years afterMohammed's death the stone remained imbedded in the walls of the Kaaba,but then some wild Arabs from the Persian Gulf came, sacked Mecca andstole the black stone. It was carried to Katif, a place near Bahrein,right across Arabia, and they kept it a long time until the people ofMecca paid a large sum of money and carried it back. On the long journeyit must have fallen from the camel because, at present, it is cracked andthe broken pieces are held together by a silver band. There once were agreat many of these stone idols in the Kaaba, but Mohammed destroyed themall except this one when he became master of Mecca.[Illustration: THE SQUARE HOUSE WITH THE BLACK OVERCOAT.]At present the stone house is empty of idols and yet all the Moslems turnin the direction of this old heathen temple to pray. The cloth that coversit comes every year as a present from the Khedive of Egypt, who is aMohammedan. It is very costly and is sent on a special camel, beautifullydecked with trappings of gilt, and a large throng of pilgrims go alongto escort the overcoat.When the wind stirs the heavy folds of cloth, the pious boys and girls ofMecca say it is the angels that watch around the Kaaba, whose wings liftthe covering. It must be a wonderful sight to see thousands of Moslempilgrims stand around this place and kneel and pray.Besides running around the Kaaba, kissing the black stone and drinkingwater from a holy well called _zemzem_, they have one day on which theysacrifice sheep or other animals. One curious custom on this day ofsacrifice I must tell you of. It is called "stoning the great devil."Early in the morning thousands of pilgrims go to a place in the valley ofMina where there are three white pillars made of masonry; the first andlargest is called the Great Devil. The pilgrims cast stones at thispillar. Each one must stand at the distance of not less than fifteen feetand say, as he throws seven pebbles: "In the name of God the Almighty I dothis, and in hatred of the devil and his shame." The Moslems fail torealise that Satan is in the hearts of men and not behind a pillar, northat he can be driven away with prayer better than by pebbles.For thirteen hundred years Moslems have come every year to Mecca, and goneaway, with no one ever to tell them of the Son of God, the Saviour of theWorld. Thirteen hundred years! Don't you think it is time to go and tellthem? And will you not pray that even this place may open its doors toJesus Christ, and crown Him Lord of all?IVSABBACH-KUM BIL KHEIR!That is to say, "Good-morning!" And the Arabs in the picture do not add,"have you used Pears' Soap?" but, "have you had your cup of Mocha coffee?"Soap is a luxury in most parts of Arabia and the vast majority of itsinhabitants never use it; millions would not know it if they saw it.Perhaps the old Sheikh, however, used a bit of soap to wash his hands andfeet early before sunrise when he went to the mosque to pray. Now he hasreturned and sits in the coffee-shop ready to take a sip of coffee and"drink tobacco" from the long pipe. The Arabs always speak of _drinking_tobacco when they mean to smoke; I suppose one reason is because they usethe peculiar water-pipes with the long stems in which the smoke passesthrough the water and bubbles out to the mouth. Have you time to stop andstudy the picture with me?What a pretty window in the corner! The Arabs call a window _shibaak_,which means network, because their windows are very much like a fish-net.Glass is seldom used in Arabia except by Europeans and Arabs who havebecome civilised; and so the carpenter or joiner fits little round bars,one into the other, like marbles or beads on a string and the result isoften very beautiful. Light and air come in (not to speak of clouds ofdust) while no one can look through from the outside; and you know howafraid Arab girls and women are to show their faces to strangers.Under the arch is the open fireplace where the big coffee-pots andwater-kettles simmer all day on a charcoal fire. The old man looks quitecheerful seated on his uncomfortable stool made of date-sticks. You willread later about our old friend the date-palm and how the tree is used fornearly every purpose. I wish I could show you how they take the thinbranches and punch holes in them and then deftly, before you can countninety, build together a chair or a bedstead. I have often slept soundlyand safely on bedsteads made of these thin leaf-sticks no bigger aroundthan a child's finger. The sticks are full of "spring" so one does notneed a wire mattress, nor have I ever known one of them, if made honestly,to become a _folding bed_ under a restless sleeper as they say happenssometimes in New York hotels!Although the old man in our picture is waited on by the younger Arab (whois perhaps the keeper of the cafe), yet I know he is not rich. Do younotice his toil-worn hands and the patch on the shoulder of his longovercoat? I fancy too his pretty vest, so carefully buttoned by more thana dozen cloth buttons, is a little torn on one side; nor has he a finegirdle like the rich shopkeepers.[Illustration: SABBACH-KUM BIL KHEIR!]Extremes meet in the picture and three countries widely apart on the mapare brought close together. Of course, you know the coffee is the realYemen article, which coming first from Mocha on the Red Sea, is stillcalled by that Arabian name. The curious pipe with its round bottom,carved head-piece and long stem, is used everywhere in Arabia and isgenerally called _"nargeelie,"_ which is the Indian name for cocoanut. Thebowl of the pipe is in fact an empty cocoanut shell; the stem once grew inthe jungle and perhaps tigers brushed past it; now it is pierced to drawsmoke.The curious pipe is from India, the tobacco first came from America butthe coffee is Arabian. Let us listen to the story of the cup of coffee: Ina book published in 1566 by an Arab scholar on the virtues of coffee it isstated that a knowledge of coffee was first brought to Arabia fromAbyssinia about the year 1400 by a pious man whose tomb is still veneratedin Yemen. The knowledge of coffee spread from Yemen in south Arabia overthe whole world. In 1690 Van Hoorne, a general of the Dutch East Indiacompany, received a few coffee seeds from the Arabs at Mocha and plantedthem in Batavia on the island of Java. In this way Mocha coffee has becomethe mother of Java and of all other kinds of coffee sold at your grocers'.Nothing can be more beautiful than the green hills and fertile gardens inthe Arabian coffee country. The coffee berry grows on an evergreen tree ofabout eighteen feet high; its leaves are a beautiful dark, shining greenand the blossom of the tree is pure white with a most delicate andfragrant odour. Each tree bears an enormous number of coffee-berries; asingle tree is said to have yielded sixteen pounds! Arabia not onlyproduces the finest coffee in the world, but I think the Arabs know howto prepare a good cup of coffee better than other peoples. The raw bean isroasted just before it is used and so keeps all its strength; it is_pounded_ fine, much finer than you can grind it, in a mortar, with aniron pestle; lastly two smelling herbs, _heyl_ and saffron are added whenit is boiled just enough to give a flavour. Some fibres of palm bark arestuck into the spout of the coffee-pot to act as a strainer and then theclear brown liquid is poured into a tiny cup and handed to you in thecoffee-shop. No wonder the Arab dervishes smack their lips over this,their only luxury.But how did the tobacco get into our picture? You can hunt up the storyfor yourselves in your school histories. Had not Sir Walter Raleigh in1586 introduced the weed to the court of Queen Elizabeth from Virginia,our picture and social life in Arabia would be very different. The customof puffing tobacco has spread like a prairie fire and it is now so commonin the East that very few realise it was not always found there. Therethey are all together, an Indian pipe, Arabian coffee and Americantobacco! How much faster and further tobacco has travelled than the Bible;how many people had begun to drink Mocha before Arabia had a missionary!But, of course, nothing can travel for nothing; and somebody must pay thetravelling expenses. America pays many millions more for tobacco in a yearthan it pays for missionaries. It is not surprising, therefore, that allArabians smoke and only a very few have ever heard of the Son of God, theSaviour of the world. As Jesus Himself said, "the children of this worldare wiser in their generation than the children of light." When peoplelearn to love missions as much and as often as they do a good cigar and acup of coffee there will be no need of mite boxes. God hasten the day.VAT THE CORNER GROCERYIt is not a very long distance from the Arab coffee-shop where we left ourfriend smoking, to the grocer. The streets are very narrow and unless weare very careful that camel will crowd us to the wall or those water-skinson the white donkey wet our clothes--see how they drip! Well, one turnmore and here we are. The grocer in the picture on the next page isleaning on his elbow waiting for a customer. And if he keeps his groceriesas free from flies and ants as he does his spotless white turban we willbuy our day's supplies here. The shops in Arabia are not very large andthey have no place for customers except outside. Sometimes there is a sortof raised seat or bench on which the purchaser sits when he bargains forsomething; but generally you have to stand up outside while the crowdspush and the traffic goes on. One curious custom is that all the shops ofone kind cluster close together in one street or section of the town. Youwill see for example in one street a long row of shops where they selldrugs and perfumery; in another place there are only hardware merchants;again a whole street of nothing but grocers. I think the reason is thatArabs love to bargain and to beat down prices and so it is easier to haveall the merchants of one kind close together. At any rate this arrangementmakes it quite convenient for the purchaser. Indeed it is becomingsomewhat customary to group the shops in this way in some of your Westerncities. Occidental civilisation can learn some things from the Orient![Illustration: ARAB GROCER.]Our shopkeeper has a mixed lot of groceries in his shop; many things whichyou would find at your grocers' he has never heard of. Everything istopsy-turvy. Just fancy how strange to hang up the sugar in a row of coneson strings like sausages! Do you see them on the ceiling of the shop inour picture? That is the way white sugar comes wrapped from France and issold in Arabia. A sugar _barrel_ would soon be full of ants in thiscountry; but when it hangs up on a string the ants have a hard timegetting it away. Maybe there is a suggestion here for your homes if youare troubled with ants.In those big Arab baskets the grocer keeps his carrots and othervegetables; carrots are white in Arabia and there are curious vegetablesof which you have never heard.Do you see the bottles and tin boxes on his shelves? Those are for spices;pepper, cinnamon, nutmegs, curry-powder and such things of which Arabhousewives are very fond.The big bowl on the left probably has olives in it or other kind ofpickled vegetables. On the right you can see the big pair of old fashionedscales on which he weighs his wares. I hope he is an honest man, althoughI do not think he looks very honest, do you? The scale hangs true I haveno doubt; but it is in the weights that deception lurks. In Arabia we canevery day see illustrations of the words of Solomon in the book ofProverbs about "divers weights" and "false balances." The most of theshopkeepers do not have proper weights of iron or brass, but use ordinarycobblestones and pebbles. Only a few days ago I bought some walnuts andthe grocer weighed them so many stones' weight! Do you know what a "stone"weight is. Maybe you had better look it up in your dictionary. Thatcovered kettle near the scale-pans on top of the little box contains_semn_, which is the Arabic name for sheep's fat. You would hardly believeme if I told you what a lot of this greasy yellow stuff the boys and girlseat on their rice, and how much is used in an Arab kitchen. It is sold byweight, just as well as all other things, even _milk_ in Arabia. If wewait long enough you will see Fatimah and Mirjam and the other girls comewith empty bowls to buy so many pennies' worth of grease.Do you notice that the shop has queer little doors on the lower part ofthe front opening? The other part of the shop is closed by a flap-doorthat does not show on the picture. This is hinged from the top and is usedwhen the shop is open as a sort of blind to keep off the sun or the rain.When the shopkeeper leaves his shop for a half hour or so he hangs a sortof fish-net over the opening of his shop and never needs to lock it. Thisis a curious custom, and I have often wondered how the shops were safefrom stealing boys or robbers in such cases. It is one more instance ofhow different the East is from the West.The shopkeepers generally close their shops at sunset, and only in a veryfew places are there people who buy and sell or go about to do shoppingby lamplight. Our grocer on the corner has provided for emergencies, andthe large Arabian lantern ought to light up all his little shop.Across the street is the place where they sell crockery. The salesman isout, but his boy, as you see, has taken the opportunity to eat someapples. I wonder whether he got them at the grocer's?[Illustration: ARAB BOY IN A CROCKERY SHOP. (Float this image to theright.)]His father sells water-jugs and jars made of porous earth. Oh what ablessing those jars are to all the people of this hot and dry country. Wehave no ice in Arabia and so no refrigerators; the wells are never verydeep and the water comes a long distance. So if it were not for thecrockery man and his water-jugs we could never drink _cold_ water. Butjust pour the water in one of these earthen pots and hang it in the windand then in a few minutes the water gets cold. We missionaries always havesuch water-jars hanging or standing in our windows to catch the breeze.Perhaps this kind of water-cooler is very old, and Solomon himself lookedat one when he wrote the words: "As cold waters to a thirsty soul so isgood news from a far country."VIBLIND FATIMAHIt was on a Sunday afternoon that I first met Blind Fatimah and greetedher with _Salaam aleikum_ and she answered _aleikum es salaam!_ "Peace beto you and on you be peace." I asked if she could read. She said she could"read by heart," but could not see anything. She at that time could repeattwenty-six chapters of the Koran, the sacred book of the Mohammedans. NowI think she can repeat it nearly all; it contains one hundred and fourteenchapters. Some are very short and others are very long; some parts of thebook are very good, but most of it is a jumble of events and of thingsthat never happened--all mixed up topsy-turvy.A slave woman was Fatimah's teacher and now she is helper in the school ofthis teacher. She is the prompter, and always begins each sentence of therecitation, and the other children follow on. If any mistakes are made,she will instantly correct them.She is a peculiar looking girl and she is not pretty. Her clothes consistof cast off garments given her by others. Her head is generally coveredand wrapped up in a black muslin veil; then she has an _abba_ or Arabiancloak of very green-black cashmere; then under that a many colouredgarment called a _thobe_; it is square in pattern with armholes andsleeves nearly a yard wide. The ends of these wide sleeves are deftlytaken and thrown over the head to form a sort of tight-fitting cap.Underneath this garment is a kind of dressing gown with tight-fittingsleeves. Such is Fatimah's wardrobe. She wears no shoes, not even sandals.Would you like to walk in the hot sand with no covering for your feet?Sometimes I visit the school where Fatimah teaches the smaller girls A, B,C. It is a topsy-turvy school indeed. The object seems to be to make asmuch noise as possible; the pupils sit on the floor with a small stand ortrestle (like a saw-buck!) in front of each one to hold their Korans outof which they read. The first pupil begins a sentence at the top of his,or her, voice and then in a sort of refrain it is taken up by all theothers. The teacher sits outside the school very often sewing or preparinga meal or entertaining visitors; for the schoolhouse is an ordinary mathut dwelling. If however a pupil makes a mistake in reading she hearsinstantly and corrects it.When the hours of prayer come around (the Moslems you know pray five timesa day) lessons are dropped. One day I called at the school at the time ofafternoon prayer. All the children had run down to the sea, to wash theirfaces and hands and feet, so as to be quite pure outwardly, when repeatingMohammed's prayers.In the accompanying picture of a Moslem boy praying you will see whatthose forms are and how much _form_ there is to go through. Blind Fatimahstood with her hands clasped, looking upward with those sightless eyes,her lips moving. Then she fell on her knees, with the little, thin handsspread out; then she bowed down until her forehead touched the earth,continuing in that position for a little time; then she got up, and withanother upward look and motion of the lips, the devotions were ended.[Illustration: HOW A MOSLEM BOY PRAYS.]I prayed there, too, that her eyes might be opened to see Jesus as her ownSaviour, and that she might know Him as the _Son of God_, and not merelyas one of the many prophets mentioned in the Koran. It seemed such a sadsight to see this blind child, doubly blind because her religion is false,and she is resting on a false hope.She always listens when I tell her, or read to her about God, and JesusChrist the Saviour. And if you would help together by your daily prayers,perhaps soon God will give the answer. Would it not be blessed for you andme if some day blind Fatimah should have opened eyes; not to see the dategroves, and the sea, and the beautiful sunsets of Bahrein, but farmore--to see Jesus' face and to follow Him by leading others to Him?    "For thousands and thousands who wander and fall,      Never heard of that heavenly home;    I should like them to know there is room for them all,      And that Jesus has bid them to come.    I long for the joy of that glorious time,      The sweetest and brightest and best,    When the dear little children of every clime      Shall crowd to His arms and be blest."VIIDATES AND SUGAR-CANEThis is the sweetest chapter in the book. The pictures are enough to makeone's mouth water and give one an appetite for Arabian dates. I do notsuppose there is a boy or girl in England or America that has not eatenthe fruit of the Arabian palm tree; but how many of you know the taste ofsugar-cane?In many parts of Arabia, especially at Busrah and along the river Tigris,you can see the sugar-cane sellers sit by the wayside and dispose of thisArabian stick-candy to the boys and girls in exchange for coppers. Thewoman in the picture has chosen the shelter of a date tree and beside thetall bundles of cane she has oranges for sale as well. The sugar-cane iscut into pieces and sold "by the knot"; that is, by the length of thestick from one knot to the next. It is not expensive and I have seen eventhe very poorest children suck their cane on the way home as happy assugar can make them. The sugar-cane is a kind of grass but it grows totwice the height of a boy and is over two inches in circumference. Thestems are smooth, shining and hard on the outside, but inside they areporous and the pores are full of sugar sap. The sugar-cane first came fromIndia, but the Arabs spread its cultivation as far as Morocco and Sicily;so that it is no wonder that the word "sugar" itself comes from theArabic. Yet it shows how ignorant the Arabs are to-day because, althoughthey have sugar-cane, _their_ sugar nearly all comes from Europe. They donot know how to manufacture it and therefore eat the sugar-cane raw.[Illustration: WOMAN SELLING SUGAR-CANE.]Sweeter than sugar-cane and much more plentiful is the date. There is noplace in all Arabia where you do not see the date palm growing, and seldomcan you eat a meal in any part of the country but dates are part of thebill-of-fare. In fact thousands of people in Arabia have nothing but datesto eat from January to December! So plentiful are they that even donkeysand camels are fed on dates in some districts.Many of the dates you buy in your own country come from Arabia. On thebest kind of dates which come in wooden boxes you will find Muscat orBusrah stamped to show from what place they were shipped. There are verymany kinds of dates in Arabia, and only a very few sorts are sent abroad.Some of them are too delicate to stand the long voyage and others arefound only in small quantities. I do not think any of the dates that reachAmerica equal those we pick from the palm tree ourselves here inArabia--no more than dried apple rings taste as good as ripe juicy sweetapples from the orchard. When the dates ripen in September they arepicked, sorted, and then packed in layers by the Arab women and boys whoget paid for this work. Large steamships are loaded down with these boxesand many of them leave Busrah every year with no other cargo than dates.[Illustration: DATES GROWING ON A DATE PALM.]The date tree is very beautiful. I think it is the most beautiful of allthe palms. It is no wonder that a palm branch is the symbol of victory inthe Bible and that the psalmist compares the life of a righteous man to apalm-tree! How straight and beautifully proportioned is the tall trunk ofthe tree. It is an evergreen and is always flourishing winter and summer.It is a lovely sight to see the huge clusters of ripening fruit,golden-yellow or reddish-brown, amid the bright green branches. Along therivers in the north of Arabia, at Hassa and in Oman, date orchards stretchfor miles and miles as far as you can see. Some of the Arabs have suchlarge date gardens that they do not know the number of their trees. How doyou suppose they climb the tree? The Arabs have no ladders and indeed itwould be hard to make a ladder long enough to reach to the top of a tallpalm tree. So they use a rope band which goes around the trunk of the treeand around their waist; it is shoved up little by little and the Arab putshis bare feet on the rough bark of the tree and so climbs up as easily asa monkey. The palm tree is perhaps the most useful tree in the world.Every part of it is used for something or other, and I do not see howArabia could get along without palm trees. The fruit is prepared in manydifferent ways for food. The date stones are used by the Arab children inplaying checkers and other games on the smooth sand. They are also groundup into a coarse kind of meal and this is good cattle-food. The branchesof the date tree are long and strong and thin just like a piece of rattan.From them the carpenters make beds, tables, chairs, cradles, bird-cages,reading-stands, boats, crates, kites and a dozen other useful things. Theleaves are woven into baskets, mats, fans and string. From the barkexcellent fibre makes rope of all sizes. Not a bit of the tree is wasted.Even the blossoms are used to make a kind of drink and the old musty fruitthat cannot be eaten is made into date syrup or date vinegar.In one of the pictures you see the fire wood market at Busrah. The longbranches you see are sold for kindling wood and they make a splendid fire.The heavier parts of the tree are also used for fuel and the donkeys areloaded with these date knots and date sticks in baskets. It is a busyscene and, what with braying of donkeys and shouting of thewood-merchants, there is enough noise too.[Illustration: FIRE WOOD MARKET, BUSRAH.]There is one more blessing that comes from the palm tree and which we haveforgotten. That is shade. Arabia is a hot and dry country. The summer sunis much more piercing than in America and the summer is much longer. Whenyou travel a long camel journey across the desert, oh how good it is tocome to a grove of palm trees and rest! Such a place is called an _oasis_and underneath the palms there are always springs of water. I can wellunderstand how happy the children of Israel were after their journey inthe desert, when they came to Elim where "there were twelve wells ofwater and threescore and ten palm trees." In summer time many of the townArabs leave their houses in the city and go to camp out in thedate-gardens to enjoy the cool shades. The Arab poets have written manypoems in praise of their favourite tree and fruit, but none of them are sofunny as these lines which Campbell wrote from Algiers where the date treealso flourishes and with which we will end this chapter:    "Though my letter bears date as you view    From the land of the date-bearing palm    I will palm no more puns upon you."VIIITHE SHEPHERD OF THE SEWING MACHINEIn the blue waters of the Persian Gulf there lies a coral island calledBahrein. At a few hundred yards to the northeast of it is a still smallerisland shaped like a pack-saddle, where palm trees and white coral rockhouses are reflected in the salt water at high tide. The little islandtown is called Moharrek, that is, the "Burning Place," because it is veryhot there in summer. After sailing across in a boat one day, and wendingour way through a dirty bazar full of flies and Arabs, we were directed tothe house of the man called "The Shepherd of the Sewing Machine." His realname is Mohammed bin Sooltaan, but nobody knows him by any other name ortitle than _Raeee el karkhan_, which literally means shepherd of the sewingmachine. Let me tell you his story and how he got that queer name.Years ago, as pilot on the native boats that sail from Bahrein to Bombay,Calcutta, Zanzibar and Jiddah, he had experience of a wider world than thelittle island where he was born. But the life was a hard one and his wageswere small. Moreover, the coming of steamships up the Gulf took away theprofit of the sailing craft, and so Mohammed fared from bad to worse. Heloved an Arab lass with plaited, well-greased locks of hair and a pleasantface, but her father asked a larger dowry than he could ever pay.An Arab young man must always pay a good price to the father of hissweetheart before he is allowed to marry her. But this Mohammed was toopoor to pay the price asked. What a queer topsy-turvy custom it is for aman to buy his wife just as he buys a horse or a camel! The Arabs oftenask how much a wife costs in America and wonder that we are not allowed bythe Christian laws to send away our wives and marry others.Mohammed could not stay at home so he once more went in a ship to Jiddah,the port to Mecca, where pilgrims from all the Moslem world exchangethought and money for bad bread and fanaticism. And yet even here thecivilisation of the West tries to enter. Wandering through the bazarsMohammed for the first time saw a sewing machine, in the hands of anIndian tailor. A marvel to the sailor fisherman, indeed! Almost as great amiracle to him as the Koran. The more he looked the more he coveted, andhe could not pass the place without reckoning up the possible profits ofsuch an investment should he return with it to his native island. Theresult was that he forswore the sea and preferred another kind of wheel tothat of the pilot. With many mutual _wallahs_ the bargain was concludedand the machine reached Bahrein. It was the first on the islands, and allthe sheikhs came to see its marvellous build and wonderful work. Mohammedhas a Western head on Eastern shoulders, and there was not a screw ortension from treadle to shuttle, which he did not learn the use of. It isunnecessary to state at the cost of how many broken needles he becameproficient. Amid cries of _ajeeb, ajeeb_, the first Arab shirt wasstitched together, and even the youngsters on the street imitated thewhirrr-clic-whirrr of the machine. As for Mohammed, he sewed on, and whilehis sandalled feet worked the treadle his mind worked out a problemsomething like this: Three long-shirts a day and an _abba_, at one _kran_per shirt and two for the abba, thirty-five krans per week, how long willit take to pay the dowry? An _abba_ is a large over-garment worn by bothmen and women in Arabia. It is like a cape or overcoat but has no sleevesnor buttons. The Arabs in Bahrein put a great deal of pretty embroiderywork on these garments and some of them are worth twenty or thirtydollars. But the sewing is done very cheaply. A kran is a Persian coinworth about ten cents; can you figure out how much Mohammed earned in amonth?The Shepherd of the Machine kept working away and when his hopes grewstrong he sang at his work. In a few months he paid a visit to the Mullah(the Moslem priest or teacher), and that same night the Arab fiddles anddrums rang out merry music around the palm-leaf hut of his beloved bride.But the music of the machine sounded still sweeter next morning. Dailybread, with rice, fish and dates, and on rare occasions even mutton, allcame out of the machine. He loved the very iron of it and, as he told us,read a prayer over it every morning: _Bismillahi er rahman er raheem._ Hiswas the only machine, and a small monopoly soon makes a capitalist. Hispalm branch hut was exchanged for a house of stone; and Allah blessed himgreatly. No shepherd was ever more tender to his little lambs thanMohammed to the old machine.When we entered the house on our first visit, there stood the machine! Notmuch the worse for wear, and with "_Pfaff_. C. Theodosius,Constantinople," still legible on the nickel-plate. But the old machinehad found a rival. By its side stood another make of machine which lookedstrangely familiar to American eyes. It was while comparing the machinesand drinking Arab coffee that we learned from Mohammed why he prized theold one as better. "Wallah," he said, "I would not sell it for many timesits original price. There is blessing in it, and all I have comes fromthat machine, praise be to Allah." And so we sipped his cups and heard hisstory and ceased to wonder why he was called the Shepherd of the Sewingmachine. The shepherd has a brother who wants to learn English and goes toBombay every year--but that is another story.There are many other sewing machines in Bahrein now, but Mohammed's wasthe first, and he introduced the others. Do you not think that he shouldbe called the Christopher Columbus of Bahrein tailors?IXTHE CHILDREN OF THE DESERTAbout one-third of Topsy-turvy Land is desert and is the home of thoseArabs that wander about from place to place and are called nomads or_Bedouin_. The word Bedouin means a desert-dweller. But you must not thinkthat a desert is a flat country covered with a deep layer of sand withouttrees or shrubs. Oh no! There are such deserts in Arabia too, but thegreater part of what is called desert is much more attractive and is only_desert_ because it has no settled population and no villages. The soil isoften very good and in springtime after the rains the whole of northernArabia (where most of the nomads pitch their tents) is one vast prairie ofwild flowers and green grass. The Arabs of the North are rich in flocksand herds. I am sure you can still find some who, like Job, have seventhousand sheep and three thousand camels and a very great household. Theyall live in tents and the tents of Arabia are not white and round likecircus tents but jet black and square or oblong. You remember the Biblealways speaks of the _black_ tents of Kedar. They are black because theyare woven from goat's hair which is used also for their garments and isalmost as good a waterproof covering as india rubber. But when you have tospend a long hot day under such a roof as I have done you feel sorry forthe Arabs that they have no better protection against the blazing sun.Everything is home-made and clumsy, but shall I tell you what I havefound? There is no warmer hospitality in all the wide world than in thesetents of Kedar. A few weeks ago I spent a Sabbath day resting by the wayin one of these tents. The women brought water to cool my head; a greatbowl of camel's milk was our drink even before they asked our errand; andat night they killed a fat kid and made a guest meal fit for an epicure.The Arabs of the desert are more ignorant than those of the towns, butthey are much kinder to strangers and treat their wives and childrenbetter. Their life is rather monotonous, but they enjoy it. Like theAmerican Indians they prefer a tent to a house, and would rather changetheir home every day than settle down as farmers. When pasture fails fortheir flocks of sheep the chief gives notice and on the morrow the wholecamp has moved away. Some tribes move every month and go for a longdistance to find fresh pastures.[Illustration: ARAB RIDERS WITH LANCES.]The Bedouin are divided into many tribes and clans. Some of them arefriendly to each other but nearly all are at war with one another all theyear round. Robbery and murder are very frequent. Every one goes armedwith a long spear or with a gun, and many carry a war club and a sword aswell. The largest Arab tribes and the wealthiest are the _Anaeze_ and the_Shommar_. They have many fine horses. In the picture you see a group ofthem armed with their long spears. The spear of the leader is ornamentedwith a tuft of ostrich feathers; these spears are often over twelve feetlong and have a sharp steel lance at the end. The Arabs are fond ofgames, especially galloping their horses and playing at war. They are veryskillful riders and kind to their steeds; they do not spend much time ingrooming them and they never use a whip and seldom a bit. Their bridle islike our halter strap, and the horse is so well trained that he needs noiron bit in his mouth.One of the most interesting of all the Arab tribes is called _theSuleibi_. They are despised by all the other Arabs and seem to be of adifferent race. The women of this tribe are remarkable for their beautyand the men for their skill as blacksmiths and tinkers. They are alwayssought after to do the tinkering for the Arabs of all other tribes. Theyhave no camels or horses but ride little donkeys and dress in gazelleskins. Some people think that this tribe is a remnant of the Christianpopulation of Arabia; they have many curious beliefs and their name means,"Those-of-the-Cross." Perhaps some day a missionary will bring them backto a true knowledge of the Crucified One.The nomads of Arabia are happy in springtime when there is enough grassfor their flocks and the wells of the desert are full of water. But afterthe long summer drought there is often a great scarcity of food and evenfamine in many parts of Arabia. Then the nomads eat anything and drink thebrackish water from the bottom of a mud pool with relish. In no country inthe world is water so costly as in Arabia; nowhere is it so carefullyused; an Arab never wastes a drop of water and looks surprised and painedwhen an European traveller rinses out a cup before drinking! The nomadArabs eat locusts and wild honey as did John the Baptist. But I have alsoseen them eat the big lizards of the desert and the jerboas--a sort ofdesert rat. An Arab once stood amidst a circle of jewellers at Busrah andsaid: "On one occasion I had missed my way in the desert, and having noroad-provision left, I had given myself up for lost, when all at once Ifound a bag of pearls. Never shall I forget that relish and delight solong as I mistook them for parched wheat; nor that bitterness anddisappointment when I discovered that they were real pearls!" This storyis told by a Persian poet and although it may not be true yet it teaches alesson. To a hungry man a handful of wheat is better than all the pearlsof the ocean.[Illustration: PEARL MERCHANTS.]In his tent the Arab is very lazy. His only occupation is feeding hishorses or milking his camels. The Arab girls go out to take care of theflocks while the wife performs all the domestic duties. She grinds wheatin the hand-mill; kneads and bakes bread; makes butter by shaking the milkin a leather bag; fetches water in a skin; works at the loom and is busyall the time. The Arab smokes his pipe, drinks coffee and talks to hisfriends; unless he is on the march or on a robbery excursion his lifeseems very lazy.[Illustration: ARABIAN WATER-BOTTLE.]Scarcely any of the Bedouin can read, and they have neither schools normosques. The Bedouin sometimes say, "Mohammed's religion cannot have beenintended for us; it demands washings, but we have no water; alms, but wehave no money; pilgrimage to Mecca, but we are always wandering and God iseverywhere." Yet outwardly they observe the Moslem religion of which theyknow so little. In our next chapter you will read how earnestly even thenomad children pray in the desert. And I believe God loves these sons ofIshmael and will yet bring them back to Abraham's faith. Don't you thinkso too?XNOORAH'S PRAYERFor many days the sailing craft from Bahrein had been unloading Indianwares at the port of Ojeir on the Hassa coast, and for many hours the busythrong of Bedouin drivers and merchants and onlookers were loading thecaravan, emphasising their task or their impatience with great oaths,almost as guttural and angry as the noise of the camels. At length, withthe pious cry of _Tawakalna_, "we have trusted in God," they are off.A caravan is composed of companies, and while the whole host numberedseven hundred camels, with merchants and travellers and drivers, _our_company from Ojeir to Hofhoof counted only six. There was Salih and Nasir,a second son of the desert, both from Riad; a poor unfortunate lad withstumpy hands and feet, who limped about on rag shoes and seemed quitehappy; there was Noorah and her sister, and lastly, the missionary.But for the shuffling of the desert sand and the whack of a driving stickthe caravan marched in silence. The sun shone full in our faces as itslowly sank in the west, its last rays coloured the clouds hanging overthe lowlands of Hassa a bright red, and when it disappeared we heard thesheikhs of the companies, one after the other, call to prayer. Only a partof the caravan responded. The Turkish soldiers on horseback kept on theirway; the most pious of the merchants had already urged their beasts aheadof the rest and had finished a duty that interfered with a speedy journeyand the first choice of location at the night encampment; some excusedthemselves by quoting a Koran text, and others took no notice of the call.Not so the Bedouin child Noorah and her younger sister. They had trudgedon foot four long hours, armed with sticks to urge on that lazy whitecamel, always loitering to snatch a bite of desert-thorn with his giantjaws. A short time before sunset I saw the two children mount the animalby climbing up its neck, as only Arabs can, but now, at call to prayerthey devoutly slipped down. Hand in hand they ran ahead a short distance,shuffled aside some sand with their bare feet, rubbed some on their hands,(as do all pious Moslems in the absence of water), faced Mecca, andprayed.As they did then, so at sunrise and at noon and at four o'clock and sunsetand when the evening star disappeared--five times a day--they prayed. Itis not true, as is generally supposed, that women in Moslem lands do notpray. Only at Mecca, as far as I know, of all Arabia, are they allowed aplace in the _public mosques_, but at home a larger per cent. observe thetimes of prayer than do the men.When Noorah had ended her prayer and resumed the task of belabouring thewhite camel, she turned to me with a question, _"Laish ma tesully anta?"_which with Bedouin bluntness means, "_You_, why don't you pray?" Thequestion set me musing half the night; not, I confess, about my ownprayers, but about hers. Why did Noorah pray? What did Noorah pray? Didshe understand that    Prayer is the burden of a sigh, the falling of a tear,    The upward glancing of the eye when only God is near,as well as the dead formalism of the mosque? How could I answer herquestion in a way that she might well understand? And if hers, too, was asincere prayer, as I believe,--the prayer of an ignorant child of thedesert,--did she pray words or thoughts? What do Noorah and her more thantwo million Bedouin sisters ask of God five times daily? Leaving out vainrepetitions, this is what they say:    "In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate;    Praise be to God who the two worlds made;    Thee do we entreat and Thee do we supplicate;    Lead us in the way the straight,    The way of those whom Thou dost compassionate,    Not of those on whom is hate    Nor those that deviate. Amen."It is the first chapter of the Koran and is used by Moslems as we use theLord's Prayer. The words are very beautiful I think, don't you?Whether Noorah understood what she asked I know not; but to me who saw andheard in the desert twilight, (as under like conditions to you), theprayer was full of pathos. The desert! where God is, and where but for Hismercy and compassion death and solitude would reign alone; the desert, aworld of its own kind, a sea of sand, with no life in it except the LivingOne, and over it only His canopy of stars--God of the two worlds! And tothat God, than whom there is no other, and whom they ignorantly worship,these sons and daughters of outcast Ishmael bow their faces in the dustand five times daily entreat and supplicate to be led aright in the way oftruth.They ask to be directed into the _straight_ way, but oh how crooked is theway of God which Mohammed taught in his book! Sadder still, what a crookedway it is that the Moslems walk! Impure words, lying lips, hands thatsteal and feet that run after cruelty--these are what children in Arabiapossess. But I dare say that some of them are really sorry for their sinsand when they pray like Noorah in the desert they want to have peace andpardon. Are they looking unconsciously perhaps for the footprints in thedesert of One who said, "I am the Way, the Truth and the Life"?Alas, Noorah and her many sisters (your sisters, too) have never seen Hisbeauty nor heard of His love! They do not know that the "way of those whomThou dost compassionate" is the new and living way through Christ's crossand death. They are ignorant of the awful word, "He that believeth not onthe Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him." Has Godthe Merciful then not heard Noorah's prayer? Will He not answer it? Is Hismercy to these children of Abraham clean gone forever? How long they havewaited and how many of the desert children are now sleeping in littledesert graves! Do you not think God wants _you_ to carry the gospel tothem and send them teachers to learn the way of Jesus?Think of Noorah's question, "_You_, why don't you pray?" Think of Christ'swords, _"Go tell quickly."_     "ARABIA THE LOVED."    There's a land since long neglected,      There's a people still rejected,    But of truth and grace elected,      In His love for them.    Softer than their night wind's fleeting,      Richer than their starry tenting,    Stronger than their sands protecting,      Is His love for them.    To the host of Islam's leading,      To the slave in bondage bleeding,    To the desert dweller pleading,      Bring His love to them.    Through the promise on God's pages,      Through His work in history's stages,    Through the cross that crowns the ages,      Show His love to them.    With the prayer that still availeth      With the power that prevaileth,    With the love that never faileth,      Tell His love to them.    Till the desert's sons now aliens,      Till its tribes and their dominions,    Till Arabia's raptured millions,      Praise His love of them.    --J.G.L.XIPICTURES WITH WORDS ONLYYou already know many curious facts about the people of Topsy-turvy Land.Would you like to hear something about their language and their writing?The language of this land is very old, almost as old as its camels or itsdesert sands. The Moslems even go so far as to say that Adam and Eve spokeArabic in Paradise and they say it is called the language of the angels.It is written from right to left just in the opposite way of this page ofEnglish writing. The Arabic alphabet has twenty-eight letters, all ofwhich are considered consonants. There are marks put above and below theline to show the sounds of the vowels; just as we wrote the word _potato_in our first chapter.Arabic grammar is much more difficult than English grammar, and even theboys who attend the big Arabic college of El Azhar in Cairo, Egypt, mustfind its study a bugbear. Just think of learning _fifteen_ conjugationsinstead of the much smaller number in Latin or Greek! The books used inMoslem schools would look very crude and dull to you who learnt your A, B,C, from an illustrated primer perhaps with coloured pictures.Strict Mohammedans do not allow their boys and girls to have pictures intheir books, because they say all pictures are idols. And yet the love forbeauty and the desire for ornament on the written or printed page was sostrong with the Arabs that they began from the earliest times to usetheir alphabet to make arabesques. Arabesque is a big word and it reallymeans an Arab picture. But these pictures of the Arabs (which you find onthe arches of old mosques, in books and on tombstones) are ornaments ordesigns made out of the beautifully curved letters of the alphabet. Theold Arab copyists and their sculptors wrote and carved the words of theKoran, or the names of God, etc., in all sorts of ways to make pictures_out of words only_, lest they break the law of their prophet. Here aretwo examples of how pictures can be made out of letters. You have alldoubtless heard of a "wordless book"; and some of you have books withoutwords and full of pictures. Here is a picture made out of the Arabicalphabet, and every curve and dot belongs to the words so curiouslywritten. I copied them out of an Arabic treatise on penmanship, for you.The face is not at all pretty, and yet Moslem lads think it is very cleverto bring this likeness of man out of the four names, _Allah, Mohammed,Ali_ and _Hassan_. These words you notice are written twice, both to theleft and to the right. What a disgrace to the holy name of God to put thatof three Arabs with it in a monograph! It is very sad to hear some Moslemssay that they trust in _these_ people to intercede for them with God. Ifyou have read what sinful lives these people led when they were the chiefrulers in Arabia, you will almost agree with me in calling this firstpicture a Moslem idol.[Illustration: DESIGNS MADE OUT OF ARABIC WRITING.]There are many Moslems in Bahrein who have hanging up in their rooms thesemonograms or designs. One favourite I have often seen contains only fivenames: _Allah, Mohammed, Ali, Hassan and Hussein_. The people who make somuch of these descendants of Mohammed are called _Shiahs_; the otherMoslems who think they are more orthodox are called _Sunnites_.What do you think of our second picture? Is not the design very pretty foran embroidery pattern? The motto is written twice; once from the right andonce _backward_ from the left, the same as in the other picture. The wordsare taken from the Koran and are as true as they are beautiful. _Manyattawakil ala Allah fa hooa hasbahoo_; which means, "Whoever trusts inGod will find Him sufficient." That surely contradicts the other picture,does it not? And yet they are both from the same copy-book. There are manycontradictions in the religion of Mohammed. I only hope that when Christ'sgospel has conquered Arabia, the name of Jesus will be written on everymosque and in every heart; then contradiction will give way to the truth,and whoever trusts in Christ will find Him sufficient.Would it not be nice to make something pretty for use in the home or inthe Sunday-school, and embroider the Arabic words on it? It would be aconstant reminder of Arabia and of the beautiful motto--only an Arabicversion of Paul's words, _Our sufficiency is of God._Our last illustration to close this chapter is an example of Arabicevery-day penmanship. It was written in the mountains of Oman, and is aletter from a poor cripple asking for a copy of the Psalms and otherbooks. It was sent to our brother Peter J. Zwemer a year before he died,when he was on a missionary journey in Oman.[Illustration: ARABIC LETTER FROM A POOR CRIPPLE.]XIITHE QUEER PENNIES OF OMAN AND OF HASSAIf Jesus Himself, on one occasion, said, "Show me a penny," and preached asermon from it, surely we may follow his example and learn something fromthese strange coins which you see in the pictures at the beginning and endof this chapter. The coin on this page comes from Oman, the home of theArabian camel and one of its most fertile provinces. Perhaps some of theboys and girls can tell where Oman is and give its boundaries withoutlooking in the geography, but I am sure none of you can read theinscription on the penny, and tell what it all means. Who is Fessul binTurkee? What is an Imam? How much is one-quarter of an Anna? And when didthis queer coin come fresh from the mint?[Illustration: OMAN COIN.]Let us begin at the beginning. Fessul bin Turkee, the present ruler ofOman, lives in a large, tumble-down old castle in Muscat, and his big redflag waves over the town every Friday, the Mohammedan Sabbath. He is notmuch better nor worse than his father, Turkee, or than other rulers inArabia, but he certainly is far more enterprising, and is generally likedby the Arabs of Muscat. He is not however in all respects a mercifulruler. When I visited Muscat a few years ago this petty king had a reallion's den, like Nebuchadnezzar, and the story goes that he sometimes usedit in the same way to get rid of his enemies. He once had a steam-launch,and even put up an electric light on the top of his castle, but both ofthese modern improvements came to grief. He also started a small icefactory to supply his household with cold water when the thermometer risesto over one hundred degrees; but the expense was too great and so theproject melted away likewise. His last venture is more successful, andever since the ice factory added a P to its sign-board and became a "picefactory," copper coins have been plentiful in Oman. A _pice_ is the Indianname for a small copper coin, and the Arabs borrowed the word, with manyother words, from the Hindu traders. The Sultan has plenty of wives andhorses and retainers; his castle is well-supplied with old cannon andmodern rifles; huge coffee-pots pour out cheap hospitality every day; butwithal I do not think he is very happy, for he is in debt and his power isnot as extensive as it was once. Fessul's proper title is not Sultan,although he is often so called, but _Imam_, which signifies religiousleader. It is the old title given to the political chiefs of Oman andZanzibar.The word means one "who stands before," and was first used as a title forthe leader of prayer in the mosques. In Oman the religious chiefs soontook hold of politics, and so the title has a significance now in thispart of Arabia that it never had elsewhere.Let us get back to the penny. Its face (although being a Mohammedan coinit really has no human _face_ because their religion forbids pictures)bears an English as well as an Arabic inscription. The opposite side onlyhas the Sultan's name in Arabic. On the side that has the English words isthe legend: "Struck at Muscat in the year 1315." Yet the penny is onlythree years old, for the Moslems begin to date their years from the_Hegira_, or flight of their prophet from Mecca to Medina. This took placein the year 622 A.D. But we must also remember that their year is severaldays shorter than ours, because they have lunar months all of equal lengthand only 360 days in a year.How strange it is to read such an old date for such a recent year as 1899,since we count time from the birth of Christ! But you must remember thatthe False Prophet has had it all his own way in Arabia for thirteenhundred years, and that the missionaries in this country are very fewindeed. Only for a very few years and in a very few places has Christ beenpreached.Now, however, even this queer little penny can bear witness to the factthat the gospel has come to Oman. It is worth one-quarter of an anna;there are sixteen annas in a rupee, and a rupee is worth aboutthirty-three cents. Not a big value, is it? But for four of these coinsthe poorest boy in Muscat can buy a complete gospel of Matthew. Theshopkeeper must take in a great many of them, for last year one thousandfour hundred and thirty-three such gospels and other portions of the Biblewere sold in this part of Arabia and paid for by these coppers.Another interesting fact to notice is that part of the inscription on thecoin is English. Coming events cast their shadows before. England's powerin checking the cruel slave trade and rooting out piracy on the coasts ofArabia has made its influence felt. An English primer is sure to follow apenny with an English motto, and some day our mission will have a schoolat Muscat for Arab boys and girls, as well as for rescued slaves. YourAmerican pennies and your prayers will help to bring it about. Moreover,do you not think that if they keep on buying gospels and reading them,Jesus Christ will some time be the true _Imam of Muscat and Oman_?[Illustration: HASSA COINS.]The other coin is the only _old_ coin that is at present current inArabia, and I leave you to decide whether it is not the oddest andqueerest penny you have ever seen. The first time I saw these queerblacksmith-nail coins was in 1893, when I made a visit to Hofhoof, thecapital of the province of Hassa, in Eastern Arabia. The people used them,as we do pennies, for all small purchases, but I fear such a _pointed_coin must have been harder on their pockets than our round coins. It iscalled the _Taweelah_, or long-bit, and consists of a small copper-bar ofabout an inch in length, split at one end and with the fissure slightlyopened. The coin has neither date nor motto, although one can yetoccasionally find silver coins of like shape with the Arabic motto:_"Honour to the sober man, dishonour to the ambitious."_ The coin,although it has no date, was undoubtedly made by one of the Carmathianrulers about the year 920 A.D. This was more than five hundred yearsbefore Columbus discovered America! The Carmathians were a very fanaticalsect of Moslems. You remember reading in chapter three how they took theblack stone from Mecca?Well, these people had this province as the centre of their power and herethey struck these peculiar coins. I have heard it said that they were soopposed to images and faces on money that their leader devised this longbar-like shape for his coins to prevent any one from making images onthem!At any rate the Carmathians were very brave warriors. When Abu Tahir,their first leader, attacked Bagdad with only 500 horsemen he was met by amessenger from the city saying that 30,000 soldiers were guarding thegates. "Yes," said Abu Tahir, "but among them all there are not three suchas these." At the same instant he turned to three of his companionscommanding one to plunge a dagger into his own breast, another to leapinto the rushing Tigris river and the third to cast himself down aprecipice. They obeyed without a murmur. "Relate," continued the general,"what you have just seen; before evening your leader shall be chainedamong my dogs." No wonder that with such absolute obedience, theCarmathians terrified all Arabia with their army.As I handle their old coins and think of the past, I sometimes wonder howmuch Our Great Captain, Christ Jesus would accomplish had He soldiersequally obedient and brave as did the Carmathian general, in redeemingArabia from its long darkness and bloodshed. It is nineteen hundred yearsago that He commanded us: "Go ye into all the world and preach thegospel."But even now there is no one preaching the gospel in Hassa nor in all theinterior of Arabia. Why?XIIIARAB BABIES AND THEIR MOTHERSAn Arab baby is such a funny little creature! In Christian lands babies,as soon as possible, are given a warm bath and dressed with comfortableclothing. But in Arabia the babies are not washed for many days, onlyrubbed over with a brown powder and their tiny eyelids painted round withcollyrium. They are wound up in a piece of calico and tied up with astring, just like a package of sugar. Their arms are fastened by thebandage so that they cannot possibly move them. The Arab mothers say thatif the arms and legs of babies were left hanging loose the poor thingswould never sleep. A small, tight bonnet for the head completes the baby'swardrobe. A few blue beads or buttons are sewn on the front of this cap tokeep off the evil-eye, for Moslem women all believe that if a strangerlooks at a baby it may turn sick and die.On the day when the baby is named a sacrifice is slain and eaten andsilver offerings are given to the poor, equal to the weight of hair on theinfant's head. The poor baby's hair is all shaved off to be weighed in thebalance. Poor people who cannot afford this offering omit the custom.Charms are placed on the arms or around the neck of the child. A fewverses from the Koran are written out and put in a leather or silver caseand also tied around the arm or neck of the baby. If the child shows signsof illness the mother makes it swallow some of the Koran. That is, aportion is written out and the ink is washed off with water and this dirtywater is taken by the patient. A prescription was sent to me once when Iwas ill by a Moslem _mullah_, or teacher, of this character and he wasquite certain I would recover if I drank it. I am glad to say I got betterwithout the ink medicine.[Illustration: DATE-STICK CRADLE.]When the baby is forty days old and has received its name a new date-stickcradle is triumphantly brought home from the market and the new babyplaced in it. And then Master or Miss Arab will get such a violent rockingthat no Christian baby could stand. The ground is uneven, for there are nowooden floors in Arabia, and the rockers are nearly straight so that youcan imagine it is not the pleasantest thing in the world to be rocked inan Arab cradle. In the picture you can see just what a date-stick cradleis like.Arab babies cry a great deal; what with sand storms and flies and otherinsects they generally have sore eyes and apparently need strong treatmentto make them quiet and give their mothers and sisters time to grind thewheat and churn the butter. Everything is made fresh each day in an Arabhousehold. The rice must be cooked for the daily meal, the wheat groundfor bread, and the milk put into the leather churn. These people have noice chest, not even cupboards, many of them, so the coffee is freshlyroasted and pounded in a mortar for breakfast. The flour is taken to thehand-mill and butter comes out of the churn every day fresh. Then themother will have to draw the daily supply of water and wash the fewclothes at the well. The better classes have their slaves to do the hardwork but the Bedouin women and the poor have to do all the toil and neverget a rest. Rich and poor are alike in not having any intellectualpleasures. Few can read and even those who can read, are able to read onlythe Koran and the Moslem traditions. The children have no primers orpicture-books, and no Arab mother ever has a newspaper or a magazine. Shehas never heard of such things. Arab women do not know anything of themany interests and pleasures that occupy the time of women in Christianlands.[Illustration: WOMEN GRINDING AT THE MILL.]Would you like to know how they make bread in Arabia? First the wheat issifted and cleaned and then it is put into one of the hand-mills. Itconsists of an upper and nether millstone with a hole in the upper one anda wooden handle. Two women usually sit and grind because the stone isheavy and they love to talk while they work. One swings it half way andthe other pulls it around. Then the coarse flour is taken out and put intoa bowl with water and salt and mixed to the right consistency. A pieceof this dough is then taken between the hands and gradually beaten untilit is about the thickness of a book cover and twelve inches in diameter--around, flat cake of dough. The oven is usually under ground and is shapedlike a large jar with the mouth above the ground a little. A fire is built_inside_ the oven and when the sides of the oven are quite hot the fire isallowed to die out. Then the large pan cakes of bread are deftly clappedon to the side of the oven until the space is covered and one by one thecakes are taken out when done. In some houses they have a shallow oval panwhich is placed over an open fire and on this the cakes are baked. The panis put on the fire upside down, so even here we are again in Topsy-turvyLand. Twenty or thirty of these flat loaves are baked at one time, for ahungry Arab can eat five or six at one meal.[Illustration: BEDOUIN WOMEN EATING THEIR BREAKFAST.]Now the men come in to eat the food that the housewife has prepared. Witha short prayer called _bismillah_ they begin and then shove the rice andmeat or the bread and gravy into their mouths as fast as they can.Whatever is left when the men get through is for the women. You can see agroup of Arab women in the picture eating their meal from one common dishin front of their tent. They use their hands instead of spoons or forksbut get along very well and always wash before and after their simplemeal.Now the women always have to wait on their husbands and eat by themselves.When things get right side up in this dark land we hope to see the wholefamily sitting down together and taking their meal with joy andthanksgiving.XIVBOAT-BUILDERS AND CARPENTERSSinbad the sailor died long ago but the sea he sailed is still called thePersian Gulf and is just as full of curious islands as it was in his time.The boats are also just like Sinbad's and the sailors sing the same songs,I think, for there are very few changes in the almost changeless East. TheBahrein harbour-boat is built on the islands, out of timber from India andmasts from Ceylon. But the sailcloth and the ropes are made on this ourisland home. All boats of this kind carry a good lot of passengers, drawvery little water and are fast sailing craft; so that even the Americanboy whose father owns a yacht would not speak with contempt of one ofthese boats. In fact I have heard English sea captains who had drunk saltwater for years say that they never saw better harbour boats in a stormthan these of Bahrein.[Illustration: CARGO BOATS, BAHREIN.]In another kind of boat the pearl-divers of the Gulf go out to their hardtoil and costly labour. One of them costs about four hundred _rupees_,that is about one hundred and thirty dollars. You do not think that isdear, do you, for a boat that holds a crew of twenty? But the cost ofdiving for pearls is not in the boat or the apparatus; it costs lives.Many of the divers are eaten by sharks before they return with the year'spearl harvest; others lose limbs and health. I wish you could see the oddshaped oars the Arabs use in these boats. They consist of a round polewith a sort of barrel-head or spoon shaped board tied to one end. The boatbuilders always use twine and rope rather than nails or screws to puttheir boats together. The boys of Bahrein can make beautiful sailing boatsto play with out of bits of date-stick and strings.[Illustration: RIVER BOAT, BUSRAH.]Each fishing boat has a sort of figure-head and this is generally coveredwith the skin of a sheep or goat. This animal is sacrificed on the daywhen the boat is first launched, just as we give the boat a name and putflags on it. It is a very old custom to offer a blood sacrifice when aboat is first put into the water.Not only in the villages on the coasts of the Red Sea and the PersianGulf are there boat builders and sailors; Arabia has two large rivers thathelp to make its northern boundary and they are highways of traffic.Our picture shows a river boat on the canal at Busrah. It goes the longjourney from Busrah to Bagdad over five hundred miles or even to Hillahand the other towns on the Euphrates river. This kind of boat has a cabinin the bow and can carry a large cargo of wheat or wool. It sails by allthe interesting country which was once the home of Abraham and is stillcalled Mesopotamia.The largest boats used by the Arabs are called _dhows_ or _buggalows_. Youwill hear something more about these boats in the chapter on the slavetrade.The carpenters of Arabia, like the boat builders, work in a veryold-fashioned way. But they are much less skillful in their work. Youoften see well-built boats but never a well-made door or a window thatshuts properly. Perhaps the fault is with their tools and perhaps they arenot as skillful as they once were in using them.The Arab carpenter uses no bench or vise; he squats upon the ground in theshade of some old building or tree and carries all his tools in a smallbasket with him. He has four hands instead of the two hands of an Americancarpenter, for his feet are bare and he can work as well with his toes asyou can with your fingers. It is wonderful to see how an Arab carpentercan hold a board with his toes while his hands are busy sawing or planingit!I never see one of these carpenters using his toes so cleverly withoutthinking that we who wear shoes and stockings and only use our feet forwalking have lost one of the powers that the Arabs still possess. Acarpenter's handsome handiwork in Arabia should be called his _toe_some_toey_-work; don't you think so? In the picture at the end of this chapteryou see an Arab carpenter's tools. His saw is exactly opposite to anordinary saw as the teeth all point the wrong way! But you know he _pulls_the tool so it is all right. The plane has four handles instead of one.The gimlet is like ours but instead of a brace and bit to make holes, theArab uses a fiddle-string stretched on a bow which he twists once ortwice around his borer, or auger-bit. Then he fiddles away until he hasmade a hole.[Illustration: SAWING A BEAM.]It is very strange to see two Arab carpenters sawing a beam as you findthem in the picture.Time is not valuable in the East because the days are long and life iseasy and the people are never in a hurry. Never do anything to-day thatcan be done to-morrow is their motto. So they spend a half hour in fixingthe beam on a tripod; then they pull and push and push and pull the greatclumsy saw blade up and down and in an hour or so the beam is cut in two.What would such carpenters say if they were to visit an American sawmilland see the gang-saw cut six boards out of a log at once just as easy asyour mother cuts a cheese? Arabia and its carpenters are very far behindus in civilisation. The whole country is in need of schools and industrialmissions so that the Arab boys may learn to handle tools and makefurniture and build houses.[Illustration: AN ARAB CARPENTER'S TOOLS.]In America there is hardly a boy living but he can drive a nail and sawoff a board and put up a shelf. In Arabia only carpenters' sons can dothese things; the ordinary boy does not even know how to use a jack-knife;he never had one. A short definition of Arabia would be "a land withouttools." Ritter, the great geographer, calls Arabia "the anti-industrialcentre of the world," which is only the same definition in other words.XVARABIC PROVERBS AND ARABIC HUMOURThe people of Topsy-turvy Land, like all orientals, are very fond ofproverbs and short, bright sayings. You know that even to-day there aremen who go about in the coffee shops of Arabia to tell stories, just asyou have read in the Arabian Nights. Some of their stories are veryinteresting and some of their proverbs are wise. Others are notinteresting and many of their stories are too bad to repeat. Even some oftheir proverbs bear the mark of their topsy-turvy religion and are onlyhalf true. Judge them for yourself. Here are fifty examples; which do youthink is the best proverb among them? Are they all good?First seek your neighbour, then build your house.First get a companion, then go on the road.Whoever dies in a strange land, dies a martyr.When the judge is oppressive, the very air is, too. Don't cut your headoff with your tongue.Keep your dog hungry and he will follow you.Leave off sin, then ask forgiveness.Every horse knows its rider.Talk is feminine, but a good answer is masculine.With little food a bed tastes good.A trotting dog is better than a sleeping lion.Every girl is beautiful in her father's eyes.His tongue is sweeter than dates but his hands are as hard as sticks.There is no perfume after the wedding.Clouds do not fear the barking of dogs.A bird catches a bird.Poverty is the mother of deceptions.The fruit of haste is repentance.That man is like the _Kaaba_; he goes nowhere but every one comes to him.The tongue of a fool is the key to his destruction.The needle clothes others but is itself naked.If the owl were game to eat, the gunner would not have passed by theruined castle.Happy is the man whose enemy is wise.Time is stingy of honour.The best generosity is quick.If your neighbour is honey, don't lick him all up.If you don't know a man's parents look at his appearance.What a strange world if all wool were red!Fall but don't bawl.Your enemy will love you when the ass becomes a doctor.Wait, donkey, till the grass grows.A loaned garment is not warm.He is a hard man; his name is Rock, son of a Cliff.The oppression of a cat is better than the justice of a rat.While I was fishing, I was caught.A blacksmith came to shoe the Pasha's horse and a frog in the pond stuckout her foot too.One nettle seed will ruin a garden.Who speaks the whole truth will get a broken head.What's the good of a house without food?Ask experience but don't neglect the doctor.She wears seven veils but has no modesty.He fasted a year and breakfasted on an onion.A false friend is an open enemy.They gave me no food, but the smoke from their kitchen blinded me.When the lion is away, the hyenas play.They said to the blind man, throw away your stick; he replied, why desertan old friend?Haste is of the devil; deliberation, of God.They put the dog's tail in the press forty years, and when it came out itstill had a curl.Lucky days do not come in a bunch.Look for a thing where you lost it.Some of these resemble our own proverbs and others may perplex you atfirst. Of course they are all better in Arabic than in the translation.The people of Arabia seldom or never engage in practical jokes, but theyare often very witty in their remarks. The Caliph Mansur once met an Arabon the desert and said to him: "Give thanks to God who has caused theplague to cease that ravaged thy country.""God is too good," the Arab answered, "to punish us with two such scourgesat the same time as the plague and thy government."An Arab poet sent his book to a famous author. "Dost thou want fame?"said the latter, "then hang thy book up in the market-place where all cansee it.""But how will they know the author?""Why, just hang yourself close to the book!"Here is another story that is told about a Moslem preacher. One Fridaywhen the people were gathered in the mosque to pray and to hear thesermon, he got up in the pulpit and asked the audience if they knew whathe intended to preach about."No," they replied."Well, then, I shall not tell you," and he stepped down. The next Fridayhe asked the same question, and now, taught by experience, they answered:"Yes, we know.""Well, then, I need not tell you," and again he stepped down.The third Friday when the same question was put, the people said, "Some ofus know and some don't know.""In that case," said the preacher-wag, "let those of you who know tellthose that don't know." And again there was no sermon.And now to close this chapter here is a very topsy-turvy story with apuzzle in it:The Arabs relate that when the prophet Jonah fled from Joppa to Tarshish,there were thirty passengers, all told, in the ship. The storm grew veryfierce, and out of fear, the captain determined to throw half the crewoverboard, that is, fifteen men. But he knew that fifteen of the thirtywere true believers, and fifteen were infidels, and among them, Jonahalso. To avoid suspicion and accomplish his purpose he put the thirty menall in a row in such a way that by counting out every ninth man, thebelievers alone remained and the unbelievers were all of them one by onecast into the sea.This is the way he arranged them; every _dot_ stands for an _unbeliever_,and the strokes for believers--thirty altogether.[Illustration: PUZZLE OF THE THIRTY MEN.]You begin to count from the left, as the captain did, and if you mark outevery ninth man you can keep on counting out the ninth men until onlyupright strokes are left.From your knowledge of arithmetic, can you tell me the reason of thispuzzle?The Arabs remember the puzzle by some verses in which every dotted letterstands for an unbeliever and those that have no dots stand for Moslems.You see that even the story of Jonah and the whale is topsy-turvy out inArabia!XVIGOLD, FRANKINCENSE AND MYRRHIn olden times Arabia was a much more important country than it is to-day.Before there were large seagoing ships, all the trade between India,Persia, even China, on the east, and Egypt on the west, was carried oncamels. The caravans at that time used to cross Arabia in all directions,and the men who drove these camel-trains grew wealthy, as railroadmagnates do to-day. We read about this early traffic on these highways ofthe desert in the Old Testament as well as in the old Greek histories. Theprovince of Yemen was celebrated for its wealth and civilisation as earlyas the time of Solomon. It was then called Sheba and the old capital wascalled Marib, a little northeast of the present city of Sanaa. There arestill many extensive ruins and inscriptions which testify to the height oftheir civilisation. We read of one of the queens of Sheba (the Arabs sayshe was named _Bilkis_) who came to prove Solomon with hard questions. Shecame with a large caravan of camels bearing spices and gold in abundance;her present to Solomon consisted of "an hundred and twenty talents ofgold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones." Gold is nolonger found in Arabia but it was undoubtedly once very plentiful there.All the old writers speak of Arabia as a-gold country. One of the Greekgeographers speaks of a stream in which large nuggets of gold were found.Some people think Ophir was in Arabia. However that may be, the travellerBurton explored the northwestern part of the peninsula and found old minesand even traces of gold dust. If Job lived in the land of Midian we canwell understand how he could describe mining operations so well as he doesin the twenty-eighth chapter of his book.[Illustration: BRANCH OF INCENSE TREE.]Frankincense and myrrh were also carried across Arabia by the caravans,and both of these precious gums came from Arabia itself and are stillfound there. One of the oldest articles of commerce was incense. The gumwas used in sacrifices and in all the heathen temple worship as well as bythe Jews in their worship. One thousand talents' weight of frankincensewas brought every year to Darius, the Persian king, as tribute fromArabia. The present incense country is southern Arabia, especiallyHadramaut. Here the incense tree (of which you see a small branch in thepicture) grows. The young trees are cut with a knife, and from theincisions made in the bark a milk-like juice comes out. When it has hadtime to harden, the large clear globules are scraped off into baskets andthe inferior kind that has run down the bark is collected separately. Itis shipped from Arabia to Bombay or goes out from Aden and still commandsa good price. In some Roman Catholic churches this incense is burnt everySunday and if you will go to a large druggist he may be able to show youpieces of Arabian incense.Myrrh and frankincense are frequently mentioned together. Both aresweet-smelling gums and both came originally from Arabia. According to aGreek legend, Myrrha was the daughter of one of the kings of Cyprus whoangered her father and when he attempted to stab her, fled to Arabia. Hereshe was changed into a tree called myrrh! A few of these trees are stillfound in Yemen, but myrrh is not at all as plentiful as it once was inArabia. It is a low, thorny, ragged-looking tree with bright green leaves.The gum exudes from cracks in the bark near the root of the plant. Whendry it is of a rich brown colour and has a bitter taste. The word "myrrh"in Arabic means bitter, and I think that is the origin of the name givento the tree and not the foolish story of the Greek mythology. You mustlook up all the references in the Bible to myrrh. I wonder whether themyrrh which Nicodemus used to embalm the body of our Saviour for Hisburial came from Arabia? In Matthew's gospel we read of the wise men whocame from the East to worship Jesus. "And when they had opened theirtreasures they presented unto Him gifts; gold and frankincense and myrrh."Do you not think that these wise men came from Arabia, even as the queenof Sheba did, to see the king of the Jews? Perhaps Isaiah prophesied oftheir coming when he wrote concerning Arabia: "The multitude of camelsshall cover thee the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Shebashall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall shew forththe praises of the Lord." At any rate we are quite sure that thefrankincense they brought came from Arabia. There is a great deal in theBible about this country and there are many beautiful promises for theredemption of its people. Arabs were present at Pentecost and the firstmissionary to Arabia was the Apostle Paul. God has not forgotten Hispromises and we must all pray that soon they may be fulfilled. No one hasyet been to tell the children of Hadramaut, who gather the incense-gum,the story of Jesus' birth and of His death on the cross. There is not asingle missionary in all that country; no one has been to tell the newsthat the Babe of Bethlehem is the King of Glory.    "Thou who in a manger      Once hast lowly lain,    Who dost now in glory      O'er all kingdoms reign,    Gather in the heathen      Who in lands afar    Ne'er have see the brightness      Of Thy guiding star."XVIISLAVES AND SLAVE TRADERSThe Arabs who in past ages were the merchants of the Orient in gold,frankincense and myrrh, both then and now traded in slaves also. And thecruel trade is not yet ended. Would you like to hear about some boys whohave darker skins than yours, and darker hearts, because they do not knowthe Lord Jesus as their own Saviour? Well, these poor little boys werestolen from their mothers and fathers by wicked men called Arabs, who gofrom Arabia to Africa in boats to steal boys and girls and bring them hereto sell them. Each boy is sold for nearly ten pounds (50). These men knowit is wrong in their hearts, but you see what a lot of money they make!What does St. Paul say? "The _love_ of money is the root of all evil." Andthen the religion of the Arab permits him to do this work of stealing andselling boys and girls.One night about two or three years ago, just as the sun was setting, somelittle black boys were playing and fishing near the water on the coast ofZanzibar, in East Africa; a man came up to them and offered them somedates. Little black _and white_ boys are always ready to eat, are theynot? These boys took the dates and while they were eating, the man threw acloth over their heads and carried them off to a boat standing near. TheArabs caught a great many in this way, and when the boat had as many as itcould carry they moved away and began to travel towards Arabia. The poorchildren were kept in the bottom of the boat, all huddled together, andgiven very little to eat and drink. Sometimes the sea was rough and theywere sick, so altogether their voyage in an open boat was not a pleasantone. But "Some One" was taking notice of these children and He was goingto deliver them. Do _you_ know who was watching over them? After many daysat sea the boat came near Muscat. A servant of the British Consul saw theboat and knew there were slaves in it. Then the Consul got ready in asmall boat and went after the big one. They had to follow nearly all nightand at last overtook the slave-dhow. The Consul pulled alongside in aBedden (native boat) and demanded the firearms of the Arabs. Then he boundthem and put his own sailors on board, and brought the precious cargo ofsouls into Muscat harbour.[Illustration: SLAVE GIRL IN ARABIA.]The owner of the slave-dhow was sent to prison, and the boys and girlswere given away to Christian people to train, the missionary in Muscatgetting the largest share.This was the origin of the rescued-slave school at Muscat. Other slavesare caught from time to time and liberated. Sometimes they are sent toBombay or other places in India; a large number were once liberated atAden and are now in a school at Lovedale in Africa. When these poor slavechildren first come from the slave ships they are very ignorant and almostlike wild animals. They need to learn everything, and even their languageis of little use to them, as they need to learn Arabic before they can getalong in Arabia. The Muscat boys first learned English from themissionary, but it was not easy for them.They only knew a few words when I first went to Muscat. For instance, theycalled all lights, such as lamps, candles, etc., _fire_. Well, one nightwe were sitting on the verandah with the lamp, reading, and Suliman cameand said _"big fire!"_ We jumped up and said "where?" Looking all aroundwe could not see a sign of fire. Then he said, "big fire on table." We raninto the dining-room--still no fire. Suliman then pointed to the lamp andsaid again "big fire"; so we learned by that time he wanted the lamp forthe table, as dinner was ready.[Illustration: LIBERATED SLAVES AT BAHREIN.]Would you like to hear how a day was spent in this Muscat school when theboys were beginning to learn? Now the boys are all big and have scattered;they are working as servants in different places and some are learning atrade. But here is a description of the early days of their training: "Weare up before dawn almost, and yet the boys are up before us, and havetaken in their mats (beds), and are splashing about in the big cement bathin the yard. They do not use towels; the sun soon dries the skin, and thenthey dress with one article only, a _wazeera,_ a piece of cloth. After thebath they clean up the schoolroom, sweep the yard; then they eat bread anddates and drink water. When the meal is finished all the boys wash theirhands and put on their coats to come up-stairs. See how nicely they marchforward, two and two, just like the animals going into Noah's Ark. They_halt_ in front of the harmonium 'single file'--'face about'--'toes toline!' Now we are ready for prayers. Look, boys and girls, how quietlythese black boys stand; now we are going to sing:' 'Jesus loves me, this Iknow.' They love the singing, and all make as much noise as possible.Singing finished, we read a short passage of Scripture, and tell verysimply how Jesus loved them and died for them. They are beginning to learnabout God and who the Lord Jesus is. One morning I held up the Bible andasked them, 'What is this?'"They answered, 'God's Book.'"'And what do we read about in God's Book?'"They all answered, 'The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want.' I had beenteaching them this Psalm, but I did not know how well they knew it; it wasa nice answer, do not you think so? After the scripture lesson we kneeland pray, all the boys repeating, 'O God, wash me from all my sins in theblood of my Saviour, and I shall be whiter than snow; give me Thy HolySpirit, for Jesus' sake. Amen.' Will you ask God to make the boys praythis prayer from their hearts? You see they are only just beginning tolearn about God. Before they came to us they were quite heathen. Prayerended we all march into another room,--you may come too, and beginlessons. The big boys are learning sentences now; the little ones arestill at A, B, C, 1, 2, 3. At the end of two hours of spelling, readingand writing, a little simple drill and the morning school is ended. Someof the boys help prepare their fish and rice for dinner, and others makebaskets. At three o'clock all march up again for sewing. And let me tellyou a secret; the smallest boy of all sews the neatest. After this theboys get ready to go for a bath in the sea, or for a walk. When we returnwe have evening prayers, and then the boys eat their supper of rice andfish, take their mats into the garden and go to sleep."That was the way in which eighteen rescued slave boys began to live a lifewith more light, and therefore also more responsibility than their formerlife as savage children in Africa.But what of the thousands who are _not_ rescued, but are taken to placesalong the coast of Arabia and sold? Their lot is miserable. In Mecca thereis a slave market where boys and girls are sold to the highest bidder. AtSur, in South Arabia, there are still many Arabs who make money by buyingand selling poor negro children. Only last month a little negro lad called"Diamond" told me how he had been captured and sold to a merchant inPersia. I am very glad that I can tell you that the little lad escaped toa British ship and is now free.A writer who travelled in the Red Sea says that he passed hundreds ofslave-dhows. What a lot of misery that means; not only misery to theparents of these stolen children in Africa, but to the childrenthemselves. There may be many slaves in Arabia who get enough to eat andhave good clothing to wear, but they always remain slaves at the best, andare taught a false religion by their masters. I think dearly all of themwere happier at home in Africa than in dark Arabia.It is hard to love the cruel slave trader, is it not? Yet Jesus told us to"love our enemies." The way to root out the slave trade is to evangelisethe slave trader. The entire west coast of Arabia has not a singlemissionary; no wonder that here the slave trade is carried on withouthindrance! Will you not pray for western Arabia, and also for the Arabslave dealers that God may soften their hearts and make them stop theirbad work? And will not all the girls pray for their enslaved black sistersin Arabia, whose lot is very miserable?XVIIIABOUT SOME LITTLE MISSIONARIESSome little missionaries came to Arabia a few years before any of theAmerican missionaries did, and have been coming ever since. Most of themwere born in a country not far from Arabia, and yet only one of themvisited Arabia before Mohammed was born. Although they never write reportsof their work in the papers, yet I have seen a few splendid littleaccounts of their work written on tablets of flesh with tears for ink. Itis just because their work is done so much in secret and in out-of-the-wayplaces, that they are generally overlooked and often underestimated. Theyreceive only bare support and no salary, and get along in the mostself-denying way by fasting and living all together, packed like herringin a dark, close room, except when they go out into the sunshine on theirjourneys.Most of them came out in the steerage of the big ships from London, butnone of them were seasick at all throughout the entire voyage. They do notgo about two and two unless it is that one of the old ones goes hand inhand with a younger brother for support. Generally a score or more traveltogether. They never complain of being tired or discouraged, and never getfever or cholera, although I have talked and slept with them at Bahreinwhen I had fever myself. Never yet has one of them died on a sick-bed,although they often hide away and disappear for months. On one or twooccasions I have heard of a small company of them being burned at thestake, but I was told that not a groan escaped from their lips, nor weretheir companions frightened the least bit. With my own eyes I have seenone or two of them torn asunder and trampled upon by those who hate JesusChrist and His kingdom and His little missionaries. Yet the only sound tobe heard was the blasphemies of their persecutors, who could not answerthem in any other way.It is very strange indeed, that when once one or two of them getacclimatised and learn the language, they are bound to their work by somany tiny cords of love that they seldom fall apart from their work orfall out one with the other. There are more than sixty different names andages among them, and yet they all have one family accent. Some of them aremedical missionaries and can soothe and heal even broken hearts andprevent broken heads. There are two ladies among them, but they seldom goabout alone, and, especially in Arabia, the men do most of the preaching.Most of them are evangelists or apostles and teachers. And theirenterprise and push! why one of them told me the other day that he wanted_"to preach the gospel in the regions beyond"_ Mecca, and that even there_"every knee should bow to Jesus."_ Why, you begin to see them everywherein the Persian Gulf and around Muscat and Aden. Last year a few of themwent to Jiddah with the pilgrims. They dress very plainly, but often inbright Oriental colours (one just came in all in green); on one or twooccasions I have seen them wear gold when visiting a rich man, but therewas no pride about them, and they put on no airs in their talk.[Illustration: MISSION HOUSE AT BUSRAH.]How many are there of these little missionaries, do you ask? Over threethousand eight hundred and forty visited and left the three stations ofthe Arabian Mission in the Persian Gulf last year. But, as I told you,they are _so_ modest that only a score of them perhaps sent in any accountof their work, and that even was sent through a third party by word ofmouth. I have heard it whispered that a faithful record of all theirjourneys and speeches is kept, but that these are put on file to bepublished all at once on a certain great day, when missionaries all gettheir permanent discharge. What a quiet, patient, faithful, loving body ofworkers they are. Even when it is very, very hot, and after a hard day'swork, they never get out of temper as other missionaries sometimes do whenin hot discussion with a bigoted Moslem. And yet how plainly they tellthe truth--they do not even fear a Turkish Pasha; but that is because theyhave very cunningly all obtained a Turkish passport and a permit to preachanywhere unmolested.Of course, you have guessed my riddle, or else you will want to know whatthese missionaries cost and why we do not employ more of them; and whosent them out, and to what Board they are responsible; and who buys themnew clothes of leather and cloth; and what happens to them when theirbacks are bent with age and their faces furrowed with care, and when onlythey themselves can read their title clear?I think no one will have to help you guess my riddle or tell you that thefour missionaries who go about the most are Matthew, Mark, Luke and John,and that the two ladies are Esther and Ruth. Now you have guessed that theLittle Missionaries are the Books of the Bible. Do you know how many thereare? How many in the Old Testament? How many in the New Testament? Perhapssome of you know the names of _all_ the sixty-six! But it is not enough toknow the names of these Books that we have called Little Missionaries. Wemust know what is in them, we must know the message they bear to thissinful and troubled world. And we must all do our part to send out thisblessed message of peace, comfort, and eternal life. It may not be yourwork to go to Arabia, but yet you have a work to do of one kind or anotherfor Arabia. The Bible must be sent there. And now may I ask all the boysand girls who read this to pray for the Little Missionaries? Pray thatthey may go ahead and prepare the way of the Lord all over this darkpeninsula, from the palm groves of Busrah to the harbour of Aden, and fromthe sea of Oman to the unholy cities,--Mecca and Medina.    "Jesus, tender Shepherd      Thou hast other sheep    Far away from shelter      Where dark shadows creep.    Seeking Saviour, bring them home    That they may no longer roam.    "Jesus, tender Shepherd      While Thou leadest me,    As Thy little helper      Faithful may I be.    Seeking others far and wide    Drawing lost ones to Thy side."XIXTURNING THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWNAbout eighteen hundred and fifty years ago two missionaries came to a townin Greece, called Thessalonica, and began to preach. They did nobody anyharm and only talked about the love of Jesus Christ for sinners. A greatnumber of people believed and attended their meetings. Some of the nobleand wealthy women of the town also became Christians and for about threeweeks the preaching went on unhindered. However, as soon as the enemies ofthe gospel saw that Paul and Silas were meeting with success they didtheir best to stir up trouble. A mob collected and with a great deal ofnoise and shouting pulled some of the new believers through the streets,crying: _"They that have turned the world upside down are come hitheralso!"_ Just as it was in Thessalonica so it has been in every place wherethe gospel has been preached. The word of God does turn the world upsidedown. The gospel is powerful and its effect is often at first to stir upthe envy and hatred of men who love not God. When the heathen areworshipping idols and enjoying sinful pleasures they like to be let alone.A thief does not like the policeman's lantern. Those who do dark thingshate the light. The Moslem's idea of right and wrong is so crooked that hedoes not like to have it exposed.[Illustration: THE SULTAN'S SOLDIERS.]Supposing there was a country where all the people wore their garmentswrong side out because they knew no better, and then some one came wearinghis clothes properly and trying to teach these ignorant people, would theynot think _him_ mad and say why do _you_ not turn your coat inside out?That is the very way Moslems regard the missionary. They often tell us,"You are so good and kind why don't you accept the true religion andbecome a believer?" You must not think that the heathen or the Mohammedansare anxious to hear the gospel. They do not know of its value and so donot know what they miss. When they hear that the gospel demands a holylife and forbids all swearing and lying and uncleanness, they think such areligion too difficult and prefer their own. All their topsy-turvy waysand thoughts seem perfectly correct to themselves until God's Spiritenlightens them.It is no wonder therefore that there is always opposition and trouble whenmissionaries (even such quiet _little_ missionaries as we read about),come to a village. When you want to put a thing straight that is upsidedown there is sure to be an overturning. The farmer is not sorry becausehis rude plow breaks the hard soil and bruises the weeds and turns all thegreensward under. Oh no; he does that to make some better green grow. Waitthree months and you will see the whole field covered with a wavingharvest of wheat. Ploughing is pretty rough work on weeds. Opening a newmission station is pretty rough, I admit, on a false religion. And thewise men cannot help knowing this and so they repeat the words of the oldGreeks when they see a missionary settle down in their village: "Thosethat have turned the world upside down are come hither also ... sayingthat there is another King, _Jesus_."The king of all hearts in the Mohammedan world is their prophet Mohammed.They love his name and imitate his acts to the least particular. Much morefaithfully, I fear, than we imitate Jesus, our example. The great questionin Arabia is whether Mohammed or Jesus is to rule the country. Mohammedhas had it very much his own way for thirteen hundred years, but now hisdominion is being disputed. God's providence is working in many ways tohelp His gospel. I sometimes think that we might call His providence theplow and His gospel the good seed. For example, what a strange thing it isfor the Arabs to find Christian governments interfering with their slavetrade. Does not the Koran approve of slave holders and did not Mohammedbuy and sell slaves? And then when the big merchant ships come to thecoasts of Arabia and the ignorant Arabs learn of other lands and peoplesand civilisation they cannot help losing some of their pride andprejudice. They compare the government of England in Aden with that of theTurks in Sanaa and then--well they feel like turning the world upside downthemselves!The Mohammedan religion has such a strong hold in Arabia that it will notbe overcome in one day or by one battle. We must expect a long and hardfight. Before Topsy-turvy Land becomes a Christian land there will bemartyrs in Arabia. Every Moslem who accepts Christ does so at his peril,and yet there are those who dare to confess Christ before men. When youread in mission reports of troubles and opposition, of burning up books,imprisoning colporteurs and expelling missionaries you must not think thatthe gospel is being defeated. It is conquering. What we see under suchcircumstances is only the dust in the wake of the ploughman. God isturning the world upside down that it may be right side up when Jesuscomes. He that plougheth should plough in hope. We may not be able to seea harvest yet in this country but, furrow after furrow, the soil isgetting ready for the seed.Don't some of you want to come and do a day's ploughing for the King?There are some splendid stretches of virgin prairie yet untouched betweenBahrein and Mecca.XXTURNING THE WORLD DOWNSIDE UPThe story of mission work in Arabia is not very long, but it is full ofinterest. From the day when Mohammed proclaimed himself an apostle inMecca until about sixteen years ago when Ion Keith Falconer came to Adenas a missionary, all of Topsy-turvy Land lay in darkness as regards thegospel. For thirteen hundred years Mohammed had it all his own way inArabia. Now his dominion over the hearts of men, is in dispute, and thereis no doubt that the final, full victory will rest with Jesus the Son ofGod, the Saviour of the world.Would you like to hear something, before we close this book about themissions that are now working in this country? There are _three_ missions.The missionaries of the Church of England began work in Bagdad about theyear 1882. Bagdad is not at all a small town. It has a population of onehundred and eighty thousand people, and it was once a very important city.You can read all about its ancient beauty and wealth and commerce in theArabian Nights. Some of the palaces that Harouner Rashid visited are stillstanding. In the city there are at present sixty-four mosques, sixchurches and twenty-two synagogues. One-third of the population are Jews,and there are over five thousand Christians. Most of the latter belong tothe Roman Catholic faith, or to other twilight churches. The RomanCatholic cathedral, which you see in the picture, is the only church inall Northern Arabia that has a bell. Moslems do not like to hearchurch-bells, and they were forbidden by some rulers of the Moslem worldlong ago. The Protestant Christians meet for worship in a dwelling-house.The Bagdad mission has a large dispensary for the sick where thousands ofMoslems and Jews and Christians come every year for treatment. Books aresold to the people, and there is a school for boys and girls which is alsohelping to _turn down_ old prejudices and _turn up_ the right side ofchild-life. The Moslem children are beginning to believe that the world is_round_ and that Constantinople is not the capital of all Europe.The British and Foreign Bible Society is also helping to turn this part ofthe world downside up. The gospel which has been buried under manysuperstitions and traditions so long, is again showing its power._Colporteurs_ are men who carry the Bible about, offer it to the peopleand read and explain it to those whose hearts are open. They have a hardtask, but if it were not for them the "Little Missionaries" would not getalong at all.On the way from Bagdad to Busrah, we pass Amara, an enterprising villagewhere the people once burned books and threw stones at the missionary, butwhere now the little Bible-shop of the American Mission shines unhindered,    "Like a little candle, burning in the night."At Busrah, Rev. James Cantine began mission work in 1891, and ever sincethat time he and others have been ploughing and sowing seed and waitingfor the showers that come before the harvest. It was at Busrah that KamilAbd el Messiah, the Moslem convert from Syria, died a witness for Christ.Have you read the wonderful story of his life? It is full of pathos andshows how in the heart and life of at least one Moslem the Holy Spiritmade topsy-turvy things straight. There are others like Kamil in Arabia,but many of them are still following the Master afar off, because theyfear the persecutions of men. At Busrah, there is also a dispensary, andhere too the gospel is sold and preached and lived before the people.Bahrein, you know, is a group of islands, and it is about six years agothat the people first saw a missionary. Nearly three-fourths of thepopulation are pearl-merchants or pearl-fishers. Will you not pray thatthey may learn to value the Pearl of Great Price?A visit any morning in the week to the dispensary at Bahrein, would soonconvince you that here too the Arab world is slowly but surely turningdownside up. Women learn to their delight that they have equal right tosympathy with men, and they need not wait until the men are helped first.The Arabs are very ignorant of medicine and their remedies are eitherfoolish or cruel. To "let out the pain" in rheumatism, they burn the bodywith a hot iron. All their ideas are upside down, and very few know onwhich side of their body the liver is located. Now when our missiondoctors perform miracles of surgery on the maimed, and miracles of mercyon the suffering, the result is to prepare their hearts for Christ'smessage. To the fanatic Moslem a Christian is "an ignorant unbeliever."But we may put a parody on Pope's lines and say, in their case:    "A Christian is a monster of such frightful mien    That to be hated needs but to be seen.    But seen too oft familiar with his face    They first endure, then pity, then embrace."Many of the Moslems who in gratitude are ready to embrace a Christianphysician may yet learn to embrace Christian teaching.Muscat in Arabic, means "the place where something falls." And thesurroundings are so rocky and steep that everything has a chance to tumbledown except the mercury in the thermometer. That is always up high. Inthis hot, crowded town, the Arabian Mission opened its third station inthe year 1893. Two years before the veteran missionary-bishop, ThomasValpy French laid down his life here, and the fallen standard was taken upby Peter J. Zwemer. After five years of toil in Oman, he also entered intorest. George E. Stone, his successor in Oman, was also worthy of themartyr's crown, and his simple grave at Muscat tells how "he arose,forsook all, and followed Christ."This part of Arabia is sacred because of what these three pioneerssuffered to open the door for the gospel. I do not think the King willleave a province where He has buried so much treasure in the hands of theenemy, do you? The work of preaching in Oman is at present full ofpromise, and the people seem willing to hear. The American Bible Societyis sending the Scriptures all over Eastern Arabia.[Illustration: MUSCAT HARBOUR.]The last mission station in Arabia we mention, is the first that peoplegenerally visit. Aden is a coaling station as well as a missionary centreand passengers travelling to the Orient nearly always stop here on theway. There are Christian churches and hospitals and government schools. AtSheikh Ottoman, a short distance from Aden, Ion Keith Falconer, the firstmodern missionary to this land, began his work. He died here also, but hislife was so full of love and sacrifice that his _work_ is still going on.The Free Church of Scotland mission has medical work, an industrial schoolfor waifs and a memorial chapel. From a great distance patients come to becured, and Moslems to buy the Bible.The great lighthouse on the island of Perim, near Aden, throws its lightfor ten miles out on the dark sea and saves ships from the breakers. Butthe light of the gospel in the Bible depot at Aden, shines two hundredmiles to the north as far as Sanaa, and three hundred miles east toMakalla on the coast. Yet I dare say it costs more to keep up thelighthouse at Perim (not to speak of building it) than it does to keepopen all the Bible lighthouses of all Arabia. Perhaps Keith Falconerthought of this when he said in his farewell address:_"We Christians have a great and imposing war office, but a very smallarmy. While vast continents are shrouded in almost utter darkness andhundreds of millions suffer the horrors of heathenism and Islam, theburden of proof lies upon you to show that the circumstances in which Godhas placed you, were meant by Him to keep you out of the foreign missionfield."__Before you lay aside this book, will you not ask yourself why you shouldnot go out to Arabia, or to some other land yet shrouded in darkness, andshine for Jesus?_    An Old Friend in a New Dress.

FRECHETTE1880NOTE DU TRANSCRIPTEUR:Du a une mauvaise qualite du livre source, certains mots etaientillisibles. Le transcripteur a devine ces mots au meilleur de sonjugement. Dans le texte suivant, ils sont notes entre parenthesesaccolade { }.INTRODUCTION   Le 10 fevrier 1763, le traite de Versailles cedait le Canada   a l'Angleterre, et le drapeau francais retraversait les mers   sous la garde des braves qui l'avaient si noblement defendu,   et qui, abandonnes, decimes, ecrases par le nombre, n'avaient   pas voulu quitter le sol qu'ils avaient illustre par tant de   luttes glorieuses, sans y laisser au moins le souvenir d'une   derniere victoire.   Un pavillon jusqu'alors abhorre flotta sur le Cap aux   Diamants. Deux siecles de decouvertes, de travaux et de   combats heroiques, devenaient inutiles. Tout semblait perdu,   fors l'honneur!   Qui aurait pu prevoir alors que le petit groupe de malheureux   qui ne purent regagner la France a la suite du chevalier de   Levis, formeraient, un siecle plus tard, deux millions d'ames   disseminees sur tout le continent americain, unies ensemble   par deux liens sacres, la meme foi et la meme langue?   Ce miracle s'est opere pourtant. En depit de tout, le Canada   est reste francais, et les Canadiens sont aujourd'hui un   peuple distinct, homogene, ayant sa religion, ses lois, ses   universites, sa litterature--et, grace aux libertes   constitutionnelles que lui garantit la   Grande-Bretagne--pouvant, autant que qui que ce soit au monde,   se vanter d'etre son propre maitre.   La race francaise a donc une vitalite exceptionnelle, puisque   la conquete, l'isolement et meme la persecution n'ont pu ni   paralyser la croissance numerique ni entraver le developpement   prodigieux de cette poignee de colons ainsi violemment separes   de leur mere-patrie!   Que les Canadiens soient restes catholiques, cela peut   surprendre l'historien; mais ils auraient pu renoncer a leur   idiome sans perdre la foi de leurs peres: l'exemple de   l'Irlande est la pour le prouver. Pourquoi donc ont-ils si   energiquement et si fidelement conserve la langue francaise?   Cette question demanderait des developpements qui ne   tiendraient pas dans le cadre d'une Introduction. Mais il me   semble qu'a part le fait que, par la predication evangelique,   la langue francaise est toujours demeuree identifiee, pour   ainsi dire, avec la religion, une des causes principales de sa   conservation se trouve dans son originalite meme et dans le   cachet particulier que lui donne la civilisation qu'elle   represente. Voila ou je vois le secret de sa preservation, en   meme temps que celui de son influence sur le monde americain.   Du Nouveau-Brunswick a la Louisiane, il y a des descendants de   Francais qui citent Racine a cote de Pope, Victor Hugo a cote   de Shakespeare. De ce melange de deux civilisations souvent   rivales et toujours distinctes, il ne peut manquer de sortir   un element puissant, un peuple qui aura son caractere propre,   lequel sera la resultante necessaire de toutes les forces que   les divers groupes nationaux de l'age present auront su mettre   en jeu.   Cette these de l'influence de la langue francaise en Amerique   a recu une sanction officielle de la part de lord Dufferin,   dans sa reponse a l'adresse que lui presenta l'Assemblee   Legislative au moment ou il quittait le pays, et tout   recemment, au banquet de la Saint-Jean-Baptiste, de la part de   son successeur a Rideau-Hall, le marquis de Lorne. Tous les   deux ont exprime cette pensee que, loin d'essayer a faire   disparaitre le francais, l'autorite anglaise devrait au   contraire en favoriser la diffusion, comme un moyen sur de   faire profiter les populations du Dominion des grandes idees   que la France represente dans le monde, et de donner a la   nationalite qui est en voie de formation sur cette partie du   continent une originalite veritable et feconde.   A nous, Canadiens-francais, de profiter des larges libertes   que nous donne la constitution anglaise, pour imprimer le plus   fortement possible le sceau de la France sur ce peuple   nouveau.   Or le moyen le plus efficace d'y arriver, c'est de conserver   notre belle langue avec un soin jaloux. Mais conservons-la   intacte, et pour cela, il faut l'etudier. La langue francaise   est la plus belle des langues modernes, mais peut-etre aussi   la plus difficile. Il ne suffit pas de connaitre les regles   des participes sur le bout du doigt pour savoir le francais;   et quand on est parvenu a l'apprendre, ce n'est pas encore   tout: il faudrait le bien parler. Et sur ce point une reforme   ne serait peut-etre pas deplacee dans nos colleges et nos   pensionnats de jeunes filles. Les _icitte_, les _bin_, les   _itout_, les _pantoute_--pour citer quelques-uns des   barbarismes populaires qui s'introduisent dans la conversation   de nos classes reputees instruites--devraient etre severement   proscrits de nos maisons d'education, au meme titre que les   anglicismes. Malheureusement on n'y fait que tres peu   d'attention; et il en resulte que meme ceux qui ecrivent   passablement leur langue, la parle quelquefois d'une facon   atroce.   "La langue francaise, c'est un diamant d'un prix inestimable;   c'est une oeuvre d'art travaillee par les siecles, d'une   beaute a nulle autre pareille. Tout le monde l'admire, elle   charme tout le monde, bien qu'elle ne livre ses secrets qu'a   un petit nombre; il faut etre amoureux d'elle, l'aimer   beaucoup, lui faire longtemps la cour, et elle ne se donne   qu'a celui qui sait la vaincre par un labeur perseverant et   une longue constance. Mais quels tresors elle revele a ses   favoris! Sa delicatesse exquise ravit l'intelligence; elle est   tout amour et tout gaiete, pleine de noblesse et   d'enthousiasme, accessible aux sciences comme a la fantaisie,   a toutes les hautes pensees comme a tous les sentiments   dignes; elle comprend votre coeur, et seconde votre esprit. Si   vous la possedez, rien ne vous decidera jamais a y renoncer.   Vous la garderez comme votre meilleur bien.[1]"   C'est en 1870 que M. Dunn ecrivait ces belles lignes. Il veut   sans doute en prouver la sincerite en publiant aujourd'hui ce   Glossaire, oeuvre unique chez nous. On ne peut que l'en   feliciter, car il a voulu contribuer a polir un "diamant" dont   le prix est, dans toute l'acception du mot, "inestimable."   LOUIS-H. FRECHETTE.   Montreal, 1er decembre 1880.[Footnote 1: _Pourquoi nous sommes Francais_, par OSCAR DUNN. Montreal,1870.]PREFACEIl est bien etonnant que dans un pays, non pas seulement separe, maisoublie de la France depuis plus d'un siecle, la langue francaise soitrestee la langue du peuple; il serait plus etonnant encore que, dansnotre isolement, et subissant le contact journalier de la populationanglaise, nous eussions echappe au barbarisme. Au Canada, l'industrie,le commerce, les metiers sont, en grande partie du moins, diriges pardes hommes qui ne connaissent pas le francais; et pourtant, il faut secomprendre de negociants a commis, de patrons a ouvriers. Etant donneesces conditions sociales, on peut admettre _a priori_ que le francaiscanadien est entache d'anglicisme. Mais entendons-nous sur ce point.Plusieurs ecrivains ont parle du _patois_ canadien. Or, il n'y a pas depatois chez nous; nous parlons le _francais_, et nous le parlons mieux,aux intonations pres, que Paris, qui a son argot, mieux que la province,qui a ses patois. Ce qui nous manque, c'est l'articulation,l'accentuation nette, la conduite de la voix, la maniere de dire, quidonnent a la langue francaise ce charme qui nous eblouit quand elle estparlee par un "francais de France." On dirait que nous avons peur d'etreexpressifs, et voila la plus deplorable _anglicisation_ que nous ayonssubie. Quant a nos anglicismes veritables, on en exagere le nombre; onmet au compte de l'anglais bien des mots, bien des locutions qui noussont venus directement de Bretagne et de Normandie, ou qui appartiennentau vieux langage. Citons comme exemple le mot _Acertainer_. Il appellele sourire sur nos levres, nous le prenons pour une francisation del'anglais _To ascertain_; mais, de fait, c'est le contraire qui est laverite. Francois Ier, dans une lettre au parlement de Paris, datee du 9avril 1526, disait: "Et parce que nous sommes duement _acertenes_ que,etc." Le mot, du reste, est encore usite en Normandie.Entendons-nous aussi sur un autre {point}. Lorsque je dis que nousparlons mieux que Paris, je veux parler du _peuple_ au Canada compareavec celui de la capitale francaise. S'il s'agissait de la classeinstruite, des lettres, je soutiendrais une opinion toute contraire;car, chose singuliere, dans ce pays, ceux qui ont fait un coursd'etudes classique et ceux qui n'ont pas depasse l'ecole primaireparlent, a quelques nuances pres, le meme langage. Or, ce langage chezces derniers est fort distingue, de beaucoup superieur a celui de laclasse sociale correspondante en France; mais chez les premiers, le memelangage est, bien entendu, vulgaire. C'est ce qui frappe l'etranger etce qui nous vaut des critiques dont nous nous offensons.Le but que je me propose en publiant ce glossaire est donc de montrer lavraie nature des fautes que nous commettons, et d'en alleger d'autantnotre langage, s'il est possible.J'ai certainement fait des omissions, j'ai du commettre plus d'uneerreur; mais, avec le temps, et la critique aidant, je comblerai lesunes et je reparerai les autres. Je serai l'oblige de quiconquem'adressera ses observations a ce sujet, soit par lettre, soit par lavoie des journaux.Tel qu'il, est, ce glossaire, contenant un releve de plus de 1750 mots,peut servir de base a une oeuvre tres complete. Il comprend, sauferreurs et omissions: 1 deg. Les mots du cru canadien, les locutions bonneset mauvaises qui nous sont propres; 2 deg. les mots que nous employonshabituellement et qui se retrouvent dans le patois de quelque provincede France; 3 deg. les anglicismes et les expressions vicieuses; 4 deg.l'indication de plusieurs fautes de prononciation qui constituentl'accent canadien; 5 deg. bon nombre de mots tres francais dont l'usage aete condamne par quelques-uns de nos publicistes.Il n'est guere question de technologie dans ce travail; je n'ai etudieque notre langue ordinaire et commune. Les mots techniques desprofessions et des metiers demanderaient un dictionnaire special, et jecrois qu'un des traducteurs officiels de l'Assemblee poursuit, depuisplusieurs annees deja, une oeuvre de ce genre.I. On se demande tout d'abord s'il se peut qu'une locution canadienne,non sanctionnee par l'Academie, soit bonne. Je tiens pour l'affirmative.Supposons que j'amene un des quarante immortels dans la cabane d'une_sucrerie_, que je fasse de la _tire_ en son honneur, et que je luidemande comment il appelle cette operation. Le dictionnaire auquel il acollabore ne lui donnera pas la reponse. Et cependant, il faut un motpour dire la chose; mais la France, ignorant la chose, n'a pu nousfournir le mot: nous l'avons donc cree, c'etait notre droit.Il en est de meme de plusieurs autres mots que notre climat et nosconditions speciales de vie publique ou privee ont fait naitrespontanement. Ainsi, nos hivers creent un genre d'existence que lalangue francaise academique est impuissante a decrire; c'est a la languefranco-canadienne que cela est naturellement devolu. De fait, cettethese semble reconnue par l'Academie elle-meme, qui admet l'expressiontoute canadienne "Faire _portage_."II. Nous employons un bon nombre de mots qui, rejetes par l'Academie,nous sont venus toutefois de France; ils appartiennent a quelque patois.On trouvera dans ce glossaire le premier releve qui en ait ete fait.Au Canada, l'on ne constatera point sans surprise cette ingerence despatois; mais, reflexion faite, on se dira que ce glossaire est bienpetit pour une _province francaise_, et que, dans son ensemble, lalangue academique est vraiment la langue populaire chez nous.En France, on aimera sans doute a retrouver au sein de nos populationsces vieilles locutions qui datent de Montaigne et de Rabelais, tous cesmots du pays normand, breton, picard, berrichon, qui ne sont passanctionnes par l'Academie; mais qui n'en sont pas moins de provenancefrancaise. Toutes ces expressions prouvent notre origine; elles sontautant de certificats de nationalite. Aussi je me flatte qu'au point devue ethnologique, ce travail aura un certain interet.D'ailleurs, je me rappelle un mot de Charles Nodier qui autorise mesrecherches: "Si les patois n'existaient plus, il faudrait creer uneacademie pour les retrouver."III. Il en est des anglicismes comme de tous les neologismes; ilspeuvent enrichir la langue ou l'appauvrir, selon qu'ils sont faits apropos ou sans necessite. Puis il y a ceux sortes d'anglicismes, soitqu'on emprunte a l'anglais des tournures de phrase, ou qu'on en adoptecertains mots. Quant aux tournures, elles sont, ce semble, toujourscondamnables et ne peuvent qu'enlever a la langue une partie de sadistinction, de son originalite; c'est dans les mots seulement que nouspouvons trouver une augmentation de richesse; le secret consiste a lesbien choisir.Ce choix, nous l'avons fait en plus d'un cas d'une maniere fortheureuse, et souvent avec plus de discretion que les Francais eux-memes.Ceux qui ont assiste aux courses de chevaux en France et qui connaissentle jargon du sport en general admettent sans peine l'exactitude de cetteassertion. Pour ce qui est des tournures, la chose est differente. C'estla que nous pechons mortellement tous les jours, en paroles et enecrits.Et, disons-le, ce glossaire n'est pas destine a nous corriger tout afait sous ce rapport. J'ai plus de confiance dans la grammaire bienetudiee, dans les auteurs classiques bien lus.IV. J'ai parle plus haut de l'accentuation nette qui nous manque. Il y aaussi certaine maniere de prononcer quelques lettres qui donne a notrelangage un _accent_. En matiere de prononciation, accent et defaut sontsynonymes, et l'accent parisien, pour etre plus repandu et mieux, tolereque celui de Marseilles, n'en est pas moins un defaut. Nous avons tousde l'accent. Nous disons: "C'est une abomin_a_tion; Voila un beaumir_ouer_." Et nous prononcons le _d_ et le _t_ avec un son sifflant.Mais l'influence active de nos maisons d'education a deja commence aeffacer cet accent et finira par nous en debarrasser completement.V. _Accoutumance, Quasiment_ sont des mots que l'Academie reconnait.Ils ont ete neanmoins plusieurs fois denonces par des ecrivainscanadiens. Il m'a paru utile de revendiquer, en meme temps que pourplusieurs autres, leur droit de cite chez nous; Nous ne sommes pastellement riches que nous puissions refuser la vieille monnaie marqueeau bon coin.Il reste a nommer les principaux auteurs que j'ai, consultes.

Odier,notaire a Sherbrooke, et qui m'a ete presque aussi utile que lesouvrages du meme genre deja publies.Tous ces travaux ont grandement abrege mes recherches, et l'on ne doitpas oublier que si le plus difficile est de definir les mots, le pluslong est de les trouver ou de s'en souvenir. J'ai donc pris mon bien ouje l'ai trouve: c'est par ce procede qu'on arrive a completer undictionnaire. Je rappellerai--_si parva licet componere magnis_--que labase des quatre volumes de Littre est une copie presque textuelle del'Academie.Esperons que mon oeuvre sera continuee, et que le jour viendra ou, nepouvant plus ignorer nos fautes de langage, nous cesserons d'encommettre.O.D.ABREVIATIONS_Acad._............Dictionnaire de l'Academie._Angl._............Anglais ou Anglicisme._Arg._.............Argot._Bar._.............Barbare ou Barbarisme._Bret._............Bretagne._Can._.............Canada ou Canadien._Ch._..............Champagne._Ctre. de la Fr._..Centre de la France._Dict._............Dictionnaire._Edit._............Edition._Fam._.............Familier._Fig._.............Figure._Fr._..............France ou Francais._Loc._.............Locution._Lor._.............Lorraine ou Lorrain._Neol._............Neologisme._Nor._.............Normandie ou Normand._Pic._.............Picardie ou Picard._Poit._............Poitou ou Poitevin._Pop._.............Populaire._Pron._............Prononcer._Rom._.............Roman._Sig._.............Signifie ou Signification._Syn._.............Synonyme._T._...............Terme._Trad._............Traduit ou Traduction._V._...............Voir._Wal._.............Wallon.----...............Repetition du meme mot.GLOSSAIRE FRANCO-CANADIENAA.Elle.

BAILEY SAUNDERS, M.A.ON HUMAN NATURE.CONTENTS.  HUMAN NATURE  GOVERNMENT  FREE-WILL AND FATALISM  CHARACTER  MORAL INSTINCT  ETHICAL REFLECTIONSTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.The following essays are drawn from the chapters entitled _Zur Ethik_and _Zur Rechtslehre und Politik_ which are to be found both inSchopenhauer's _Parerga_ and in his posthumous writings. As in myprevious volumes, so also in this, I have omitted a few passages whichappeared to me to be either antiquated or no longer of any generalinterest. For convenience' sake I have divided the original chaptersinto sections, which I have had to name; and I have also had to inventa title which should express their real scope. The reader will findthat it is not so much _Ethics_ and _Politics_ that are here treated,as human nature itself in various aspects.T.B.S.HUMAN NATURE.Truths of the physical order may possess much external significance,but internal significance they have none. The latter is the privilegeof intellectual and moral truths, which are concerned with theobjectivation of the will in its highest stages, whereas physicaltruths are concerned with it in its lowest.For example, if we could establish the truth of what up till now isonly a conjecture, namely, that it is the action of the sun whichproduces thermoelectricity at the equator; that this producesterrestrial magnetism; and that this magnetism, again, is the cause ofthe _aurora borealis_, these would be truths externally of great, butinternally of little, significance. On the other hand, examplesof internal significance are furnished by all great and truephilosophical systems; by the catastrophe of every good tragedy; nay,even by the observation of human conduct in the extreme manifestationsof its morality and immorality, of its good and its evil character.For all these are expressions of that reality which takes outwardshape as the world, and which, in the highest stages of itsobjectivation, proclaims its innermost nature.To say that the world has only a physical and not a moral significanceis the greatest and most pernicious of all errors, the fundamentalblunder, the real perversity of mind and temper; and, at bottom, itis doubtless the tendency which faith personifies as Anti-Christ.Nevertheless, in spite of all religions--and they are systems whichone and all maintain the opposite, and seek to establish it in theirmythical way--this fundamental error never becomes quite extinct, butraises its head from time to time afresh, until universal indignationcompels it to hide itself once more.Yet, however certain we may feel of the moral significance of lifeand the world, to explain and illustrate it, and to resolve thecontradiction between this significance and the world as it is, forma task of great difficulty; so great, indeed, as to make it possiblethat it has remained for me to exhibit the true and only genuineand sound basis of morality everywhere and at all times effective,together with the results to which it leads. The actual facts ofmorality are too much on my side for me to fear that my theory canever be replaced or upset by any other.However, so long as even my ethical system continues to be ignored bythe professorial world, it is Kant's moral principle that prevails inthe universities. Among its various forms the one which is most infavour at present is "the dignity of man." I have already exposedthe absurdity of this doctrine in my treatise on the _Foundation ofMorality_.[1] Therefore I will only say here that if the question wereasked on what the alleged dignity of man rests, it would not be longbefore the answer was made that it rests upon his morality. In otherwords, his morality rests upon his dignity, and his dignity rests uponhis morality.[Footnote 1: Sec. 8.]But apart from this circular argument it seems to me that the idea ofdignity can be applied only in an ironical sense to a being whose willis so sinful, whose intellect is so limited, whose body is so weak andperishable as man's. How shall a man be proud, when his conceptionis a crime, his birth a penalty, his life a labour, and death anecessity!--  _Quid superbit homo? cujus conceptio culpa,  Nasci poena, labor vita, necesse mori_!Therefore, in opposition to the above-mentioned form of the Kantianprinciple, I should be inclined to lay down the following rule: Whenyou come into contact with a man, no matter whom, do not attempt anobjective appreciation of him according to his worth and dignity. Donot consider his bad will, or his narrow understanding and perverseideas; as the former may easily lead you to hate and the latter todespise him; but fix your attention only upon his sufferings, hisneeds, his anxieties, his pains. Then you will always feel yourkinship with him; you will sympathise with him; and instead of hatredor contempt you will experience the commiseration that alone is thepeace to which the Gospel calls us. The way to keep down hatred andcontempt is certainly not to look for a man's alleged "dignity," but,on the contrary, to regard him as an object of pity.The Buddhists, as the result of the more profound views which theyentertain on ethical and metaphysical subjects, start from thecardinal vices and not the cardinal virtues; since the virtues maketheir appearance only as the contraries or negations of the vices.According to Schmidt's _History of the Eastern Mongolians_ thecardinal vices in the Buddhist scheme are four: Lust, Indolence,Anger, and Avarice. But probably instead of Indolence, we should readPride; for so it stands in the _Lettres edifiantes et curieuses_,[1]where Envy, or Hatred, is added as a fifth. I am confirmed incorrecting the statement of the excellent Schmidt by the fact that myrendering agrees with the doctrine of the Sufis, who are certainlyunder the influence of the Brahmins and Buddhists. The Sufis alsomaintain that there are four cardinal vices, and they arrange them invery striking pairs, so that Lust appears in connection with Avarice,and Anger with Pride. The four cardinal virtues opposed to them wouldbe Chastity and Generosity, together with Gentleness and Humility.[Footnote 1: Edit, of 1819, vol. vi., p. 372.]When we compare these profound ideas of morality, as they areentertained by oriental nations, with the celebrated cardinal virtuesof Plato, which have been recapitulated again and again--Justice,Valour, Temperance, and Wisdom--it is plain that the latter are notbased on any clear, leading idea, but are chosen on grounds that aresuperficial and, in part, obviously false. Virtues must be qualitiesof the will, but Wisdom is chiefly an attribute of the Intellect.[Greek: Sophrosynae], which Cicero translates _Temperantia_, is a veryindefinite and ambiguous word, and it admits, therefore, of a varietyof applications: it may mean discretion, or abstinence, or keeping alevel head. Courage is not a virtue at all; although sometimes it is aservant or instrument of virtue; but it is just as ready to becomethe servant of the greatest villainy. It is really a quality oftemperament. Even Geulinx (in the preface to this _Ethics_) condemnedthe Platonic virtues and put the following in their place: Diligence,Obedience, Justice and Humility; which are obviously bad. The Chinesedistinguish five cardinal virtues: Sympathy, Justice, Propriety,Wisdom, and Sincerity. The virtues of Christianity are theological,not cardinal: Faith, Love, and Hope.Fundamental disposition towards others, assuming the character eitherof Envy or of Sympathy, is the point at which the moral virtues andvices of mankind first diverge. These two diametrically oppositequalities exist in every man; for they spring from the inevitablecomparison which he draws between his own lot and that of others.According as the result of this comparison affects his individualcharacter does the one or the other of these qualities become thesource and principle of all his action. Envy builds the wall between_Thee_ and _Me_ thicker and stronger; Sympathy makes it slight andtransparent; nay, sometimes it pulls down the wall altogether; andthen the distinction between self and not-self vanishes.Valour, which has been mentioned as a virtue, or rather the Courageon which it is based (for valour is only courage in war), deserves acloser examination. The ancients reckoned Courage among the virtues,and cowardice among the vices; but there is no corresponding idea inthe Christian scheme, which makes for charity and patience, and in itsteaching forbids all enmity or even resistance. The result is thatwith the moderns Courage is no longer a virtue. Nevertheless it mustbe admitted that cowardice does not seem to be very compatible withany nobility of character--if only for the reason that it betrays anovergreat apprehension about one's own person.Courage, however, may also be explained as a readiness to meet illsthat threaten at the moment, in order to avoid greater ills thatlie in the future; whereas cowardice does the contrary. But thisreadiness is of the same quality as _patience_, for patience consistsin the clear consciousness that greater evils than those which arepresent, and that any violent attempt to flee from or guard againstthe ills we have may bring the others upon us. Courage, then, wouldbe a kind of patience; and since it is patience that enables us topractise forbearance and self control, Courage is, through the mediumof patience, at least akin to virtue.But perhaps Courage admits of being considered from a higher point ofview. The fear of death may in every case be traced to a deficiencyin that natural philosophy--natural, and therefore resting on merefeeling--which gives a man the assurance that he exists in everythingoutside him just as much as in his own person; so that the death ofhis person can do him little harm. But it is just this very assurancethat would give a man heroic Courage; and therefore, as the readerwill recollect from my _Ethics_, Courage comes from the same source asthe virtues of Justice and Humanity. This is, I admit, to take a veryhigh view of the matter; but apart from it I cannot well explain whycowardice seems contemptible, and personal courage a noble and sublimething; for no lower point of view enables me to see why a finiteindividual who is everything to himself--nay, who is himself eventhe very fundamental condition of the existence of the rest of theworld--should not put his own preservation above every other aim. Itis, then, an insufficient explanation of Courage to make it restonly on utility, to give it an empirical and not a transcendentalcharacter. It may have been for some such reason that Calderon onceuttered a sceptical but remarkable opinion in regard to Courage, nay,actually denied its reality; and put his denial into the mouth of awise old minister, addressing his young sovereign. "Although," heobserved, "natural fear is operative in all alike, a man may be bravein not letting it be seen; and it is this that constitutes Courage":  _Que aunque el natural temor  En todos obra igualmente,  No mostrarle es ser valiente  Y esto es lo que hace el valor_.[1][Footnote 1: _La Hija del Aire_, ii., 2.]In regard to the difference which I have mentioned between theancients and the moderns in their estimate of Courage as a virtue,it must be remembered that by Virtue, _virtus_, [Greek: aretae], theancients understood every excellence or quality that was praiseworthyin itself, it might be moral or intellectual, or possibly onlyphysical. But when Christianity demonstrated that the fundamentaltendency of life was moral, it was moral superiority alone thanhenceforth attached to the notion of Virtue. Meanwhile the earlierusage still survived in the elder Latinists, and also in Italianwriters, as is proved by the well-known meaning of the word_virtuoso_. The special attention of students should be drawn to thiswider range of the idea of Virtue amongst the ancients, as otherwiseit might easily be a source of secret perplexity. I may recommend twopassages preserved for us by Stobaeus, which will serve this purpose.One of them is apparently from the Pythagorean philosopher Metopos, inwhich the fitness of every bodily member is declared to be a virtue.The other pronounces that the virtue of a shoemaker is to make goodshoes. This may also serve to explain why it is that in the ancientscheme of ethics virtues and vices are mentioned which find no placein ours.As the place of Courage amongst the virtues is a matter of doubt,so is that of Avarice amongst the vices. It must not, however, beconfounded with greed, which is the most immediate meaning of theLatin word _avaritia_. Let us then draw up and examine the arguments_pro et contra_ in regard to Avarice, and leave the final judgment tobe formed by every man for himself.On the one hand it is argued that it is not Avarice which is a vice,but extravagance, its opposite. Extravagance springs from a brutishlimitation to the present moment, in comparison with which the future,existing as it does only in thought, is as nothing. It rests upon theillusion that sensual pleasures possess a positive or real value.Accordingly, future need and misery is the price at which thespendthrift purchases pleasures that are empty, fleeting, and often nomore than imaginary; or else feeds his vain, stupid self-conceit onthe bows and scrapes of parasites who laugh at him in secret, or onthe gaze of the mob and those who envy his magnificence. We should,therefore, shun the spendthrift as though he had the plague, and ondiscovering his vice break with him betimes, in order that later on,when the consequences of his extravagance ensue, we may neither haveto help to bear them, nor, on the other hand, have to play the part ofthe friends of Timon of Athens.At the same time it is not to be expected that he who foolishlysquanders his own fortune will leave another man's intact, if itshould chance to be committed to his keeping; nay, _sui profusus_ and_alieni appetens_ are by Sallust very rightly conjoined. Hence it isthat extravagance leads not only to impoverishment but also to crime;and crime amongst the moneyed classes is almost always the result ofextravagance. It is accordingly with justice that the _Koran_ declaresall spendthrifts to be "brothers of Satan."But it is superfluity that Avarice brings in its train, and when wassuperfluity ever unwelcome? That must be a good vice which has goodconsequences. Avarice proceeds upon the principle that all pleasure isonly negative in its operation and that the happiness which consistsof a series of pleasures is a chimaera; that, on the contrary, itis pains which are positive and extremely real. Accordingly, theavaricious man foregoes the former in order that he may be thebetter preserved from the latter, and thus it is that _bear andforbear_--_sustine et abstine_--is his maxim. And because he knows,further, how inexhaustible are the possibilities of misfortune,and how innumerable the paths of danger, he increases the means ofavoiding them, in order, if possible, to surround himself with atriple wall of protection. Who, then, can say where precaution againstdisaster begins to be exaggerated? He alone who knows where themalignity of fate reaches its limit. And even if precaution wereexaggerated it is an error which at the most would hurt the man whotook it, and not others. If he will never need the treasures which helays up for himself, they will one day benefit others whom naturehas made less careful. That until then he withdraws the moneyfrom circulation is no misfortune; for money is not an article ofconsumption: it only represents the good things which a man mayactually possess, and is not one itself. Coins are only counters;their value is what they represent; and what they represent cannot bewithdrawn from circulation. Moreover, by holding back the money,the value of the remainder which is in circulation is enhanced byprecisely the same amount. Even though it be the case, as is said,that many a miser comes in the end to love money itself for its ownsake, it is equally certain that many a spendthrift, on the otherhand, loves spending and squandering for no better reason. Friendshipwith a miser is not only without danger, but it is profitable, becauseof the great advantages it can bring. For it is doubtless those whoare nearest and dearest to the miser who on his death will reapthe fruits of the self-control which he exercised; but even in hislifetime, too, something may be expected of him in cases of greatneed. At any rate one can always hope for more from him than from thespendthrift, who has lost his all and is himself helpless and in debt._Mas da el duro que el desnudo_, says a Spanish proverb; the man whohas a hard heart will give more than the man who has an empty purse.The upshot of all this is that Avarice is not a vice.On the other side, it may be said that Avarice is the quintessence ofall vices. When physical pleasures seduce a man from the right path,it is his sensual nature--the animal part of him--which is at fault.He is carried away by its attractions, and, overcome by the impressionof the moment, he acts without thinking of the consequences. When,on the other hand, he is brought by age or bodily weakness to thecondition in which the vices that he could never abandon end byabandoning him, and his capacity for physical pleasure dies--if heturns to Avarice, the intellectual desire survives the sensual. Money,which represents all the good things of this world, and is these goodthings in the abstract, now becomes the dry trunk overgrown with allthe dead lusts of the flesh, which are egoism in the abstract. Theycome to life again in the love of the Mammon. The transient pleasureof the senses has become a deliberate and calculated lust of money,which, like that to which it is directed, is symbolical in its nature,and, like it, indestructible.This obstinate love of the pleasures of the world--a love which, as itwere, outlives itself; this utterly incorrigible sin, this refinedand sublimated desire of the flesh, is the abstract form in which alllusts are concentrated, and to which it stands like a general idea toindividual particulars. Accordingly, Avarice is the vice of age, justas extravagance is the vice of youth.This _disputatio in utramque partem_--this debate for and against--iscertainly calculated to drive us into accepting the _juste milieu_morality of Aristotle; a conclusion that is also supported by thefollowing consideration.Every human perfection is allied to a defect into which it threatensto pass; but it is also true that every defect is allied to aperfection. Hence it is that if, as often happens, we make a mistakeabout a man, it is because at the beginning of our acquaintance withhim we confound his defects with the kinds of perfection to which theyare allied. The cautious man seems to us a coward; the economical man,a miser; the spendthrift seems liberal; the rude fellow, downright andsincere; the foolhardy person looks as if he were going to work with anoble self-confidence; and so on in many other cases.       *       *       *       *       *No one can live among men without feeling drawn again and again to thetempting supposition that moral baseness and intellectual incapacityare closely connected, as though they both sprang direct from onesource. That that, however, is not so, I have shown in detail.[1] Thatit seems to be so is merely due to the fact that both are so oftenfound together; and the circumstance is to be explained by the veryfrequent occurrence of each of them, so that it may easily happen forboth to be compelled to live under one roof. At the same time it isnot to be denied that they play into each other's hands to theirmutual benefit; and it is this that produces the very unedifyingspectacle which only too many men exhibit, and that makes the world togo as it goes. A man who is unintelligent is very likely to show hisperfidy, villainy and malice; whereas a clever man understands howto conceal these qualities. And how often, on the other hand, doesa perversity of heart prevent a man from seeing truths which hisintelligence is quite capable of grasping![Footnote 1: In my chief work, vol. ii., ch. xix,]Nevertheless, let no one boast. Just as every man, though he be thegreatest genius, has very definite limitations in some one sphere ofknowledge, and thus attests his common origin with the essentiallyperverse and stupid mass of mankind, so also has every man somethingin his nature which is positively evil. Even the best, nay thenoblest, character will sometimes surprise us by isolated traits ofdepravity; as though it were to acknowledge his kinship with the humanrace, in which villainy--nay, cruelty--is to be found in that degree.For it was just in virtue of this evil in him, this bad principle,that of necessity he became a man. And for the same reason the worldin general is what my clear mirror of it has shown it to be.But in spite of all this the difference even between one man andanother is incalculably great, and many a one would be horrified tosee another as he really is. Oh, for some Asmodeus of morality, tomake not only roofs and walls transparent to his favourites, butalso to lift the veil of dissimulation, fraud, hypocrisy, pretence,falsehood and deception, which is spread over all things! to show howlittle true honesty there is in the world, and how often, even whereit is least to be expected, behind all the exterior outwork of virtue,secretly and in the innermost recesses, unrighteousness sits at thehelm! It is just on this account that so many men of the better kindhave four-footed friends: for, to be sure, how is a man to get relieffrom the endless dissimulation, falsity and malice of mankind, ifthere were no dogs into whose honest faces he can look withoutdistrust?For what is our civilised world but a big masquerade? where you meetknights, priests, soldiers, men of learning, barristers, clergymen,philosophers, and I don't know what all! But they are not what theypretend to be; they are only masks, and, as a rule, behind the masksyou will find moneymakers. One man, I suppose, puts on the mask oflaw, which he has borrowed for the purpose from a barrister, only inorder to be able to give another man a sound drubbing; a second haschosen the mask of patriotism and the public welfare with a similarintent; a third takes religion or purity of doctrine. For all sortsof purposes men have often put on the mask of philosophy, and evenof philanthropy, and I know not what besides. Women have a smallerchoice. As a rule they avail themselves of the mask of morality,modesty, domesticity, and humility. Then there are general masks,without any particular character attaching to them like dominoes. Theymay be met with everywhere; and of this sort is the strict rectitude,the courtesy, the sincere sympathy, the smiling friendship, thatpeople profess. The whole of these masks as a rule are merely, as Ihave said, a disguise for some industry, commerce, or speculation. Itis merchants alone who in this respect constitute any honest class.They are the only people who give themselves out to be what they are;and therefore they go about without any mask at all, and consequentlytake a humble rank.It is very necessary that a man should be apprised early in life thatit is a masquerade in which he finds himself. For otherwise there aremany things which he will fail to understand and put up with, nay, atwhich he will be completely puzzled, and that man longest of all whoseheart is made of better clay--  _Et meliore luto finxit praecordia Titan.[1]_[Footnote 1: Juvenal, _Sat_. 14, 34]Such for instance is the favour that villainy finds; the neglect thatmerit, even the rarest and the greatest, suffers at the hands of thoseof the same profession; the hatred of truth and great capacity; theignorance of scholars in their own province; and the fact that truewares are almost always despised and the merely specious ones inrequest. Therefore let even the young be instructed betimes that inthis masquerade the apples are of wax, the flowers of silk, the fishof pasteboard, and that all things--yes, all things--are toys andtrifles; and that of two men whom he may see earnestly engaged inbusiness, one is supplying spurious goods and the other paying forthem in false coin.But there are more serious reflections to be made, and worse things tobe recorded. Man is at bottom a savage, horrible beast. We know it,if only in the business of taming and restraining him which we callcivilisation. Hence it is that we are terrified if now and then hisnature breaks out. Wherever and whenever the locks and chains of lawand order fall off and give place to anarchy, he shows himself forwhat he is. But it is unnecessary to wait for anarchy in order to gainenlightenment on this subject. A hundred records, old and new, producethe conviction that in his unrelenting cruelty man is in no wayinferior to the tiger and the hyaena. A forcible example is suppliedby a publication of the year 1841 entitled _Slavery and the InternalSlave Trade in the United States of North America: being replies toquestions transmitted by the British Anti-slavery Society to theAmerican Anti-slavery Society_.[1] This book constitutes one of theheaviest indictments against the human race. No one can put it downwith a feeling of horror, and few without tears. For whatever thereader may have ever heard, or imagined, or dreamt, of the unhappycondition of slavery, or indeed of human cruelty in general, it willseem small to him when he reads of the way in which those devilsin human form, those bigoted, church-going, strictly Sabbatarianrascals--and in particular the Anglican priests among them--treatedtheir innocent black brothers, who by wrong and violence had got intotheir diabolical clutches.[Footnote 1: _Translator's 'Note_.--If Schopenhauer were writingto-day, he would with equal truth point to the miseries of the Africantrade. I have slightly abridged this passage, as some of the evilsagainst which he protested no longer exist.]Other examples are furnished by Tshudi's _Travels in Peru_, in thedescription which he gives of the treatment of the Peruvian soldiersat the hands of their officers; and by Macleod's _Travels in EasternAfrica_, where the author tells of the cold-blooded and truly devilishcruelty with which the Portuguese in Mozambique treat their slaves.But we need not go for examples to the New World, that obverse side ofour planet. In the year 1848 it was brought to life that in England,not in one, but apparently in a hundred cases within a brief period, ahusband had poisoned his wife or _vice versa_, or both had joined inpoisoning their children, or in torturing them slowly to death bystarving and ill-treating them, with no other object than to get themoney for burying them which they had insured in the Burial Clubsagainst their death. For this purpose a child was often insured inseveral, even in as many as twenty clubs at once.[1][Footnote 1: Cf. _The Times_, 20th, 22nd and 23rd Sept., 1848, andalso 12th Dec., 1853.]Details of this character belong, indeed, to the blackest pages in thecriminal records of humanity. But, when all is said, it is theinward and innate character of man, this god _par excellence_ of thePantheists, from which they and everything like them proceed. In everyman there dwells, first and foremost, a colossal egoism, which breaksthe bounds of right and justice with the greatest freedom, as everydaylife shows on a small scale, and as history on every page of it on alarge. Does not the recognised need of a balance of power in Europe,with the anxious way in which it is preserved, demonstrate that manis a beast of prey, who no sooner sees a weaker man near him than hefalls upon him without fail? and does not the same hold good of theaffairs of ordinary life?But to the boundless egoism of our nature there is joined more orless in every human breast a fund of hatred, anger, envy, rancour andmalice, accumulated like the venom in a serpent's tooth, and waitingonly for an opportunity of venting itself, and then, like a demonunchained, of storming and raging. If a man has no great occasion forbreaking out, he will end by taking advantage of the smallest, and byworking it up into something great by the aid of his imagination; for,however small it may be, it is enough to rouse his anger--  _Quantulacunque adeo est occasio, sufficit irae[1]_--[Footnote 1: Juvenal, _Sat_. 13, 183.]and then he will carry it as far as he can and may. We see this indaily life, where such outbursts are well known under the name of"venting one's gall on something." It will also have been observedthat if such outbursts meet with no opposition the subject of themfeels decidedly the better for them afterwards. That anger isnot without its pleasure is a truth that was recorded even byAristotle;[1] and he quotes a passage from Homer, who declares angerto be sweeter than honey. But not in anger alone--in hatred too, whichstands to anger like a chronic to an acute disease, a man may indulgewith the greatest delight:[Footnote 1: _Rhet_., i., 11; ii., 2.]  _Now hatred is by far the longest pleasure,  Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure_[1][Footnote 1: Byron _Don Juan_, c. xiii, 6.]Gobineau in his work _Les Races Humaines_ has called man _l'animalmechant par excellence_. People take this very ill, because they feelthat it hits them; but he is quite right, for man is the only animalwhich causes pain to others without any further purpose than just tocause it. Other animals never do it except to satisfy their hunger, orin the rage of combat. If it is said against the tiger that he killsmore than eats, he strangles his prey only for the purpose of eatingit; and if he cannot eat it, the only explanation is, as the Frenchphrase has it, that _ses yeux sont plus grands que son estomac_. Noanimal ever torments another for the mere purpose of tormenting, butman does it, and it is this that constitutes the diabolical feature inhis character which is so much worse than the merely animal. I havealready spoken of the matter in its broad aspect; but it is manifesteven in small things, and every reader has a daily opportunityof observing it. For instance, if two little dogs are playingtogether--and what a genial and charming sight it is--and a child ofthree or four years joins them, it is almost inevitable for it tobegin hitting them with a whip or stick, and thereby show itself, evenat that age, _l'animal mechant par excellence_. The love of teasingand playing tricks, which is common enough, may be traced to the samesource. For instance, if a man has expressed his annoyance at anyinterruption or other petty inconvenience, there will be no lack ofpeople who for that very reason will bring it about: _animal mechantpar excellence_! This is so certain that a man should be careful notto express any annoyance at small evils. On the other hand he shouldalso be careful not to express his pleasure at any trifle, for, ifhe does so, men will act like the jailer who, when he found that hisprisoner had performed the laborious task of taming a spider, and tooka pleasure in watching it, immediately crushed it under his foot:_l'animal mechant par excellence_! This is why all animals areinstinctively afraid of the sight, or even of the track of a man, that_animal mechant par excellence_! nor does their instinct them false;for it is man alone who hunts game for which he has no use and whichdoes him no harm.It is a fact, then, that in the heart of every man there lies a wildbeast which only waits for an opportunity to storm and rage, in itsdesire to inflict pain on others, or, if they stand in his way, tokill them. It is this which is the source of all the lust of war andbattle. In trying to tame and to some extent hold it in check, theintelligence, its appointed keeper, has always enough to do. Peoplemay, if they please, call it the radical evil of human nature--aname which will at least serve those with whom a word stands for anexplanation. I say, however, that it is the will to live, which, moreand more embittered by the constant sufferings of existence, seeks toalleviate its own torment by causing torment in others. But in thisway a man gradually develops in himself real cruelty and malice. Theobservation may also be added that as, according to Kant, mattersubsists only through the antagonism of the powers of expansion andcontraction, so human society subsists only by the antagonism ofhatred, or anger, and fear. For there is a moment in the life ofall of us when the malignity of our nature might perhaps make usmurderers, if it were not accompanied by a due admixture of fear tokeep it within bounds; and this fear, again, would make a man thesport and laughing stock of every boy, if anger were not lying readyin him, and keeping watch.But it is _Schadenfreude_, a mischievous delight in the misfortunes ofothers, which remains the worst trait in human nature. It is a feelingwhich is closely akin to cruelty, and differs from it, to say thetruth, only as theory from practice. In general, it may be said of itthat it takes the place which pity ought to take--pity which is itsopposite, and the true source of all real justice and charity._Envy_ is also opposed to pity, but in another sense; envy, that isto say, is produced by a cause directly antagonistic to that whichproduces the delight in mischief. The opposition between pity and envyon the one hand, and pity and the delight in mischief on the other,rests, in the main, on the occasions which call them forth. In thecase of envy it is only as a direct effect of the cause which excitesit that we feel it at all. That is just the reason why envy, althoughit is a reprehensible feeling, still admits of some excuse, and is,in general, a very human quality; whereas the delight in mischief isdiabolical, and its taunts are the laughter of hell.The delight in mischief, as I have said, takes the place which pityought to take. Envy, on the contrary, finds a place only where thereis no inducement to pity, or rather an inducement to its opposite; andit is just as this opposite that envy arises in the human breast; andso far, therefore, it may still be reckoned a human sentiment. Nay, Iam afraid that no one will be found to be entirely free from it. Forthat a man should feel his own lack of things more bitterly at thesight of another's delight in the enjoyment of them, is natural; nay,it is inevitable; but this should not rouse his hatred of the man whois happier than himself. It is just this hatred, however, in whichtrue envy consists. Least of all should a man be envious, when it is aquestion, not of the gifts of fortune, or chance, or another's favour,but of the gifts of nature; because everything that is innate in a manrests on a metaphysical basis, and possesses justification of a higherkind; it is, so to speak, given him by Divine grace. But, unhappily,it is just in the case of personal advantages that envy is mostirreconcilable. Thus it is that intelligence, or even genius, cannotget on in the world without begging pardon for its existence, whereverit is not in a position to be able, proudly and boldly, to despise theworld.In other words, if envy is aroused only by wealth, rank, or power,it is often kept down by egoism, which perceives that, on occasion,assistance, enjoyment, support, protection, advancement, and soon, may be hoped for from the object of envy or that at least byintercourse with him a man may himself win honour from the reflectedlight of his superiority; and here, too, there is the hope of one dayattaining all those advantages himself. On the other hand, in the envythat is directed to natural gifts and personal advantages, like beautyin women, or intelligence in men, there is no consolation or hope ofone kind or the other; so that nothing remains but to indulge abitter and irreconcilable hatred of the person who possesses theseprivileges; and hence the only remaining desire is to take vengeanceon him.But here the envious man finds himself in an unfortunate position; forall his blows fall powerless as soon as it is known that they comefrom him. Accordingly he hides his feelings as carefully as if theywere secret sins, and so becomes an inexhaustible inventor of tricksand artifices and devices for concealing and masking his procedure,in order that, unperceived, he may wound the object of his envy. Forinstance, with an air of the utmost unconcern he will ignore theadvantages which are eating his heart out; he will neither see them,nor know them, nor have observed or even heard of them, and thus makehimself a master in the art of dissimulation. With great cunning hewill completely overlook the man whose brilliant qualities are gnawingat his heart, and act as though he were quite an unimportant person;he will take no notice of him, and, on occasion, will have even quiteforgotten his existence. But at the same time he will before allthings endeavour by secret machination carefully to deprive thoseadvantages of any opportunity of showing themselves and becomingknown. Then out of his dark corner he will attack these qualities withcensure, mockery, ridicule and calumny, like the toad which spurtsits poison from a hole. No less will he enthusiastically praiseunimportant people, or even indifferent or bad performances in thesame sphere. In short, he will becomes a Proteas in stratagem, inorder to wound others without showing himself. But what is the useof it? The trained eye recognises him in spite of it all. He betrayshimself, if by nothing else, by the way in which he timidly avoidsand flies from the object of his envy, who stands the more completelyalone, the more brilliant he is; and this is the reason why prettygirls have no friends of their own sex. He betrays himself, too, bythe causeless hatred which he shows--a hatred which finds vent in aviolent explosion at any circumstance however trivial, though it isoften only the product of his imagination. How many such men there arein the world may be recognised by the universal praise of modesty,that is, of a virtue invented on behalf of dull and commonplacepeople. Nevertheless, it is a virtue which, by exhibiting thenecessity for dealing considerately with the wretched plight of thesepeople, is just what calls attention to it.For our self-consciousness and our pride there can be nothing moreflattering than the sight of envy lurking in its retreat and plottingits schemes; but never let a man forget that where there is envy thereis hatred, and let him be careful not to make a false friend out ofany envious person. Therefore it is important to our safety to layenvy bare; and a man should study to discover its tricks, as it iseverywhere to be found and always goes about _incognito_; or as Ihave said, like a venomous toad it lurks in dark corners. It deservesneither quarter nor sympathy; but as we can never reconcile it let ourrule of conduct be to scorn it with a good heart, and as our happinessand glory is torture to it we may rejoice in its sufferings:  _Den Neid wirst nimmer du versoehnen;  So magst du ihn getrost verhoehnen.  Dein Glueck, dein Ruhm ist ihm ein Leiden:  Magst drum an seiner Quaal dich weiden_.We have been taking a look at the _depravity_ of man, and it is asight which may well fill us with horror. But now we must cast oureyes on the _misery_ of his existence; and when we have done so, andare horrified by that too, we must look back again at his depravity.We shall then find that they hold the balance to each other. We shallperceive the eternal justice of things; for we shall recognise thatthe world is itself the Last Judgment on it, and we shall begin tounderstand why it is that everything that lives must pay the penaltyof its existence, first in living and then in dying. Thus the evilof the penalty accords with the evil of the sin--_malum poenae_ with_malum culpae_. From the same point of view we lose our indignation atthat intellectual incapacity of the great majority of mankind which inlife so often disgusts us. In this _Sansara_, as the Buddhists callit, human misery, human depravity and human folly correspond with oneanother perfectly, and they are of like magnitude. But if, on somespecial inducement, we direct our gaze to one of them, and survey itin particular, it seems to exceed the other two. This, however, is anillusion, and merely the effect of their colossal range.All things proclaim this _Sansara_; more than all else, the world ofmankind; in which, from a moral point of view, villainy and baseness,and from an intellectual point of view, incapacity and stupidity,prevail to a horrifying extent. Nevertheless, there appear init, although very spasmodically, and always as a fresh surprise,manifestations of honesty, of goodness, nay, even of nobility; andalso of great intelligence, of the thinking mind of genius. They neverquite vanish, but like single points of light gleam upon us out of thegreat dark mass. We must accept them as a pledge that this _Sansara_contains a good and redeeming principle, which is capable of breakingthrough and of filling and freeing the whole of it.       *       *       *       *       *The readers of my _Ethics_ know that with me the ultimate foundationof morality is the truth which in the _Vedas_ and the _Vedanta_receives its expression in the established, mystical formula, _Tattwam asi (This is thyself_), which is spoken with reference to everyliving thing, be it man or beast, and is called the _Mahavakya_, thegreat word.Actions which proceed in accordance with this principle, such as thoseof the philanthropist, may indeed be regarded as the beginning ofmysticism. Every benefit rendered with a pure intention proclaims thatthe man who exercises it acts in direct conflict with the world ofappearance; for he recognises himself as identical with anotherindividual, who exists in complete separation from him. Accordingly,all disinterested kindness is inexplicable; it is a mystery; and hencein order to explain it a man has to resort to all sorts of fictions.When Kant had demolished all other arguments for theism, he admittedone only, that it gave the best interpretation and solution of suchmysterious actions, and of all others like them. He therefore allowedit to stand as a presumption unsusceptible indeed of theoreticalproof, but valid from a practical point of view. I may, however,express my doubts whether he was quite serious about it. For to makemorality rest on theism is really to reduce morality to egoism;although the English, it is true, as also the lowest classes ofsociety with us, do not perceive the possibility of any otherfoundation for it.The above-mentioned recognition of a man's own true being inanother individual objectively presented to him, is exhibited in aparticularly beautiful and clear way in the cases in which a man,already destined to death beyond any hope of rescue, gives himself upto the welfare of others with great solicitude and zeal, and tries tosave them. Of this kind is the well-known story of a servant who wasbitten in a courtyard at night by a mad dog. In the belief that shewas beyond hope, she seized the dog and dragged it into a stable,which she then locked, so that no one else might be bitten. Then againthere is the incident in Naples, which Tischbein has immortalised inone of his _aquarelles_. A son, fleeing from the lava which is rapidlystreaming toward the sea, is carrying his aged father on his back.When there is only a narrow strip of land left between the devouringelements, the father bids the son put him down, so that the son maysave himself by flight, as otherwise both will be lost. The son obeys,and as he goes casts a glance of farewell on his father. This is themoment depicted. The historical circumstance which Scott representsin his masterly way in _The Heart of Midlothian_, chap, ii., is of aprecisely similar kind; where, of two delinquents condemned to death,the one who by his awkwardness caused the capture of the other happilysets him free in the chapel by overpowering the guard after theexecution-sermon, without at the same time making any attempt on hisown behalf. Nay, in the same category must also be placed the scenewhich is represented in a common engraving, which may perhaps beobjectionable to western readers--I mean the one in which a soldier,kneeling to be shot, is trying by waving a cloth to frighten away hisdog who wants to come to him.In all these cases we see an individual in the face of his ownimmediate and certain destruction no longer thinking of savinghimself, so that he may direct the whole of his efforts to saving someone else. How could there be a clearer expression of the consciousnessthat what is being destroyed is only a phenomenon, and that thedestruction itself is only a phenomenon; that, on the other hand, thereal being of the man who meets his death is untouched by that event,and lives on in the other man, in whom even now, as his actionbetrays, he so clearly perceives it to exist? For if this were not so,and it was his real being which was about to be annihilated, how couldthat being spend its last efforts in showing such an ardent sympathyin the welfare and continued existence of another?There are two different ways in which a man may become consciousof his own existence. On the one hand, he may have an empiricalperception of it, as it manifests itself externally--something sosmall that it approaches vanishing point; set in a world which, asregards time and space, is infinite; one only of the thousand millionsof human creatures who run about on this planet for a very briefperiod and are renewed every thirty years. On the other hand, by goingdown into the depths of his own nature, a man may become consciousthat he is all in all; that, in fact, he is the only real being; andthat, in addition, this real being perceives itself again in others,who present themselves from without, as though they formed a mirror ofhimself.Of these two ways in which a man may come to know what he is, thefirst grasps the phenomenon alone, the mere product of _the principleof individuation_; whereas the second makes a man immediatelyconscious that he is _the thing-in-itself_. This is a doctrine inwhich, as regards the first way, I have Kant, and as regards both, Ihave the _Vedas_, to support me.There is, it is true, a simple objection to the second method. It maybe said to assume that one and the same being can exist in differentplaces at the same time, and yet be complete in each of them.Although, from an empirical point of view, this is the most palpableimpossibility--nay, absurdity--it is nevertheless perfectly trueof the thing-in-itself. The impossibility and the absurdity of it,empirically, are only due to the forms which phenomena assume,in accordance with the principle of individuation. For thething-in-itself, the will to live, exists whole and undivided in everybeing, even in the smallest, as completely as in the sum-total of allthings that ever were or are or will be. This is why every being, eventhe smallest, says to itself, So long as I am safe, let the worldperish--_dum ego salvus sim, pereat mundus_. And, in truth, even ifonly one individual were left in the world, and all the rest were toperish, the one that remained would still possess the whole self-beingof the world, uninjured and undiminished, and would laugh at thedestruction of the world as an illusion. This conclusion _perimpossible_ may be balanced by the counter-conclusion, which is on allfours with it, that if that last individual were to be annihilated inand with him the whole world would be destroyed. It was in this sensethat the mystic Angelas Silesius[1] declared that God could not livefor a moment without him, and that if he were to be annihilated Godmust of necessity give up the ghost:  _Ich weiss dass ohne mich Gott nicht ein Nu kann leben;  Werd' ich zunicht, er muss von Noth den Geist aufgeben_.[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--Angelus Silesius, see _Counsels andMaxims_, p. 39, note.]But the empirical point of view also to some extent enables us toperceive that it is true, or at least possible, that our self canexist in other beings whose consciousness is separated and differentfrom our own. That this is so is shown by the experience ofsomnambulists. Although the identity of their ego is preservedthroughout, they know nothing, when they awake, of all that a momentbefore they themselves said, did or suffered. So entirely is theindividual consciousness a phenomenon that even in the same ego twoconsciousnesses can arise of which the one knows nothing of the other.GOVERNMENT.It is a characteristic failing of the Germans to look in the cloudsfor what lies at their feet. An excellent example of this is furnishedby the treatment which the idea of _Natural Right_ has received atthe hands of professors of philosophy. When they are called uponto explain those simple relations of human life which make up thesubstance of this right, such as Right and Wrong, Property, State,Punishment and so on, they have recourse to the most extravagant,abstract, remote and meaningless conceptions, and out of them build aTower of Babel reaching to the clouds, and taking this or that formaccording to the special whim of the professor for the time being. Theclearest and simplest relations of life, such as affect us directly,are thus made quite unintelligible, to the great detriment of theyoung people who are educated in such a school. These relationsthemselves are perfectly simple and easily understood--as the readermay convince himself if he will turn to the account which I have givenof them in the _Foundation of Morality_, Sec. 17, and in my chief work,bk. i., Sec. 62. But at the sound of certain words, like Right, Freedom,the Good, Being--this nugatory infinitive of the cupola--and manyothers of the same sort, the German's head begins to swim, and fallingstraightway into a kind of delirium he launches forth into high-flownphrases which have no meaning whatever. He takes the most remote andempty conceptions, and strings them together artificially, instead offixing his eyes on the facts, and looking at things and relations asthey really are. It is these things and relations which supply theideas of Right and Freedom, and give them the only true meaning thatthey possess.The man who starts from the preconceived opinion that the conceptionof Right must be a positive one, and then attempts to define it, willfail; for he is trying to grasp a shadow, to pursue a spectre, tosearch for what does not exist. The conception of Right is a negativeone, like the conception of Freedom; its content is mere negation.It is the conception of Wrong which is positive; Wrong has the samesignificance as _injury_--_laesio_--in the widest sense of the term.An injury may be done either to a man's person or to his property orto his honour; and accordingly a man's rights are easy to define:every one has a right to do anything that injures no one else.To have a right to do or claim a thing means nothing more than to beable to do or take or vise it without thereby injuring any one else._Simplex sigillum veri_. This definition shows how senseless manyquestions are; for instance, the question whether we have the right totake our own life, As far as concerns the personal claims which othersmay possibly have upon us, they are subject to the condition that weare alive, and fall to the ground when we die. To demand of a man, whodoes not care to live any longer for himself, that he should liveon as a mere machine for the advantage of others is an extravagantpretension.Although men's powers differ, their rights are alike. Their rights donot rest upon their powers, because Right is of a moral complexion;they rest on the fact that the same will to live shows itself inevery man at the same stage of its manifestation. This, however, onlyapplies to that original and abstract Right, which a man possesses asa man. The property, and also the honour, which a man acquires forhimself by the exercise of his powers, depend on the measure and kindof power which he possesses, and so lend his Right a wider sphere ofapplication. Here, then, equality comes to an end. The man who isbetter equipped, or more active, increases by adding to his gains, nothis Right, but the number of the things to which it extends.In my chief work[1] I have proved that the State in its essence ismerely an institution existing for the purpose of protecting itsmembers against outward attack or inward dissension. It follows fromthis that the ultimate ground on which the State is necessary is theacknowledged lack of Right in the human race. If Right were there, noone would think of a State; for no one would have any fear that hisrights would be impaired; and a mere union against the attacks of wildbeasts or the elements would have very little analogy with what wemean by a State. From this point of view it is easy to see how dulland stupid are the philosophasters who in pompous phrases representthat the State is the supreme end and flower of human existence. Sucha view is the apotheosis of Philistinism.[Footnote 1: 1 Bk. ii., ch. xlvii.]If it were Right that ruled in the world, a man would have done enoughin building his house, and would need no other protection than theright of possessing it, which would be obvious. But since Wrong is theorder of the day, it is requisite that the man who has built his houseshould also be able to protect it. Otherwise his Right is _defacto_ incomplete; the aggressor, that is to say, has the right ofmight--_Faustrecht_; and this is just the conception of Rightwhich Spinoza entertains. He recognises no other. His words are:_unusquisque tantum juris habet quantum potentia valet_;[1] each manhas as much right as he has power. And again: _uniuscujusque juspotentia ejus definitur_; each man's right is determined by hispower.[2] Hobbes seems to have started this conception of Right,[3]and he adds the strange comment that the Right of the good Lord to allthings rests on nothing but His omnipotence.[Footnote 1: _Tract. Theol. Pol_., ch. ii., Sec. 8.][Footnote 2: _Ethics_, IV., xxxvii., 1.][Footnote 3: Particularly in a passage in the _De Cive_, I, Sec. 14.]Now this is a conception of Right which, both in theory and inpractice, no longer prevails in the civic world; but in the worldin general, though abolished in theory, it continues to apply inpractice. The consequences of neglecting it may be seen in the caseof China. Threatened by rebellion within and foes without, this greatempire is in a defenceless state, and has to pay the penalty of havingcultivated only the arts of peace and ignored the arts of war.There is a certain analogy between the operations of nature and thoseof man which is a peculiar but not fortuitous character, and is basedon the identity of the will in both. When the herbivorous animals hadtaken their place in the organic world, beasts of prey made theirappearance--necessarily a late appearance--in each species, andproceeded to live upon them. Just in the same way, as soon as byhonest toil and in the sweat of their faces men have won from theground what is needed for the support of their societies, a number ofindividuals are sure to arise in some of these societies, who, insteadof cultivating the earth and living on its produce, prefer to taketheir lives in their hands and risk health and freedom by falling uponthose who are in possession of what they have honestly earned, and byappropriating the fruits of their labour. These are the beasts ofprey in the human race; they are the conquering peoples whom we findeverywhere in history, from the most ancient to the most recent times.Their varying fortunes, as at one moment they succeed and at anotherfail, make up the general elements of the history of the world. HenceVoltaire was perfectly right when he said that the aim of all war isrobbery. That those who engage in it are ashamed of their doings isclear by the fact that governments loudly protest their reluctance toappeal to arms except for purposes of self-defence. Instead of tryingto excuse themselves by telling public and official lies, which arealmost more revolting than war itself, they should take their stand,as bold as brass, on Macchiavelli's doctrine. The gist of it may bestated to be this: that whereas between one individual and another,and so far as concerns the law and morality of their relations,the principle, _Don't do to others what you wouldn't like done toyourself_, certainly applies, it is the converse of this principlewhich is appropriate in the case of nations and in politics: _What youwouldn't like done to yourself do to others_. If you do not want tobe put under a foreign yoke, take time by the forelock, and put yourneighbour under it himself; whenever, that is to say, his weaknessoffers you the opportunity. For if you let the opportunity pass, itwill desert one day to the enemy's camp and offer itself there. Thenyour enemy will put you under his yoke; and your failure to grasp theopportunity may be paid for, not by the generation which was guilty ofit, but by the next. This Macchiavellian principle is always a muchmore decent cloak for the lust of robbery than the rags of veryobvious lies in a speech from the head of the State; lies, too, of adescription which recalls the well-known story of the rabbit attackingthe dog. Every State looks upon its neighbours as at bottom a horde ofrobbers, who will fall upon it as soon as they have the opportunity.       *       *       *       *       *Between the serf, the farmer, the tenant, and the mortgagee, thedifference is rather one of form than of substance. Whether thepeasant belongs to me, or the land on which he has to get a living;whether the bird is mine, or its food, the tree or its fruit, is amatter of little moment; for, as Shakespeare makes Shylock say:                              _You take my life  When you do take the means whereby I live_.The free peasant has, indeed, the advantage that he can go off andseek his fortune in the wide world; whereas the serf who is attachedto the soil, _glebae adscriptus_, has an advantage which is perhapsstill greater, that when failure of crops or illness, old age orincapacity, render him helpless, his master must look after him, andso he sleeps well at night; whereas, if the crops fail, his mastertosses about on his bed trying to think how he is to procure bread forhis men. As long ago as Menander it was said that it is better tobe the slave of a good master than to live miserably as a freeman.Another advantage possessed by the free is that if they have anytalents they can improve their position; but the same advantage is notwholly withheld from the slave. If he proves himself useful to hismaster by the exercise of any skill, he is treated accordingly; justas in ancient Rome mechanics, foremen of workshops, architects, nay,even doctors, were generally slaves.Slavery and poverty, then, are only two forms, I might almost say onlytwo names, of the same thing, the essence of which is that a man'sphysical powers are employed, in the main, not for himself but forothers; and this leads partly to his being over-loaded with work, andpartly to his getting a scanty satisfaction for his needs. For Naturehas given a man only as much physical power as will suffice, if heexerts it in moderation, to gain a sustenance from the earth. No greatsuperfluity of power is his. If, then, a not inconsiderable number ofmen are relieved from the common burden of sustaining the existenceof the human race, the burden of the remainder is augmented, and theysuffer. This is the chief source of the evil which under the name ofslavery, or under the name of the proletariat, has always oppressedthe great majority of the human race.But the more remote cause of it is luxury. In order, it may be said,that some few persons may have what is unnecessary, superfluous,and the product of refinement--nay, in order that they may satisfyartificial needs--a great part of the existing powers of mankindhas to be devoted to this object, and therefore withdrawn from theproduction of what is necessary and indispensable. Instead of buildingcottages for themselves, thousands of men build mansions for a few.Instead of weaving coarse materials for themselves and their families,they make fine cloths, silk, or even lace, for the rich, and ingeneral manufacture a thousand objects of luxury for their pleasure. Agreat part of the urban population consists of workmen who make thesearticles of luxury; and for them and those who give them work thepeasants have to plough and sow and look after the flocks as wellas for themselves, and thus have more labour than Nature originallyimposed upon them. Moreover, the urban population devotes a great dealof physical strength, and a great deal of land, to such things aswine, silk, tobacco, hops, asparagus and so on, instead of to corn,potatoes and cattle-breeding. Further, a number of men are withdrawnfrom agriculture and employed in ship-building and seafaring, in orderthat sugar, coffee, tea and other goods may be imported. In short,a large part of the powers of the human race is taken away from theproduction of what is necessary, in order to bring what is superfluousand unnecessary within the reach of a few. As long therefore as luxuryexists, there must be a corresponding amount of over-work and misery,whether it takes the name of poverty or of slavery. The fundamentaldifference between the two is that slavery originates in violence,and poverty in craft. The whole unnatural condition of society--theuniversal struggle to escape from misery, the sea-trade attended withso much loss of life, the complicated interests of commerce, andfinally the wars to which it all gives rise--is due, only and alone,to luxury, which gives no happiness even to those who enjoy it, nay,makes them ill and bad-tempered. Accordingly it looks as if the mosteffective way of alleviating human misery would be to diminish luxury,or even abolish it altogether.There is unquestionably much truth in this train of thought. But theconclusion at which it arrives is refuted by an argument possessingthis advantage over it--that it is confirmed by the testimony ofexperience. A certain amount of work is devoted to purposes of luxury.What the human race loses in this way in the _muscular power_ whichwould otherwise be available for the necessities of existence isgradually made up to it a thousandfold by the _nervous power_, which,in a chemical sense, is thereby released. And since the intelligenceand sensibility which are thus promoted are on a higher level than themuscular irritability which they supplant, so the achievements of mindexceed those of the body a thousandfold. One wise counsel is worth thework of many hands:  [Greek: Hos en sophon bouleuma tas pollon cheiras nika.]A nation of nothing but peasants would do little in the way ofdiscovery and invention; but idle hands make active heads. Science andthe Arts are themselves the children of luxury, and they dischargetheir debt to it. The work which they do is to perfect technology inall its branches, mechanical, chemical and physical; an art which inour days has brought machinery to a pitch never dreamt of before, andin particular has, by steam and electricity, accomplished things thelike of which would, in earlier ages, have been ascribed to the agencyof the devil. In manufactures of all kinds, and to some extent inagriculture, machines now do a thousand times more than could everhave been done by the hands of all the well-to-do, educated, andprofessional classes, and could ever have been attained if all luxuryhad been abolished and every one had returned to the life of apeasant. It is by no means the rich alone, but all classes, who derivebenefit from these industries. Things which in former days hardlyany one could afford are now cheap and abundant, and even the lowestclasses are much better off in point of comfort. In the Middle Ages aKing of England once borrowed a pair of silk stockings from one of hislords, so that he might wear them in giving an audience to the Frenchambassador. Even Queen Elizabeth was greatly pleased and astonished toreceive a pair as a New Year's present; to-day every shopman has them.Fifty years ago ladies wore the kind of calico gowns which servantswear now. If mechanical science continues to progress at the samerate for any length of time, it may end by saving human labour almostentirely, just as horses are even now being largely superseded bymachines. For it is possible to conceive that intellectual culturemight in some degree become general in the human race; and this wouldbe impossible as long as bodily labour was incumbent on any great partof it. Muscular irritability and nervous sensibility are always andeverywhere, both generally and particularly, in antagonism; for thesimple reason that it is one and the same vital power which underliesboth. Further, since the arts have a softening effect on character, itis possible that quarrels great and small, wars and duels, will vanishfrom the world; just as both have become much rarer occurrences.However, it is not my object here to write a _Utopia_.But apart from all this the arguments used above in favour of theabolition of luxury and the uniform distribution of all bodily labourare open to the objection that the great mass of mankind, always andeverywhere, cannot do without leaders, guides and counsellors, inone shape or another, according to the matter in question; judges,governors, generals, officials, priests, doctors, men of learning,philosophers, and so on, are all a necessity. Their common task is tolead the race for the greater part so incapable and perverse, throughthe labyrinth of life, of which each of them according to his positionand capacity has obtained a general view, be his range wide or narrow.That these guides of the race should be permanently relieved of allbodily labour as well as of all vulgar need and discomfort; nay,that in proportion to their much greater achievements they shouldnecessarily own and enjoy more than the common man, is natural andreasonable. Great merchants should also be included in the sameprivileged class, whenever they make far-sighted preparations fornational needs.The question of the sovereignty of the people is at bottom the sameas the question whether any man can have an original right to rulea people against its will. How that proposition can be reasonablymaintained I do not see. The people, it must be admitted, issovereign; but it is a sovereign who is always a minor. It must havepermanent guardians, and it can never exercise its rights itself,without creating dangers of which no one can foresee the end;especially as like all minors, it is very apt to become the sport ofdesigning sharpers, in the shape of what are called demagogues.Voltaire remarks that the first man to become a king was a successfulsoldier. It is certainly the case that all princes were originallyvictorious leaders of armies, and for a long time it was as such thatthey bore sway. On the rise of standing armies princes began to regardtheir people as a means of sustaining themselves and their soldiers,and treated them, accordingly, as though they were a herd of cattle,which had to be tended in order that it might provide wool, milk, andmeat. The why and wherefore of all this, as I shall presently show indetail, is the fact that originally it was not right, but might, thatruled in the world. Might has the advantage of having been the firstin the field. That is why it is impossible to do away with it andabolish it altogether; it must always have its place; and all that aman can wish or ask is that it should be found on the side of rightand associated with it. Accordingly says the prince to his subjects:"I rule you in virtue of the power which I possess. But, on the otherhand, it excludes that of any one else, and I shall suffer none butmy own, whether it comes from without, or arises within by one of youtrying to oppress another. In this way, then, you are protected." Thearrangement was carried out; and just because it was carried out theold idea of kingship developed with time and progress into quite adifferent idea, and put the other one in the background, where it maystill be seen, now and then, flitting about like a spectre. Its placehas been taken by the idea of the king as father of his people, asthe firm and unshakable pillar which alone supports and maintains thewhole organisation of law and order, and consequently the rightsof every man.[1] But a king can accomplish this only by inbornprerogative which reserves authority to him and to him alone--anauthority which is supreme, indubitable, and beyond all attack, nay,to which every one renders instinctive obedience. Hence the king isrightly said to rule "by the grace of God." He is always the mostuseful person in the State, and his services are never too dearlyrepaid by any Civil List, however heavy.[Footnote 1: We read in Stobaeus, _Florilegium_, ch. xliv., 41, of aPersian custom, by which, whenever a king died, there was a five days'anarchy, in order that people might perceive the advantage of havingkings and laws.]But even as late a writer as Macchiavelli was so decidedly imbued withthe earlier or mediaeval conception of the position of a prince thathe treats it as a matter which is self-evident: he never discusses it,but tacitly takes it as the presupposition and basis of his advice.It may be said generally that his book is merely the theoreticalstatement and consistent and systematic exposition of the practiceprevailing in his time. It is the novel statement of it in a completetheoretical form that lends it such a poignant interest. The samething, I may remark in passing, applies to the immortal little work ofLa Rochefaucauld, who, however, takes private and not public life forhis theme, and offers, not advice, but observations. The title of thisfine little book is open, perhaps, to some objection: the contents arenot, as a rule, either _maxims_ or _reflections_, but _apercus_;and that is what they should be called. There is much, too, inMacchiavelli that will be found also to apply to private life.Right in itself is powerless; in nature it is Might that rules. Toenlist might on the side of right, so that by means of it rightmay rule, is the problem of statesmanship. And it is indeed a hardproblem, as will be obvious if we remember that almost every humanbreast is the seat of an egoism which has no limits, and is usuallyassociated with an accumulated store of hatred and malice; so thatat the very start feelings of enmity largely prevail over those offriendship. We have also to bear in mind that it is many millions ofindividuals so constituted who have to be kept in the bonds of lawand order, peace and tranquillity; whereas originally every one hada right to say to every one else: _I am just as good as you are_! Aconsideration of all this must fill us with surprise that on the wholethe world pursues its way so peacefully and quietly, and with so muchlaw and order as we see to exist. It is the machinery of State whichalone accomplishes it. For it is physical power alone which has anydirect action on men; constituted as they generally are, it is forphysical power alone that they have any feeling or respect.If a man would convince himself by experience that this is the case,he need do nothing but remove all compulsion from his fellows, and tryto govern them by clearly and forcibly representing to them whatis reasonable, right, and fair, though at the same time it may becontrary to their interests. He would be laughed to scorn; and asthings go that is the only answer he would get. It would soon beobvious to him that moral force alone is powerless. It is, then,physical force alone which is capable of securing respect. Now thisforce ultimately resides in the masses, where it is associated withignorance, stupidity and injustice. Accordingly the main aim ofstatesmanship in these difficult circumstances is to put physicalforce in subjection to mental force--to intellectual superiority, andthus to make it serviceable. But if this aim is not itself accompaniedby justice and good intentions the result of the business, if itsucceeds, is that the State so erected consists of knaves and fools,the deceivers and the deceived. That this is the case is madegradually evident by the progress of intelligence amongst the masses,however much it may be repressed; and it leads to revolution. Butif, contrarily, intelligence is accompanied by justice and goodintentions, there arises a State as perfect as the character of humanaffairs will allow. It is very much to the purpose if justice andgood intentions not only exist, but are also demonstrable and openlyexhibited, and can be called to account publicly, and be subject tocontrol. Care must be taken, however, lest the resulting participationof many persons in the work of government should affect the unity ofthe State, and inflict a loss of strength and concentration on thepower by which its home and foreign affairs have to be administered.This is what almost always happens in republics. To produce aconstitution which should satisfy all these demands would accordinglybe the highest aim of statesmanship. But, as a matter of fact,statesmanship has to consider other things as well. It has to reckonwith the people as they exist, and their national peculiarities. Thisis the raw material on which it has to work, and the ingredients ofthat material will always exercise a great effect on the completedscheme.Statesmanship will have achieved a good deal if it so far attains itsobject as to reduce wrong and injustice in the community to a minimum.To banish them altogether, and to leave no trace of them, is merelythe ideal to be aimed at; and it is only approximately that it can bereached. If they disappear in one direction, they creep in again inanother; for wrong and injustice lie deeply rooted in human nature.Attempts have been made to attain the desired aim by artificialconstitutions and systematic codes of law; but they are not incomplete touch with the facts--they remain an asymptote, for thesimple reason that hard and fast conceptions never embrace allpossible cases, and cannot be made to meet individual instances. Suchconceptions resemble the stones of a mosaic rather than the delicateshading in a picture. Nay, more: all experiments in this matter areattended with danger; because the material in question, namely, thehuman race, is the most difficult of all material to handle. It isalmost as dangerous as an explosive.No doubt it is true that in the machinery of the State the freedomof the press performs the same function as a safety-valve in othermachinery; for it enables all discontent to find a voice; nay, indoing so, the discontent exhausts itself if it has not much substance;and if it has, there is an advantage in recognising it betimesand applying the remedy. This is much better than to repress thediscontent, and let it simmer and ferment, and go on increasing untilit ends in an explosion. On the other hand, the freedom of the pressmay be regarded as a permission to sell poison--poison for the heartand the mind. There is no idea so foolish but that it cannot be putinto the heads of the ignorant and incapable multitude, especially ifthe idea holds out some prospect of any gain or advantage. And when aman has got hold of any such idea what is there that he will not do?I am, therefore, very much afraid that the danger of a free pressoutweighs its utility, particularly where the law offers a way ofredressing wrongs. In any case, however, the freedom of the pressshould be governed by a very strict prohibition of all and everyanonymity.Generally, indeed, it may be maintained that right is of a natureanalogous to that of certain chemical substances, which cannot beexhibited in a pure and isolated condition, but at the most only witha small admixture of some other substance, which serves as a vehiclefor them, or gives them the necessary consistency; such as fluorine,or even alcohol, or prussic acid. Pursuing the analogy we may say thatright, if it is to gain a footing in the world and really prevail,must of necessity be supplemented by a small amount of arbitraryforce, in order that, notwithstanding its merely ideal and thereforeethereal nature, it may be able to work and subsist in the real andmaterial world, and not evaporate and vanish into the clouds, asit does in Hesoid. Birth-right of every description, all heritableprivileges, every form of national religion, and so on, may beregarded as the necessary chemical base or alloy; inasmuch as it isonly when right has some such firm and actual foundation that it canbe enforced and consistently vindicated. They form for right a sort of[Greek: os moi pou sto]--a fulcrum for supporting its lever.Linnaeus adopted a vegetable system of an artificial and arbitrarycharacter. It cannot be replaced by a natural one, no matter howreasonable the change might be, or how often it has been attempted tomake it, because no other system could ever yield the same certaintyand stability of definition. Just in the same way the artificial andarbitrary basis on which, as has been shown, the constitution ofa State rests, can never be replaced by a purely natural basis. Anatural basis would aim at doing away with the conditions that havebeen mentioned: in the place of the privileges of birth it would putthose of personal merit; in the place of the national religion, theresults of rationalistic inquiry, and so on. However agreeable toreason this might all prove, the change could not be made; because anatural basis would lack that certainty and fixity of definition whichalone secures the stability of the commonwealth. A constitution whichembodied abstract right alone would be an excellent thing for naturesother than human, but since the great majority of men are extremelyegoistic, unjust, inconsiderate, deceitful, and sometimes evenmalicious; since in addition they are endowed with very scantyintelligence there arises the necessity for a power that shall beconcentrated in one man, a power that shall be above all law andright, and be completely irresponsible, nay, to which everything shallyield as to something that is regarded as a creature of a higherkind, a ruler by the grace of God. It is only thus that men can bepermanently held in check and governed.The United States of North America exhibit the attempt to proceedwithout any such arbitrary basis; that is to say, to allow abstractright to prevail pure and unalloyed. But the result is not attractive.For with all the material prosperity of the country what do we find?The prevailing sentiment is a base Utilitarianism with its inevitablecompanion, ignorance; and it is this that has paved the way for aunion of stupid Anglican bigotry, foolish prejudice, coarse brutality,and a childish veneration of women. Even worse things are the order ofthe day: most iniquitous oppression of the black freemen, lynch law,frequent assassination often committed with entire impunity, duels ofa savagery elsewhere unknown, now and then open scorn of all law andjustice, repudiation of public debts, abominable political rascalitytowards a neighbouring State, followed by a mercenary raid on its richterritory,--afterwards sought to be excused, on the part of the chiefauthority of the State, by lies which every one in the country knew tobe such and laughed at--an ever-increasing ochlocracy, and finallyall the disastrous influence which this abnegation of justice in highquarters must have exercised on private morals. This specimen of apure constitution on the obverse side of the planet says very littlefor republics in general, but still less for the imitations of it inMexico, Guatemala, Colombia and Peru.A peculiar disadvantage attaching to republics--and one that mightnot be looked for--is that in this form of government it must be moredifficult for men of ability to attain high position and exercisedirect political influence than in the case of monarchies. For alwaysand everywhere and under all circumstances there is a conspiracy, orinstinctive alliance, against such men on the part of all the stupid,the weak, and the commonplace; they look upon such men as theirnatural enemies, and they are firmly held together by a common fear ofthem. There is always a numerous host of the stupid and the weak,and in a republican constitution it is easy for them to suppress andexclude the men of ability, so that they may not be outflanked bythem. They are fifty to one; and here all have equal rights at thestart.In a monarchy, on the other hand, this natural and universal league ofthe stupid against those who are possessed of intellectual advantagesis a one-sided affair; it exists only from below, for in a monarchytalent and intelligence receive a natural advocacy and support fromabove. In the first place, the position of the monarch himself ismuch too high and too firm for him to stand in fear of any sort ofcompetition. In the next place, he serves the State more by his willthan by his intelligence; for no intelligence could ever be equalto all the demands that would in his case be made upon it. He istherefore compelled to be always availing himself of other men'sintelligence. Seeing that his own interests are securely bound up withthose of his country; that they are inseparable from them and one withthem, he will naturally give the preference to the best men, becausethey are his most serviceable instruments, and he will bestow hisfavour upon them--as soon, that is, as he can find them; which is notso difficult, if only an honest search be made. Just in the sameway even ministers of State have too much advantage over risingpoliticians to need to regard them with jealousy; and accordingly foranalogous reasons they are glad to single out distinguished men andset them to work, in order to make use of their powers for themselves.It is in this way that intelligence has always under a monarchicalgovernment a much better chance against its irreconcilable andever-present foe, stupidity; and the advantage which it gains is verygreat.In general, the monarchical form of government is that which isnatural to man; just as it is natural to bees and ants, to a flight ofcranes, a herd of wandering elephants, a pack of wolves seeking preyin common, and many other animals, all of which place one of theirnumber at the head of the business in hand. Every business in whichmen engage, if it is attended with danger--every campaign, everyship at sea--must also be subject to the authority of one commander;everywhere it is one will that must lead. Even the animal organism isconstructed on a monarchical principle: it is the brain alone whichguides and governs, and exercises the hegemony. Although heart, lungs,and stomach contribute much more to the continued existence of thewhole body, these philistines cannot on that account be allowed toguide and lead. That is a business which belongs solely to the brain;government must proceed from one central point. Even the solar systemis monarchical. On the other hand, a republic is as unnatural as itis unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts andsciences. Accordingly we find that everywhere in the world, and at alltimes, nations, whether civilised or savage, or occupying a positionbetween the two, are always under monarchical government. The rule ofmany as Homer said, is not a good thing: let there be one ruler, oneking;  [Greek: Ouk agathon polykoiraniae-eis koiranos esto  Eis basoleus.] [1][Footnote 1: _Iliad_, ii., 204.]How would it be possible that, everywhere and at all times, we shouldsee many millions of people, nay, even hundreds of millions, becomethe willing and obedient subjects of one man, sometimes even onewoman, and provisionally, even, of a child, unless there were amonarchical instinct in men which drove them to it as the form ofgovernment best suited to them? This arrangement is not the productof reflection. Everywhere one man is king, and for the most part hisdignity is hereditary. He is, as it were, the personification, themonogram, of the whole people, which attains an individuality in him.In this sense he can rightly say: _l'etat c'est moi_. It is preciselyfor this reason that in Shakespeare's historical plays the kingsof England and France mutually address each other as _France_ and_England_, and the Duke of Austria goes by the name of his country. Itis as though the kings regarded themselves as the incarnation of theirnationalities. It is all in accordance with human nature; and for thisvery reason the hereditary monarch cannot separate his own welfare andthat of his family from the welfare of his country; as, on the otherhand, mostly happens when the monarch is elected, as, for instance, inthe States of the Church.[1] The Chinese can conceive of a monarchicalgovernment only; what a republic is they utterly fail to understand.When a Dutch legation was in China in the year 1658, it was obliged torepresent that the Prince of Orange was their king, as otherwise theChinese would have been inclined to take Holland for a nest of piratesliving without any lord or master.[2] Stobaeus, in a chapter in his_Florilegium_, at the head of which he wrote _That monarchy is best_,collected the best of the passages in which the ancients explainedthe advantages of that form of government. In a word, republics areunnatural and artificial; they are the product of reflection. Hence itis that they occur only as rare exceptions in the whole history ofthe world. There were the small Greek republics, the Roman and theCarthaginian; but they were all rendered possible by the fact thatfive-sixths, perhaps even seven-eighths, of the population consistedof slaves. In the year 1840, even in the United States, there werethree million slaves to a population of sixteen millions. Then, again,the duration of the republics of antiquity, compared with that ofmonarchies, was very short. Republics are very easy to found, andvery difficult to maintain, while with monarchies it is exactly thereverse. If it is Utopian schemes that are wanted, I say this: theonly solution of the problem would be a despotism of the wise and thenoble, of the true aristocracy and the genuine nobility, brought aboutby the method of generation--that is, by the marriage of the noblestmen with the cleverest and most intellectual women. This is my Utopia,my Republic of Plato.[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--The reader will recollect thatSchopenhauer was writing long before the Papal territories wereabsorbed into the kingdom of Italy.][Footnote 2: See Jean Nieuhoff, _L'Ambassade de la Compagnie Orientaledes Provinces Unies vers L'Empereur de la Chine_, traduit par Jean leCharpentier a Leyde, 1665; ch. 45.]Constitutional kings are undoubtedly in much the same position asthe gods of Epicurus, who sit upon high in undisturbed bliss andtranquillity, and do not meddle with human affairs. Just now they arethe fashion. In every German duodecimo-principality a parody of theEnglish constitution is set up, quite complete, from Upper andLower Houses down to the Habeas Corpus Act and trial by jury. Theseinstitutions, which proceed from English character and Englishcircumstances, and presuppose both, are natural and suitable to theEnglish people. It is just as natural to the German people to be splitup into a number of different stocks, under a similar number of rulingPrinces, with an Emperor over them all, who maintains peace at home,and represents the unity of the State board. It is an arrangementwhich has proceeded from German character and German circumstances.I am of opinion that if Germany is not to meet with the same fate asItaly, it must restore the imperial crown, which was done away withby its arch-enemy, the first Napoleon; and it must restore it aseffectively as possible. [1] For German unity depends on it, andwithout the imperial crown it will always be merely nominal, orprecarious. But as we no longer live in the days of Guenther ofSchwarzburg, when the choice of Emperor was a serious business, theimperial crown ought to go alternately to Prussia and to Austria, forthe life of the wearer. In any case, the absolute sovereignty of thesmall States is illusory. Napoleon I. did for Germany what Otto theGreat did for Italy: he divided it into small, independent States, onthe principle, _divide et impera_.[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--Here, again, it is hardly necessaryto say that Schopenhauer, who died in 1860, and wrote this passage atleast some years previously, cannot be referring to any of theevents which culminated in 1870. The whole passage forms a strikingillustration of his political sagacity.]The English show their great intelligence, amongst other ways, byclinging to their ancient institutions, customs and usages, and byholding them sacred, even at the risk of carrying this tenacity toofar, and making it ridiculous. They hold them sacred for the simplereason that those institutions and customs are not the invention of anidle head, but have grown up gradually by the force of circumstanceand the wisdom of life itself, and are therefore suited to them as anation. On the other hand, the German Michel[1] allows himself to bepersuaded by his schoolmaster that he must go about in an Englishdress-coat, and that nothing else will do. Accordingly he has bulliedhis father into giving it to him; and with his awkward manners thisungainly creature presents in it a sufficiently ridiculous figure. Butthe dress-coat will some day be too tight for him and incommode him.It will not be very long before he feels it in trial by jury. Thisinstitution arose in the most barbarous period of the Middle Ages--thetimes of Alfred the Great, when the ability to read and write exempteda man from the penalty of death. It is the worst of all criminalprocedures. Instead of judges, well versed in law and of greatexperience, who have grown grey in daily unravelling the tricks andwiles of thieves, murderers and rascals of all sorts, and so are wellable to get at the bottom of things, it is gossiping tailors andtanners who sit in judgment; it is their coarse, crude, unpractised,and awkward intelligence, incapable of any sustained attention, thatis called upon to find out the truth from a tissue of lies and deceit.All the time, moreover, they are thinking of their cloth and theirleather, and longing to be at home; and they have absolutely no clearnotion at all of the distinction between probability and certainty. Itis with this sort of a calculus of probabilities in their stupid headsthat they confidently undertake to seal a man's doom.[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--It may be well to explain that"Michel" is sometimes used by the Germans as a nickname of theirnation, corresponding to "John Bull" as a nickname of the English.Fluegel in his German-English Dictionary declares that _der deutscheMichel_ represents the German nation as an honest, blunt, unsuspiciousfellow, who easily allows himself to be imposed upon, even, he adds,with a touch of patriotism, "by those who are greatly his inferiors inpoint of strength and real worth."]The same remark is applicable to them which Dr. Johnson made of acourt-martial in which he had little confidence, summoned to decide avery important case. He said that perhaps there was not a member ofit who, in the whole course of his life, had ever spent an hour byhimself in balancing probabilities.[1] Can any one imagine that thetailor and the tanner would be impartial judges? What! the viciousmultitude impartial! as if partiality were not ten times more to befeared from men of the same class as the accused than from judges whoknew nothing of him personally, lived in another sphere altogether,were irremovable, and conscious of the dignity of their office. Butto let a jury decide on crimes against the State and its head, or onmisdemeanours of the press, is in a very real sense to set the fox tokeep the geese.[Footnote 1: Boswell's _Johnson_, 1780, set. 71.]Everywhere and at all times there has been much discontent withgovernments, laws and public regulations; for the most part, however,because men are always ready to make institutions responsible for themisery inseparable from human existence itself; which is, to speakmythically, the curse that was laid on Adam, and through him on thewhole race. But never has that delusion been proclaimed in a moremendacious and impudent manner than by the demagogues of the_Jetstzeit_--of the day we live in. As enemies of Christianity, theyare, of course, optimists: to them the world is its own end andobject, and accordingly in itself, that is to say, in its own naturalconstitution, it is arranged on the most excellent principles, andforms a regular habitation of bliss. The enormous and glaring evils ofthe world they attribute wholly to governments: if governments, theythink, were to do their duty, there would be a heaven upon earth; inother words, all men could eat, drink, propagate and die, free fromtrouble and want. This is what they mean when they talk of the worldbeing "its own end and object"; this is the goal of that "perpetualprogress of the human race," and the other fine things which they arenever tired of proclaiming.Formerly it was _faith_ which was the chief support of the throne;nowadays it is _credit_. The Pope himself is scarcely more concernedto retain the confidence of the faithful than to make his creditorsbelieve in his own good faith. If in times past it was the guilty debtof the world which was lamented, now it is the financial debts of theworld which arouse dismay. Formerly it was the Last Day which wasprophesied; now it is the [Greek: seisachtheia] the great repudiation,the universal bankruptcy of the nations, which will one day happen;although the prophet, in this as in the other case, entertains a firmhope that he will not live to see it himself.From an ethical and a rational point of view, the _right ofpossession_ rests upon an incomparably better foundation than the_right of birth_; nevertheless, the right of possession is allied withthe right of birth and has come to be part and parcel of it, so thatit would hardly be possible to abolish the right of birth withoutendangering the right of possession. The reason of this is that mostof what a man possesses he inherited, and therefore holds by a kind ofright of birth; just as the old nobility bear the names only of theirhereditary estates, and by the use of those names do no more than giveexpression to the fact that they own the estates. Accordingly allowners of property, if instead of being envious they were wise, oughtalso to support the maintenance of the rights of birth.The existence of a nobility has, then, a double advantage: it helps tomaintain on the one hand the rights of possession, and on the otherthe right of birth belonging to the king. For the king is the firstnobleman in the country, and, as a general rule, he treats thenobility as his humble relations, and regards them quite otherwisethan the commoners, however trusty and well-beloved. It is quitenatural, too, that he should have more confidence in those whoseancestors were mostly the first ministers, and always the immediateassociates, of his own. A nobleman, therefore, appeals with reasonto the name he bears, when on the occurrence of anything to rousedistrust he repeats his assurance of fidelity and service to the king.A man's character, as my readers are aware, assuredly comes to himfrom his father. It is a narrow-minded and ridiculous thing not toconsider whose son a man is.FREE-WILL AND FATALISM.No thoughtful man can have any doubt, after the conclusions reached inmy prize-essay on _Moral Freedom_, that such freedom is to be sought,not anywhere in nature, but outside of it. The only freedom thatexists is of a metaphysical character. In the physical world freedomis an impossibility. Accordingly, while our several actions are in nowise free, every man's individual character is to be regarded as afree act. He is such and such a man, because once for all it is hiswill to be that man. For the will itself, and in itself, and also inso far as it is manifest in an individual, and accordingly constitutesthe original and fundamental desires of that individual, isindependent of all knowledge, because it is antecedent to suchknowledge. All that it receives from knowledge is the series ofmotives by which it successively develops its nature and makes itselfcognisable or visible; but the will itself, as something that liesbeyond time, and so long as it exists at all, never changes. Thereforeevery man, being what he is and placed in the circumstances whichfor the moment obtain, but which on their part also arise by strictnecessity, can absolutely never do anything else than just what atthat moment he does do. Accordingly, the whole course of a man's life,in all its incidents great and small, is as necessarily predeterminedas the course of a clock.The main reason of this is that the kind of metaphysical free actwhich I have described tends to become a knowing consciousness--aperceptive intuition, which is subject to the forms of space and time.By means of those forms the unity and indivisibility of the act arerepresented as drawn asunder into a series of states and events,which are subject to the Principle of Sufficient Reason in its fourforms--and it is this that is meant by _necessity_. But the result ofit all assumes a moral complexion. It amounts to this, that by what wedo we know what we are, and by what we suffer we know what we deserve.Further, it follows from this that a man's _individuality_ does notrest upon the principle of individuation alone, and therefore is notaltogether phenomenal in its nature. On the contrary, it has its rootsin the thing-in-itself, in the will which is the essence of eachindividual. The character of this individual is itself individual. Buthow deep the roots of individuality extend is one of the questionswhich I do not undertake to answer.In this connection it deserves to be mentioned that even Plato, in hisown way, represented the individuality of a man as a free act.[1] Herepresented him as coming into the world with a given tendency, whichwas the result of the feelings and character already attaching tohim in accordance with the doctrine of metempsychosis. The Brahminphilosophers also express the unalterable fixity of innate characterin a mystical fashion. They say that Brahma, when a man is produced,engraves his doings and sufferings in written characters on his skull,and that his life must take shape in accordance therewith. They pointto the jagged edges in the sutures of the skull-bones as evidence ofthis writing; and the purport of it, they say, depends on his previouslife and actions. The same view appears to underlie the Christian, orrather, the Pauline, dogma of Predestination.[Footnote 1: _Phaedrus_ and _Laws, bk_. x.]But this truth, which is universally confirmed by experience, isattended with another result. All genuine merit, moral as well asintellectual, is not merely physical or empirical in its origin,but metaphysical; that is to say, it is given _a priori_ and not _aposteriori_; in other words, it lies innate and is not acquired,and therefore its source is not a mere phenomenon, but thething-in-itself. Hence it is that every man achieves only that whichis irrevocably established in his nature, or is born with him.Intellectual capacity needs, it is true, to be developed just as manynatural products need to be cultivated in order that we may enjoy oruse them; but just as in the case of a natural product no cultivationcan take the place of original material, neither can it do so in thecase of intellect. That is the reason why qualities which are merelyacquired, or learned, or enforced--that is, qualities _a posteriori_,whether moral or intellectual--are not real or genuine, butsuperficial only, and possessed of no value. This is a conclusion oftrue metaphysics, and experience teaches the same lesson to all whocan look below the surface. Nay, it is proved by the great importancewhich we all attach to such innate characteristics as physiognomy andexternal appearance, in the case of a man who is at all distinguished;and that is why we are so curious to see him. Superficial people, tobe sure,--and, for very good reasons, commonplace people too,--will beof the opposite opinion; for if anything fails them they will thus beenabled to console themselves by thinking that it is still to come.The world, then, is not merely a battlefield where victory and defeatreceive their due recompense in a future state. No! the world isitself the Last Judgment on it. Every man carries with him the rewardand the disgrace that he deserves; and this is no other than thedoctrine of the Brahmins and Buddhists as it is taught in the theoryof metempsychosis.The question has been raised, What two men would do, who lived asolitary life in the wilds and met each other for the first time.Hobbes, Pufendorf, and Rousseau have given different answers.Pufendorf believed that they would approach each other as friends;Hobbes, on the contrary, as enemies; Rousseau, that they would passeach other by In silence. All three are both right and wrong. Thisis just a case in which the incalculable difference that there is ininnate moral disposition between one individual and another would makeits appearance. The difference is so strong that the question hereraised might be regarded as the standard and measure of it. For thereare men in whom the sight of another man at once rouses a feeling ofenmity, since their inmost nature exclaims at once: That is not me!There are, others in whom the sight awakens immediate sympathy; theirinmost nature says: _That is me over again_! Between the two thereare countless degrees. That in this most important matter we are sototally different is a great problem, nay, a mystery.In regard to this _a priori_ nature of moral character there is matterfor varied reflection in a work by Bastholm, a Danish writer, entitled_Historical Contributions to the Knowledge of Man in the SavageState_. He is struck by the fact that intellectual culture and moralexcellence are shown to be entirely independent of each other,inasmuch as one is often found without the other. The reason of this,as we shall find, is simply that moral excellence in no wise springsfrom reflection, which is developed by intellectual culture, butfrom the will itself, the constitution of which is innate and notsusceptible in itself of any improvement by means of education.Bastholm represents most nations as very vicious and immoral; and onthe other hand he reports that excellent traits of character are foundamongst some savage peoples; as, for instance, amongst the Orotchyses,the inhabitants of the island Savu, the Tunguses, and the Pelewislanders. He thus attempts to solve the problem, How it is that sometribes are so remarkably good, when their neighbours are all bad,It seems to me that the difficulty may be explained as follows: Moralqualities, as we know, are heritable, and an isolated tribe, such asis described, might take its rise in some one family, and ultimatelyin a single ancestor who happened to be a good man, and then maintainits purity. Is it not the case, for instance, that on many unpleasantoccasions, such as repudiation of public debts, filibustering raidsand so on, the English have often reminded the North Americans oftheir descent from English penal colonists? It is a reproach, however,which can apply only to a small part of the population.It is marvellous how _every man's individuality_ (that is to say, theunion of a definite character with a definite intellect) accuratelydetermines all his actions and thoughts down to the most unimportantdetails, as though it were a dye which pervaded them; and how, inconsequence, one man's whole course of life, in other words, his innerand outer history, turns out so absolutely different from another's.As a botanist knows a plant in its entirety from a single leaf; asCuvier from a single bone constructed the whole animal, so an accurateknowledge of a man's whole character may be attained from a singlecharacteristic act; that is to say, he himself may to some extentbe constructed from it, even though the act in question is of verytrifling consequence. Nay, that is the most perfect test of all, forin a matter of importance people are on their guard; in triflesthey follow their natural bent without much reflection. That iswhy Seneca's remark, that even the smallest things may be taken asevidence of character, is so true: _argumenta morum ex minimis quoquelicet capere_.[1] If a man shows by his absolutely unscrupulous andselfish behaviour in small things that a sentiment of justice isforeign to his disposition, he should not be trusted with a pennyunless on due security. For who will believe that the man who everyday shows that he is unjust in all matters other than those whichconcern property, and whose boundless selfishness everywhere protrudesthrough the small affairs of ordinary life which are subject tono scrutiny, like a dirty shirt through the holes of a raggedjacket--who, I ask, will believe that such a man will act honourablyin matters of _meum_ and _tuum_ without any other incentive but thatof justice? The man who has no conscience in small things will be ascoundrel in big things. If we neglect small traits of character,we have only ourselves to blame if we afterwards learn to ourdisadvantage what this character is in the great affairs of life. Onthe same principle, we ought to break with so-called friends even inmatters of trifling moment, if they show a character that is maliciousor bad or vulgar, so that we may avoid the bad turn which only waitsfor an opportunity of being done us. The same thing applies toservants. Let it always be our maxim: Better alone than amongsttraitors.[Footnote 1: _Ep_., 52.]Of a truth the first and foremost step in all knowledge of mankind isthe conviction that a man's conduct, taken as a whole, and in all itsessential particulars, is not governed by his reason or by any of theresolutions which he may make in virtue of it. No man becomes this orthat by wishing to be it, however earnestly. His acts proceed from hisinnate and unalterable character, and they are more immediately andparticularly determined by motives. A man's conduct, therefore, is thenecessary product of both character and motive. It may be illustratedby the course of a planet, which is the result of the combined effectof the tangential energy with which it is endowed, and the centripetalenergy which operates from the sun. In this simile the former energyrepresents character, and the latter the influence of motive. It isalmost more than a mere simile. The tangential energy which properlyspeaking is the source of the planet's motion, whilst on theother hand the motion is kept in check by gravitation, is, from ametaphysical point of view, the will manifesting itself in that body.To grasp this fact is to see that we really never form anything morethan a conjecture of what we shall do under circumstances which arestill to happen; although we often take our conjecture for a resolve.When, for instance, in pursuance of a proposal, a man with thegreatest sincerity, and even eagerness, accepts an engagement to dothis or that on the occurrence of a certain future event, it is byno means certain that he will fulfil the engagement; unless he is soconstituted that the promise which he gives, in itself and as such, isalways and everywhere a motive sufficient for him, by acting upon him,through considerations of honour, like some external compulsion. Butabove and beyond this, what he will do on the occurrence of that eventmay be foretold from true and accurate knowledge of his character andthe external circumstances under the influence of which he will fall;and it may with complete certainty be foretold from this alone. Nay,it is a very easy prophecy if he has been already seen in a likeposition; for he will inevitably do the same thing a second time,provided that on the first occasion he had a true and completeknowledge of the facts of the case. For, as I have often remarked, afinal cause does not impel a man by being real, but by being known;_causa finalis non movet secundum suum esse reale, sed secundum essecognitum_.[1] Whatever he failed to recognise or understand the firsttime could have no influence upon his will; just as an electriccurrent stops when some isolating body hinders the action of theconductor. This unalterable nature of character, and the consequentnecessity of our actions, are made very clear to a man who has not,on any given occasion, behaved as he ought to have done, by showinga lack either of resolution or endurance or courage, or some otherquality demanded at the moment. Afterwards he recognises what it isthat he ought to have done; and, sincerely repenting of his incorrectbehaviour, he thinks to himself, _If the opportunity were offered tome again, I should act differently_. It is offered once more; the sameoccasion recurs; and to his great astonishment he does precisely thesame thing over again.[2][Footnote 1: Suarez, _Disp. Metaph_., xxiii.; Sec.Sec.7 and 8.][Footnote 2: Cf. _World as Will_, ii., pp. 251 ff. _sqq_. (thirdedition).]The best examples of the truth in question are in every way furnishedby Shakespeare's plays. It is a truth with which he was thoroughlyimbued, and his intuitive wisdom expressed it in a concrete shape onevery page. I shall here, however, give an instance of it in a case inwhich he makes it remarkably clear, without exhibiting any design oraffectation in the matter; for he was a real artist and never setout from general ideas. His method was obviously to work up to thepsychological truth which he grasped directly and intuitively,regardless of the fact that few would notice or understand it, andwithout the smallest idea that some dull and shallow fellows inGermany would one day proclaim far and wide that he wrote his works toillustrate moral commonplaces. I allude to the character of the Earlof Northumberland, whom we find in three plays in succession, althoughhe does not take a leading part in any one of them; nay, he appearsonly in a few scenes distributed over fifteen acts. Consequently, ifthe reader is not very attentive, a character exhibited at such greatintervals, and its moral identity, may easily escape his notice, eventhough it has by no means escaped the poet's. He makes the earl appeareverywhere with a noble and knightly grace, and talk in languagesuitable to it; nay, he sometimes puts very beautiful and evenelevated passages, into his mouth. At the same time he is very farfrom writing after the manner of Schiller, who was fond of paintingthe devil black, and whose moral approval or disapproval of thecharacters which he presented could be heard in their own words. WithShakespeare, and also with Goethe, every character, as long as he ison the stage and speaking, seems to be absolutely in the right, eventhough it were the devil himself. In this respect let the readercompare Duke Alba as he appears in Goethe with the same character inSchiller.We make the acquaintance of the Earl of Northumberland in the play of_Richard II_., where he is the first to hatch a plot against the Kingin favour of Bolingbroke, afterwards Henry IV., to whom he even offerssome personal flattery (Act II., Sc. 3). In the following act hesuffers a reprimand because, in speaking of the King he talks of himas "Richard," without more ado, but protests that he did it only forbrevity's sake. A little later his insidious words induce the King tosurrender. In the following act, when the King renounces the crown,Northumberland treats him with such harshness and contempt that theunlucky monarch is quite broken, and losing all patience once moreexclaims to him: _Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell_! Atthe close, Northumberland announces to the new King that he has sentthe heads of the former King's adherents to London.In the following tragedy, _Henry IV_., he hatches a plot against thenew King in just the same way. In the fourth act we see the rebelsunited, making preparations for the decisive battle on the morrow, andonly waiting impatiently for Northumberland and his division. At lastthere arrives a letter from him, saying that he is ill, and that hecannot entrust his force to any one else; but that nevertheless theothers should go forward with courage and make a brave fight. Theydo so, but, greatly weakened by his absence, they are completelydefeated; most of their leaders are captured, and his own son, thevalorous Hotspur, falls by the hand of the Prince of Wales.Again, in the following play, the _Second Part of Henry IV_., we seehim reduced to a state of the fiercest wrath by the death of his son,and maddened by the thirst for revenge. Accordingly he kindles anotherrebellion, and the heads of it assemble once more. In the fourth act,just as they are about to give battle, and are only waiting for him tojoin them, there comes a letter saying that he cannot collect a properforce, and will therefore seek safety for the present in Scotland;that, nevertheless, he heartily wishes their heroic undertaking thebest success. Thereupon they surrender to the King under a treatywhich is not kept, and so perish.So far is character from being the work of reasoned choice andconsideration that in any action the intellect has nothing to do butto present motives to the will. Thereafter it looks on as a merespectator and witness at the course which life takes, in accordancewith the influence of motive on the given character. All the incidentsof life occur, strictly speaking, with the same necessity as themovement of a clock. On this point let me refer to my prize-essay on_The Freedom of the Will_. I have there explained the true meaning andorigin of the persistent illusion that the will is entirely free inevery single action; and I have indicated the cause to which it isdue. I will only add here the following teleological explanation ofthis natural illusion.Since every single action of a man's life seems to possess the freedomand originality which in truth only belong to his character as heapprehends it, and the mere apprehension of it by his intellect iswhat constitutes his career; and since what is original in everysingle action seems to the empirical consciousness to be always beingperformed anew, a man thus receives in the course of his career thestrongest possible moral lesson. Then, and not before, he becomesthoroughly conscious of all the bad sides of his character. Conscienceaccompanies every act with the comment: _You should act differently_,although its true sense is: _You could be other than you are_. As theresult of this immutability of character on the one hand, and, on theother, of the strict necessity which attends all the circumstances inwhich character is successively placed, every man's course of lifeis precisely determined from Alpha right through to Omega. But,nevertheless, one man's course of life turns out immeasurably happier,nobler and more worthy than another's, whether it be regarded from asubjective or an objective point of view, and unless we are to excludeall ideas of justice, we are led to the doctrine which is wellaccepted in Brahmanism and Buddhism, that the subjective conditions inwhich, as well as the objective conditions under which, every man isborn, are the moral consequences of a previous existence.Macchiavelli, who seems to have taken no interest whatever inphilosophical speculations, is drawn by the keen subtlety of his veryunique understanding into the following observation, which possessesa really deep meaning. It shows that he had an intuitive knowledge ofthe entire necessity with which, characters and motives being given,all actions take place. He makes it at the beginning of the prologueto his comedy _Clitia_. _If_, he says, _the same men were to recurin the world in the way that the same circumstances recur, a hundredyears would never elapse without our finding ourselves together oncemore, and doing the same things as we are doing now--Se nel mondotornassino i medesimi uomini, como tornano i medesimi casi, nonpassarebbono mai cento anni che noi non ci trovassimo un altra voltainsieme, a fare le medesime cose che hora_. He seems however to havebeen drawn into the remark by a reminiscence of what Augustine says inhis _De Civitate Dei_, bk. xii., ch. xiii.Again, Fate, or the [Greek: eimarmenae] of the ancients, is nothingbut the conscious certainty that all that happens is fast bound by achain of causes, and therefore takes place with a strict necessity;that the future is already ordained with absolute certainty and canundergo as little alteration as the past. In the fatalistic myths ofthe ancients all that can be regarded as fabulous is the predictionof the future; that is, if we refuse to consider the possibility ofmagnetic clairvoyance and second sight. Instead of trying to explainaway the fundamental truth of Fatalism by superficial twaddle andfoolish evasion, a man should attempt to get a clear knowledge andcomprehension of it; for it is demonstrably true, and it helps us in avery important way to an understanding of the mysterious riddle ofour life. Predestination and Fatalism do not differ in the main. Theydiffer only in this, that with Predestination the given character andexternal determination of human action proceed from a rational Being,and with Fatalism from an irrational one. But in either case theresult is the same: that happens which must happen.On the other hand the conception of _Moral Freedom_ is inseparablefrom that of _Originality_. A man may be said, but he cannot beconceived, to be the work of another, and at the same time be free inrespect of his desires and acts. He who called him into existence outof nothing in the same process created and determined his nature--inother words, the whole of his qualities. For no one can create withoutcreating a something, that is to say, a being determined throughoutand in all its qualities. But all that a man says and does necessarilyproceeds from the qualities so determined; for it is only thequalities themselves set in motion. It is only some external impulsethat they require to make their appearance. As a man is, so must heact; and praise or blame attaches, not to his separate acts, but tohis nature and being.That is the reason why Theism and the moral responsibility of man areincompatible; because responsibility always reverts to the creator ofman and it is there that it has its centre. Vain attempts have beenmade to make a bridge from one of these incompatibles to the other bymeans of the conception of moral freedom; but it always breaks downagain. What is _free_ must also be _original_. If our will is _free_,our will is also _the original element_, and conversely. Pre-Kantiandogmatism tried to separate these two predicaments. It was therebycompelled to assume two kinds of freedom, one cosmological, of thefirst cause, and the other moral and theological, of human will. Theseare represented in Kant by the third as well as the fourth antimony offreedom.On the other hand, in my philosophy the plain recognition of thestrictly necessary character of all action is in accordance with thedoctrine that what manifests itself even in the organic and irrationalworld is _will_. If this were not so, the necessity under whichirrational beings obviously act would place their action in conflictwith will; if, I mean, there were really such a thing as the freedomof individual action, and this were not as strictly necessitated asevery other kind of action. But, as I have just shown, it is this samedoctrine of the necessary character of all acts of will which makes itneedful to regard a man's existence and being as itself the work ofhis freedom, and consequently of his will. The will, therefore, mustbe self-existent; it must possess so-called _a-se-ity_. Under theopposite supposition all responsibility, as I have shown, would be atan end, and the moral like the physical world would be a mere machine,set in motion for the amusement of its manufacturer placed somewhereoutside of it. So it is that truths hang together, and mutuallyadvance and complete one another; whereas error gets jostled at everycorner.What kind of influence it is that _moral instruction_ may exerciseon conduct, and what are the limits of that influence, are questionswhich I have sufficiently examined in the twentieth section of mytreatise on the _Foundation of Morality_. In all essential particularsan analogous influence is exercised by _example_, which, however, hasa more powerful effect than doctrine, and therefore it deserves abrief analysis.In the main, example works either by restraining a man or byencouraging him. It has the former effect when it determines him toleave undone what he wanted to do. He sees, I mean, that other peopledo not do it; and from this he judges, in general, that it is notexpedient; that it may endanger his person, or his property, or hishonour.He rests content, and gladly finds himself relieved from examininginto the matter for himself. Or he may see that another man, who hasnot refrained, has incurred evil consequences from doing it; this isexample of the deterrent kind. The example which encourages a manworks in a twofold manner. It either induces him to do what he wouldbe glad to leave undone, if he were not afraid lest the omission mightin some way endanger him, or injure him in others' opinion; or else itencourages him to do what he is glad to do, but has hitherto refrainedfrom doing from fear of danger or shame; this is example of theseductive kind. Finally, example may bring a man to do what he wouldhave otherwise never thought of doing. It is obvious that in this lastcase example works in the main only on the intellect; its effect onthe will is secondary, and if it has any such effect, it is by theinterposition of the man's own judgment, or by reliance on the personwho presented the example.The whole influence of example--and it is very strong--rests on thefact that a man has, as a rule, too little judgment of his own, andoften too little knowledge, o explore his own way for himself, andthat he is glad, therefore, to tread in the footsteps of some oneelse. Accordingly, the more deficient he is in either of thesequalities, the more is he open to the influence of example; and wefind, in fact, that most men's guiding star is the example of others;that their whole course of life, in great things and in small, comesin the end to be mere imitation; and that not even in the pettiestmatters do they act according to their own judgment. Imitation andcustom are the spring of almost all human action. The cause of itis that men fight shy of all and any sort of reflection, and veryproperly mistrust their own discernment. At the same time thisremarkably strong imitative instinct in man is a proof of his kinshipwith apes.But the kind of effect which example exercises depends upon a man'scharacter, and thus it is that the same example may possibly seduceone man and deter another. An easy opportunity of observing this isafforded in the case of certain social impertinences which come intovogue and gradually spread. The first time that a man notices anythingof the kind, he may say to himself: _For shame! how can he do it! howselfish and inconsiderate of him! really, I shall take care never todo anything like that_. But twenty others will think: _Aha! if he doesthat, I may do it too_.As regards morality, example, like doctrine, may, it is true, promotecivil or legal amelioration, but not that inward amendment which is,strictly speaking, the only kind of moral amelioration. For examplealways works as a personal motive alone, and assumes, therefore,that a man is susceptible to this sort of motive. But it is just thepredominating sensitiveness of a character to this or that sort ofmotive that determines whether its morality is true and real; though,of whatever kind it is, it is always innate. In general it may be saidthat example operates as a means of promoting the good and the badqualities of a character, but it does not create them; and so itis that Seneca's maxim, _velle non discitur_--_will cannot belearned_--also holds good here. But the innateness of all truly moralqualities, of the good as of the bad, is a doctrine that consortsbetter with the metempsychosis of the Brahmins and Buddhists,according to which a man's good and bad deeds follow him from oneexistence to another like his shadow, than with Judaism. For Judaismrequires a man to come into the world as a moral blank, so that, invirtue of an inconceivable free will, directed to objects whichare neither to be sought nor avoided--_liberum arbitriumindifferentiae_--and consequently as the result of reasonedconsideration, he may choose whether he is to be an angel or a devil,or anything else that may lie between the two. Though I am well awarewhat the Jewish scheme is, I pay no attention to it; for my standardis truth. I am no professor of philosophy, and therefore I do not findmy vocation in establishing the fundamental ideas of Judaism at anycost, even though they for ever bar the way to all and every kind ofphilosophical knowledge. _Liberum arbitrium indifferentiae_ underthe name of _moral freedom_ is a charming doll for professors ofphilosophy to dandle; and we must leave it to those intelligent,honourable and upright gentlemen.CHARACTER.Men who aspire to a happy, a brilliant and a long life, instead of toa virtuous one, are like foolish actors who want to be always havingthe great parts,--the parts that are marked by splendour and triumph.They fail to see that the important thing is not _what_ or _how much_,but _how_ they act.Since _a man does not alter_, and his _moral character_ remainsabsolutely the same all through his life; since he must play out thepart which he has received, without the least deviation from thecharacter; since neither experience, nor philosophy, nor religioncan effect any improvement in him, the question arises, What is themeaning of life at all? To what purpose is it played, this farcein which everything that is essential is irrevocably fixed anddetermined?It is played that a man may come to understand himself, that he maysee what it is that he seeks and has sought to be; what he wants, andwhat, therefore, he is. _This is a knowledge which must be impartedto him from without_. Life is to man, in other words, to will, whatchemical re-agents are to the body: it is only by life that a manreveals what he is, and it is only in so far as he reveals himselfthat he exists at all. Life is the manifestation of character, of thesomething that we understand by that word; and it is not in life, butoutside of it, and outside time, that character undergoes alteration,as a result of the self-knowledge which life gives. Life is onlythe mirror into which a man gazes not in order that he may get areflection of himself, but that he may come to understand himself bythat reflection; that he may see _what_ it is that the mirror shows.Life is the proof sheet, in which the compositors' errors are broughtto light. How they become visible, and whether the type is large orsmall, are matters of no consequence. Neither in the externals of lifenor in the course of history is there any significance; for as it isall one whether an error occurs in the large type or in the small, soit is all one, as regards the essence of the matter, whether an evildisposition is mirrored as a conqueror of the world or a commonswindler or ill-natured egoist. In one case he is seen of all men; inthe other, perhaps only of himself; but that he should see himself iswhat signifies.Therefore if egoism has a firm hold of a man and masters him, whetherit be in the form of joy, or triumph, or lust, or hope, or franticgrief, or annoyance, or anger, or fear, or suspicion, or passion ofany kind--he is in the devil's clutches and how he got into them doesnot matter. What is needful is that he should make haste to get out ofthem; and here, again, it does not matter how.I have described _character_ as _theoretically_ an act of will lyingbeyond time, of which life in time, or _character in action_, is thedevelopment. For matters of practical life we all possess the one aswell as the other; for we are constituted of them both. Charactermodifies our life more than we think, and it is to a certain extenttrue that every man is the architect of his own fortune. No doubt itseems as if our lot were assigned to us almost entirely from without,and imparted to us in something of the same way in which a melodyoutside us reaches the ear. But on looking back over our past, we seeat once that our life consists of mere variations on one and the sametheme, namely, our character, and that the same fundamental basssounds through it all. This is an experience which a man can and mustmake in and by himself.Not only a man's life, but his intellect too, may be possessed of aclear and definite character, so far as his intellect is applied tomatters of theory. It is not every man, however, who has an intellectof this kind; for any such definite individuality as I mean isgenius--an original view of the world, which presupposes an absolutelyexceptional individuality, which is the essence of genius. A man'sintellectual character is the theme on which all his works arevariations. In an essay which I wrote in Weimar I called it the knackby which every genius produces his works, however various. Thisintellectual character determines the physiognomy of men ofgenius--what I might call _the theoretical physiognomy_--and gives itthat distinguished expression which is chiefly seen in the eyes andthe forehead. In the case of ordinary men the physiognomy presents nomore than a weak analogy with the physiognomy of genius. On the otherhand, all men possess _the practical physiognomy_, the stamp of will,of practical character, of moral disposition; and it shows itselfchiefly in the mouth.Since character, so far as we understand its nature, is above andbeyond time, it cannot undergo any change under the influence of life.But although it must necessarily remain the same always, it requirestime to unfold itself and show the very diverse aspects which it maypossess. For character consists of two factors: one, the will-to-liveitself, blind impulse, so-called impetuosity; the other, the restraintwhich the will acquires when it comes to understand the world; and theworld, again, is itself will. A man may begin by following the cravingof desire, until he comes to see how hollow and unreal a thing islife, how deceitful are its pleasures, what horrible aspects itpossesses; and this it is that makes people hermits, penitents,Magdalenes. Nevertheless it is to be observed that no such changefrom a life of great indulgence in pleasure to one of resignation ispossible, except to the man who of his own accord renounces pleasure.A really bad life cannot be changed into a virtuous one. The mostbeautiful soul, before it comes to know life from its horrible side,may eagerly drink the sweets of life and remain innocent. But itcannot commit a bad action; it cannot cause others suffering to doa pleasure to itself, for in that case it would see clearly whatit would be doing; and whatever be its youth and inexperience itperceives the sufferings of others as clearly as its own pleasures.That is why one bad action is a guarantee that numberless others willbe committed as soon as circumstances give occasion for them. Somebodyonce remarked to me, with entire justice, that every man had somethingvery good and humane in his disposition, and also something very badand malignant; and that according as he was moved one or the other ofthem made its appearance. The sight of others' suffering arouses, notonly in different men, but in one and the same man, at one moment aninexhaustible sympathy, at another a certain satisfaction; and thissatisfaction may increase until it becomes the cruellest delight inpain. I observe in myself that at one moment I regard all mankind withheartfelt pity, at another with the greatest indifference, on occasionwith hatred, nay, with a positive enjoyment of their pain.All this shows very clearly that we are possessed of two different,nay, absolutely contradictory, ways of regarding the world: oneaccording to the principle of individuation, which exhibits allcreatures as entire strangers to us, as definitely not ourselves. Wecan have no feelings for them but those of indifference, envy, hatred,and delight that they suffer. The other way of regarding the worldis in accordance with what I may call the_Tat-twam-asi_--_this-is-thyself_ principle. All creatures areexhibited as identical with ourselves; and so it is pity and lovewhich the sight of them arouses.The one method separates individuals by impassable barriers; the otherremoves the barrier and brings the individuals together. The one makesus feel, in regard to every man, _that is what I am_; the other,_that is not what I am_. But it is remarkable that while the sight ofanother's suffering makes us feel our identity with him, and arousesour pity, this is not so with the sight of another's happiness. Thenwe almost always feel some envy; and even though we may have no suchfeeling in certain cases,--as, for instance, when our friends arehappy,--yet the interest which we take in their happiness is of a weakdescription, and cannot compare with the sympathy which we feel withtheir suffering. Is this because we recognise all happiness to be adelusion, or an impediment to true welfare? No! I am inclined to thinkthat it is because the sight of the pleasure, or the possessions,which are denied to us, arouses envy; that is to say, the wish thatwe, and not the other, had that pleasure or those possessions.It is only the first way of looking at the world which is founded onany demonstrable reason. The other is, as it were, the gate out ofthis world; it has no attestation beyond itself, unless it be the veryabstract and difficult proof which my doctrine supplies. Why the firstway predominates in one man, and the second in another--though perhapsit does not exclusively predominate in any man; why the one or theother emerges according as the will is moved--these are deep problems.The paths of night and day are close together:  [Greek: Engus gar nuktos de kai aematos eisi keleuthoi.]It is a fact that there is a great and original difference betweenone empirical character and another; and it is a difference which,at bottom, rests upon the relation of the individual's will to hisintellectual faculty. This relation is finally determined by thedegree of will in his father and of intellect in his mother; and theunion of father and mother is for the most part an affair of chance.This would all mean a revolting injustice in the nature of theworld, if it were not that the difference between parents and son isphenomenal only and all chance is, at bottom, necessity.As regards the freedom of the will, if it were the case that the willmanifested itself in a single act alone, it would be a free act. Butthe will manifests itself in a course of life, that is to say, in aseries of acts. Every one of these acts, therefore, is determined asa part of a complete whole, and cannot happen otherwise than it doeshappen. On the other hand, the whole series is free; it is simply themanifestation of an individualised will.If a man feels inclined to commit a bad action and refrains, he iskept back either (1) by fear of punishment or vengeance; or (2) bysuperstition in other words, fear of punishment in a future life; or(3) by the feeling of sympathy, including general charity; or (4) bythe feeling of honour, in other words, the fear of shame; or (5) bythe feeling of justice, that is, an objective attachment to fidelityand good-faith, coupled with a resolve to hold them sacred, becausethey are the foundation of all free intercourse between man andman, and therefore often of advantage to himself as well. This lastthought, not indeed as a thought, but as a mere feeling, influencespeople very frequently. It is this that often compels a man of honour,when some great but unjust advantage is offered him, to reject it withcontempt and proudly exclaim: _I am an honourable man_! For otherwisehow should a poor man, confronted with the property which chance oreven some worse agency has bestowed on the rich, whose very existenceit is that makes him poor, feel so much sincere respect for thisproperty, that he refuses to touch it even in his need; and althoughhe has a prospect of escaping punishment, what other thought is itthat can be at the bottom of such a man's honesty? He is resolved notto separate himself from the great community of honourable peoplewho have the earth in possession, and whose laws are recognisedeverywhere. He knows that a single dishonest act will ostracise andproscribe him from that society for ever. No! a man will spend moneyon any soil that yields him good fruit, and he will make sacrificesfor it.With a good action,--that, every action in which a man's own advantageis ostensibly subordinated to another's,--the motive is either (1)self-interest, kept in the background; or (2) superstition, in otherwords, self-interest in the form of reward in another life; or (3)sympathy; or (4) the desire to lend a helping hand, in other words,attachment to the maxim that we should assist one another in need, andthe wish to maintain this maxim, in view of the presumption that someday we ourselves may find it serve our turn. For what Kant calls agood action done from motives of duty and for the sake of duty, thereis, as will be seen, no room at all. Kant himself declares it to bedoubtful whether an action was ever determined by pure motives of dutyalone. I affirm most certainly that no action was ever so done; it ismere babble; there is nothing in it that could really act as a motiveto any man. When he shelters himself behind verbiage of that sort, heis always actuated by one of the four motives which I have described.Among these it is obviously sympathy alone which is quite genuine andsincere._Good_ and _bad_ apply to character only _a potiori_; that is to say,we prefer the good to the bad; but, absolutely, there is no suchdistinction. The difference arises at the point which lies betweensubordinating one's own advantage to that of another, and notsubordinating it. If a man keeps to the exact middle, he is _just_.But most men go an inch in their regard for others' welfare to twentyyards in regard for their own.The source of _good_ and of _bad character_, so far as we have anyreal knowledge of it, lies in this, that with the bad character thethought of the external world, and especially of the living creaturesin it, is accompanied--all the more, the greater the resemblancebetween them and the individual self--by a constant feeling of _not I,not I, not I_.Contrarily, with the good character (both being assumed to exist ina high degree) the same thought has for its accompaniment, like afundamental bass, a constant feeling of _I, I, I_. From this springbenevolence and a disposition to help all men, and at the same time acheerful, confident and tranquil frame of mind, the opposite of thatwhich accompanies the bad character.The difference, however, is only phenomenal, although it is adifference which is radical. But now we come to _the hardest of allproblems_: How is it that, while the will, as the thing-in-itself, isidentical, and from a metaphysical point of view one and the samein all its manifestations, there is nevertheless such an enormousdifference between one character and another?--the malicious,diabolical wickedness of the one, and set off against it, the goodnessof the other, showing all the more conspicuously. How is it that weget a Tiberius, a Caligula, a Carcalla, a Domitian, a Nero; and on theother hand, the Antonines, Titus, Hadrian, Nerva? How is it that amongthe animals, nay, in a higher species, in individual animals, there isa like difference?--the malignity of the cat most strongly developedin the tiger; the spite of the monkey; on the other hand, goodness,fidelity and love in the dog and the elephant. It is obvious that theprinciple of wickedness in the brute is the same as in man.We may to some extent modify the difficulty of the problem byobserving that the whole difference is in the end only one of degree.In every living creature, the fundamental propensities and instinctsall exist, but they exist in very different degrees and proportions.This, however, is not enough to explain the facts.We must fall back upon the intellect and its relation to the will; itis the only explanation that remains. A man's intellect, however, byno means stands in any direct and obvious relation with the goodnessof his character. We may, it is true, discriminate between two kindsof intellect: between understanding, as the apprehension of relationin accordance with the Principle of Sufficient Reason, and cognition,a faculty akin to genius, which acts more directly, is independent ofthis law, and passes beyond the Principle of Individuation. The latteris the faculty which apprehends Ideas, and it is the faculty whichhas to do with morality. But even this explanation leaves much tobe desired. _Fine minds are seldom fine souls_ was the correctobservation of Jean Paul; although they are never the contrary. LordBacon, who, to be sure, was less a fine soul than a fine mind, was ascoundrel.I have declared space and time to be part of the Principle ofIndividuation, as it is only space and time that make the multiplicityof similar objects a possibility. But multiplicity itself also admitsof variety; multiplicity and diversity are not only quantitative, butalso qualitative. How is it that there is such a thing as qualitativediversity, especially in ethical matters? Or have I fallen into anerror the opposite of that in which Leibnitz fell with his _identitasindiscernibilium_?The chief cause of intellectual diversity is to be found in thebrain and nervous system. This is a fact which somewhat lessens theobscurity of the subject. With the brutes the intellect and the brainare strictly adapted to their aims and needs. With man alone thereis now and then, by way of exception, a superfluity, which, if it isabundant, may yield genius. But ethical diversity, it seems, proceedsimmediately from the will. Otherwise ethical character would not beabove and beyond time, as it is only in the individual that intellectand will are united. The will is above and beyond time, and eternal;and character is innate; that is to say, it is sprung from the sameeternity, and therefore it does not admit of any but a transcendentalexplanation.Perhaps some one will come after me who will throw light into thisdark abyss.MORAL INSTINCT.An act done by instinct differs from every other kind of act in thatan understanding of its object does not precede it but follows uponit. Instinct is therefore a rule of action given _a priori_. We may beunaware of the object to which it is directed, as no understanding ofit is necessary to its attainment. On the other hand, if an act isdone by an exercise of reason or intelligence, it proceeds accordingto a rule which the understanding has itself devised for the purposeof carrying out a preconceived aim. Hence it is that action accordingto rule may miss its aim, while instinct is infallible.On the _a priori_ character of instinct we may compare what Plato saysin the _Philebus_. With Plato instinct is a reminiscence of somethingwhich a man has never actually experienced in his lifetime; in thesame way as, in the _Phaedo_ and elsewhere, everything that a manlearns is regarded as a reminiscence. He has no other word to expressthe _a priori_ element in all experience.There are, then, three things that are _a priori_:(1) Theoretical Reason, in other words, the conditions which make allexperience possible.(2) Instinct, or the rule by which an object promoting the life of thesenses may, though unknown, be attained.(3) The Moral Law, or the rule by which an action takes place withoutany object.Accordingly rational or intelligent action proceeds by a rule laiddown in accordance with the object as it is understood. Instinctiveaction proceeds by a rule without an understanding of the object ofit. Moral action proceeds by a rule without any object at all._Theoretical Reason_ is the aggregate of rules in accordancewith which all my knowledge--that is to say, the whole world ofexperience--necessarily proceeds. In the same manner _Instinct_ is theaggregate of rules in accordance with which all my action necessarilyproceeds if it meets with no obstruction. Hence it seems to me thatInstinct may most appropriately be called _practical reason_, for liketheoretical reason it determines the _must_ of all experience.The so-called moral law, on the other hand, is only one aspect of _thebetter consciousness_, the aspect which it presents from the point ofview of instinct. This better consciousness is something lying beyondall experience, that is, beyond all reason, whether of the theoreticalor the practical kind, and has nothing to do with it; whilst it is invirtue of the mysterious union of it and reason in the same individualthat the better consciousness comes into conflict with reason, leavingthe individual to choose between the two.In any conflict between the better consciousness and reason, if theindividual decides for reason, should it be theoretical reason, hebecomes a narrow, pedantic philistine; should it be practical, arascal.If he decides for the better consciousness, we can make no furtherpositive affirmation about him, for if we were to do so, we shouldfind ourselves in the realm of reason; and as it is only what takesplace within this realm that we can speak of at all it follows that wecannot speak of the better consciousness except in negative terms.This shows us how it is that reason is hindered and obstructed;that _theoretical reason_ is suppressed in favour of _genius_, and_practical reason_ in favour of _virtue_. Now the better consciousnessis neither theoretical nor practical; for these are distinctions thatonly apply to reason. But if the individual is in the act of choosing,the better consciousness appears to him in the aspect which it assumesin vanquishing and overcoming the practical reason (or instinct, touse the common word). It appears to him as an imperative command, an_ought_. It so appears to him, I say; in other words, that is theshape which it takes for the theoretical reason which rendersall things into objects and ideas. But in so far as the betterconsciousness desires to vanquish and overcome the theoretical reason,it takes no shape at all; on the simple ground that, as it comesinto play, the theoretical reason is suppressed and becomes the mereservant of the better consciousness. That is why genius can never giveany account of its own works.In the morality of action, the legal principle that both sides are tobe heard must not be allowed to apply; in other words, the claims ofself and the senses must not be urged. Nay, on the contrary, as soonas the pure will has found expression, the case is closed; _necaudienda altera pars_.The lower animals are not endowed with moral freedom. Probably this isnot because they show no trace of the better consciousness which in usis manifested as morality, or nothing analogous to it; for, if thatwere so, the lower animals, which are in so many respects likeourselves in outward appearance that we regard man as a species ofanimal, would possess some _raison d'etre_ entirely different from ourown, and actually be, in their essential and inmost nature, somethingquite other than ourselves. This is a contention which is obviouslyrefuted by the thoroughly malignant and inherently vicious characterof certain animals, such as the crocodile, the hyaena, the scorpion,the snake, and the gentle, affectionate and contented character ofothers, such as the dog. Here, as in the case of men, the character,as it is manifested, must rest upon something that is above and beyondtime. For, as Jacob Boehme says,[1] _there is a power in every animalwhich is indestructible, and the spirit of the world draws it intoitself, against the final separation at the Last Judgment_. Thereforewe cannot call the lower animals free, and the reason why we cannotdo so is that they are wanting in a faculty which is profoundlysubordinate to the better consciousness in its highest phase, I meanreason. Reason is the faculty of supreme comprehension, the idea oftotality. How reason manifests itself in the theoretical sphere Kanthas shown, and it does the same in the practical: it makes us capableof observing and surveying the whole of our life, thought, and action,in continual connection, and therefore of acting according to generalmaxims, whether those maxims originate in the understanding asprudential rules, or in the better consciousness as moral laws.[Footnote 1: _Epistles_, 56.]If any desire or passion is aroused in us, we, and in the same way thelower animals, are for the moment filled with this desire; we are allanger, all lust, all fear; and in such moments neither the betterconsciousness can speak, nor the understanding consider theconsequences. But in our case reason allows us even at that momentto see our actions and our life as an unbroken chain,--a chainwhich connects our earlier resolutions, or, it may be, the futureconsequences of our action, with the moment of passion which now fillsour whole consciousness. It shows us the identity of our person, evenwhen that person is exposed to influences of the most varied kind, andthereby we are enabled to act according to maxims. The lower animalis wanting in this faculty; the passion which seizes it completelydominates it, and can be checked only by another passion--anger, forinstance, or lust, by fear; even though the vision that terrifies doesnot appeal to the senses, but is present in the animal only as a dimmemory and imagination. Men, therefore, may be called irrational, if,like the lower animals, they allow themselves to be determined by themoment.So far, however, is reason from being the source of morality that itis reason alone which makes us capable of being rascals, which thelower animals cannot be. It is reason which enables us to form an evilresolution and to keep it when the provocation to evil is removed; itenables us, for example, to nurse vengeance. Although at the momentthat we have an opportunity of fulfilling our resolution the betterconsciousness may manifest itself as love or charity, it is by forceof reason, in pursuance of some evil maxim, that we act against it.Thus Goethe says that a man may use his reason only for the purpose ofbeing more bestial than any beast:  _Er hat Vernunft, doch braucht er sie allein  Um theirischer als jedes Thier zu sein_.For not only do we, like the beasts, satisfy the desires of themoment, but we refine upon them and stimulate them in order to preparethe desire for the satisfaction.Whenever we think that we perceive a trace of reason in the loweranimals, it fills us with surprise. Now our surprise is not excited bythe good and affectionate disposition which some of them exhibit--werecognise that as something other than reason--but by some action inthem which seems to be determined not by the impression of the moment,but by a resolution previously made and kept. Elephants, for instance,are reported to have taken premeditated revenge for insults long afterthey were suffered; lions, to have requited benefits on an opportunitytardily offered. The truth of such stories has, however, no bearing atall on the question, What do we mean by reason? But they enable us todecide whether in the lower animals there is any trace of anythingthat we can call reason.Kant not only declares that all our moral sentiments originate inreason, but he lays down that reason, _in my sense of the word_, isa condition of moral action; as he holds that for an action to bevirtuous and meritorious it must be done in accordance with maxims,and not spring from a resolve taken under some momentary impression.But in both contentions he is wrong. If I resolve to take vengeance onsome one, and when an opportunity offers, the better consciousness inthe form of love and humanity speaks its word, and I am influenced byit rather than by my evil resolution, this is a virtuous act, for itis a manifestation of the better consciousness. It is possible toconceive of a very virtuous man in whom the better consciousness isso continuously active that it is never silent, and never allows hispassions to get a complete hold of him. By such consciousness he issubject to a direct control, instead of being guided indirectly,through the medium of reason, by means of maxims and moral principles.That is why a man may have weak reasoning powers and a weakunderstanding and yet have a high sense of morality and be eminentlygood; for the most important element in a man depends as little onintellectual as it does on physical strength. Jesus says, _Blessedare the poor in spirit_. And Jacob Boehme has the excellent and nobleobservation: _Whoso lies quietly in his own will, like a child in thewomb, and lets himself be led and guided by that inner principle fromwhich he is sprung, is the noblest and richest on earth_.[1][Footnote 1: _Epistles_, 37.]ETHICAL REFLECTIONS.The philosophers of the ancient world united in a single conceptiona great many things that had no connection with one another. Of thisevery dialogue of Plato's furnishes abundant examples. The greatestand worst confusion of this kind is that between ethics and politics.The State and the Kingdom of God, or the Moral Law, are so entirelydifferent in their character that the former is a parody of thelatter, a bitter mockery at the absence of it. Compared with the MoralLaw the State is a crutch instead of a limb, an automaton instead of aman.       *       *       *       *       *The _principle of honour_ stands in close connection with humanfreedom. It is, as it were, an abuse of that freedom. Instead ofusing his freedom to fulfil the moral law, a man employs his powerof voluntarily undergoing any feeling of pain, of overcoming anymomentary impression, in order that he may assert his self-will,whatever be the object to which he directs it. As he thereby showsthat, unlike the lower animals, he has thoughts which go beyond thewelfare of his body and whatever makes for that welfare, it has comeabout that the principle of honour is often confused with virtue. Theyare regarded as if they were twins. But wrongly; for although theprinciple of honour is something which distinguishes man from thelower animals, it is not, in itself, anything that raises him abovethem. Taken as an end and aim, it is as dark a delusion as any otheraim that springs from self. Used as a means, or casually, it may beproductive of good; but even that is good which is vain and frivolous.It is the misuse of freedom, the employment of it as a weapon forovercoming the world of feeling, that makes man so infinitely moreterrible than the lower animals; for they do only what momentaryinstinct bids them; while man acts by ideas, and his ideas may entailuniversal ruin before they are satisfied.There is another circumstance which helps to promote the notion thathonour and virtue are connected. A man who can do what he wants to doshows that he can also do it if what he wants to do is a virtuous act.But that those of our actions which we are ourselves obliged to regardwith contempt are also regarded with contempt by other people servesmore than anything that I have here mentioned to establish theconnection. Thus it often happens that a man who is not afraid of theone kind of contempt is unwilling to undergo the other. But when weare called upon to choose between our own approval and the world'scensure, as may occur in complicated and mistaken circumstances, whatbecomes of the principle of honour then?Two characteristic examples of the principle of honour are to be foundin Shakespeare's _Henry VI_., Part II., Act IV., Sc. 1. A pirate isanxious to murder his captive instead of accepting, like others, aransom for him; because in taking his captive he lost an eye, andhis own honour and that of his forefathers would in his opinion bestained, if he were to allow his revenge to be bought off as though hewere a mere trader. The prisoner, on the other hand, who is the Dukeof Suffolk, prefers to have his head grace a pole than to uncover itto such a low fellow as a pirate, by approaching him to ask for mercy.Just as civic honour--in other words, the opinion that we deserve tobe trusted--is the palladium of those whose endeavour it is to maketheir way in the world on the path of honourable business, so knightlyhonour--in other words, the opinion that we are men to be feared--isthe palladium of those who aim at going through life on the pathof violence; and so it was that knightly honour arose among therobber-knights and other knights of the Middle Ages.       *       *       *       *       *A theoretical philosopher is one who can supply in the shape of ideasfor the reason, a copy of the presentations of experience; just aswhat the painter sees he can reproduce on canvas; the sculptor, inmarble; the poet, in pictures for the imagination, though they arepictures which he supplies only in sowing the ideas from which theysprang.A so-called practical philosopher, on the other hand, is one who,contrarily, deduces his action from ideas. The theoretical philosophertransforms life into ideas. The practical philosopher transforms ideasinto life; he acts, therefore, in a thoroughly reasonable manner; heis consistent, regular, deliberate; he is never hasty or passionate;he never allows himself to be influenced by the impression of themoment.And indeed, when we find ourselves among those full presentations ofexperience, or real objects, to which the body belongs--since the bodyis only an objectified will, the shape which the will assumes in thematerial world--it is difficult to let our bodies be guided, not bythose presentations, but by a mere image of them, by cold, colourlessideas, which are related to experience as the shadow of Orcus to life;and yet this is the only way in which we can avoid doing things ofwhich we may have to repent.The theoretical philosopher enriches the domain of reason by adding toit; the practical philosopher draws upon it, and makes it serve him.       *       *       *       *       *According to Kant the truth of experience is only a hypotheticaltruth. If the suppositions which underlie all the intimations ofexperience--subject, object, time, space and causality--were removed,none of those intimations would contain a word of truth. In otherwords, experience is only a phenomenon; it is not knowledge of thething-in-itself.If we find something in our own conduct at which we are secretlypleased, although we cannot reconcile it with experience, seeing thatif we were to follow the guidance of experience we should have todo precisely the opposite, we must not allow this to put us out;otherwise we should be ascribing an authority to experience whichit does not deserve, for all that it teaches rests upon a meresupposition. This is the general tendency of the Kantian Ethics.       *       *       *       *       *Innocence is in its very nature stupid. It is stupid because the aimof life (I use the expression only figuratively, and I could justas well speak of the essence of life, or of the world) is to gain aknowledge of our own bad will, so that our will may become an objectfor us, and that we may undergo an inward conversion. Our body isitself our will objectified; it is one of the first and foremost ofobjects, and the deeds that we accomplish for the sake of the bodyshow us the evil inherent in our will. In the state of innocence,where there is no evil because there is no experience, man is, asit were, only an apparatus for living, and the object for which theapparatus exists is not yet disclosed. An empty form of life likethis, a stage untenanted, is in itself, like the so-called real world,null and void; and as it can attain a meaning only by action, byerror, by knowledge, by the convulsions of the will, it wears acharacter of insipid stupidity. A golden age of innocence, a fools'paradise, is a notion that is stupid and unmeaning, and for thatvery reason in no way worthy of any respect. The first criminal andmurderer, Cain, who acquired a knowledge of guilt, and throughguilt acquired a knowledge of virtue by repentance, and so came tounderstand the meaning of life, is a tragical figure more significant,and almost more respectable, than all the innocent fools in the worldput together.       *       *       *       *       *If I had to write about _modesty_ I should say: I know the esteemedpublic for which I have the honour to write far too well to dare togive utterance to my opinion about this virtue. Personally I am quitecontent to be modest and to apply myself to this virtue withthe utmost possible circumspection. But one thing I shall neveradmit--that I have ever required modesty of any man, and any statementto that effect I repel as a slander.The paltry character of most men compels the few who have any meritor genius to behave as though they did not know their own value, andconsequently did not know other people's want of value; for it isonly on this condition that the mob acquiesces in tolerating merit. Avirtue has been made out of this necessity, and it is called modesty.It is a piece of hypocrisy, to be excused only because other peopleare so paltry that they must be treated with indulgence.       *       *       *       *       *Human misery may affect us in two ways, and we may be in one of twoopposite moods in regard to it.In one of them, this misery is immediately present to us. We feel itin our own person, in our own will which, imbued with violent desires,is everywhere broken, and this is the process which constitutessuffering. The result is that the will increases in violence, asis shown in all cases of passion and emotion; and this increasingviolence comes to a stop only when the will turns and gives way tocomplete resignation, in other words, is redeemed. The man who isentirely dominated by this mood will regard any prosperity which hemay see in others with envy, and any suffering with no sympathy.In the opposite mood human misery is present to us only as a factof knowledge, that is to say, indirectly. We are mainly engaged inlooking at the sufferings of others, and our attention is withdrawnfrom our own. It is in their person that we become aware of humanmisery; we are filled with sympathy; and the result of this mood isgeneral benevolence, philanthropy. All envy vanishes, and insteadof feeling it, we are rejoiced when we see one of our tormentedfellow-creatures experience any pleasure or relief.After the same fashion we may be in one of two opposite moods inregard to human baseness and depravity. In the one we perceive thisbaseness indirectly, in others. Out of this mood arise indignation,hatred, and contempt of mankind. In the other we perceive it directly,in ourselves. Out of it there arises humiliation, nay, contrition.In order to judge the moral value of a man, it is very important toobserve which of these four moods predominate in him. They go inpairs, one out of each division. In very excellent characters thesecond mood of each division will predominate.       *       *       *       *       *The categorical imperative, or absolute command, is a contradiction.Every command is conditional. What is unconditional and necessary is a_must_, such as is presented by the laws of nature.It is quite true that the moral law is entirely conditional. Thereis a world and a view of life in which it has neither validity norsignificance. That world is, properly speaking, the real world inwhich, as individuals, we live; for every regard paid to morality is adenial of that world and of our individual life in it. It is a viewof the world, however, which does not go beyond the principle ofsufficient reason; and the opposite view proceeds by the intuition ofIdeas.       *       *       *       *       *If a man is under the influence of two opposite but very strongmotives, A and B, and I am greatly concerned that he should choose A,but still more that he should never be untrue to his choice, and bychanging his mind betray me, or the like, it will not do for me to sayanything that might hinder the motive B from having its full effectupon him, and only emphasise A; for then I should never be able toreckon on his decision. What I have to do is, rather, to put bothmotives before him at the same time, in as vivid and clear a way aspossible, so that they may work upon him with their whole force. Thechoice that he then makes is the decision of his inmost nature, andstands firm to all eternity. In saying _I will do this_, he has said_I must do this_. I have got at his will, and I can rely upon itsworking as steadily as one of the forces of nature. It is as certainas fire kindles and water wets that he will act according to themotive which has proved to be stronger for him. Insight and knowledgemay be attained and lost again; they may be changed, or improved, ordestroyed; but will cannot be changed. That is why _I apprehend, Iperceive, I see_, is subject to alteration and uncertainty; _I will_,pronounced on a right apprehension of motive, is as firm as natureitself. The difficulty, however, lies in getting at a rightapprehension. A man's apprehension of motive may change, or becorrected or perverted; and on the other hand, his circumstances mayundergo an alteration.       *       *       *       *       *A man should exercise an almost boundless toleration and placability,because if he is capricious enough to refuse to forgive a singleindividual for the meanness or evil that lies at his door, it is doingthe rest of the world a quite unmerited honour.But at the same time the man who is every one's friend is no one'sfriend. It is quite obvious what sort of friendship it is which wehold out to the human race, and to which it is open to almost everyman to return, no matter what he may have done.       *       *       *       *       *With the ancients _friendship_ was one of the chief elements inmorality. But friendship is only limitation and partiality; it isthe restriction to one individual of what is the due of all mankind,namely, the recognition that a man's own nature and that of mankindare identical. At most it is a compromise between this recognition andselfishness.       *       *       *       *       *A lie always has its origin in the desire to extend the dominion ofone's own will over other individuals, and to deny their will in orderthe better to affirm one's own. Consequently a lie is in its verynature the product of injustice, malevolence and villainy. That is whytruth, sincerity, candour and rectitude are at once recognised andvalued as praiseworthy and noble qualities; because we presume thatthe man who exhibits them entertains no sentiments of injustice ormalice, and therefore stands in no need of concealing such sentiments.He who is open cherishes nothing that is bad.       *       *       *       *       *There is a certain kind of courage which springs from the same sourceas good-nature. What I mean is that the good-natured man is almost asclearly conscious that he exists in other individuals as in himself. Ihave often shown how this feeling gives rise to good-nature. Italso gives rise to courage, for the simple reason that the man whopossesses this feeling cares less for his own individual existence,as he lives almost as much in the general existence of all creatures.Accordingly he is little concerned for his own life and itsbelongings. This is by no means the sole source of courage for it isa phenomenon due to various causes. But it is the noblest kind ofcourage, as is shown by the fact that in its origin it is associatedwith great gentleness and patience. Men of this kind are usuallyirresistible to women.       *       *       *       *       *All general rules and precepts fail, because they proceed from thefalse assumption that men are constituted wholly, or almost wholly,alike; an assumption which the philosophy of Helvetius expresslymakes. Whereas the truth is that the original difference betweenindividuals in intellect and morality is immeasurable.       *       *       *       *       *The question as to whether morality is something real is the questionwhether a well-grounded counter-principle to egoism actually exists.As egoism restricts concern for welfare to a single individual,_viz_., the man's own self, the counter-principle would have to extendit to all other individuals.       *       *       *       *       *It is only because the will is above and beyond time that the stingsof conscience are ineradicable, and do not, like other pains,gradually wear away. No! an evil deed weighs on the conscience yearsafterwards as heavily as if it had been freshly committed.       *       *       *       *       *Character is innate, and conduct is merely its manifestation; theoccasion for great misdeeds comes seldom; strong counter-motives keepus back; our disposition is revealed to ourselves by our desires,thoughts, emotions, when it remains unknown to others. Reflecting onall this, we might suppose it possible for a man to possess, in somesort, an innate evil conscience, without ever having done anythingvery bad.       *       *       *       *       *_Don't do to others what you wouldn't like done to yourself_. This is,perhaps, one of those arguments that prove, or rather ask, too much.For a prisoner might address it to a judge.       *       *       *       *       *Stupid people are generally malicious, for the very same reason as theugly and the deformed.Similarly, genius and sanctity are akin. However simple-minded a saintmay be, he will nevertheless have a dash of genius in him; and howevermany errors of temperament, or of actual character, a genius maypossess, he will still exhibit a certain nobility of disposition bywhich he shows his kinship with the saint.       *       *       *       *       *The great difference between Law without and Law within, betweenthe State and the Kingdom of God, is very clear. It is the State'sbusiness to see that _every one should have justice done to him_;it regards men as passive beings, and therefore takes no account ofanything but their actions. The Moral Law, on the other hand, isconcerned that _every one should do justice_; it regards men asactive, and looks to the will rather than the deed. To prove that thisis the true distinction let the reader consider what would happen ifhe were to say, conversely, that it is the State's business that everyone should do justice, and the business of the Moral Law that everyone should have justice done to him. The absurdity is obvious.As an example of the distinction, let me take the case of a debtor anda creditor disputing about a debt which the former denies. A lawyerand a moralist are present, and show a lively interest in the matter.Both desire that the dispute should end in the same way, although whatthey want is by no means the same. The lawyer says, _I want this manto get back what belongs to him_; and the moralist, _I want that manto do his duty_.It is with the will alone that morality is concerned. Whether externalforce hinders or fails to hinder the will from working does not in theleast matter. For morality the external world is real only in so faras it is able or unable to lead and influence the will. As soon asthe will is determined, that is, as soon as a resolve is taken, theexternal world and its events are of no further moment andpractical do not exist. For if the events of the world had anysuch reality--that is to say, if they possessed a significance inthemselves, or any other than that derived from the will which isaffected by them--what a grievance it would be that all these eventslie in the realm of chance and error! It is, however, just this whichproves that the important thing is not what happens, but what iswilled. Accordingly, let the incidents of life be left to the play ofchance and error, to demonstrate to man that he is as chaff before thewind.The State concerns itself only with the incidents--with what happens;nothing else has any reality for it. I may dwell upon thoughts ofmurder and poison as much as I please: the State does not forbid me,so long as the axe and rope control my will, and prevent it frombecoming action.Ethics asks: What are the duties towards others which justice imposesupon us? in other words, What must I render? The Law of Nature asks:What need I not submit to from others? that is, What must I suffer?The question is put, not that I may do no injustice, but that Imay not do more than every man must do if he is to safeguard hisexistence, and than every man will approve being done, in order thathe may be treated in the same way himself; and, further, that I maynot do more than society will permit me to do. The same answer willserve for both questions, just as the same straight line can be drawnfrom either of two opposite directions, namely, by opposing forces;or, again, as the angle can give the sine, or the sine the angle.It has been said that the historian is an inverted prophet. In thesame way it may be said that a teacher of law is an inverted moralist(_viz_., a teacher of the duties of justice), or that politics areinverted ethics, if we exclude the thought that ethics also teachesthe duty of benevolence, magnanimity, love, and so on. The State isthe Gordian knot that is cut instead of being untied; it is Columbus'egg which is made to stand by being broken instead of balanced, asthough the business in question were to make it stand rather than tobalance it. In this respect the State is like the man who thinks thathe can produce fine weather by making the barometer go up.       *       *       *       *       *The pseudo-philosophers of our age tell us that it is the object ofthe State to promote the moral aims of mankind. This is not true;it is rather the contrary which is true. The aim for which mankindexists--the expression is parabolic--is not that a man should act insuch and such a manner; for all _opera operata_, things that haveactually been done, are in themselves matters of indifference. No! theaim is that the Will, of which every man is a complete specimen--nay,is the very Will itself--should turn whither it needs to turn; thatthe man himself (the union of Thought and Will) should perceive whatthis will is, and what horrors it contains; that he should show thereflection of himself in his own deeds, in the abomination of them.The State, which is wholly concerned with the general welfare, checksthe manifestation of the bad will, but in no wise checks the willitself; the attempt would be impossible. It is because the Statechecks the manifestation of his will that a man very seldom sees thewhole abomination of his nature in the mirror of his deeds. Or doesthe reader actually suppose there are no people in the world as bad asRobespierre, Napoleon, or other murderers? Does he fail to see thatthere are many who would act like them if only they could?Many a criminal dies more quietly on the scaffold than many anon-criminal in the arms of his family. The one has perceived what hiswill is and has discarded it. The other has not been able to discardit, because he has never been able to perceive what it is. The aimof the State is to produce a fool's paradise, and this is in directconflict with the true aim of life, namely, to attain a knowledge ofwhat the will, in its horrible nature, really is.       *       *       *       *       *Napoleon was not really worse than many, not to say most, men. He waspossessed of the very ordinary egoism that seeks its welfare at theexpense of others. What distinguished him was merely the greater powerhe had of satisfying his will, and greater intelligence, reason andcourage; added to which, chance gave him a favourable scope for hisoperations. By means of all this he did for his egoism what a thousandother men would like to do for theirs, but cannot. Every feeble ladwho by little acts of villainy gains a small advantage for himself byputting others to some disadvantage, although it may be equally small,is just as bad as Napoleon.Those who fancy that retribution comes after death would demand thatNapoleon should by unutterable torments pay the penalty for all thenumberless calamities that he caused. But he is no more culpable thanall those who possess the same will, unaccompanied by the same power.The circumstance that in his case this extraordinary power was addedallowed him to reveal the whole wickedness of the human will; and thesufferings of his age, as the necessary obverse of the medal, revealthe misery which is inextricably bound up with this bad will. It isthe general manipulation of this will that constitutes the world. Butit is precisely that it should be understood how inextricably the willto live is bound up with, and is really one and the same as, thisunspeakable misery, that is the world's aim and purpose; and it is anaim and purpose which the appearance of Napoleon did much to assist.Not to be an unmeaning fools' paradise but a tragedy, in which thewill to live understands itself and yields--that is the object forwhich the world exists. Napoleon is only an enormous mirror of thewill to live.The difference between the man who causes suffering and the man whosuffers it, is only phenomenal. It is all a will to live, identicalwith great suffering; and it is only by understanding this that thewill can mend and end.       *       *       *       *       *What chiefly distinguishes ancient from modern times is that inancient times, to use Napoleon's expression, it was affairs thatreigned: _les paroles aux choses_. In modern times this is not so.What I mean is that in ancient times the character of public life,of the State, and of Religion, as well as of private life, was astrenuous affirmation of the will to live. In modern times it is adenial of this will, for such is the character of Christianity. Butnow while on the one hand that denial has suffered some abatement evenin public opinion, because it is too repugnant to human character, onthe other what is publicly denied is secretly affirmed. Hence it isthat we see half measures and falsehood everywhere; and that is whymodern times look so small beside antiquity.       *       *       *       *       *The structure of human society is like a pendulum swinging between twoimpulses, two evils in polar opposition, _despotism_ and _anarchy_.The further it gets from the one, the nearer it approaches the other.From this the reader might hit on the thought that if it were exactlymidway between the two, it would be right. Far from it. For thesetwo evils are by no means equally bad and dangerous. The former isincomparably less to be feared; its ills exist in the main only aspossibilities, and if they come at all it is only one among millionsthat they touch. But, with anarchy, possibility and actuality areinseparable; its blows fall on every man every day. Therefore everyconstitution should be a nearer approach to a despotism than toanarchy; nay, it must contain a small possibility of despotism.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Essays Of Arthur Schopenhauerby Arthur Schopenhauer*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ESSAYS OF ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER ******** This file should be named 10739.txt or 10739.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/7/3/10739/Produced by Juliet Sutherland, Josephine Paolucci and the OnlineDistributed Proofreading Team.Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.
