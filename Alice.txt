rtOf love and sorrow in the larger lifeAs sister, helper,--nay, perhaps as wife;--For such vague instincts, after all, are human,And Elfinhart herself was but a woman.And yet, for all this new desire, I doubtIf Elfinhart would e'er have spoken out,And told the fairies of her wish to leave them,(A wish her conscious heart well knew would grieve them),If in the ripening of her silent thoughtA still voice had not whispered that she oughtTo leave that world of love and mirth and beauty,To share man's burden in this world of duty.(There's anticlimax for you! Most provoking,Just when you thought that I was only joking,Or idly fingering the poet's laurel,To find my story threatens to be moral!But as for morals, though in verse we scout them,In life we somehow can't get on without them;So if I don't insert a moral distichOnce in a while, I can't be realistic;--And in this tale, I solemnly aver,My one wish is to tell things as they were!But not _all_ things; time flies, and art is long,And I must hurry onward with my song.)How Elfinhart at last told what she wanted,And what the fairies said, please take for granted.She prayed, they yielded; Elfinhart full lothTo leave, as they to let her go, but bothAgreeing that this bitter thing must be;For they were fairies, and a mortal she.But ere they yielded, they made impositionOf what then seemed to her a light condition.'Twas done in kindness, be it understood,With fairy foresight for the maiden's good.The elf-queen spoke for all: "Dear Elfinhart,We bind you to one promise ere we part.We fear naught from men's malice; hate and wrathAnd every evil thing will shun your path,And sunshine will go with you when you move;The only danger that we dread is love.If in the after days, when suitors woo you,Your heart makes choice of one, as dearest to you,Before you put your hand in his and ownThe sacred trust reserved for him alone,Let us make trial of him, and approveHis virtue, and his manhood, and his love.Send him to us; and if he bears the test,And if we find him worthy to be blestWith love like yours, be sure we will befriend him;And may a life-long happiness attend him!But if he prove a traitor, or faint-hearted,Or if his love and he are lightly parted,In the deep willow-woods he shall remain,And never look upon your face again!"The maiden, fancy-free, was well content,And with light laughter gave her full consent;For when maids think of love (as maidens do)It seems a far-off thing; and well she knewHer lover, if she loved, would be both brave and true!Not long thereafter came an errant bandRiding along the edge of Fairyland,--Stout men-at-arms, without reproach or spot,And in the lead the bold Sir Launcelot.He, riding on ahead, silent, alone,Was stopped by a beseeching ancient croneWho hobbled to his side, as if in pain,And clutched with palsied fingers at his rein.And there behind her, from the leafage green,The sweetest eyes his eyes had ever seenWere gazing at him with wide wonderment,Nor bold nor fearful; innocence unshentShone from their blue depths, and old dreams awokeIn Launcelot's breast, while thus the beldame spoke:"A boon, a boon, Sir Launcelot of the Lake!I Pray you of your courtesy to takeThis damsel to the King. Her enemiesHave spoiled her of her birthright, and she fleesAn innocent outcast from her wasted lands,To lay her life and fortune in his hands."She spoke, and vanished in the woodland shade.Then Launcelot, leaning over helped the maidTo mount behind and at an easy trotThey and the troop rode on to Camelot.He asked no questions for some fairy spellMade light his heart, and told him all was well;And as these two rode through the land together,By dappled greenwood shade and sunlit heather,Her soft voice in his ears, the innocent charmOf her light, steady touch upon his arm,Wrought magic in his soul. That day, I ween,Sir Launcelot well-nigh forgot his queen.And Elfinhart (you knew those eyes were hers!)Laughed with the silvery jingle of his spurs,And from her heart the new world's rapture droveAll thought of Fairyland--excepting love.And so to high-towered Camelot they came,The golden city,--now a shadowy name;For over heath-clad hills the wild-winds blowWhere Arthur's halls, a thousand years agoBright with all far-fetched gems of curious art,Shone brighter with the eyes of Elfinhart.She came to Camelot; the king receives her;And there for five glad years my story leaves her.Five glad years, and this "episode" is done,And we are back again at Canto I.I write of merry jest and greenwood shade,But tales of chivalry are not my trade;So if you wish to read that five years' storyOf lady-love, romance, and martial glory,--The mighty feats of arms that Gawayne did,--The ever ripening love that Gawayne hidFive long years in his breast, biding his time,--Go seek it in some abler poet's rime.My tale begins with the young knight's brave soulAll Elfinhart's. She thinks herself heart-whole.But at that Christmas feast, in Arthur's hall,With night's soft mantle folded over all,The magic influence of the evening tideStole on their two hearts beating side by side.And Gawayne talked of troubles long ago,When each man's neighbor was his dearest foe,And of the trials he himself had passed,And the high purpose that from first to lastHad been his stay and spur, he scarce knew how,Since on Excalibur he took the vow.He told of his own hopes for future days,And how he wrought and fought not for men's praise,(Though like all good men Gawayne held that dear),Yet trusting, when men laid him on his bier,They might remember, as they gathered round it,"He left this good world better than he found it."He talked as true men seldom talk, unlessSwayed utterly by some pure passion's stress,And ever gently, though with heart on fire,Still hovered nearer to his soul's desire.And Elfinhart in gravest silence listened,But her sweet heart beat high, her blue eyes glistened;For as he bared his soul to her she dreamedA day-dream strange and new, wherein it seemedThat in that soul's clear depth she saw her own,And his most secret thought (till then unknown)Seemed hers eternally. He spoke of death,And then her heart shrank, and she drew deep breath.Suddenly, ere she understood at allWhat new life dawned before her, came the callOf fairy horns; and so the Green Knight burstUpon the scene, as told in Canto First.One jarring note, the tuneful chords among,May make mad discord of the sweetest song.E'en so with dissonant clamor through the breastOf Gawayne rang the Green Knight's merry jest;But what wild meaning must it not impartTo the vague fears of gentle Elfinhart?For she had heard in the first trumpet-blastA signal to her from the far-gone past;And now, of all the strange things that had been,Her half forgotten compact with the queenFlushed through her memory, and a swift thought cameLike sudden fear, a thought without a name,An unvoiced question and a blind alarm;And in sheer helplessness she reached an armToward Gawayne scarcely knowing what she would;Her eyes beheld him, and she understood.And is it Gawayne? He? Yes, Elfinhart,The hour has come, and you must play your part.       *       *       *       *       *So now it's all explained; and I intendTo go straight onward to the story's end.Sir Gawayne had cut off the Green Knight's head,And Arthur and his court had gone to bed;In the great hall the dying embers shoneWith a faint ghostly gleam, and there, alone,While all the rest of Camelot was sleeping,In the dark alcove Elfinhart lay weeping.But as she lay there, all about her headThere fell a checkered beam of moonlight, shedThrough the barred casement; and she faintly stirred,For in her troubled soul it seemed she heardVague music from some region far away!She raised her head and, turning where she lay,Saw in the silver moonlight the sereneAnd tranquil beauty of the fairy queen!"We sent before you called us, Elfinhart,For love lent keener magic to our art,And warned us of the thoughts that in your breastAwoke new rapture, trembling unconfessed."And Elfinhart moved closer to her kneesAnd hid her face in the white draperiesThat veiled the fairy form, till, nestling there,Her heart recovered from that blank despair,And whispered her that whatsoe'er befellLove ruled the world, and all would yet be well.And the good fairy stroked the maiden's headAnd kissed her tear-starred eyes, and smiling said:"Fie on you women's hearts! ConsistencyHides her shamed head where mortal women be!True love breeds faith and trust, it makes hearts strong;The heart's anointed king can do no wrong!And yet you weep as if you feared to prove him;--Upon my word, I don't believe you love him!"And Elfinhart replied: "Laugh if you will,My queen, but let me be a woman still.You fairies love where love is wise and just;We mortal women love because we must:And if I feared to prove him, I confessI fear I still must love him none the less."She paused, for once again her eyes grew dim:"Think you I love his virtues? I love him!But yet you judged me wrongly, for believe me,(And then laugh once again, and so forgive me),If at the first I feared what you might do,My doubts were not of Gawayne, but of you!"And so both laughed, and for a little spaceFolded each other in a glad embrace;(For fairies, bathed the whole year round in bliss,May yet be gladdened by a fair maid's kiss);And Elfinhart spoke on: "Do what you will,I trust you with my all, and fear no ill.But oh, my friend, to wait the long, long year,--To keep my heart in silence, not to hearThe words my whole soul hungers for, nor sayOne syllable to brighten his dark day!Must it be so, my queen? And how shall ISchool eyes and lips to act this year-long lie?From the dear teacher-guardian of my youthThe only ways I learned were ways of truth!I tried my skill this night, and learned to knowThat there are deeps below the deeps of woe;Hearts may be bruised and broken, yet still live;--The wounds that kill us are the wounds we give!"And so these two talked on, until the nightBegan to shiver with the gray dawn's light,And in the deep-dyed casement they might seeNew life flush through old dreams of chivalry.And then they parted. What the queen had saidI know not, but the lady, comforted,Bade farewell with calm voice and tranquil eyes,And saw with new-born strength the new sun rise.Perhaps in Fairyland there chanced to beFor them that grieve some sovereign alchemyTo turn the worst to best, and the good queenApplied this soothing balm. Such things have been;But yet I doubt if any fairy artWas needed in the case of Elfinhart;The medicine that charmed away her doleNature had planted in her own sweet soul.Of all sure things, this thing I'm surest of,--That the best cure for love's own ills is love.CANTO IIIGAWAYNECANTO IIIGAWAYNEO Muse!--But no: heaven knows I need a muse;But which of all the nine, pray, should I choose?Thalia, Clio, and Melpomene,I love them all, but none, alas, loves me;For if you want a muse to take your partYou must be solely hers with all your heart;And I have mingled since my earliest youthMy smiles and tears, my fictions and my truth;Nay, in this very tale, scarce yet half done,I've courted all the nine, and so won none!Not for me, therefore, the Parnassian lyre,Or winged war-horse shod with heavenly fire;Harsh numbers flow from throats whose thirst has beenA whole life long unslaked of Hippocrene;But I will e'en go on as best I canAnd let the story end as it began,--A plain, straightforward man's unvarnished word,Part sad, part sweet,--and part of it absurd.A year passed by, as years are wont to do,Winter and spring, summer and autumn too,Till mid-December's flaw-blown flakes of snowWarned Gawayne that the time was come to goTo the Green Chapel by the Murmuring Mere,And take again the blow he gave last year.In the great court his charger stamped the ground,While knights and weeping ladies thronged aroundTo arm him (as the custom was of yore)And bid him sad farewell for evermore.One face alone in all that bustling throngOur hero's eyes sought eagerly, and longSought vainly; for the lady Elfinhart,Debating with herself, stood yet apart;But as Sir Gawayne gathered up his reinsAnd bade the draw-bridge warden loose the chains,Suddenly Elfinhart stood by his side,Her fair face flushed with love, and joy, and pride.She plucked a sprig of holly from her gownAnd looked up, questioning; and he leaned down,And so she placed it in his helm. No wordMight Gawayne's lips then utter, but he heardThe voice that was his music, and could feelThe touch of gentle fingers through the steel."Wear this, Sir Gawayne, for a loyal friendWhose hopes and prayers go with you to the end."And, staying not for answer, she withdrew,And in the throng was lost to Gawayne's view.He roused himself, and waving high his hand,Struck spur, and so rode off toward Fairyland.Long time he traveled by an unknown way,Unhoused at night, companionless by day.The cold sleet stung him through his shirt of mail,But, underneath, his stout heart would not fail,But beat full measure through the fiercest storm,And kept his head clear and his brave soul warm.No need to tell the perils that he passed;He conquered all, and came unscathed at lastTo where a high-embattled castle stoodDeep in the heart of a dense willow-wood.And Gawayne called aloud, and to the gateA smiling porter came, who opened straight,And bade him enter in and take his rest;And Gawayne entered, and the people pressedAbout him with fair speeches; and he laidHis armor off, and gave it them, and prayedThat they would take his message to their lord,--prayer for friendly shelter, bed and board.He told them whence he was, his birth and name;And the bold baron of the castle came,A mighty man, huge-limbed, with flashing eyes,And welcomed him with old-time courtesies;For manners, in those days, were held of worth,And gentle breeding went with gentle birth.He heartily was glad his guest had come,And made Sir Gawayne feel himself at home;And as they walked in, side by side, each knewThe other for an honest man and true.That night our hero and the baron ateA sumptuous dinner in the hall of state,And all the household, ranged along the board,Made good cheer with Sir Gawayne and their lord,And passed the brimming bowl right merrilyWith friendly banter and quick repartee.And Gawayne asked if they had chanced to hearOf a Green Chapel by a Murmuring Mere,And straightway all grew grave. Within his breastSir Gawayne felt a tremor of unrest,But told his story with a gay outside,And asked for some good man to be his guideTo find his foe. "I promise him," said he,"No golden guerdon;--his reward shall beThe consciousness that unto him 't was givenTo show a parting soul the way to heaven!"Up jumped his host. "My friend, I like your attitude,And know no surer way to win heaven's gratitudeThan sending thither just such men as you;I'll be your guide. But since you are not dueAt the Green Chapel till three nights from now,And since the way is short, I'll tell you howThe interim may be disposed of best:--In short, let me propose a merry jest!"At this Sir Gawayne gave a sudden start,For some old memory seemed to clutch his heart,And in the baron's eyes he seemed to seeA twinkling gleam of green benignityNot wholly strange; but like a flash 't was gone.Gawayne sank back, and his good host went on:"Two days you sojourn here, and while I takeMy daily hunting in the wood, you makeMy house and castle yours; and then, each night,We'll meet together here at candle-light,And all my winnings in the wood, and allThat comes to you at home, whate'er befall,We'll give each other in exchange; in fine,My fortune shall be yours, and yours be mine."To Gawayne this seemed generous indeed.And with most cordial laughter he agreed.They clasped hands o'er the bargain with good zest,And then all said good-night, and went to rest.Next morning Gawayne was awakened earlyFrom a deep slumber by the hurly-burlyOf footman, horseman, seneschal, and groom,Bustling beneath the windows of his room.He rose and looked out, just in time to seeThe baron and a goodly companyOf huntsmen, armed with cross-bow, axe, and spear,Ride through the castle gate and disappear.And then, while Gawayne dressed, there came a knockUpon his chamber door. He threw the lock,And a boy page brought robes of ermine furAnd Tarsic silk,--black, white, and lavender,--For his array, and with them a kind message,Which the good knight received with no ill presage:"Will brave Sir Gawayne spare an idle hourFor quiet converse in my lady's bower?"The boy led on, and Gawayne followed himThrough crooked corridors and archways dim,Along low galleries echoing from afar,And down a winding stair; then "Here we are!"The page cried cheerily, and paused beforeThe massive carvings of an antique door.This he swung open; and the knight passed throughInto a garden, fresh with summer dew!A lady's bower in Fairyland! What penCould make that strange enchantment live again?Not he who drew Acrasia's Bower of BlissAnd Phaedria's happy isle could picture this.That sweet-souled Puritan discerned too wellThe serpent's coil behind the witch's spell;And he who saw--when the dark veil was torn--The rose of Paradise without the thorn,(Sublimest prophet, whose immortal verseLent mightier thunders to the primal curse),Even he too sternly, in the soul's defense,Repressed the still importunate cries of sense.Bid me not, therefore, task my feebler penWith dreams beyond the limits of their ken;The phantom conjurings of the magic hourThat Gawayne passed in that enchanted bowerMust be from mortal eyes forever hid.But yet some part of what he felt and didThese lines must needs disclose. As he stood there,Breathing soft odors from the mellow air,All hopes, all aims of noble knighthood seemedLike the dim yesterdays of one who dreamed,In starless caves of memory sunken deep,And, like lost music, folded in strange sleep."How long, O mortal man, wilt thou give heedTo the world's phantom voices? The hours speed,And fame and fortune yield to moth and rust,And good and evil crumble into dust.Even now the sands are running in the glass;Set not your heart upon vain things that pass;Ambitions, honors, toils, are but the snareWhere lurks for aye the blind old world's despair.Nay, quiet the bootless striving in your breastAnd let your tired heart here at last find rest.In vain have joy, love, beauty, struck deep rootIn your heart's heart, unless you pluck the fruit;Then put away the cheating soul's pretense,Heap high the press, fill full the cup of sense;Shatter the idols of blind yesterday,And let love, joy, and beauty reign alway!"Such thoughts as these, confused and unexpressed,Flooded the silence in Sir Gawayne's breast.Meanwhile a brasier filled the scented airWith wreaths of magic mist, and he was wareThat the mist drew together like a shroud;And then the veil was rent, and in the cloudStood one who seemed, in features, form, and dress,The perfect image of all loveliness.The wonders of that vision none could tellSave one whose heart had felt the mystic spell.Once and once only, in the golden daysWhen youth made melody for love's sweet lays,In two dark eyes (yet oh, how bright, how bright!)I saw the wakening rapture of love's light,And, in the hush of that still dawning, heardFrom two sweet trembling lips love's whispered word.The twilight deepens when the sun has set;In memory golden glories linger yet;But these avail not. Though my soul lay bare,With all those memories sanctuaried there,That spell was human. But the unseen powerThat wove the witchery of this fairy bower,In Gawayne's heart such subtle magic wroughtThat past and future were well-nigh forgot,And all that earth holds else, or heaven above,Seemed naught worth keeping, save this dream of love.And now, as the strange cloud of incense broke,The vision, if it were a vision, spoke,--If it were speech that filled the quivering airWith low harmonious music. Let none dareIn the rude jargons of this world to fashionThat sweet, wild anthem of unearthly passion.Could I from the broad-billowing ocean borrowOf Tristan's love and of Isolde's sorrow,The flood of those world-darkening surges, wroughtWith thoughts that lie beyond the reach of thought,Might bring me succor where weak words must fail.But Gawayne saw and heard, and passion-paleShrank back, and made a darkness of his face;(As though the unplumbed deeps of starless spaceCould quench those lustrous eyes, or close his earsTo the eternal music of love's spheres!)But the voice changed, and Gawayne, listening there,Heard now a heart's low cry of wild despair.He turned again, and lo! the vision kneltAnd drew a jeweled poniard from her belt,To arm herself against her own dear life;But as she bared her white breast to the knifeHe started quickly forward, and he graspedThe hand that held the hilt; and then she claspedHer soft arms round his neck, and as their lipsMet in the shadowing fold of love's eclipse,All earth, all heaven, all knightly hopes of grace,Died in the darkness of one blind embrace.Died? Nay; for Gawayne, ere the moment passed,Broke from the arms that strove to bind him fast,And turned away once more; and, as he pressedA trembling hand against his throbbing breast,His aimless fingers touched a treasured partOf the green holly-branch of Elfinhart,Laid in his breast when he put off his arms.What perils now are left in fairy charms?For poets fable when they call love blind;Love's habitation is the purer mind,Whence with his keen eyes he may penetrateAll mists and fogs that baser spells create.Love? What is love? Not the wild feverish thrill,When heart to heart the thronging pulses fill,And lips that close in parching kisses findNo speech but those;--the best remains behind.The tranquil spirit--the divine assuranceThat this life's seemings have a high endurance--Thoughts that allay this restless striving, calmThe passionate heart, and fill old wounds with balm;--These are the choirs invisible that moveIn white processionals up the aisles of love.Such love was Gawayne's,--love that sanctifiesThe heart's most secret altar; and his eyesWere opened, and his pulses beat once moreTheir old true rhythm. And so the strife was o'er,And all the perilous wiles of magic artWere foiled by Gawayne--and by Elfinhart.But time flies, and 't were tedious to delayMy song for all the trials of that day.Light summer breezes, skurrying o'er the deep,Ripple and foam and flash,--then sink to sleep;But underneath, serene and changing never,The mighty heart of ocean beats forever,And his deep streams renew from pole to poleThe living world's indomitable soul.Enough, then, of the spells that vexed the brainOf Gawayne; love and knighthood made allvain.And in the afternoon, when Gawayne learnedThat his good host, the baron, had returned,He met him in the hall at candle-light,According to his promise of last night.And then the baron motioned to a page,And straightway six tall men, of lusty ageAnd mighty sinews, entered the great door,Bearing the carcass of a huge wild boar,In all its uncouth ugliness complete,And dropped it quivering at our hero's feet."What do you say to that, Sir Gawayne?" criedThe baron, swelling with true sportsman's pride"But come: your promise, now, of yester-eve;'T is blesseder to give than to receive!Though I'll be sworn you'll find it hard to payFull value for the winnings of this day.""Not so," said Gawayne; "you will rest my debtor;Your gift is good, but mine will be far better."And then he strode with solemn steps alongThe echoing hall, and through the listening throng,And with the words, "My noble lord, take this!"He gave the baron a resounding kiss.The baron jumped up in ecstatic glee."Now by my great-great-grandsire's beard," quoth he,"Better than all dead boars in ChristendomIs one sweet loving kiss!--Whence did it come?""Nay, there," Sir Gawayne said, "you step beyondThe terms we stipulated in our bond.Take you my kiss in peace, as I your boar;Be glad; give thanks;--and seek to know no more."Loud laughter made the baron's eyes grow brightAnd glitter with green sparkles of delight;And then he chuckled: "Sir, I'm proud of you;I drink your best of health; _I think you'll do!_"And now the board was laid and dressed, and allSat down to dinner at the baron's call;And Gawayne looked along the room askance,Seeking the lady; and he caught one glanceOf laughing eyes--then looked away in haste,But turned again, and wondered why his tasteHad erred so strangely, for the lady seemedNot fairer now than others. Had he dreamed?He rubbed his eyes and pondered,--though in soothWithout one glimmering presage of the truth,--Till all passed lightly from his puzzled mind,Leaving contentment and good cheer behind.So all the company feasted well, and spedThe flying hours, till it was time for bed.One whole day longer must our hero restWithin doors, to fulfill the merry jest.So when, next morning, Gawayne once more heardThe hunt's-up in the court, he never stirred,But let the merry horsemen ride awayWhile he slept soundly well into the day.Later he rose, and strolled from room to room,Through vaulted twilights of ancestral gloom,Until, descending a long stair, he foundThe dim-lit castle crypt, deep under ground,Where sculptured effigies forever keptTheir long last marble silence as they slept,And iron sentinels, on bended knees,Held eyeless vigil in old panoplies.Sir Gawayne, wandering on in aimless mood,Pondered the tomb-stone legends, quaint and rude,Wherein the pensive dreamer might divineA tragic history in every line;For so does fate, with bitterest irony,Epitomize fame's immortality,Perpetuating for all after daysMute lamentations and unnoted praise.And Gawayne, reading here and there the storyOf fame obscure and unremembered glory,Found on a tablet these words: "Where he lies,The gray wave breaks and the wild sea-mew flies:If any be that loved him, seek not here,But in the lone hills by the Murmuring Mere."A nameless cenotaph!--perhaps of oneLike Gawayne's self deluded and undoneBy the green stranger; and the legend broughtA tide of passion flooding Gawayne's thought;A flood-tide, not of fear,--for Gawayne's breastShrank never at the perilous behestOf noble knighthood,--but the love of life,Compassion, and soul-sickness of the strife."If any be that loved him!" Oh, to dieFar from green-swarded Camelot, and lieAmong these bleak and barren hills alone,His end unwept for and his grave unknown,--Never again to see the glad sunriseThat brightened all his world in those dear eyes!Half suffocating in the charneled airOf that low vault, he staggered up the stair,Out of the dim-lit halls of silent deathInto the living light, and drew quick breathWhere, through a casement-arch of ivied stone,Bright from the clear blue sky the warm sun shone.The whole of life's glad rapture thrilled his heart;Till a quick step behind him made him start,And there, deep-veiled, in muffling cloak and hood,Once more the lady of the castle stood.Low-voiced she spoke, as if with studied careWeighing the syllables of her parting prayer."Sir Gawayne--nay, I pray you, turn not yet,But hear me;--though my heart may not forgetThat once, for one sweet moment, you were kind,I come not to recall that to your mind;--Between us two be love's words aye unspoken!Yet ere you go, I pray you, leave some tokenThat in the long, long years may comfort meFor the dear face I nevermore shall see.""Nay, lady," said the knight, "I have no giftsTo give you. Errant knighthood ever driftsFrom shore to shore, by wandering breezes blown,With naught save its good name to call its own.In friendship, then, I pray you keep for meMy name untarnished in your memory.""Ah, sir," she said, "my memory bears that nameBurnt in with characters of living flame.But though you give me naught, I pray you takeThis girdle from me;--wear it for my sake;Nay, but refuse me not; you little knowIts magic power. I had it long agoFrom Fairyland; and its encircling charmKeeps scathless him who wears it from all harm;No evil thing can touch him. Gird it on,If but to ease my heart when you are gone."She held a plain green girdle in her hand,In outward seeming just a narrow bandOf silk, with silver clasps; but in those daysThe strangest things were wrought in simplest ways,As Gawayne knew full well; and he could seeThat all the lady said was verity.He took the girdle, held it, fingered it,Then clasped it round his waist to try the fit,Irresolutely dallying with temptation,Till conscience grew too weak for inclination;For at the last he threw one wandering glanceOut at the casement, and the merry danceOf sparkling sunbeams on the fields of snowWrought havoc in his wavering heart; and so,Repeating to himself one word: "Life, life!"He took the token from the baron's wife.That evening, when the baron and our knightMet to exchange their gifts at candle-light,The baron, looking graver than before,Said: "Sir, my luck has left me; not a boarDid we get wind of, all this blessed day.I come with empty hands, only to prayYour pardon. What good fortune do _you_ bring?"And Gawayne answered firmly: "Not a thing!"CANTO IVCONCLUSIONCANTO IVCONCLUSIONBy noon the next day, Gawayne and his hostRode side by side along the perilous coastOf the gray Mere, from whose unquiet sleepReverberating murmurs of the deepStartled the still December's listening air.The baron, shuddering, pointed seaward. "There,"He said, "year in, year out, these voices hauntThat fearful water; heaven knows what they want!Men tell me--and I have no doubt it's true--They are knights-errant whom the Green Knight slew!Woe unto him, the over-bold, who daresAdventure near that uncouth monster's snares!"Quoth Gawayne: "How have _you_ escaped the net?"The baron answered: "I? We never met!When I'm about, he seems to shun the place,And where he is, I never show my face;But if we did meet, 't would be safe to sayNot more than one of us would get away!"And then the baron told tales by the scoreAbout the Green Knight's quenchless thirst for gore,And kept repeating that no magic charmWas proof against the prowess of his arm;At his first blow each vain defense must fall,For he was arch-magician over all.And as from tale to tale the baron ran,Sir Gawayne, had he been another man,Would certainly have felt his heart's blood curdle,Despite his secret wearing of the girdle;But when the baron finally suggestedAbandoning the venture, and protestedThat the whole monstrous business was absurd,Sir Gawayne simply said: "I gave my word."And when the baron saw he would not bend,He seemed to lose all patience. "Well, my friend,I'll go no further with you. On your headShall be your own mad blood when you are dead.Yonder your two roads fork; pause there, I pray,And ponder well before you choose your way.One takes the hills, one winds along the wave;To Camelot this,--the other to your grave!Choose the high road, Sir Gawayne; shun the danger!Say you were misdirected by a stranger;--I swear by all that's sacred, I'll not tellOne syllable to a soul:--and so farewell!"He galloped off without another word,And vanished where the road turned. Gawayne heard,Long after he had disappeared, the soundOf iron hoof-beats on the frozen ground,Till all died into silence, save those drearAnd hollow voices from the Murmuring Mere.But Gawayne chose the lower road, and passedAlong the desolate shore. The die was cast.The western skies, as the red sun sank low,Cast purple shades across the drifted snow,And Gawayne knew that the dread hour was comeFor the fulfillment of his martyrdom.And now, from just beyond a jutting hill,Came hideous sounds, as of a giant millThat hisses, roars, and sputters, clicks and clacks;--It was the Green Knight sharpening his axe!And Gawayne, coming past the corner, found him,With ghastly mouldering skulls and bones strewn round him,In joyous fury urging the keen steelAgainst the surface of his grinding wheel.The place was a wild hollow, circled roundWith barren hills, and on the bottom groundStood the Green Chapel, moss-grown, solitary;--In sooth, it seemed the devil's mortuary!The Green Knight's back was turned, and he stirred notTill Gawayne hailed him sharply; then he shotOne glance--as when, o'erhead, a living wireStartles the night with flashes of green fire;--Then hurried forward, bland as bland could be,And greeted Gawayne with green courtesy."Dear sir, I ask a thousand pardons; prayForgive me. You are punctual to the day;That's good! Of course I knew you would not fail.How do you do? You look a trifle pale;I trust, with all my heart, you are not ill?Just the cold air? It does blow rather chill!What can I do to cheer you? Let me see;--Suppose I brew a cup of hot green tea?You'ld rather not? You're pressed for time? Of course,I understand; then just get off your horse,And I'll do all I can to expediteOur little business for you. There, that's right;And now your helmet? Thanks; and if you pleasePerhaps you'll kindly kneel down on your knees,As I did when I came to Camelot; So!Are you all ready? Will you bide the blow?"And Gawayne said "I will," in such soft notesAs happy bridegrooms utter, when their throatsAre paralyzed with blest anticipation;--(What Gawayne looked for was decapitation!)And then the Green Knight swung his axe in airWith a loud whirr; and Gawayne, kneeling there,Shrank back an inch; and the green giant stayedHis threatening hand, and with a cold sneer said:"You shrink, sir, from the axe; I can't hit trueUnless you hold still, as I did for you.""Your pardon," Gawayne said, with bated breath;"This time I swear to hold as still as death."He did so, and the Green Knight swung againHis axe, and whirled it round his head, and then,Pausing a second time, said: "Very good!You're holding quite still now; I knew you would!"Gawayne, in anger, said: "Jest, if you like,After the blow; tarry no longer; strike!"So once again the ponderous axe was raised;But this time down it came, and lightly grazedSir Gawayne's neck. He felt the hot blood flow,And saw red drops that sank deep in the snow,And then he jumped up, faced his foe, and cried:"Enough: you owed me one blow, though I died;But be you man or beast or devil abhorred,I yield no further; with my mortal swordI do defy you; and if mortal manMay hope against" ...                   But the Green Knight beganA low melodious laugh, like running brooksWhose pebbly babble fills the shadowy nooksOf green-aisled woodlands, when the winds are still."My friend, we bear each other no ill will.When first I swung my axe, you showed some fear;I owed you that much for your blow last year.The second time I swung,--yet spared your life,--That paid you for the kiss you gave my wife!""Your wife!" "My wife, Sir Gawayne; 't was my word;And when I swung my weapon for the thirdAnd last time, then I made the red blood spirtFor that green girdle underneath your shirt!You played me false, my friend!"                                   And Gawayne kneltOnce more, and casting off the magic belt,In bitter broken words confessed his shame,And begged the Green Knight to avenge the nameOf injured knighthood, and with one last blowTo end his guilty life. "Nay, nay, not so,"The other softly said. "Be of good cheer;Your fault was small, for all men hold life dear.We tempted you, my friend, with all our might,And proved you in good sooth a noble knight;A veritable Joseph, sir, you are!"Quoth Gawayne drily, "Thanks, Lord Potiphar!But may I ask you why you played this part?"The other said: "Ask Lady Elfinhart!"He smiled, and from his smile a genial glowOf green mid-summer seemed to overflow,Filling with verdure all that barren place.The warm red blood rushed to Sir Gawayne's face;He caught his breath, and in his eager eyesThere shone a sudden flash of dark surmise,And then he stood a long while pondering;But in his breast his heart began to singThe old, old music whose still echoes rollForever voiceless through the listening soul.He said farewell to his good fairy friendAs in a dream, where real and unreal blendIn phantom unison, and with the lightOf love to lead him home, rode through the night,Beside the tranquil murmurs of the Mere,And through the silence of the passing year;And earth and sea and starlit sky took partIn the still exaltation of his heart,While all but love and wonder was forgot,Until he came to high-towered Camelot.To Camelot he came, and there he foundThe good King Arthur and his Table RoundAwaiting his return in anxious doubt;But ere he passed the gates a mighty shoutRose from the watchmen on the outward wallAnd bore the tidings to the inmost hall.From every window flaunting flags were flung;From the high battlements brass trumpets sung;And great bells, chiming in the topmost tower,Pealed salutation to the joyous hour,As Gawayne, riding through the cullis-port,Faced the glad throng that filled the palace court.And with this tribute paid to knightly gloryIt seems most fitting to conclude my story.Entreat me not, dear reader, to impartFurther of Gawayne, or of Elfinhart.Let your own fancy round the story outWhatever way you please; I cannot doubtThe sequel; but when I, in silent thought,Had brought Sir Gawayne back to her, and soughtWith hand profane to lift the veil, behindWhose secret shelter their two hearts enshrinedThe mutual covenant of love's mystery,That pure fane would not desecrated be.But this alone I know: the power that woveThrough human lives the warp and woof of loveWrought not in darkness, nor with hand unsure;--His fabric must forevermore endure.And hence I doubt not that these two were blestAs none may be, save they who have confessedAllegiance to that mighty spirit's law,And trod his holy ground with reverent awe.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Gawayne And The Green Knightby Charlton Miner Lewis*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GAWAYNE AND THE GREEN KNIGHT ******** This file should be named 14410.txt or 14410.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/4/4/1/14410/Produced by Ted Garvin, Melissa Er-Raqabi and the PG OnlineDistributed Proofreading TeamUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Under the name of _The Reign of Greed_ it is for thefirst time translated into English. Written some four or five yearsafter _Noli Me Tangere_, the book represents Rizal's more maturejudgment on political and social conditions in the islands, and inits graver and less hopeful tone reflects the disappointments anddiscouragements which he had encountered in his efforts to lead theway to reform. Rizal's dedication to the first edition is of specialinterest, as the writing of it was one of the grounds of accusationagainst him when he was condemned to death in 1896. It reads:    "To the memory of the priests, Don Mariano Gomez (85 years    old), Don Jose Burgos (30 years old), and Don Jacinto Zamora    (35 years old). Executed in Bagumbayan Field on the 28th of    February, 1872.    "The Church, by refusing to degrade you, has placed in doubt    the crime that has been imputed to you; the Government, by    surrounding your trials with mystery and shadows, causes the    belief that there was some error, committed in fatal moments;    and all the Philippines, by worshiping your memory and calling    you martyrs, in no sense recognizes your culpability. In so    far, therefore, as your complicity in the Cavite mutiny is not    clearly proved, as you may or may not have been patriots, and    as you may or may not have cherished sentiments for justice    and for liberty, I have the right to dedicate my work to    you as victims of the evil which I undertake to combat. And    while we await expectantly upon Spain some day to restore    your good name and cease to be answerable for your death,    let these pages serve as a tardy wreath of dried leaves over    your unknown tombs, and let it be understood that every one    who without clear proofs attacks your memory stains his hands    in your blood!        J. Rizal."A brief recapitulation of the story in _Noli Me Tangere_ (The SocialCancer) is essential to an understanding of such plot as there isin the present work, which the author called a "continuation" of thefirst story.Juan Crisostomo Ibarra is a young Filipino, who, after studyingfor seven years in Europe, returns to his native land to find thathis father, a wealthy landowner, has died in prison as the resultof a quarrel with the parish curate, a Franciscan friar named PadreDamaso. Ibarra is engaged to a beautiful and accomplished girl, MariaClara, the supposed daughter and only child of the rich Don Santiagode los Santos, commonly known as "Capitan Tiago," a typical Filipinocacique, the predominant character fostered by the friar regime.Ibarra resolves to forego all quarrels and to work for the bettermentof his people. To show his good intentions, he seeks to establish,at his own expense, a public school in his native town. He meets withostensible support from all, especially Padre Damaso's successor,a young and gloomy Franciscan named Padre Salvi, for whom Maria Claraconfesses to an instinctive dread.At the laying of the corner-stone for the new schoolhouse asuspicious accident, apparently aimed at Ibarra's life, occurs, butthe festivities proceed until the dinner, where Ibarra is grossly andwantonly insulted over the memory of his father by Fray Damaso. Theyoung man loses control of himself and is about to kill the friar,who is saved by the intervention of Maria Clara.Ibarra is excommunicated, and Capitan Tiago, through his fear of thefriars, is forced to break the engagement and agree to the marriage ofMaria Clara with a young and inoffensive Spaniard provided by PadreDamaso. Obedient to her reputed father's command and influencedby her mysterious dread of Padre Salvi, Maria Clara consents tothis arrangement, but becomes seriously ill, only to be saved bymedicines sent secretly by Ibarra and clandestinely administered bya girl friend.Ibarra succeeds in having the excommunication removed, but before hecan explain matters an uprising against the Civil Guard is secretlybrought about through agents of Padre Salvi, and the leadership isascribed to Ibarra to ruin him. He is warned by a mysterious friend,an outlaw called Elias, whose life he had accidentally saved; butdesiring first to see Maria Clara, he refuses to make his escape,and when the outbreak occurs he is arrested as the instigator of itand thrown into prison in Manila.On the evening when Capitan Tiago gives a ball in his Manila house tocelebrate his supposed daughter's engagement, Ibarra makes his escapefrom prison and succeeds in seeing Maria Clara alone. He begins toreproach her because it is a letter written to her before he went toEurope which forms the basis of the charge against him, but she clearsherself of treachery to him. The letter had been secured from her byfalse representations and in exchange for two others written by hermother just before her birth, which prove that Padre Damaso is herreal father. These letters had been accidentally discovered in theconvento by Padre Salvi, who made use of them to intimidate the girland get possession of Ibarra's letter, from which he forged othersto incriminate the young man. She tells him that she will marry theyoung Spaniard, sacrificing herself thus to save her mother's nameand Capitan Tiago's honor and to prevent a public scandal, but thatshe will always remain true to him.Ibarra's escape had been effected by Elias, who conveys him in abanka up the Pasig to the Lake, where they are so closely beset bythe Civil Guard that Elias leaps into the water and draws the pursuersaway from the boat, in which Ibarra lies concealed.On Christmas Eve, at the tomb of the Ibarras in a gloomy wood,Elias appears, wounded and dying, to find there a boy named Basiliobeside the corpse of his mother, a poor woman who had been drivento insanity by her husband's neglect and abuses on the part of theCivil Guard, her younger son having disappeared some time before inthe convento, where he was a sacristan. Basilio, who is ignorant ofElias's identity, helps him to build a funeral pyre, on which hiscorpse and the madwoman's are to be burned.Upon learning of the reported death of Ibarra in the chase on the Lake,Maria Clara becomes disconsolate and begs her supposed godfather,Fray Damaso, to put her in a nunnery. Unconscious of her knowledge oftheir true relationship, the friar breaks down and confesses that allthe trouble he has stirred up with the Ibarras has been to prevent herfrom marrying a native, which would condemn her and her children tothe oppressed and enslaved class. He finally yields to her entreatiesand she enters the nunnery of St. Clara, to which Padre Salvi is soonassigned in a ministerial capacity.        O masters, lords, and rulers in all lands,        Is this the handiwork you give to God,        This monstrous thing distorted and soul-quenched?        How will you ever straighten up this shape-;        Touch it again with immortality;        Give back the upward looking and the light;        Rebuild in it the music and the dream;        Make right the immemorial infamies,        Perfidious wrongs, immedicable woes?        O masters, lords, and rulers in all lands,        How will the future reckon with this man?        How answer his brute question in that hour        When whirlwinds of rebellion shake the world?        How will it be with kingdoms and with kings--        With those who shaped him to the thing he is--        When this dumb terror shall reply to God,        After the silence of the centuries?Edwin MarkhamCONTENTS    I.

ConclusionCHAPTER ION THE UPPER DECK    Sic itur ad astra.One morning in December the steamer _Tabo_ was laboriously ascendingthe tortuous course of the Pasig, carrying a large crowd of passengerstoward the province of La Laguna. She was a heavily built steamer,almost round, like the _tabu_ from which she derived her name,quite dirty in spite of her pretensions to whiteness, majestic andgrave from her leisurely motion. Altogether, she was held in greataffection in that region, perhaps from her Tagalog name, or from thefact that she bore the characteristic impress of things in the country,representing something like a triumph over progress, a steamer that wasnot a steamer at all, an organism, stolid, imperfect yet unimpeachable,which, when it wished to pose as being rankly progressive, proudlycontented itself with putting on a fresh coat of paint. Indeed, thehappy steamer was genuinely Filipino! If a person were only reasonablyconsiderate, she might even have been taken for the Ship of State,constructed, as she had been, under the inspection of _Reverendos_and _Ilustrisimos_....Bathed in the sunlight of a morning that made the waters of the riversparkle and the breezes rustle in the bending bamboo on its banks,there she goes with her white silhouette throwing out great cloudsof smoke--the Ship of State, so the joke runs, also has the vice ofsmoking! The whistle shrieks at every moment, hoarse and commandinglike a tyrant who would rule by shouting, so that no one on boardcan hear his own thoughts. She menaces everything she meets: now shelooks as though she would grind to bits the _salambaw_, insecurefishing apparatus which in their movements resemble skeletons ofgiants saluting an antediluvian tortoise; now she speeds straighttoward the clumps of bamboo or against the amphibian structures,_karihan_, or wayside lunch-stands, which, amid _gumamelas_ and otherflowers, look like indecisive bathers who with their feet already inthe water cannot bring themselves to make the final plunge; at times,following a sort of channel marked out in the river by tree-trunks,she moves along with a satisfied air, except when a sudden shockdisturbs the passengers and throws them off their balance, all theresult of a collision with a sand-bar which no one dreamed was there.Moreover, if the comparison with the Ship of State is not yet complete,note the arrangement of the passengers. On the lower deck appear brownfaces and black heads, types of Indians, [1] Chinese, and mestizos,wedged in between bales of merchandise and boxes, while there on theupper deck, beneath an awning that protects them from the sun, areseated in comfortable chairs a few passengers dressed in the fashion ofEuropeans, friars, and government clerks, each with his _puro_ cigar,and gazing at the landscape apparently without heeding the effortsof the captain and the sailors to overcome the obstacles in the river.The captain was a man of kindly aspect, well along in years, an oldsailor who in his youth had plunged into far vaster seas, but who nowin his age had to exercise much greater attention, care, and vigilanceto avoid dangers of a trivial character. And they were the same foreach day: the same sand-bars, the same hulk of unwieldy steamer wedgedinto the same curves, like a corpulent dame in a jammed throng. So,at each moment, the good man had to stop, to back up, to go forward athalf speed, sending--now to port, now to starboard--the five sailorsequipped with long bamboo poles to give force to the turn the rudderhad suggested. He was like a veteran who, after leading men throughhazardous campaigns, had in his age become the tutor of a capricious,disobedient, and lazy boy.Dona Victorina, the only lady seated in the European group, could saywhether the _Tabo_ was not lazy, disobedient, and capricious--DonaVictorina, who, nervous as ever, was hurling invectives against thecascos, bankas, rafts of coconuts, the Indians paddling about, andeven the washerwomen and bathers, who fretted her with their mirth andchatter. Yes, the _Tabo_ would move along very well if there were noIndians in the river, no Indians in the country, yes, if there werenot a single Indian in the world--regardless of the fact that thehelmsmen were Indians, the sailors Indians, Indians the engineers,Indians ninety-nine per cent, of the passengers, and she herself alsoan Indian if the rouge were scratched off and her pretentious gownremoved. That morning Dona Victorina was more irritated than usualbecause the members of the group took very little notice of her,reason for which was not lacking; for just consider--there could befound three friars, convinced that the world would move backwards thevery day they should take a single step to the right; an indefatigableDon Custodio who was sleeping peacefully, satisfied with his projects;a prolific writer like Ben-Zayb (anagram of Ibanez), who believed thatthe people of Manila thought because he, Ben-Zayb, was a thinker;a canon like Padre Irene, who added luster to the clergy with hisrubicund face, carefully shaven, from which towered a beautiful Jewishnose, and his silken cassock of neat cut and small buttons; and awealthy jeweler like Simoun, who was reputed to be the adviser andinspirer of all the acts of his Excellency, the Captain-General--justconsider the presence there of these pillars _sine quibus non_ of thecountry, seated there in agreeable discourse, showing little sympathyfor a renegade Filipina who dyed her hair red! Now wasn't this enoughto exhaust the patience of a female Job--a sobriquet Dona Victorinaalways applied to herself when put out with any one!The ill-humor of the senora increased every time the captain shouted"Port," "Starboard" to the sailors, who then hastily seized theirpoles and thrust them against the banks, thus with the strength oftheir legs and shoulders preventing the steamer from shoving its hullashore at that particular point. Seen under these circumstances theShip of State might be said to have been converted from a tortoiseinto a crab every time any danger threatened."But, captain, why don't your stupid steersmen go in thatdirection?" asked the lady with great indignation."Because it's very shallow in the other, senora," answered the captain,deliberately, slowly winking one eye, a little habit which he hadcultivated as if to say to his words on their way out, "Slowly,slowly!""Half speed! Botheration, half speed!" protested Dona Victorinadisdainfully. "Why not full?""Because we should then be traveling over those ricefields, senora,"replied the imperturbable captain, pursing his lips to indicate thecultivated fields and indulging in two circumspect winks.This Dona Victorina was well known in the country for her caprices andextravagances. She was often seen in society, where she was toleratedwhenever she appeared in the company of her niece, Paulita Gomez,a very beautiful and wealthy orphan, to whom she was a kind ofguardian. At a rather advanced age she had married a poor wretchnamed Don Tiburcio de Espadana, and at the time we now see her,carried upon herself fifteen years of wedded life, false frizzes, and ahalf-European costume--for her whole ambition had been to Europeanizeherself, with the result that from the ill-omened day of her weddingshe had gradually, thanks to her criminal attempts, succeeded inso transforming herself that at the present time Quatrefages andVirchow together could not have told where to classify her among theknown races.Her husband, who had borne all her impositions with the resignation ofa fakir through so many years of married life, at last on one lucklessday had had his bad half-hour and administered to her a superb whackwith his crutch. The surprise of Madam Job at such an inconsistencyof character made her insensible to the immediate effects, and onlyafter she had recovered from her astonishment and her husband hadfled did she take notice of the pain, then remaining in bed forseveral days, to the great delight of Paulita, who was very fondof joking and laughing at her aunt. As for her husband, horrifiedat the impiety of what appeared to him to be a terrific parricide,he took to flight, pursued by the matrimonial furies (two curs and aparrot), with all the speed his lameness permitted, climbed into thefirst carriage he encountered, jumped into the first banka he saw onthe river, and, a Philippine Ulysses, began to wander from town totown, from province to province, from island to island, pursued andpersecuted by his bespectacled Calypso, who bored every one that hadthe misfortune to travel in her company. She had received a report ofhis being in the province of La Laguna, concealed in one of the towns,so thither she was bound to seduce him back with her dyed frizzes.Her fellow travelers had taken measures of defense by keeping upamong themselves a lively conversation on any topic whatsoever. Atthat moment the windings and turnings of the river led them to talkabout straightening the channel and, as a matter of course, about theport works. Ben-Zayb, the journalist with the countenance of a friar,was disputing with a young friar who in turn had the countenance of anartilleryman. Both were shouting, gesticulating, waving their arms,spreading out their hands, stamping their feet, talking of levels,fish-corrals, the San Mateo River, [2] of cascos, of Indians, and soon, to the great satisfaction of their listeners and the undisguiseddisgust of an elderly Franciscan, remarkably thin and withered,and a handsome Dominican about whose lips flitted constantly ascornful smile.The thin Franciscan, understanding the Dominican's smile, decidedto intervene and stop the argument. He was undoubtedly respected,for with a wave of his hand he cut short the speech of both at themoment when the friar-artilleryman was talking about experience andthe journalist-friar about scientists."Scientists, Ben-Zayb--do you know what they are?" asked the Franciscanin a hollow voice, scarcely stirring in his seat and making only afaint gesture with his skinny hand. "Here you have in the provincea bridge, constructed by a brother of ours, which was not completedbecause the scientists, relying on their theories, condemned it asweak and scarcely safe--yet look, it is the bridge that has withstoodall the floods and earthquakes!" [3]"That's it, _punales,_ that very thing, that was exactly what I wasgoing to say!" exclaimed the friar-artilleryman, thumping his fistsdown on the arms of his bamboo chair. "That's it, that bridge andthe scientists! That was just what I was going to mention, PadreSalvi--_punales!_"Ben-Zayb remained silent, half smiling, either out of respect orbecause he really did not know what to reply, and yet his was the onlythinking head in the Philippines! Padre Irene nodded his approval ashe rubbed his long nose.Padre Salvi, the thin and withered cleric, appeared to be satisfiedwith such submissiveness and went on in the midst of the silence:"But this does not mean that you may not be as near right as PadreCamorra" (the friar-artilleryman). "The trouble is in the lake--""The fact is there isn't a single decent lake in this country,"interrupted Dona Victorina, highly indignant, and getting ready fora return to the assault upon the citadel.The besieged gazed at one another in terror, but with the promptitudeof a general, the jeweler Simoun rushed in to the rescue. "The remedyis very simple," he said in a strange accent, a mixture of Englishand South American. "And I really don't understand why it hasn'toccurred to somebody."All turned to give him careful attention, even the Dominican. Thejeweler was a tall, meager, nervous man, very dark, dressed in theEnglish fashion and wearing a pith helmet. Remarkable about him washis long white hair contrasted with a sparse black beard, indicating amestizo origin. To avoid the glare of the sun he wore constantly a pairof enormous blue goggles, which completely hid his eyes and a portionof his cheeks, thus giving him the aspect of a blind or weak-sightedperson. He was standing with his legs apart as if to maintain hisbalance, with his hands thrust into the pockets of his coat."The remedy is very simple," he repeated, "and wouldn't cost a cuarto."The attention now redoubled, for it was whispered in Manila that thisman controlled the Captain-General, and all saw the remedy in processof execution. Even Don Custodio himself turned to listen."Dig a canal straight from the source to the mouth of the river,passing through Manila; that is, make a new river-channel and fillup the old Pasig. That would save land, shorten communication, andprevent the formation of sandbars."The project left all his hearers astounded, accustomed as they wereto palliative measures."It's a Yankee plan!" observed Ben-Zayb, to ingratiate himself withSimoun, who had spent a long time in North America.All considered the plan wonderful and so indicated by the movementsof their heads. Only Don Custodio, the liberal Don Custodio, owing tohis independent position and his high offices, thought it his dutyto attack a project that did not emanate from himself--that was ausurpation! He coughed, stroked the ends of his mustache, and witha voice as important as though he were at a formal session of theAyuntamiento, said, "Excuse me, Senor Simoun, my respected friend,if I should say that I am not of your opinion. It would cost a greatdeal of money and might perhaps destroy some towns.""Then destroy them!" rejoined Simoun coldly."And the money to pay the laborers?""Don't pay them! Use the prisoners and convicts!""But there aren't enough, Senor Simoun!""Then, if there aren't enough, let all the villagers, the old men,the youths, the boys, work. Instead of the fifteen days of obligatoryservice, let them work three, four, five months for the State, with theadditional obligation that each one provide his own food and tools."The startled Don Custodio turned his head to see if there was anyIndian within ear-shot, but fortunately those nearby were rustics,and the two helmsmen seemed to be very much occupied with the windingsof the river."But, Senor Simoun--""Don't fool yourself, Don Custodio," continued Simoun dryly, "only inthis way are great enterprises carried out with small means. Thuswere constructed the Pyramids, Lake Moeris, and the Colosseumin Rome. Entire provinces came in from the desert, bringing theirtubers to feed on. Old men, youths, and boys labored in transportingstones, hewing them, and carrying them on their shoulders underthe direction of the official lash, and afterwards, the survivorsreturned to their homes or perished in the sands of the desert. Thencame other provinces, then others, succeeding one another in the workduring years. Thus the task was finished, and now we admire them,we travel, we go to Egypt and to Home, we extol the Pharaohs and theAntonines. Don't fool yourself--the dead remain dead, and might onlyis considered right by posterity.""But, Senor Simoun, such measures might provoke uprisings," objectedDon Custodio, rather uneasy over the turn the affair had taken."Uprisings, ha, ha! Did the Egyptian people ever rebel, I wonder? Didthe Jewish prisoners rebel against the pious Titus? Man, I thoughtyou were better informed in history!"Clearly Simoun was either very presumptuous or disregardedconventionalities! To say to Don Custodio's face that he did not knowhistory! It was enough to make any one lose his temper! So it seemed,for Don Custodio forgot himself and retorted, "But the fact is thatyou're not among Egyptians or Jews!""And these people have rebelled more than once," added the Dominican,somewhat timidly. "In the times when they were forced to transportheavy timbers for the construction of ships, if it hadn't been forthe clerics--""Those times are far away," answered Simoun, with a laugh even drierthan usual. "These islands will never again rebel, no matter how muchwork and taxes they have. Haven't you lauded to me, Padre Salvi,"he added, turning to the Franciscan, "the house and hospital at LosBanos, where his Excellency is at present?"Padre Salvi gave a nod and looked up, evading the question."Well, didn't you tell me that both buildings were constructedby forcing the people to work on them under the whip of alay-brother? Perhaps that wonderful bridge was built in the sameway. Now tell me, did these people rebel?""The fact is--they have rebelled before," replied the Dominican,"and _ab actu ad posse valet illatio!_""No, no, nothing of the kind," continued Simoun, starting down ahatchway to the cabin. "What's said, is said! And you, Padre Sibyla,don't talk either Latin or nonsense. What are you friars good for ifthe people can rebel?"Taking no notice of the replies and protests, Simoun descended thesmall companionway that led below, repeating disdainfully, "Bosh,bosh!"Padre Sibyla turned pale; this was the first time that he, Vice-Rectorof the University, had ever been credited with nonsense. Don Custodioturned green; at no meeting in which he had ever found himself hadhe encountered such an adversary."An American mulatto!" he fumed."A British Indian," observed Ben-Zayb in a low tone."An American, I tell you, and shouldn't I know?" retorted Don Custodioin ill-humor. "His Excellency has told me so. He's a jeweler whomthe latter knew in Havana, and, as I suspect, the one who got himadvancement by lending him money. So to repay him he has had him comehere to let him have a chance and increase his fortune by sellingdiamonds--imitations, who knows? And he so ungrateful, that, aftergetting money from the Indians, he wishes--huh!" The sentence wasconcluded by a significant wave of the hand.No one dared to join in this diatribe. Don Custodio could discredithimself with his Excellency, if he wished, but neither Ben-Zayb,nor Padre Irene, nor Padre Salvi, nor the offended Padre Sibyla hadany confidence in the discretion of the others."The fact is that this man, being an American, thinks no doubtthat we are dealing with the redskins. To talk of these matters ona steamer! Compel, force the people! And he's the very person whoadvised the expedition to the Carolines and the campaign in Mindanao,which is going to bring us to disgraceful ruin. He's the one whohas offered to superintend the building of the cruiser, and I say,what does a jeweler, no matter how rich and learned he may be, knowabout naval construction?"All this was spoken by Don Custodio in a guttural tone to his neighborBen-Zayb, while he gesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, and from timeto time with his looks consulted the others, who were nodding theirheads ambiguously. The Canon Irene indulged in a rather equivocalsmile, which he half hid with his hand as he rubbed his nose."I tell you, Ben-Zayb," continued Don Custodio, slapping the journaliston the arm, "all the trouble comes from not consulting the old-timershere. A project in fine words, and especially with a big appropriation,with an appropriation in round numbers, dazzles, meets with acceptanceat once, for this!" Here, in further explanation, he rubbed the tipof his thumb against his middle and forefinger. [4]"There's something in that, there's something in that," Ben-Zaybthought it his duty to remark, since in his capacity of journalisthe had to be informed about everything."Now look here, before the port works I presented a project, original,simple, useful, economical, and practicable, for clearing away the barin the lake, and it hasn't been accepted because there wasn't any ofthat in it." He repeated the movement of his fingers, shrugged hisshoulders, and gazed at the others as though to say, "Have you everheard of such a misfortune?""May we know what it was?" asked several, drawing nearer and givinghim their attention. The projects of Don Custodio were as renownedas quacks' specifics.Don Custodio was on the point of refusing to explain it fromresentment at not having found any supporters in his diatribe againstSimoun. "When there's no danger, you want me to talk, eh? And whenthere is, you keep quiet!" he was going to say, but that would causethe loss of a good opportunity, and his project, now that it couldnot be carried out, might at least be known and admired.After blowing out two or three puffs of smoke, coughing, and spittingthrough a scupper, he slapped Ben-Zayb on the thigh and asked,"You've seen ducks?""I rather think so--we've hunted them on the lake," answered thesurprised journalist."No, I'm not talking about wild ducks, I'm talking of the domesticones, of those that are raised in Pateros and Pasig. Do you know whatthey feed on?"Ben-Zayb, the only thinking head, did not know--he was not engagedin that business."On snails, man, on snails!" exclaimed Padre Camorra. "One doesn'thave to be an Indian to know that; it's sufficient to have eyes!""Exactly so, on snails!" repeated Don Custodio, flourishing hisforefinger. "And do you know where they get them?"Again the thinking head did not know."Well, if you had been in the country as many years as I have, youwould know that they fish them out of the bar itself, where theyabound, mixed with the sand.""Then your project?""Well, I'm coming to that. My idea was to compel all the towns roundabout, near the bar, to raise ducks, and you'll see how they, allby themselves, will deepen the channel by fishing for the snails--nomore and no less, no more and no less!"Here Don Custodio extended his arms and gazed triumphantly at thestupefaction of his hearers--to none of them had occurred such anoriginal idea."Will you allow me to write an article about that?" asked Ben-Zayb. "Inthis country there is so little thinking done--""But, Don Custodio," exclaimed Dona Victorina with smirks and grimaces,"if everybody takes to raising ducks the _balot_ [5] eggs will becomeabundant. Ugh, how nasty! Rather, let the bar close up entirely!"CHAPTER IION THE LOWER DECKThere, below, other scenes were being enacted. Seated on benchesor small wooden stools among valises, boxes, and baskets, a fewfeet from the engines, in the heat of the boilers, amid the humansmells and the pestilential odor of oil, were to be seen the greatmajority of the passengers. Some were silently gazing at the changingscenes along the banks, others were playing cards or conversing in themidst of the scraping of shovels, the roar of the engine, the hiss ofescaping steam, the swash of disturbed waters, and the shrieks of thewhistle. In one corner, heaped up like corpses, slept, or tried tosleep, a number of Chinese pedlers, seasick, pale, frothing throughhalf-opened lips, and bathed in their copious perspiration. Onlya few youths, students for the most part, easily recognizable fromtheir white garments and their confident bearing, made bold to moveabout from stern to bow, leaping over baskets and boxes, happy inthe prospect of the approaching vacation. Now they commented on themovements of the engines, endeavoring to recall forgotten notions ofphysics, now they surrounded the young schoolgirl or the red-lipped_buyera_ with her collar of _sampaguitas,_ whispering into their earswords that made them smile and cover their faces with their fans.Nevertheless, two of them, instead of engaging in these fleetinggallantries, stood in the bow talking with a man, advanced in years,but still vigorous and erect. Both these youths seemed to be wellknown and respected, to judge from the deference shown them by theirfellow passengers. The elder, who was dressed in complete black, wasthe medical student, Basilio, famous for his successful cures andextraordinary treatments, while the other, taller and more robust,although much younger, was Isagani, one of the poets, or at leastrimesters, who that year came from the Ateneo, [6] a curious character,ordinarily quite taciturn and uncommunicative. The man talking withthem was the rich Capitan Basilio, who was returning from a businesstrip to Manila."Capitan Tiago is getting along about the same as usual, yes, sir,"said the student Basilio, shaking his head. "He won't submit to anytreatment. At the advice of _a certain person_ he is sending me to SanDiego under the pretext of looking after his property, but in realityso that he may be left to smoke his opium with complete liberty."When the student said _a certain person_, he really meant Padre Irene,a great friend and adviser of Capitan Tiago in his last days."Opium is one of the plagues of modern times," replied the capitanwith the disdain and indignation of a Roman senator. "The ancients knewabout it but never abused it. While the addiction to classical studieslasted--mark this well, young men--opium was used solely as a medicine;and besides, tell me who smoke it the most?--Chinamen, Chinamen whodon't understand a word of Latin! Ah, if Capitan Tiago had only devotedhimself to Cicero--" Here the most classical disgust painted itselfon his carefully-shaven Epicurean face. Isagani regarded him withattention: that gentleman was suffering from nostalgia for antiquity."But to get back to this academy of Castilian," Capitan Basiliocontinued, "I assure you, gentlemen, that you won't materialize it.""Yes, sir, from day to day we're expecting the permit," repliedIsagani. "Padre Irene, whom you may have noticed above, and to whomwe've presented a team of bays, has promised it to us. He's on hisway now to confer with the General.""That doesn't matter. Padre Sibyla is opposed to it.""Let him oppose it! That's why he's here on the steamer, in orderto--at Los Banos before the General."And the student Basilio filled out his meaning by going through thepantomime of striking his fists together."That's understood," observed Capitan Basilio, smiling. "But eventhough you get the permit, where'll you get the funds?""We have them, sir. Each student has contributed a real.""But what about the professors?""We have them: half Filipinos and half Peninsulars." [7]"And the house?""Makaraig, the wealthy Makaraig, has offered one of his."Capitan Basilio had to give in; these young men had everythingarranged."For the rest," he said with a shrug of his shoulders, "it's notaltogether bad, it's not a bad idea, and now that you can't knowLatin at least you may know Castilian. Here you have another instance,namesake, of how we are going backwards. In our times we learned Latinbecause our books were in Latin; now you study Latin a little buthave no Latin books. On the other hand, your books are in Castilianand that language is not taught--_aetas parentum pejor avis tulitnos nequiores!_ as Horace said." With this quotation he moved awaymajestically, like a Roman emperor.The youths smiled at each other. "These men of the past," remarkedIsagani, "find obstacles for everything. Propose a thing to them andinstead of seeing its advantages they only fix their attention onthe difficulties. They want everything to come smooth and round asa billiard ball.""He's right at home with your uncle," observed Basilio."They talk of past times. But listen--speaking of uncles, what doesyours say about Paulita?"Isagani blushed. "He preached me a sermon about the choosing ofa wife. I answered him that there wasn't in Manila another likeher--beautiful, well-bred, an orphan--""Very wealthy, elegant, charming, with no defect other than aridiculous aunt," added Basilio, at which both smiled."In regard to the aunt, do you know that she has charged me to lookfor her husband?""Dona Victorina? And you've promised, in order to keep yoursweetheart.""Naturally! But the fact is that her husband is actually hidden--inmy uncle's house!"Both burst into a laugh at this, while Isagani continued: "That'swhy my uncle, being a conscientious man, won't go on the upper deck,fearful that Dona Victorina will ask him about Don Tiburcio. Justimagine, when Dona Victorina learned that I was a steerage passengershe gazed at me with a disdain that--"At that moment Simoun came down and, catching sight of the two youngmen, greeted Basilio in a patronizing tone: "Hello, Don Basilio,you're off for the vacation? Is the gentleman a townsman of yours?"Basilio introduced Isagani with the remark that he was not a townsman,but that their homes were not very far apart. Isagani lived on theseashore of the opposite coast. Simoun examined him with such markedattention that he was annoyed, turned squarely around, and faced thejeweler with a provoking stare."Well, what is the province like?" the latter asked, turning againto Basilio."Why, aren't you familiar with it?""How the devil am I to know it when I've never set foot in it? I'vebeen told that it's very poor and doesn't buy jewels.""We don't buy jewels, because we don't need them," rejoined Isaganidryly, piqued in his provincial pride.A smile played over Simoun's pallid lips. "Don't be offended, youngman," he replied. "I had no bad intentions, but as I've been assuredthat nearly all the money is in the hands of the native priests, Isaid to myself: the friars are dying for curacies and the Franciscansare satisfied with the poorest, so when they give them up to thenative priests the truth must be that the king's profile is unknownthere. But enough of that! Come and have a beer with me and we'lldrink to the prosperity of your province."The youths thanked him, but declined the offer."You do wrong," Simoun said to them, visibly taken aback. "Beer is agood thing, and I heard Padre Camorra say this morning that the lackof energy noticeable in this country is due to the great amount ofwater the inhabitants drink."Isagani was almost as tall as the jeweler, and at this he drewhimself up."Then tell Padre Camorra," Basilio hastened to say, while he nudgedIsagani slyly, "tell him that if he would drink water instead of wineor beer, perhaps we might all be the gainers and he would not giverise to so much talk.""And tell him, also," added Isagani, paying no attention to hisfriend's nudges, "that water is very mild and can be drunk, but thatit drowns out the wine and beer and puts out the fire, that heatedit becomes steam, and that ruffled it is the ocean, that it oncedestroyed mankind and made the earth tremble to its foundations!" [8]Simoun raised his head. Although his looks could not be readthrough the blue goggles, on the rest of his face surprise mightbe seen. "Rather a good answer," he said. "But I fear that he mightget facetious and ask me when the water will be converted into steamand when into an ocean. Padre Camorra is rather incredulous and isa great wag.""When the fire heats it, when the rivulets that are now scatteredthrough the steep valleys, forced by fatality, rush together in theabyss that men are digging," replied Isagani."No, Senor Simoun," interposed Basilio, changing to a jesting tone,"rather keep in mind the verses of my friend Isagani himself:    'Fire you, you say, and water we,    Then as you wish, so let it be;    But let us live in peace and right,    Nor shall the fire e'er see us fight;    So joined by wisdom's glowing flame,    That without anger, hate, or blame,    We form the steam, the fifth element,    Progress and light, life and movement.'""Utopia, Utopia!" responded Simoun dryly. "The engine is about tomeet--in the meantime, I'll drink my beer." So, without any word ofexcuse, he left the two friends."But what's the matter with you today that you're soquarrelsome?" asked Basilio."Nothing. I don't know why, but that man fills me with horror,fear almost.""I was nudging you with my elbow. Don't you know that he's calledthe Brown Cardinal?""The Brown Cardinal?""Or Black Eminence, as you wish.""I don't understand.""Richelieu had a Capuchin adviser who was called the Gray Eminence;well, that's what this man is to the General.""Really?""That's what I've heard from _a certain person,_--who always speaksill of him behind his back and flatters him to his face.""Does he also visit Capitan Tiago?""From the first day after his arrival, and I'm sure that _a certainperson_ looks upon him as a rival--in the inheritance. I believethat he's going to see the General about the question of instructionin Castilian."At that moment Isagani was called away by a servant to his uncle.On one of the benches at the stern, huddled in among the otherpassengers, sat a native priest gazing at the landscapes that weresuccessively unfolded to his view. His neighbors made room for him, themen on passing taking off their hats, and the gamblers not daring toset their table near where he was. He said little, but neither smokednor assumed arrogant airs, nor did he disdain to mingle with the othermen, returning the salutes with courtesy and affability as if he feltmuch honored and very grateful. Although advanced in years, with hairalmost completely gray, he appeared to be in vigorous health, and evenwhen seated held his body straight and his head erect, but withoutpride or arrogance. He differed from the ordinary native priests,few enough indeed, who at that period served merely as coadjutors oradministered some curacies temporarily, in a certain self-possessionand gravity, like one who was conscious of his personal dignityand the sacredness of his office. A superficial examination of hisappearance, if not his white hair, revealed at once that he belongedto another epoch, another generation, when the better young men werenot afraid to risk their dignity by becoming priests, when the nativeclergy looked any friar at all in the face, and when their class,not yet degraded and vilified, called for free men and not slaves,superior intelligences and not servile wills. In his sad and seriousfeatures was to be read the serenity of a soul fortified by study andmeditation, perhaps tried out by deep moral suffering. This priestwas Padre Florentino, Isagani's uncle, and his story is easily told.Scion of a wealthy and influential family of Manila, of agreeableappearance and cheerful disposition, suited to shine in the world, hehad never felt any call to the sacerdotal profession, but by reasonof some promises or vows, his mother, after not a few struggles andviolent disputes, compelled him to enter the seminary. She was a greatfriend of the Archbishop, had a will of iron, and was as inexorableas is every devout woman who believes that she is interpreting thewill of God. Vainly the young Florentine offered resistance, vainly hebegged, vainly he pleaded his love affairs, even provoking scandals:priest he had to become at twenty-five years of age, and priest hebecame. The Archbishop ordained him, his first mass was celebratedwith great pomp, three days were given over to feasting, and hismother died happy and content, leaving him all her fortune.But in that struggle Florentine received a wound from which henever recovered. Weeks before his first mass the woman he loved,in desperation, married a nobody--a blow the rudest he had everexperienced. He lost his moral energy, life became dull andinsupportable. If not his virtue and the respect for his office,that unfortunate love affair saved him from the depths into which theregular orders and secular clergymen both fall in the Philippines. Hedevoted himself to his parishioners as a duty, and by inclination tothe natural sciences.When the events of seventy-two occurred, [9] he feared that thelarge income his curacy yielded him would attract attention tohim, so, desiring peace above everything, he sought and secured hisrelease, living thereafter as a private individual on his patrimonialestate situated on the Pacific coast. He there adopted his nephew,Isagani, who was reported by the malicious to be his own son by hisold sweetheart when she became a widow, and by the more serious andbetter informed, the natural child of a cousin, a lady in Manila.The captain of the steamer caught sight of the old priest and insistedthat he go to the upper deck, saying, "If you don't do so, the friarswill think that you don't want to associate with them."Padre Florentino had no recourse but to accept, so he summoned hisnephew in order to let him know where he was going, and to charge himnot to come near the upper deck while he was there. "If the captainnotices you, he'll invite you also, and we should then be abusinghis kindness.""My uncle's way!" thought Isagani. "All so that I won't have anyreason for talking with Dona Victorina."CHAPTER IIILEGENDS    Ich weiss nicht was soil es bedeuten    Dass ich so traurig bin!When Padre Florentino joined the group above, the bad humor provoked bythe previous discussion had entirely disappeared. Perhaps their spiritshad been raised by the attractive houses of the town of Pasig, or theglasses of sherry they had drunk in preparation for the coming meal, orthe prospect of a good breakfast. Whatever the cause, the fact was thatthey were all laughing and joking, even including the lean Franciscan,although he made little noise and his smiles looked like death-grins."Evil times, evil times!" said Padre Sibyla with a laugh."Get out, don't say that, Vice-Rector!" responded the Canon Irene,giving the other's chair a shove. "In Hongkong you're doing a finebusiness, putting up every building that--ha, ha!""Tut, tut!" was the reply; "you don't see our expenses, and thetenants on our estates are beginning to complain--""Here, enough of complaints, _punales,_ else I'll fall toweeping!" cried Padre Camorra gleefully. "We're not complaining,and we haven't either estates or banking-houses. You know that myIndians are beginning to haggle over the fees and to flash schedules onme! Just look how they cite schedules to me now, and none other thanthose of the Archbishop Basilio Sancho, [10] as if from his time upto now prices had not risen. Ha, ha, ha! Why should a baptism costless than a chicken? But I play the deaf man, collect what I can,and never complain. We're not avaricious, are we, Padre Salvi?"At that moment Simoun's head appeared above the hatchway."Well, where've you been keeping yourself?" Don Custodio called tohim, having forgotten all about their dispute. "You're missing theprettiest part of the trip!""Pshaw!" retorted Simoun, as he ascended, "I've seen so many riversand landscapes that I'm only interested in those that call up legends.""As for legends, the Pasig has a few," observed the captain, who didnot relish any depreciation of the river where he navigated and earnedhis livelihood. "Here you have that of _Malapad-na-bato,_ a rock sacredbefore the coming of the Spaniards as the abode of spirits. Afterwards,when the superstition had been dissipated and the rock profaned, it wasconverted into a nest of tulisanes, since from its crest they easilycaptured the luckless bankas, which had to contend against both thecurrents and men. Later, in our time, in spite of human interference,there are still told stories about wrecked bankas, and if on roundingit I didn't steer with my six senses, I'd be smashed against itssides. Then you have another legend, that of Dona Jeronima's cave,which Padre Florentino can relate to you.""Everybody knows that," remarked Padre Sibyla disdainfully.But neither Simoun, nor Ben-Zayb, nor Padre Irene, nor Padre Camorraknew it, so they begged for the story, some in jest and others fromgenuine curiosity. The priest, adopting the tone of burlesque withwhich some had made their request, began like an old tutor relatinga story to children."Once upon a time there was a student who had made a promise ofmarriage to a young woman in his country, but it seems that he failedto remember her. She waited for him faithfully year after year, heryouth passed, she grew into middle age, and then one day she heard areport that her old sweetheart was the Archbishop of Manila. Disguisingherself as a man, she came round the Cape and presented herself beforehis grace, demanding the fulfilment of his promise. What she askedwas of course impossible, so the Archbishop ordered the preparationof the cave that you may have noticed with its entrance covered anddecorated with a curtain of vines. There she lived and died and thereshe is buried. The legend states that Dona Jeronima was so fat thatshe had to turn sidewise to get into it. Her fame as an enchantresssprung from her custom of throwing into the river the silver disheswhich she used in the sumptuous banquets that were attended by crowdsof gentlemen. A net was spread under the water to hold the dishesand thus they were cleaned. It hasn't been twenty years since theriver washed the very entrance of the cave, but it has gradually beenreceding, just as the memory of her is dying out among the people.""A beautiful legend!" exclaimed Ben-Zayb. "I'm going to write anarticle about it. It's sentimental!"Dona Victorina thought of dwelling in such a cave and was about tosay so, when Simoun took the floor instead."But what's your opinion about that, Padre Salvi?" he asked theFranciscan, who seemed to be absorbed in thought. "Doesn't it seem toyou as though his Grace, instead of giving her a cave, ought to haveplaced her in a nunnery--in St. Clara's, for example? What do you say?"There was a start of surprise on Padre Sibyla's part to notice thatPadre Salvi shuddered and looked askance at Simoun."Because it's not a very gallant act," continued Simoun quitenaturally, "to give a rocky cliff as a home to one with whosehopes we have trifled. It's hardly religious to expose her thus totemptation, in a cave on the banks of a river--it smacks of nymphs anddryads. It would have been more gallant, more pious, more romantic,more in keeping with the customs of this country, to shut her up inSt. Clara's, like a new Eloise, in order to visit and console herfrom time to time.""I neither can nor should pass judgment upon the conduct ofarchbishops," replied the Franciscan sourly."But you, who are the ecclesiastical governor, acting in the placeof our Archbishop, what would you do if such a case should arise?"Padre Salvi shrugged his shoulders and calmly responded, "It's notworth while thinking about what can't happen. But speaking of legends,don't overlook the most beautiful, since it is the truest: that ofthe miracle of St. Nicholas, the ruins of whose church you may havenoticed. I'm going to relate it to Senor Simoun, as he probably hasn'theard it. It seems that formerly the river, as well as the lake,was infested with caymans, so huge and voracious that they attackedbankas and upset them with a slap of the tail. Our chronicles relatethat one day an infidel Chinaman, who up to that time had refused to beconverted, was passing in front of the church, when suddenly the devilpresented himself to him in the form of a cayman and upset the banka,in order to devour him and carry him off to hell. Inspired by God,the Chinaman at that moment called upon St. Nicholas and instantlythe cayman was changed into a stone. The old people say that intheir time the monster could easily be recognized in the pieces ofstone that were left, and, for my part, I can assure you that I haveclearly made out the head, to judge from which the monster must havebeen enormously large.""Marvelous, a marvelous legend!" exclaimed Ben-Zayb. "It's good for anarticle--the description of the monster, the terror of the Chinaman,the waters of the river, the bamboo brakes. Also, it'll do for a studyof comparative religions; because, look you, an infidel Chinaman ingreat distress invoked exactly the saint that he must know only byhearsay and in whom he did not believe. Here there's no room for theproverb that 'a known evil is preferable to an unknown good.' If Ishould find myself in China and get caught in such a difficulty, Iwould invoke the obscurest saint in the calendar before Confucius orBuddha. Whether this is due to the manifest superiority of Catholicismor to the inconsequential and illogical inconsistency in the brainsof the yellow race, a profound study of anthropology alone will beable to elucidate."Ben-Zayb had adopted the tone of a lecturer and was describingcircles in the air with his forefinger, priding himself on hisimagination, which from the most insignificant facts could deduceso many applications and inferences. But noticing that Simoun waspreoccupied and thinking that he was pondering over what he, Ben-Zayb,had just said, he inquired what the jeweler was meditating about."About two very important questions," answered Simoun; "two questionsthat you might add to your article. First, what may have become ofthe devil on seeing himself suddenly confined within a stone? Did heescape? Did he stay there? Was he crushed? Second, if the petrifiedanimals that I have seen in various European museums may not havebeen the victims of some antediluvian saint?"The tone in which the jeweler spoke was so serious, while he restedhis forehead on the tip of his forefinger in an attitude of deepmeditation, that Padre Camorra responded very gravely, "Who knows,who knows?""Since we're busy with legends and are now entering the lake,"remarked Padre Sibyla, "the captain must know many--"At that moment the steamer crossed the bar and the panorama spread outbefore their eyes was so truly magnificent that all were impressed. Infront extended the beautiful lake bordered by green shores and bluemountains, like a huge mirror, framed in emeralds and sapphires,reflecting the sky in its glass. On the right were spread out thelow shores, forming bays with graceful curves, and dim there in thedistance the crags of Sungay, while in the background rose Makiling,imposing and majestic, crowned with fleecy clouds. On the left layTalim Island with its curious sweep of hills. A fresh breeze rippledover the wide plain of water."By the way, captain," said Ben-Zayb, turning around, "do you knowin what part of the lake a certain Guevara, Navarra, or Ibarra,was killed?"The group looked toward the captain, with the exception of Simoun, whohad turned away his head as though to look for something on the shore."Ah, yes!" exclaimed Dona Victorina. "Where, captain? Did he leaveany tracks in the water?"The good captain winked several times, an indication that he wasannoyed, but reading the request in the eyes of all, took a few stepstoward the bow and scanned the shore."Look over there," he said in a scarcely audible voice, after makingsure that no strangers were near. "According to the officer whoconducted the pursuit, Ibarra, upon finding himself surrounded, jumpedout of his banka there near the Kinabutasan [11] and, swimming underwater, covered all that distance of more than two miles, saluted bybullets every time that he raised his head to breathe. Over yonder iswhere they lost track of him, and a little farther on near the shorethey discovered something like the color of blood. And now I thinkof it, it's just thirteen years, day for day, since this happened.""So that his corpse--" began Ben-Zayb."Went to join his father's," replied Padre Sibyla. "Wasn't he alsoanother filibuster, Padre Salvi?""That's what might be called cheap funerals, Padre Camorra,eh?" remarked Ben-Zayb."I've always said that those who won't pay for expensive funeralsare filibusters," rejoined the person addressed, with a merry laugh."But what's the matter with you, Senor Simoun?" inquired Ben-Zayb,seeing that the jeweler was motionless and thoughtful. "Are youseasick--an old traveler like you? On such a drop of water as this!""I want to tell you," broke in the captain, who had come to hold allthose places in great affection, "that you can't call this a dropof water. It's larger than any lake in Switzerland and all those inSpain put together. I've seen old sailors who got seasick here."CHAPTER IVCABESANG TALESThose who have read the first part of this story will perhaps rememberan old wood-cutter who lived in the depths of the forest. [12] TandangSelo is still alive, and though his hair has turned completely white,he yet preserves his good health. He no longer hunts or cuts firewood,for his fortunes have improved and he works only at making brooms.His son Tales (abbreviation of Telesforo) had worked at first on shareson the lands of a capitalist, but later, having become the owner oftwo carabaos and several hundred pesos, determined to work on his ownaccount, aided by his father, his wife, and his three children. Sothey cut down and cleared away some thick woods which were situatedon the borders of the town and which they believed belonged to noone. During the labors of cleaning and cultivating the new land,the whole family fell ill with malaria and the mother died, alongwith the eldest daughter, Lucia, in the flower of her age. This,which was the natural consequence of breaking up new soil infestedwith various kinds of bacteria, they attributed to the anger of thewoodland spirit, so they were resigned and went on with their labor,believing him pacified.But when they began to harvest their first crop a religiouscorporation, which owned land in the neighboring town, laid claim tothe fields, alleging that they fell within their boundaries, and toprove it they at once started to set up their marks. However, theadministrator of the religious order left to them, for humanity'ssake, the usufruct of the land on condition that they pay a smallsum annually--a mere bagatelle, twenty or thirty pesos. Tales, aspeaceful a man as could be found, was as much opposed to lawsuitsas any one and more submissive to the friars than most people; so,in order not to smash a _palyok_ against a _kawali_ (as he said,for to him the friars were iron pots and he a clay jar), he had theweakness to yield to their claim, remembering that he did not knowSpanish and had no money to pay lawyers.Besides, Tandang Selo said to him, "Patience! You would spend morein one year of litigation than in ten years of paying what the whitepadres demand. And perhaps they'll pay you back in masses! Pretendthat those thirty pesos had been lost in gambling or had fallen intothe water and been swallowed by a cayman."The harvest was abundant and sold well, so Tales planned to build awooden house in the barrio of Sagpang, of the town of Tiani, whichadjoined San Diego.Another year passed, bringing another good crop, and for this reasonthe friars raised the rent to fifty pesos, which Tales paid in ordernot to quarrel and because he expected to sell his sugar at a goodprice."Patience! Pretend that the cayman has grown some," old Selo consoledhim.That year he at last saw his dream realized: to live in the barrio ofSagpang in a wooden house. The father and grandfather then thought ofproviding some education for the two children, especially the daughterJuliana, or Juli, as they called her, for she gave promise of beingaccomplished and beautiful. A boy who was a friend of the family,Basilio, was studying in Manila, and he was of as lowly origin as they.But this dream seemed destined not to be realized. The first care thecommunity took when they saw the family prospering was to appoint ascabeza de barangay its most industrious member, which left only Tano,the son, who was only fourteen years old. The father was thereforecalled _Cabesang_ Tales and had to order a sack coat, buy a felt hat,and prepare to spend his money. In order to avoid any quarrel withthe curate or the government, he settled from his own pocket theshortages in the tax-lists, paying for those who had died or movedaway, and he lost considerable time in making the collections and onhis trips to the capital."Patience! Pretend that the cayman's relatives have joined him,"advised Tandang Selo, smiling placidly."Next year you'll put on a long skirt and go to Manila to study likethe young ladies of the town," Cabesang Tales told his daughter everytime he heard her talking of Basilio's progress.But that next year did not come, and in its stead there was anotherincrease in the rent. Cabesang Tales became serious and scratchedhis head. The clay jar was giving up all its rice to the iron pot.When the rent had risen to two hundred pesos, Tales was not contentwith scratching his head and sighing; he murmured and protested. Thefriar-administrator then told him that if he could not pay, some oneelse would be assigned to cultivate that land--many who desired ithad offered themselves.He thought at first that the friar was joking, but the friar wastalking seriously, and indicated a servant of his to take possessionof the land. Poor Tales turned pale, he felt a buzzing in his ears, hesaw in the red mist that rose before his eyes his wife and daughter,pallid, emaciated, dying, victims of the intermittent fevers--thenhe saw the thick forest converted into productive fields, he saw thestream of sweat watering its furrows, he saw himself plowing underthe hot sun, bruising his feet against the stones and roots, whilethis friar had been driving about in his carriage with the wretch whowas to get the land following like a slave behind his master. No, athousand times, no! First let the fields sink into the depths of theearth and bury them all! Who was this intruder that he should haveany right to his land? Had he brought from his own country a singlehandful of that soil? Had he crooked a single one of his fingers topull up the roots that ran through it?Exasperated by the threats of the friar, who tried to uphold hisauthority at any cost in the presence of the other tenants, CabesangTales rebelled and refused to pay a single cuarto, having ever beforehimself that red mist, saying that he would give up his fields to thefirst man who could irrigate it with blood drawn from his own veins.Old Selo, on looking at his son's face, did not dare to mention thecayman, but tried to calm him by talking of clay jars, reminding himthat the winner in a lawsuit was left without a shirt to his back."We shall all be turned to clay, father, and without shirts we wereborn," was the reply.So he resolutely refused to pay or to give up a single span of hisland unless the friars should first prove the legality of their claimby exhibiting a title-deed of some kind. As they had none, a lawsuitfollowed, and Cabesang Tales entered into it, confiding that some atleast, if not all, were lovers of justice and respecters of the law."I serve and have been serving the King with my money and my services,"he said to those who remonstrated with him. "I'm asking for justiceand he is obliged to give it to me."Drawn on by fatality, and as if he had put into play in the lawsuitthe whole future of himself and his children, he went on spending hissavings to pay lawyers, notaries, and solicitors, not to mention theofficials and clerks who exploited his ignorance and his needs. Hemoved to and fro between the village and the capital, passed hisdays without eating and his nights without sleeping, while his talkwas always about briefs, exhibits, and appeals. There was then seena struggle such as was never before carried on under the skies of thePhilippines: that of a poor Indian, ignorant and friendless, confidingin the justness and righteousness of his cause, fighting against apowerful corporation before which Justice bowed her head, while thejudges let fall the scales and surrendered the sword. He fought astenaciously as the ant which bites when it knows that it is goingto be crushed, as does the fly which looks into space only througha pane of glass. Yet the clay jar defying the iron pot and smashingitself into a thousand pieces bad in it something impressive--it hadthe sublimeness of desperation!On the days when his journeys left him free he patrolled his fieldsarmed with a shotgun, saying that the tulisanes were hovering aroundand he had need of defending himself in order not to fall into theirhands and thus lose his lawsuit. As if to improve his marksmanship,he shot at birds and fruits, even the butterflies, with such accurateaim that the friar-administrator did not dare to go to Sagpang withoutan escort of civil-guards, while the friar's hireling, who gazed fromafar at the threatening figure of Tales wandering over the fieldslike a sentinel upon the walls, was terror stricken and refused totake the property away from him.But the local judges and those at the capital, warned by the experienceof one of their number who had been summarily dismissed, dared notgive him the decision, fearing their own dismissal. Yet they were notreally bad men, those judges, they were upright and conscientious,good citizens, excellent fathers, dutiful sons--and they wereable to appreciate poor Tales' situation better than Tales himselfcould. Many of them were versed in the scientific and historicalbasis of property, they knew that the friars by their own statutescould not own property, but they also knew that to come from faracross the sea with an appointment secured with great difficulty,to undertake the duties of the position with the best intentions,and now to lose it because an Indian fancied that justice had tobe done on earth as in heaven--that surely was an idea! They hadtheir families and greater needs surely than that Indian: one hada mother to provide for, and what duty is more sacred than that ofcaring for a mother? Another had sisters, all of marriageable age;that other there had many little children who expected their dailybread and who, like fledglings in a nest, would surely die of hungerthe day he was out of a job; even the very least of them had there,far away, a wife who would be in distress if the monthly remittancefailed. All these moral and conscientious judges tried everything intheir power in the way of counsel, advising Cabesang Tales to paythe rent demanded. But Tales, like all simple souls, once he hadseen what was just, went straight toward it. He demanded proofs,documents, papers, title-deeds, but the friars had none of these,resting their case on his concessions in the past.Cabesang Tales' constant reply was: "If every day I give alms to abeggar to escape annoyance, who will oblige me to continue my giftsif he abuses my generosity?"From this stand no one could draw him, nor were there any threats thatcould intimidate him. In vain Governor M---- made a trip expresslyto talk to him and frighten him. His reply to it all was: "You maydo what you like, Mr. Governor, I'm ignorant and powerless. But I'vecultivated those fields, my wife and daughter died while helping meclear them, and I won't give them up to any one but him who can domore with them than I've done. Let him first irrigate them with hisblood and bury in them his wife and daughter!"The upshot of this obstinacy was that the honorable judges gave thedecision to the friars, and everybody laughed at him, saying thatlawsuits are not won by justice. But Cabesang Tales appealed, loadedhis shotgun, and patrolled his fields with deliberation.During this period his life seemed to be a wild dream. His son,Tano, a youth as tall as his father and as good as his sister, wasconscripted, but he let the boy go rather than purchase a substitute."I have to pay the lawyers," he told his weeping daughter. "If I winthe case I'll find a way to get him back, and if I lose it I won'thave any need for sons."So the son went away and nothing more was heard of him except that hishair had been cropped and that he slept under a cart. Six months laterit was rumored that he had been seen embarking for the Carolines;another report was that he had been seen in the uniform of theCivil Guard."Tano in the Civil Guard! _'Susmariosep_!" exclaimed several, claspingtheir hands. "Tano, who was so good and so honest! _Requimternam!_"The grandfather went many days without speaking to the father, Julifell sick, but Cabesang Tales did not shed a single tear, although fortwo days he never left the house, as if he feared the looks of reproachfrom the whole village or that he would be called the executioner ofhis son. But on the third day he again sallied forth with his shotgun.Murderous intentions were attributed to him, and there werewell-meaning persons who whispered about that he had been heard tothreaten that he would bury the friar-administrator in the furrows ofhis fields, whereat the friar was frightened at him in earnest. As aresult of this, there came a decree from the Captain-General forbiddingthe use of firearms and ordering that they be taken up. Cabesang Taleshad to hand over his shotgun but he continued his rounds armed witha long bolo."What are you going to do with that bolo when the tulisanes havefirearms?" old Selo asked him."I must watch my crops," was the answer. "Every stalk of cane growingthere is one of my wife's bones."The bolo was taken up on the pretext that it was too long. He thentook his father's old ax and with it on his shoulder continued hissullen rounds.Every time he left the house Tandang Selo and Juli trembled for hislife. The latter would get up from her loom, go to the window, pray,make vows to the saints, and recite novenas. The grandfather was attimes unable to finish the handle of a broom and talked of returningto the forest--life in that house was unbearable.At last their fears were realized. As the fields were some distancefrom the village, Cabesang Tales, in spite of his ax, fell into thehands of tulisanes who had revolvers and rifles. They told him thatsince he had money to pay judges and lawyers he must have some alsofor the outcasts and the hunted. They therefore demanded a ransom offive hundred pesos through the medium of a rustic, with the warningthat if anything happened to their messenger, the captive would payfor it with his life. Two days of grace were allowed.This news threw the poor family into the wildest terror, which wasaugmented when they learned that the Civil Guard was going out inpursuit of the bandits. In case of an encounter, the first victimwould be the captive--this they all knew. The old man was paralyzed,while the pale and frightened daughter tried often to talk but couldnot. Still, another thought more terrible, an idea more cruel, rousedthem from their stupor. The rustic sent by the tulisanes said thatthe band would probably have to move on, and if they were slow insending the ransom the two days would elapse and Cabesang Tales wouldhave his throat cut.This drove those two beings to madness, weak and powerless as theywere. Tandang Selo got up, sat down, went outside, came back again,knowing not where to go, where to seek aid. Juli appealed to herimages, counted and recounted her money, but her two hundred pesosdid not increase or multiply. Soon she dressed herself, gatheredtogether all her jewels, and asked the advice of her grandfather,if she should go to see the gobernadorcillo, the judge, the notary,the lieutenant of the Civil Guard. The old man said yes to everything,or when she said no, he too said no. At length came the neighbors,their relatives and friends, some poorer than others, in theirsimplicity magnifying the fears. The most active of all was SisterBali, a great _panguinguera,_ who had been to Manila to practisereligious exercises in the nunnery of the Sodality.Juli was willing to sell all her jewels, except a locket set withdiamonds and emeralds which Basilio had given her, for this lockethad a history: a nun, the daughter of Capitan Tiago, had given it to aleper, who, in return for professional treatment, had made a present ofit to Basilio. So she could not sell it without first consulting him.Quickly the shell-combs and earrings were sold, as well as Juli'srosary, to their richest neighbor, and thus fifty pesos were added,but two hundred and fifty were still lacking. The locket might bepawned, but Juli shook her head. A neighbor suggested that the housebe sold and Tandang Selo approved the idea, satisfied to return tothe forest and cut firewood as of old, but Sister Bali observed thatthis could not be done because the owner was not present."The judge's wife once sold me her _tapis_ for a peso, but herhusband said that the sale did not hold because it hadn't receivedhis approval. _Aba!_ He took back the _tapis_ and she hasn't returnedthe peso yet, but I don't pay her when she wins at _panguingui, aba!_In that way I've collected twelve cuartos, and for that alone I'mgoing to play with her. I can't bear to have people fail to pay whatthey owe me, _aba!_"Another neighbor was going to ask Sister Bali why then did notshe settle a little account with her, but the quick _panguinguera_suspected this and added at once: "Do you know, Juli, what you cando? Borrow two hundred and fifty pesos on the house, payable whenthe lawsuit is won."This seemed to be the best proposition, so they decided to act uponit that same day. Sister Bali offered to accompany her, and togetherthey visited the houses of all the rich folks in Tiani, but no onewould accept the proposal. The case, they said, was already lost,and to show favors to an enemy of the friars was to expose themselvesto their vengeance. At last a pious woman took pity on the girl andlent the money on condition that Juli should remain with her as aservant until the debt was paid. Juli would not have so very muchto do: sew, pray, accompany her to mass, and fast for her now andthen. The girl accepted with tears in her eyes, received the money,and promised to enter her service on the following day, Christmas.When the grandfather heard of that sale he fell to weeping like achild. What, that granddaughter whom he had not allowed to walk in thesun lest her skin should be burned, Juli, she of the delicate fingersand rosy feet! What, that girl, the prettiest in the village andperhaps in the whole town, before whose window many gallants had vainlypassed the night playing and singing! What, his only granddaughter,the sole joy of his fading eyes, she whom he had dreamed of seeingdressed in a long skirt, talking Spanish, and holding herself erectwaving a painted fan like the daughters of the wealthy--she to becomea servant, to be scolded and reprimanded, to ruin her fingers, tosleep anywhere, to rise in any manner whatsoever!So the old grandfather wept and talked of hanging or starving himselfto death. "If you go," he declared, "I'm going back to the forestand will never set foot in the town."Juli soothed him by saying that it was necessary for her father toreturn, that the suit would be won, and they could then ransom herfrom her servitude.The night was a sad one. Neither of the two could taste a bite andthe old man refused to lie down, passing the whole night seated ina corner, silent and motionless. Juli on her part tried to sleep,but for a long time could not close her eyes. Somewhat relieved abouther father's fate, she now thought of herself and fell to weeping,but stifled her sobs so that the old man might not hear them. Thenext day she would be a servant, and it was the very day Basilio wasaccustomed to come from Manila with presents for her. Henceforwardshe would have to give up that love; Basilio, who was going to be adoctor, couldn't marry a pauper. In fancy she saw him going to thechurch in company with the prettiest and richest girl in the town,both well-dressed, happy and smiling, while she, Juli, followed hermistress, carrying novenas, buyos, and the cuspidor. Here the girlfelt a lump rise in her throat, a sinking at her heart, and beggedthe Virgin to let her die first.But--said her conscience--he will at least know that I preferred topawn myself rather than the locket he gave me.This thought consoled her a little and brought on empty dreams. Whoknows but that a miracle might happen? She might find the two hundredand fifty pesos under the image of the Virgin--she had read ofmany similar miracles. The sun might not rise nor morning come, andmeanwhile the suit would be won. Her father might return, or Basilioput in his appearance, she might find a bag of gold in the garden,the tulisanes would send the bag of gold, the curate, Padre Camorra,who was always teasing her, would come with the tulisanes. So herideas became more and more confused, until at length, worn out byfatigue and sorrow, she went to sleep with dreams of her childhoodin the depths of the forest: she was bathing in the torrent alongwith her two brothers, there were little fishes of all colors thatlet themselves be caught like fools, and she became impatient becauseshe found no pleasure in catchnig such foolish little fishes! Basiliowas under the water, but Basilio for some reason had the face of herbrother Tano. Her new mistress was watching them from the bank.CHAPTER VA COCHERO'S CHRISTMAS EVEBasilio reached San Diego just as the Christmas Eve procession waspassing through the streets. He had been delayed on the road forseveral hours because the cochero, having forgotten his cedula, washeld up by the Civil Guard, had his memory jogged by a few blows froma rifle-butt, and afterwards was taken before the commandant. Now thecarromata was again detained to let the procession pass, while theabused cochero took off his hat reverently and recited a paternosterto the first image that came along, which seemed to be that of agreat saint. It was the figure of an old man with an exceptionallylong beard, seated at the edge of a grave under a tree filled withall kinds of stuffed birds. A _kalan_ with a clay jar, a mortar,and a _kalikut_ for mashing buyo were his only utensils, as if toindicate that he lived on the border of the tomb and was doing hiscooking there. This was the Methuselah of the religious iconographyof the Philippines; his colleague and perhaps contemporary is calledin Europe Santa Claus, and is still more smiling and agreeable."In the time of the saints," thought the cochero, "surely there were nocivil-guards, because one can't live long on blows from rifle-butts."Behind the great old man came the three Magian Kings on ponies thatwere capering about, especially that of the negro Melchior, whichseemed to be about to trample its companions."No, there couldn't have been any civil-guards," decided thecochero, secretly envying those fortunate times, "because if therehad been, that negro who is cutting up such capers beside those twoSpaniards"--Gaspar and Bathazar--"would have gone to jail."Then, observing that the negro wore a crown and was a king, like theother two, the Spaniards, his thoughts naturally turned to the kingof the Indians, and he sighed. "Do you know, sir," he asked Basiliorespectfully, "if his right foot is loose yet?"Basilio had him repeat the question. "Whose right foot?""The King's!" whispered the cochero mysteriously."What King's?""Our King's, the King of the Indians."Basilio smiled and shrugged his shoulders, while the cochero againsighed. The Indians in the country places preserve the legend thattheir king, imprisoned and chained in the cave of San Mateo, willcome some day to free them. Every hundredth year he breaks one of hischains, so that he now has his hands and his left foot loose--onlythe right foot remains bound. This king causes the earthquakes when hestruggles or stirs himself, and he is so strong that in shaking handswith him it is necessary to extend to him a bone, which he crushesin his grasp. For some unexplainable reason the Indians call him KingBernardo, perhaps by confusing him with Bernardo del Carpio. [13]"When he gets his right foot loose," muttered the cochero, stiflinganother sigh, "I'll give him my horses, and offer him my services evento death, for he'll free us from the Civil Guard." With a melancholygaze he watched the Three Kings move on.The boys came behind in two files, sad and serious as though they werethere under compulsion. They lighted their way, some with torches,others with tapers, and others with paper lanterns on bamboo poles,while they recited the rosary at the top of their voices, as thoughquarreling with somebody. Afterwards came St. Joseph on a modest float,with a look of sadness and resignation on his face, carrying his stalkof lilies, as he moved along between two civil-guards as though he werea prisoner. This enabled the cochero to understand the expression onthe saint's face, but whether the sight of the guards troubled him orhe had no great respect for a saint who would travel in such company,he did not recite a single requiem.Behind St. Joseph came the girls bearing lights, their heads coveredwith handkerchiefs knotted under their chins, also reciting the rosary,but with less wrath than the boys. In their midst were to be seenseveral lads dragging along little rabbits made of Japanese paper,lighted by red candles, with their short paper tails erect. The ladsbrought those toys into the procession to enliven the birth of theMessiah. The little animals, fat and round as eggs, seemed to be sopleased that at times they would take a leap, lose their balance, fall,and catch fire. The owner would then hasten to extinguish such burningenthusiasm, puffing and blowing until he finally beat out the fire,and then, seeing his toy destroyed, would fall to weeping. The cocheroobserved with sadness that the race of little paper animals disappearedeach year, as if they had been attacked by the pest like the livinganimals. He, the abused Sinong, remembered his two magnificent horses,which, at the advice of the curate, he had caused to be blessed tosave them from plague, spending therefor ten pesos--for neitherthe government nor the curates have found any better remedy forthe epizootic--and they had died after all. Yet he consoled himselfby remembering also that after the shower of holy water, the Latinphrases of the padre, and the ceremonies, the horses had become sovain and self-important that they would not even allow him, Sinong,a good Christian, to put them in harness, and he had not dared to whipthem, because a tertiary sister had said that they were _sanctified_.The procession was closed by the Virgin dressed as the Divine Shepherd,with a pilgrim's hat of wide brim and long plumes to indicate thejourney to Jerusalem. That the birth might be made more explicable, thecurate had ordered her figure to be stuffed with rags and cotton underher skirt, so that no one could be in any doubt as to her condition. Itwas a very beautiful image, with the same sad expression of all theimages that the Filipinos make, and a mien somewhat ashamed, doubtlessat the way in which the curate had arranged her. In front came severalsingers and behind, some musicians with the usual civil-guards. Thecurate, as was to be expected after what he had done, was not in hisplace, for that year he was greatly displeased at having to use allhis diplomacy and shrewdness to convince the townspeople that theyshould pay thirty pesos for each Christmas mass instead of the usualtwenty. "You're turning filibusters!" he had said to them.The cochero must have been greatly preoccupied with the sights of theprocession, for when it had passed and Basilio ordered him to go on, hedid not notice that the lamp on his carromata had gone out. Neither didBasilio notice it, his attention being devoted to gazing at the houses,which were illuminated inside and out with little paper lanternsof fantastic shapes and colors, stars surrounded by hoops with longstreamers which produced a pleasant murmur when shaken by the wind,and fishes of movable heads and tails, having a glass of oil inside,suspended from the eaves of the windows in the delightful fashion ofa happy and homelike fiesta. But he also noticed that the lights wereflickering, that the stars were being eclipsed, that this year hadfewer ornaments and hangings than the former, which in turn had hadeven fewer than the year preceding it. There was scarcely any musicin the streets, while the agreeable noises of the kitchen were not tobe heard in all the houses, which the youth ascribed to the fact thatfor some time things had been going badly, the sugar did not bring agood price, the rice crops had failed, over half the live stock haddied, but the taxes rose and increased for some inexplicable reason,while the abuses of the Civil Guard became more frequent to kill offthe happiness of the people in the towns.He was just pondering over this when an energetic"Halt!" resounded. They were passing in front of the barracks and oneof the guards had noticed the extinguished lamp of the carromata,which could not go on without it. A hail of insults fell about thepoor cochero, who vainly excused himself with the length of theprocession. He would be arrested for violating the ordinances andafterwards advertised in the newspapers, so the peaceful and prudentBasilio left the carromata and went his way on foot, carrying hisvalise. This was San Diego, his native town, where he had not asingle relative.The only, house wherein there seemed to be any mirth was CapitanBasilio's. Hens and chickens cackled their death chant to theaccompaniment of dry and repeated strokes, as of meat pounded on achopping-block, and the sizzling of grease in the frying-pans. A feastwas going on in the house, and even into the street there passed acertain draught of air, saturated with the succulent odors of stewsand confections. In the entresol Basilio saw Sinang, as small aswhen our readers knew her before, [14] although a little rounder andplumper since her marriage. Then to his great surprise he made out,further in at the back of the room, chatting with Capitan Basilio,the curate, and the alferez of the Civil Guard, no less than thejeweler Simoun, as ever with his blue goggles and his nonchalant air."It's understood, Senor Simoun," Capitan Basilio was saying, "thatwe'll go to Tiani to see your jewels.""I would also go," remarked the alferez, "because I need a watch-chain,but I'm so busy--if Capitan Basilio would undertake--"Capitan Basilio would do so with the greatest pleasure, and ashe wished to propitiate the soldier in order that he might not bemolested in the persons of his laborers, he refused to accept themoney which the alferez was trying to get out of his pocket."It's my Christmas gift!""I can't allow you, Capitan, I can't permit it!""All right! We'll settle up afterwards," replied Capitan Basilio witha lordly gesture.Also, the curate wanted a pair of lady's earrings and requested thecapitan to buy them for him. "I want them first class. Later we'llfix up the account.""Don't worry about that, Padre," said the good man, who wished to beat peace with the Church also. An unfavorable report on the curate'spart could do him great damage and cause him double the expense,for those earrings were a forced present. Simoun in the meantime waspraising his jewels."That fellow is fierce!" mused the student. "He does businesseverywhere. And if I can believe _a certain person,_ he buys from somegentlemen for a half of their value the same jewels that he himselfhas sold for presents. Everybody in this country prospers but us!"He made his way to his house, or rather Capitan Tiago's, now occupiedby a trustworthy man who had held him in great esteem since theday when he had seen him perform a surgical operation with the samecoolness that he would cut up a chicken. This man was now waiting togive him the news. Two of the laborers were prisoners, one was to bedeported, and a number of carabaos had died."The same old story," exclaimed Basilio, in a bad humor. "You alwaysreceive me with the same complaints." The youth was not overbearing,but as he was at times scolded by Capitan Tiago, he liked in his turnto chide those under his orders.The old man cast about for something new. "One of our tenants has died,the old fellow who took care of the woods, and the curate refused tobury him as a pauper, saying that his master is a rich man.""What did he die of?""Of old age.""Get out! To die of old age! It must at least have been somedisease." Basilio in his zeal for making autopsies wanted diseases."Haven't you anything new to tell me? You take away my appetiterelating the same old things. Do you know anything of Sagpang?"The old man then told him about the kidnapping of CabesangTales. Basilio became thoughtful and said nothing more--his appetitehad completely left him.CHAPTER VIBASILIOWhen the bells began their chimes for the midnight mass and those whopreferred a good sleep to fiestas and ceremonies arose grumbling atthe noise and movement, Basilio cautiously left the house, took twoor three turns through the streets to see that he was not watchedor followed, and then made his way by unfrequented paths to the roadthat led to the ancient wood of the Ibarras, which had been acquiredby Capitan Tiago when their property was confiscated and sold. AsChristmas fell under the waning moon that year, the place was wrappedin darkness. The chimes had ceased, and only the tolling soundedthrough the darkness of the night amid the murmur of the breeze-stirredbranches and the measured roar of the waves on the neighboring lake,like the deep respiration of nature sunk in profound sleep.Awed by the time and place, the youth moved along with his head down,as if endeavoring to see through the darkness. But from time to timehe raised it to gaze at the stars through the open spaces between thetreetops and went forward parting the bushes or tearing away the lianasthat obstructed his path. At times he retraced his steps, his footwould get caught among the plants, he stumbled over a projecting rootor a fallen log. At the end of a half-hour he reached a small brook onthe opposite side of which arose a hillock, a black and shapeless massthat in the darkness took on the proportions of a mountain. Basiliocrossed the brook on the stones that showed black against the shiningsurface of the water, ascended the hill, and made his way to a smallspace enclosed by old and crumbling walls. He approached the baletetree that rose in the center, huge, mysterious, venerable, formed ofroots that extended up and down among the confusedly-interlaced trunks.Pausing before a heap of stones he took off his hat and seemed to bepraying. There his mother was buried, and every time he came to thetown his first visit was to that neglected and unknown grave. Since hemust visit Cabesang Tales' family the next day, he had taken advantageof the night to perform this duty. Seated on a stone, he seemed to fallinto deep thought. His past rose before him like a long black film,rosy at first, then shadowy with spots of blood, then black, black,gray, and then light, ever lighter. The end could not be seen, hiddenas it was by a cloud through which shone lights and the hues of dawn.Thirteen years before to the day, almost to the hour, his motherhad died there in the deepest distress, on a glorious night when themoon shone brightly and the Christians of the world were engaged inrejoicing. Wounded and limping, he had reached there in pursuit ofher--she mad and terrified, fleeing from her son as from a ghost. Thereshe had died, and there had come a stranger who had commanded him tobuild a funeral pyre. He had obeyed mechanically and when he returnedhe found a second stranger by the side of the other's corpse. Whata night and what a morning those were! The stranger helped him raisethe pyre, whereon they burned the corpse of the first, dug the gravein which they buried his mother, and then after giving him some piecesof money told him to leave the place. It was the first time that he hadseen that man--tall, with blood-shot eyes, pale lips, and a sharp nose.Entirely alone in the world, without parents or brothers and sisters,he left the town whose authorities inspired in him such great fear andwent to Manila to work in some rich house and study at the same time,as many do. His journey was an Odyssey of sleeplessness and startlingsurprises, in which hunger counted for little, for he ate the fruitsin the woods, whither he retreated whenever he made out from afar theuniform of the Civil Guard, a sight that recalled the origin of allhis misfortunes. Once in Manila, ragged and sick, he went from doorto door offering his services. A boy from the provinces who knew nota single word of Spanish, and sickly besides! Discouraged, hungry, andmiserable, he wandered about the streets, attracting attention by thewretchedness of his clothing. How often was he tempted to throw himselfunder the feet of the horses that flashed by, drawing carriages shiningwith silver and varnish, thus to end his misery at once! Fortunately,he saw Capitan Tiago, accompanied by Aunt Isabel. He had known themsince the days in San Diego, and in his joy believed that in them hesaw almost fellow-townsfolk. He followed the carriage until he lostsight of it, and then made inquiries for the house. As it was thevery day that Maria Clara entered the nunnery and Capitan Tiago wasaccordingly depressed, he was admitted as a servant, without pay,but instead with leave to study, if he so wished, in San Juan deLetran. [15]Dirty, poorly dressed, with only a pair of clogs for footwear, atthe end of several months' stay in Manila, he entered the first yearof Latin. On seeing his clothes, his classmates drew away from him,and the professor, a handsome Dominican, never asked him a question,but frowned every time he looked at him. In the eight months thatthe class continued, the only words that passed between them werehis name read from the roll and the daily _adsum_ with which thestudent responded. With what bitterness he left the class eachday, and, guessing the reason for the treatment accorded him, whattears sprang into his eyes and what complaints were stifled in hisheart! How he had wept and sobbed over the grave of his mother,relating to her his hidden sorrows, humiliations, and affronts,when at the approach of Christmas Capitan Tiago had taken him backto San Diego! Yet he memorized the lessons without omitting a comma,although he understood scarcely any part of them. But at length hebecame resigned, noticing that among the three or four hundred in hisclass only about forty merited the honor of being questioned, becausethey attracted the professor's attention by their appearance, someprank, comicality, or other cause. The greater part of the studentscongratulated themselves that they thus escaped the work of thinkingand understanding the subject. "One goes to college, not to learnand study, but to gain credit for the course, so if the book can bememorized, what more can be asked--the year is thus gained." [16]Basilio passed the examinations by answering the solitary questionasked him, like a machine, without stopping or breathing, and in theamusement of the examiners won the passing certificate. His ninecompanions--they were examined in batches of ten in order to savetime--did not have such good luck, but were condemned to repeat theyear of brutalization.In the second year the game-cock that he tended won a large sum and hereceived from Capitan Tiago a big tip, which he immediately investedin the purchase of shoes and a felt hat. With these and the clothesgiven him by his employer, which he made over to fit his person,his appearance became more decent, but did not get beyond that. Insuch a large class a great deal was needed to attract the professor'sattention, and the student who in the first year did not make himselfknown by some special quality, or did not capture the good-will of theprofessors, could with difficulty make himself known in the rest of hisschool-days. But Basilio kept on, for perseverance was his chief trait.His fortune seemed to change somewhat when he entered the thirdyear. His professor happened to be a very jolly fellow, fond ofjokes and of making the students laugh, complacent enough in thathe almost always had his favorites recite the lessons--in fact,he was satisfied with anything. At this time Basilio now wore shoesand a clean and well-ironed camisa. As his professor noticed thathe laughed very little at the jokes and that his large eyes seemedto be asking something like an eternal question, he took him fora fool, and one day decided to make him conspicuous by callingon him for the lesson. Basilio recited it from beginning to end,without hesitating over a single letter, so the professor called hima parrot and told a story to make the class laugh. Then to increasethe hilarity and justify the epithet he asked several questions,at the same time winking to his favorites, as if to say to them,"You'll see how we're going to amuse ourselves."Basilio now understood Spanish and answered the questions with theplain intention of making no one laugh. This disgusted everybody,the expected absurdity did not materialize, no one could laugh, andthe good friar never pardoned him for having defrauded the hopes ofthe class and disappointed his own prophecies. But who would expectanything worth while to come from a head so badly combed and placed onan Indian poorly shod, classified until recently among the arborealanimals? As in other centers of learning, where the teachers arehonestly desirous that the students should learn, such discoveriesusually delight the instructors, so in a college managed by menconvinced that for the most part knowledge is an evil, at least forthe students, the episode of Basilio produced a bad impression andhe was not questioned again during the year. Why should he be, whenhe made no one laugh?Quite discouraged and thinking of abandoning his studies, he passedto the fourth year of Latin. Why study at all, why not sleep likethe others and trust to luck?One of the two professors was very popular, beloved by all, passingfor a sage, a great poet, and a man of advanced ideas. One day whenhe accompanied the collegians on their walk, he had a dispute withsome cadets, which resulted in a skirmish and a challenge. No doubtrecalling his brilliant youth, the professor preached a crusade andpromised good marks to all who during the promenade on the followingSunday would take part in the fray. The week was a lively one--therewere occasional encounters in which canes and sabers were crossed,and in one of these Basilio distinguished himself. Borne in triumphby the students and presented to the professor, he thus became knownto him and came to be his favorite. Partly for this reason and partlyfrom his diligence, that year he received the highest marks, medalsincluded, in view of which Capitan Tiago, who, since his daughterhad become a nun, exhibited some aversion to the friars, in a fit ofgood humor induced him to transfer to the Ateneo Municipal, the fameof which was then in its apogee.Here a new world opened before his eyes--a system of instructionthat he had never dreamed of. Except for a few superfluities and somechildish things, he was filled with admiration for the methods thereused and with gratitude for the zeal of the instructors. His eyes attimes filled with tears when he thought of the four previous yearsduring which, from lack of means, he had been unable to study at thatcenter. He had to make extraordinary efforts to get himself to thelevel of those who had had a good preparatory course, and it might besaid that in that one year he learned the whole five of the secondarycurricula. He received his bachelor's degree, to the great satisfactionof his instructors, who in the examinations showed themselves to beproud of him before the Dominican examiners sent there to inspect theschool. One of these, as if to dampen such great enthusiasm a little,asked him where he had studied the first years of Latin."In San Juan de Letran, Padre," answered Basilio."Aha! Of course! He's not bad,--in Latin," the Dominican then remarkedwith a slight smile.From choice and temperament he selected the course in medicine. CapitanTiago preferred the law, in order that he might have a lawyer free,but knowledge of the laws is not sufficient to secure clientagein the Philippines--it is necessary to win the cases, and for thisfriendships are required, influence in certain spheres, a good deal ofastuteness. Capitan Tiago finally gave in, remembering that medicalstudents get on intimate terms with corpses, and for some time hehad been seeking a poison to put on the gaffs of his game-cocks,the best he had been able to secure thus far being the blood of aChinaman who had died of syphilis.With equal diligence, or more if possible, the young man continuedthis course, and after the third year began to render medical serviceswith such great success that he was not only preparing a brilliantfuture for himself but also earning enough to dress well and savesome money. This was the last year of the course and in two months hewould be a physician; he would come back to the town, he would marryJuliana, and they would be happy. The granting of his licentiateshipwas not only assured, but he expected it to be the crowning act ofhis school-days, for he had been designated to deliver the valedictoryat the graduation, and already he saw himself in the rostrum, beforethe whole faculty, the object of public attention. All those heads,leaders of Manila science, half-hidden in their colored capes; allthe women who came there out of curiosity and who years before hadgazed at him, if not with disdain, at least with indifference; allthose men whose carriages had once been about to crush him down in themud like a dog: they would listen attentively, and he was going tosay something to them that would not be trivial, something that hadnever before resounded in that place, he was going to forget himselfin order to aid the poor students of the future--and he would makehis entrance on his work in the world with that speech.CHAPTER VIISIMOUNOver these matters Basilio was pondering as he visited his mother'sgrave. He was about to start back to the town when he thought he sawa light flickering among the trees and heard the snapping of twigs,the sound of feet, and rustling of leaves. The light disappearedbut the noises became more distinct, coming directly toward where hewas. Basilio was not naturally superstitious, especially after havingcarved up so many corpses and watched beside so many death-beds,but the old legends about that ghostly spot, the hour, the darkness,the melancholy sighing of the wind, and certain tales heard in hischildhood, asserted their influence over his mind and made his heartbeat violently.The figure stopped on the other side of the balete, but the youthcould see it through an open space between two roots that had grownin the course of time to the proportions of tree-trunks. It producedfrom under its coat a lantern with a powerful reflecting lens, whichit placed on the ground, thereby lighting up a pair of riding-boots,the rest of the figure remaining concealed in the darkness. The figureseemed to search its pockets and then bent over to fix a shovel-bladeon the end of a stout cane. To his great surprise Basilio thought hecould make out some of the features of the jeweler Simoun, who indeedit was.The jeweler dug in the ground and from time to time the lanternilluminated his face, on which were not now the blue goggles that socompletely disguised him. Basilio shuddered: that was the same strangerwho thirteen years before had dug his mother's grave there, only nowhe had aged somewhat, his hair had turned white, he wore a beard anda mustache, but yet his look was the same, the bitter expression,the same cloud on his brow, the same muscular arms, though somewhatthinner now, the same violent energy. Old impressions were stirredin the boy: he seemed to feel the heat of the fire, the hunger, theweariness of that time, the smell of freshly turned earth. Yet hisdiscovery terrified him--that jeweler Simoun, who passed for a BritishIndian, a Portuguese, an American, a mulatto, the Brown Cardinal, hisBlack Eminence, the evil genius of the Captain-General as many calledhim, was no other than the mysterious stranger whose appearance anddisappearance coincided with the death of the heir to that land! Butof the two strangers who had appeared, which was Ibarra, the livingor the dead?This question, which he had often asked himself whenever Ibarra's deathwas mentioned, again came into his mind in the presence of the humanenigma he now saw before him. The dead man had had two wounds, whichmust have been made by firearms, as he knew from what he had sincestudied, and which would be the result of the chase on the lake. Thenthe dead man must have been Ibarra, who had come to die at the tombof his forefathers, his desire to be cremated being explained by hisresidence in Europe, where cremation is practised. Then who was theother, the living, this jeweler Simoun, at that time with such anappearance of poverty and wretchedness, but who had now returnedloaded with gold and a friend of the authorities? There was themystery, and the student, with his characteristic cold-bloodedness,determined to clear it up at the first opportunity.Simoun dug away for some time, but Basilio noticed that his old vigorhad declined--he panted and had to rest every few moments. Fearingthat he might be discovered, the boy made a sudden resolution. Risingfrom his seat and issuing from his hiding-place, he asked in the mostmatter-of-fact tone, "Can I help you, sir?"Simoun straightened up with the spring of a tiger attacked at hisprey, thrust his hand in his coat pocket, and stared at the studentwith a pale and lowering gaze."Thirteen years ago you rendered me a great service, sir," went onBasilio unmoved, "in this very place, by burying my mother, and Ishould consider myself happy if I could serve you now."Without taking his eyes off the youth Simoun drew a revolver fromhis pocket and the click of a hammer being cocked was heard. "Forwhom do you take me?" he asked, retreating a few paces."For a person who is sacred to me," replied Basilio with some emotion,for he thought his last moment had come. "For a person whom all, exceptme, believe to be dead, and whose misfortunes I have always lamented."An impressive silence followed these words, a silence that to theyouth seemed to suggest eternity. But Simoun, after some hesitation,approached him and placing a hand on his shoulder said in a movingtone: "Basilio, you possess a secret that can ruin me and now you havejust surprised me in another, which puts me completely in your hands,the divulging of which would upset all my plans. For my own securityand for the good of the cause in which I labor, I ought to seal yourlips forever, for what is the life of one man compared to the end Iseek? The occasion is fitting; no one knows that I have come here;I am armed; you are defenceless; your death would be attributed tothe outlaws, if not to more supernatural causes--yet I'll let youlive and trust that I shall not regret it. You have toiled, you havestruggled with energetic perseverance, and like myself, you have yourscores to settle with society. Your brother was murdered, your motherdriven to insanity, and society has prosecuted neither the assassinnor the executioner. You and I are the dregs of justice and insteadof destroying we ought to aid each other."Simoun paused with a repressed sigh, and then slowly resumed, whilehis gaze wandered about: "Yes, I am he who came here thirteen yearsago, sick and wretched, to pay the last tribute to a great and noblesoul that was willing to die for me. The victim of a vicious system, Ihave wandered over the world, working night and day to amass a fortuneand carry out my plan. Now I have returned to destroy that system,to precipitate its downfall, to hurl it into the abyss toward whichit is senselessly rushing, even though I may have to shed oceansof tears and blood. It has condemned itself, it stands condemned,and I don't want to die before I have seen it in fragments at thefoot of the precipice!"Simoun extended both his arms toward the earth, as if with that gesturehe would like to hold there the broken remains. His voice took on asinister, even lugubrious tone, which made the student shudder."Called by the vices of the rulers, I have returned to these islands,and under the cloak of a merchant have visited the towns. My goldhas opened a way for me and wheresoever I have beheld greed in themost execrable forms, sometimes hypocritical, sometimes shameless,sometimes cruel, fatten on the dead organism, like a vulture on acorpse, I have asked myself--why was there not, festering in itsvitals, the corruption, the ptomaine, the poison of the tombs, tokill the foul bird? The corpse was letting itself be consumed, thevulture was gorging itself with meat, and because it was not possiblefor me to give it life so that it might turn against its destroyer,and because the corruption developed slowly, I have stimulated greed,I have abetted it. The cases of injustice and the abuses multipliedthemselves; I have instigated crime and acts of cruelty, so that thepeople might become accustomed to the idea of death. I have stirred uptrouble so that to escape from it some remedy might be found; I haveplaced obstacles in the way of trade so that the country, impoverishedand reduced to misery, might no longer be afraid of anything; I haveexcited desires to plunder the treasury, and as this has not beenenough to bring about a popular uprising, I have wounded the peoplein their most sensitive fiber; I have made the vulture itself insultthe very corpse that it feeds upon and hasten the corruption."Now, when I was about to get the supreme rottenness, the supremefilth, the mixture of such foul products brewing poison, when thegreed was beginning to irritate, in its folly hastening to seizewhatever came to hand, like an old woman caught in a conflagration,here you come with your cries of Hispanism, with chants of confidencein the government, in what cannot come to pass, here you have a bodypalpitating with heat and life, young, pure, vigorous, throbbing withblood, with enthusiasm, suddenly come forth to offer itself again asfresh food!"Ah, youth is ever inexperienced and dreamy, always running afterthe butterflies and flowers! You have united, so that by your effortsyou may bind your fatherland to Spain with garlands of roses when inreality you are forging upon it chains harder than the diamond! Youask for equal rights, the Hispanization of your customs, and you don'tsee that what you are begging for is suicide, the destruction of yournationality, the annihilation of your fatherland, the consecration oftyranny! What will you be in the future? A people without character,a nation without liberty--everything you have will be borrowed, evenyour very defects! You beg for Hispanization, and do not pale withshame when they deny it you! And even if they should grant it to you,what then--what have you gained? At best, a country of pronunciamentos,a land of civil wars, a republic of the greedy and the malcontents,like some of the republics of South America! To what are you tendingnow, with your instruction in Castilian, a pretension that would beridiculous were it not for its deplorable consequences! You wish toadd one more language to the forty odd that are spoken in the islands,so that you may understand one another less and less.""On the contrary," replied Basilio, "if the knowledge of Castilianmay bind us to the government, in exchange it may also unite theislands among themselves.""A gross error!" rejoined Simoun. "You are letting yourselves bedeceived by big words and never go to the bottom of things to examinethe results in their final analysis. Spanish will never be the generallanguage of the country, the people will never talk it, because theconceptions of their brains and the feelings of their hearts cannotbe expressed in that language--each people has its own tongue, as ithas its own way of thinking! What are you going to do with Castilian,the few of you who will speak it? Kill off your own originality,subordinate your thoughts to other brains, and instead of freeingyourselves, make yourselves slaves indeed! Nine-tenths of those ofyou who pretend to be enlightened are renegades to your country! Heamong you who talks that language neglects his own in such a way thathe neither writes nor understands it, and how many have I not seenwho pretended not to know a single word of it! But fortunately, youhave an imbecile government! While Russia enslaves Poland by forcingthe Russian language upon it, while Germany prohibits French in theconquered provinces, your government strives to preserve yours, andyou in return, a remarkable people under an incredible government, youare trying to despoil yourselves of your own nationality! One and allyou forget that while a people preserves its language, it preservesthe marks of its liberty, as a man preserves his independence whilehe holds to his own way of thinking. Language is the thought of thepeoples. Luckily, your independence is assured; human passions arelooking out for that!"Simoun paused and rubbed his hand over his forehead. The waning moonwas rising and sent its faint light down through the branches of thetrees, and with his white locks and severe features, illuminated frombelow by the lantern, the jeweler appeared to be the fateful spiritof the wood planning some evil.Basilio was silent before such bitter reproaches and listened withbowed head, while Simoun resumed: "I saw this movement started and havepassed whole nights of anguish, because I understood that among thoseyouths there were exceptional minds and hearts, sacrificing themselvesfor what they thought to be a good cause, when in reality they wereworking against their own country. How many times have I wishedto speak to you young men, to reveal myself and undeceive you! Butin view of the reputation I enjoy, my words would have been wronglyinterpreted and would perhaps have had a counter effect. How many timeshave I not longed to approach your Makaraig, your Isagani! SometimesI thought of their death, I wished to destroy them--"Simoun checked himself."Here's why I let you live, Basilio, and by such imprudence I exposemyself to the risk of being some day betrayed by you. But you knowwho I am, you know how much I must have suffered--then believe inme! You are not of the common crowd, which sees in the jeweler Simounthe trader who incites the authorities to commit abuses in order thatthe abused may buy jewels. I am the Judge who wishes to castigatethis system by making use of its own defects, to make war on it byflattering it. I need your help, your influence among the youth, tocombat these senseless desires for Hispanization, for assimilation,for equal rights. By that road you will become only a poor copy,and the people should look higher. It is madness to attempt toinfluence the thoughts of the rulers--they have their plan outlined,the bandage covers their eyes, and besides losing time uselessly, youare deceiving the people with vain hopes and are helping to bend theirnecks before the tyrant. What you should do is to take advantage oftheir prejudices to serve your needs. Are they unwilling that yoube assimilated with the Spanish people? Good enough! Distinguishyourselves then by revealing yourselves in your own character, tryto lay the foundations of the Philippine fatherland! Do they deny youhope? Good! Don't depend on them, depend upon yourselves and work! Dothey deny you representation in their Cortes? So much the better! Evenshould you succeed in sending representatives of your own choice,what are you going to accomplish there except to be overwhelmed amongso many voices, and sanction with your presence the abuses and wrongsthat are afterwards perpetrated? The fewer rights they allow you,the more reason you will have later to throw off the yoke, and returnevil for evil. If they are unwilling to teach you their language,cultivate your own, extend it, preserve to the people their own wayof thinking, and instead of aspiring to be a province, aspire to bea nation! Instead of subordinate thoughts, think independently, tothe end that neither by right, nor custom, nor language, the Spaniardcan be considered the master here, nor even be looked upon as a partof the country, but ever as an invader, a foreigner, and sooner orlater you will have your liberty! Here's why I let you live!"Basilio breathed freely, as though a great weight had been lifted fromhim, and after a brief pause, replied: "Sir, the honor you do me inconfiding your plans to me is too great for me not to be frank withyou, and tell you that what you ask of me is beyond my power. I amno politician, and if I have signed the petition for instruction inCastilian it has been because I saw in it an advantage to our studiesand nothing more. My destiny is different; my aspiration reducesitself to alleviating the physical sufferings of my fellow men."The jeweler smiled. "What are physical sufferings compared to moraltortures? What is the death of a man in the presence of the death of asociety? Some day you will perhaps be a great physician, if they letyou go your way in peace, but greater yet will be he who can injecta new idea into this anemic people! You, what are you doing for theland that gave you existence, that supports your life, that affordsyou knowledge? Don't you realize that that is a useless life which isnot consecrated to a great idea? It is a stone wasted in the fieldswithout becoming a part of any edifice.""No, no, sir!" replied Basilio modestly, "I'm not folding my arms,I'm working like all the rest to raise up from the ruins of the pasta people whose units will be bound together--that each one may feelin himself the conscience and the life of the whole. But howeverenthusiastic our generation may be, we understand that in this greatsocial fabric there must be a division of labor. I have chosen mytask and will devote myself to science.""Science is not the end of man," declared Simoun."The most civilized nations are tending toward it.""Yes, but only as a means of seeking their welfare.""Science is more eternal, it's more human, it's moreuniversal!" exclaimed the youth in a transport of enthusiasm. "Within afew centuries, when humanity has become redeemed and enlightened, whenthere are no races, when all peoples are free, when there are neithertyrants nor slaves, colonies nor mother countries, when justice rulesand man is a citizen of the world, the pursuit of science alone willremain, the word patriotism will be equivalent to fanaticism, and hewho prides himself on patriotic ideas will doubtless be isolated asa dangerous disease, as a menace to the social order."Simoun smiled sadly. "Yes, yes," he said with a shake of his head,"yet to reach that condition it is necessary that there be notyrannical and no enslaved peoples, it is necessary that man go aboutfreely, that he know how to respect the rights of others in their ownindividuality, and for this there is yet much blood to be shed, thestruggle forces itself forward. To overcome the ancient fanaticismthat bound consciences it was necessary that many should perish inthe holocausts, so that the social conscience in horror declaredthe individual conscience free. It is also necessary that all answerthe question which with each day the fatherland asks them, with itsfettered hands extended! Patriotism can only be a crime in a tyrannicalpeople, because then it is rapine under a beautiful name, but howeverperfect humanity may become, patriotism will always be a virtue amongoppressed peoples, because it will at all times mean love of justice,of liberty, of personal dignity--nothing of chimerical dreams, ofeffeminate idyls! The greatness of a man is not in living before histime, a thing almost impossible, but in understanding its desires,in responding to its needs, and in guiding it on its forward way. Thegeniuses that are commonly believed to have existed before their time,only appear so because those who judge them see from a great distance,or take as representative of the age the line of stragglers!"Simoun fell silent. Seeing that he could awake no enthusiasm inthat unresponsive mind, he turned to another subject and asked witha change of tone: "And what are you doing for the memory of yourmother and your brother? Is it enough that you come here every year,to weep like a woman over a grave?" And he smiled sarcastically.The shot hit the mark. Basilio changed color and advanced a step."What do you want me to do?" he asked angrily."Without means, without social position, how may I bring theirmurderers to justice? I would merely be another victim, shattered likea piece of glass hurled against a rock. Ah, you do ill to recall thisto me, since it is wantonly reopening a wound!""But what if I should offer you my aid?"Basilio shook his head and remained pensive. "All the tardyvindications of justice, all the revenge in the world, will not restorea single hair of my mother's head, or recall a smile to my brother'slips. Let them rest in peace--what should I gain now by avenging them?""Prevent others from suffering what you have suffered, that inthe future there be no brothers murdered or mothers driven tomadness. Resignation is not always a virtue; it is a crime when itencourages tyrants: there are no despots where there are no slaves! Manis in his own nature so wicked that he always abuses complaisance. Ithought as you do, and you know what my fate was. Those who causedyour misfortunes are watching you day and night, they suspect thatyou are only biding your time, they take your eagerness to learn,your love of study, your very complaisance, for burning desires forrevenge. The day they can get rid of you they will do with you asthey did with me, and they will not let you grow to manhood, becausethey fear and hate you!""Hate me? Still hate me after the wrong they have done me?" askedthe youth in surprise.Simoun burst into a laugh. "'It is natural for man to hate thosewhom he has wronged,' said Tacitus, confirming the _quos laeserunt etoderunt_ of Seneca. When you wish to gauge the evil or the good thatone people has done to another, you have only to observe whetherit hates or loves. Thus is explained the reason why many who haveenriched themselves here in the high offices they have filled, ontheir return to the Peninsula relieve themselves by slanders andinsults against those who have been their victims. _Proprium humaniingenii est odisse quern laeseris!"_"But if the world is large, if one leaves them to the peacefulenjoyment of power, if I ask only to be allowed to work, to live--""And to rear meek-natured sons to send them afterwards to submit tothe yoke," continued Simoun, cruelly mimicking Basilio's tone. "A finefuture you prepare for them, and they have to thank you for a lifeof humiliation and suffering! Good enough, young man! When a bodyis inert, it is useless to galvanize it. Twenty years of continuousslavery, of systematic humiliation, of constant prostration, finallycreate in the mind a twist that cannot be straightened by the laborof a day. Good and evil instincts are inherited and transmitted fromfather to son. Then let your idylic ideas live, your dreams of aslave who asks only for a bandage to wrap the chain so that it mayrattle less and not ulcerate his skin! You hope for a little homeand some ease, a wife and a handful of rice--here is your ideal manof the Philippines! Well, if they give it to you, consider yourselffortunate."Basilio, accustomed to obey and bear with the caprices and humorsof Capitan Tiago. was now dominated by Simoun, who appeared to himterrible and sinister on a background bathed in tears and blood. Hetried to explain himself by saying that he did not consider himselffit to mix in politics, that he had no political opinions becausehe had never studied the question, but that he was always ready tolend his services the day they might be needed, that for the momenthe saw only one need, the enlightenment of the people.Simoun stopped him with a gesture, and, as the dawn was coming,said to him: "Young man, I am not warning you to keep my secret,because I know that discretion is one of your good qualities, andeven though you might wish to sell me, the jeweler Simoun, the friendof the authorities and of the religious corporations, will alwaysbe given more credit than the student Basilio, already suspectedof filibusterism, and, being a native, so much the more marked andwatched, and because in the profession you are entering upon youwill encounter powerful rivals. After all, even though you have notcorresponded to my hopes, the day on which you change your mind,look me up at my house in the Escolta, and I'll be glad to help you."Basilio thanked him briefly and went away."Have I really made a mistake?" mused Simoun, when he found himselfalone. "Is it that he doubts me and meditates his plan of revengeso secretly that he fears to tell it even in the solitude of thenight? Or can it be that the years of servitude have extinguishedin his heart every human sentiment and there remain only the animaldesires to live and reproduce? In that case the type is deformedand will have to be cast over again. Then the hecatomb is preparing:let the unfit perish and only the strongest survive!"Then he added sadly, as if apostrophizing some one: "Have patience, youwho left me a name and a home, have patience! I have lost all--country,future, prosperity, your very tomb, but have patience! And thou,noble spirit, great soul, generous heart, who didst live with only onethought and didst sacrifice thy life without asking the gratitude orapplause of any one, have patience, have patience! The methods that Iuse may perhaps not be thine, but they are the most direct. The dayis coming, and when it brightens I myself will come to announce itto you who are now indifferent. Have patience!"CHAPTER VIIIMERRY CHRISTMAS!When Juli opened her sorrowing eyes, she saw that the house was stilldark, but the cocks were crowing. Her first thought was that perhapsthe Virgin had performed the miracle and the sun was not going to rise,in spite of the invocations of the cocks. She rose, crossed herself,recited her morning prayers with great devotion, and with as littlenoise as possible went out on the _batalan._There was no miracle--the sun was rising and promised a magnificentmorning, the breeze was delightfully cool, the stars were palingin the east, and the cocks were crowing as if to see who could crowbest and loudest. That had been too much to ask--it were much easierto request the Virgin to send the two hundred and fifty pesos. Whatwould it cost the Mother of the Lord to give them? But underneath theimage she found only the letter of her father asking for the ransom offive hundred pesos. There was nothing to do but go, so, seeing thather grandfather was not stirring, she thought him asleep and beganto prepare breakfast. Strange, she was calm, she even had a desireto laugh! What had she had last night to afflict her so? She was notgoing very far, she could come every second day to visit the house,her grandfather could see her, and as for Basilio, he had known forsome time the bad turn her father's affairs had taken, since he hadoften said to her, "When I'm a physician and we are married, yourfather won't need his fields.""What a fool I was to cry so much," she said to herself as she packedher _tampipi._ Her fingers struck against the locket and she pressedit to her lips, but immediately wiped them from fear of contagion, forthat locket set with diamonds and emeralds had come from a leper. Ah,then, if she should catch that disease she could not get married.As it became lighter, she could see her grandfather seated in acorner, following all her movements with his eyes, so she caught up her_tampipi_ of clothes and approached him smilingly to kiss his hand. Theold man blessed her silently, while she tried to appear merry. "Whenfather comes back, tell him that I have at last gone to college--mymistress talks Spanish. It's the cheapest college I could find."Seeing the old man's eyes fill with tears, she placed the _tampipi_on her head and hastily went downstairs, her slippers slapping merrilyon the wooden steps. But when she turned her head to look again atthe house, the house wherein had faded her childhood dreams and hermaiden illusions, when she saw it sad, lonely, deserted, with thewindows half closed, vacant and dark like a dead man's eyes, whenshe heard the low rustling of the bamboos, and saw them nodding inthe fresh morning breeze as though bidding her farewell, then hervivacity disappeared; she stopped, her eyes filled with tears, andletting herself fall in a sitting posture on a log by the waysideshe broke out into disconsolate tears.Juli had been gone several hours and the sun was quite high overheadwhen Tandang Selo gazed from the window at the people in their festivalgarments going to the town to attend the high mass. Nearly all ledby the hand or carried in their arms a little boy or girl decked outas if for a fiesta.Christmas day in the Philippines is, according to the elders, a fiestafor the children, who are perhaps not of the same opinion and who,it may be supposed, have for it an instinctive dread. They are rousedearly, washed, dressed, and decked out with everything new, dear,and precious that they possess--high silk shoes, big hats, woolen orvelvet suits, without overlooking four or five scapularies, whichcontain texts from St. John, and thus burdened they are carried tothe high mass, where for almost an hour they are subjected to the heatand the human smells from so many crowding, perspiring people, and ifthey are not made to recite the rosary they must remain quiet, bored,or asleep. At each movement or antic that may soil their clothingthey are pinched and scolded, so the fact is that they do not laughor feel happy, while in their round eyes can be read a protest againstso much embroidery and a longing for the old shirt of week-days.Afterwards, they are dragged from house to house to kiss theirrelatives' hands. There they have to dance, sing, and recite allthe amusing things they know, whether in the humor or not, whethercomfortable or not in their fine clothes, with the eternal pinchingsand scoldings if they play any of their tricks. Their relatives givethem cuartos which their parents seize upon and of which they hearnothing more. The only positive results they are accustomed to get fromthe fiesta are the marks of the aforesaid pinchings, the vexations,and at best an attack of indigestion from gorging themselves withcandy and cake in the houses of kind relatives. But such is thecustom, and Filipino children enter the world through these ordeals,which afterwards prove the least sad, the least hard, of their lives.Adult persons who live independently also share in this fiesta,by visiting their parents and their parents' relatives, crookingtheir knees, and wishing them a merry Christmas. Their Christmasgift consists of a sweetmeat, some fruit, a glass of water, or someinsignificant present.Tandang Selo saw all his friends pass and thought sadly that thisyear he had no Christmas gift for anybody, while his granddaughterhad gone without hers, without wishing him a merry Christinas. Wasit delicacy on Juli's part or pure forgetfulness?When he tried to greet the relatives who called on him, bringing theirchildren, he found to his great surprise that he could not articulatea word. Vainly he tried, but no sound could he utter. He placed hishands on his throat, shook his head, but without effect. When he triedto laugh, his lips trembled convulsively and the only noise producedwas a hoarse wheeze like the blowing of bellows.The women gazed at him in consternation. "He's dumb, he's dumb!" theycried in astonishment, raising at once a literal pandemonium.CHAPTER IXPILATESWhen the news of this misfortune became known in the town, somelamented it and others shrugged their shoulders. No one was to blame,and no one need lay it on his conscience.The lieutenant of the Civil Guard gave no sign: he had received anorder to take up all the arms and he had performed his duty. He hadchased the tulisanes whenever he could, and when they captured CabesangTales he had organized an expedition and brought into the town,with their arms bound behind them, five or six rustics who lookedsuspicious, so if Cabesang Tales did not show up it was because hewas not in the pockets or under the skins of the prisoners, who werethoroughly shaken out.The friar-administrator shrugged his shoulders: he had nothing todo with it, it was a matter of tulisanes and he had merely done hisduty. True it was that if he had not entered the complaint, perhaps thearms would not have been taken up, and poor Tales would not have beencaptured; but he, Fray Clemente, had to look after his own safety,and that Tales had a way of staring at him as if picking out a goodtarget in some part of his body. Self-defense is natural. If thereare tulisanes, the fault is not his, it is not his duty to run themdown--that belongs to the Civil Guard. If Cabesang Tales, insteadof wandering about his fields, had stayed at home, he would not havebeen captured. In short, that was a punishment from heaven upon thosewho resisted the demands of his corporation.When Sister Penchang, the pious old woman in whose service Julihad entered, learned of it, she ejaculated several _'Susmarioseps_,crossed herself, and remarked, "Often God sends these trials becausewe are sinners or have sinning relatives, to whom we should havetaught piety and we haven't done so."Those _sinning relatives_ referred to Juliana, for to this piouswoman Juli was a great sinner. "Think of a girl of marriageable agewho doesn't yet know how to pray! _Jesus_, how scandalous! If thewretch doesn't say the _Dios te salve Maria_ without stopping at _escontigo_, and the _Santa Maria_ without a pause after _pecadores_, asevery good Christian who fears God ought to do! She doesn't know the_oremus gratiam_, and says _mentibus_ for _mentibus_. Anybody hearingher would think she was talking about something else. _'Susmariosep!_"Greatly scandalized, she made the sign of the cross and thanked God,who had permitted the capture of the father in order that the daughtermight be snatched from sin and learn the virtues which, accordingto the curates, should adorn every Christian woman. She thereforekept the girl constantly at work, not allowing her to return to thevillage to look after her grandfather. Juli had to learn how to pray,to read the books distributed by the friars, and to work until thetwo hundred and fifty pesos should be paid.When she learned that Basilio had gone to Manila to get his savingsand ransom Juli from her servitude, the good woman believed that thegirl was forever lost and that the devil had presented himself inthe guise of the student. Dreadful as it all was, how true was thatlittle book the curate had given her! Youths who go to Manila tostudy are ruined and then ruin the others. Thinking to rescue Juli,she made her read and re-read the book called _Tandang Basio Macunat_,[17] charging her always to go and see the curate in the convento,[18] as did the heroine, who is so praised by the author, a friar.Meanwhile, the friars had gained their point. They had certainlywon the suit, so they took advantage of Cabesang Tales' captivityto turn the fields over to the one who had asked for them, withoutthe least thought of honor or the faintest twinge of shame. Whenthe former owner returned and learned what had happened, when he sawhis fields in another's possession,--those fields that had cost thelives of his wife and daughter,--when he saw his father dumb and hisdaughter working as a servant, and when he himself received an orderfrom the town council, transmitted through the headman of the village,to move out of the house within three days, he said nothing; he satdown at his father's side and spoke scarcely once during the whole day.CHAPTER XWEALTH AND WANTOn the following day, to the great surprise of the village, the jewelerSimoun, followed by two servants, each carrying a canvas-covered chest,requested the hospitality of Cabesang Tales, who even in the midstof his wretchedness did not forget the good Filipino customs--rather,he was troubled to think that he had no way of properly entertainingthe stranger. But Simoun brought everything with him, servants andprovisions, and merely wished to spend the day and night in the housebecause it was the largest in the village and was situated betweenSan Diego and Tiani, towns where he hoped to find many customers.Simoun secured information about the condition of the roads and askedCabesang Tales if his revolver was a sufficient protection againstthe tulisanes."They have rifles that shoot a long way," was the rather absent-mindedreply."This revolver does no less," remarked Simoun, firing at an areca-palmsome two hundred paces away.Cabesang Tales noticed that some nuts fell, but remained silentand thoughtful.Gradually the families, drawn by the fame of the jeweler's wares,began to collect. They wished one another merry Christmas, theytalked of masses, saints, poor crops, but still were there to spendtheir savings for jewels and trinkets brought from Europe. It wasknown that the jeweler was the friend of the Captain-General, so itwasn't lost labor to get on good terms with him, and thus be preparedfor contingencies.Capitan Basilio came with his wife, daughter, and son-in-law, preparedto spend at least three thousand pesos. Sister Penchang was there tobuy a diamond ring she had promised to the Virgin of Antipolo. Shehad left Juli at home memorizing a booklet the curate had sold her forfour cuartos, with forty days of indulgence granted by the Archbishopto every one who read it or listened to it read."_Jesus!_" said the pious woman to Capitana Tika, "that poor girl hasgrown up like a mushroom planted by the _tikbalang._ I've made her readthe book at the top of her voice at least fifty times and she doesn'tremember a single word of it. She has a head like a sieve--full whenit's in the water. All of us hearing her, even the dogs and cats,have won at least twenty years of indulgence."Simoun arranged his two chests on the table, one being somewhat largerthan the other. "You don't want plated jewelry or imitation gems. Thislady," turning to Sinang, "wants real diamonds.""That's it, yes, sir, diamonds, old diamonds, antique stones, youknow," she responded. "Papa will pay for them, because he likes antiquethings, antique stones." Sinang was accustomed to joke about the greatdeal of Latin her father understood and the little her husband knew."It just happens that I have some antique jewels," replied Simoun,taking the canvas cover from the smaller chest, a polished steelcase with bronze trimmings and stout locks. "I have necklaces ofCleopatra's, real and genuine, discovered in the Pyramids; rings ofRoman senators and knights, found in the ruins of Carthage.""Probably those that Hannibal sent back after the battle ofCannae!" exclaimed Capitan Basilio seriously, while he trembled withpleasure. The good man, thought he had read much about the ancients,had never, by reason of the lack of museums in Filipinas, seen anyof the objects of those times."I have brought besides costly earrings of Roman ladies, discoveredin the villa of Annius Mucius Papilinus in Pompeii."Capitan Easilio nodded to show that he understood and was eager tosee such precious relics. The women remarked that they also wantedthings from Rome, such as rosaries blessed by the Pope, holy relicsthat would take away sins without the need of confessions, and so on.When the chest was opened and the cotton packing removed, there wasexposed a tray filled with rings, reliquaries, lockets, crucifixes,brooches, and such like. The diamonds set in among variously coloredstones flashed out brightly and shimmered among golden flowers ofvaried hues, with petals of enamel, all of peculiar designs and rareArabesque workmanship.Simoun lifted the tray and exhibited another filled with quaint jewelsthat would have satisfied the imaginations of seven debutantes on theeves of the balls in their honor. Designs, one more fantastic thanthe other, combinations of precious stones and pearls worked intothe figures of insects with azure backs and transparent forewings,sapphires, emeralds, rubies, turquoises, diamonds, joined to formdragon-flies, wasps, bees, butterflies, beetles, serpents, lizards,fishes, sprays of flowers. There were diadems, necklaces of pearlsand diamonds, so that some of the girls could not withhold a _naku_of admiration, and Sinang gave a cluck with her tongue, whereuponher mother pinched her to prevent her from encouraging the jewelerto raise his prices, for Capitana Tika still pinched her daughtereven after the latter was married."Here you have some old diamonds," explained the jeweler. "This ringbelonged to the Princess Lamballe and those earrings to one of MarieAntoinette's ladies." They consisted of some beautiful solitairediamonds, as large as grains of corn, with somewhat bluish lights,and pervaded with a severe elegance, as though they still reflectedin their sparkles the shuddering of the Reign of Terror."Those two earrings!" exclaimed Sinang, looking at her father andinstinctively covering the arm next to her mother."Something more ancient yet, something Roman," said Capitan Basiliowith a wink.The pious Sister Penchang thought that with such a gift the Virgin ofAntipolo would be softened and grant her her most vehement desire:for some time she had begged for a wonderful miracle to which hername would be attached, so that her name might be immortalized onearth and she then ascend into heaven, like the Capitana Ines of thecurates. She inquired the price and Simoun asked three thousand pesos,which made the good woman cross herself--_'Susmariosep!_Simoun now exposed the third tray, which was filled with watches,cigar- and match-cases decorated with the rarest enamels, reliquariesset with diamonds and containing the most elegant miniatures.The fourth tray, containing loose gems, stirred a murmur ofadmiration. Sinang again clucked with her tongue, her mother againpinched her, although at the same time herself emitting a _'Susmaria_of wonder.No one there had ever before seen so much wealth. In that chest linedwith dark-blue velvet, arranged in trays, were the wonders of the_Arabian Nights,_ the dreams of Oriental fantasies. Diamonds as largeas peas glittered there, throwing out attractive rays as if they wereabout to melt or burn with all the hues of the spectrum; emeralds fromPeru, of varied forms and shapes; rubies from India, red as drops ofblood; sapphires from Ceylon, blue and white; turquoises from Persia;Oriental pearls, some rosy, some lead-colored, others black. Thosewho have at night seen a great rocket burst in the azure darkness ofthe sky into thousands of colored lights, so bright that they makethe eternal stars look dim, can imagine the aspect the tray presented.As if to increase the admiration of the beholders, Simoun took thestones out with his tapering brown fingers, gloating over theircrystalline hardness, their luminous stream, as they poured from hishands like drops of water reflecting the tints of the rainbow. Thereflections from so many facets, the thought of their great value,fascinated the gaze of every one.Cabesang Tales, who had approached out of curiosity, closed his eyesand drew back hurriedly, as if to drive away an evil thought. Suchgreat riches were an insult to his misfortunes; that man had come thereto make an exhibition of his immense wealth on the very day that he,Tales, for lack of money, for lack of protectors, had to abandon thehouse raised by his own hands."Here you have two black diamonds, among the largest in existence,"explained the jeweler. "They're very difficult to cut because they'rethe very hardest. This somewhat rosy stone is also a diamond, as isthis green one that many take for an emerald. Quiroga the Chinamanoffered me six thousand pesos for it in order to present it to a veryinfluential lady, and yet it is not the green ones that are the mostvaluable, but these blue ones."He selected three stones of no great size, but thick and well-cut,of a delicate azure tint."For all that they are smaller than the green," he continued,"they cost twice as much. Look at this one, the smallest of all,weighing not more than two carats, which cost me twenty thousandpesos and which I won't sell for less than thirty. I had to make aspecial trip to buy it. This other one, from the mines of Golconda,weighs three and a half carats and is worth over seventy thousand. TheViceroy of India, in a letter I received the day before yesterday,offers me twelve thousand pounds sterling for it."Before such great wealth, all under the power of that man who talkedso unaffectedly, the spectators felt a kind of awe mingled withdread. Sinang clucked several times and her mother did not pinchher, perhaps because she too was overcome, or perhaps because shereflected that a jeweler like Simoun was not going to try to gainfive pesos more or less as a result of an exclamation more or lessindiscreet. All gazed at the gems, but no one showed any desire tohandle them, they were so awe-inspiring. Curiosity was blunted bywonder. Cabesang Tales stared out into the field, thinking that witha single diamond, perhaps the very smallest there, he could recoverhis daughter, keep his house, and perhaps rent another farm. Couldit be that those gems were worth more than a man's home, the safetyof a maiden, the peace of an old man in his declining days?As if he guessed the thought, Simoun remarked to those about him: "Lookhere--with one of these little blue stones, which appear so innocentand inoffensive, pure as sparks scattered over the arch of heaven,with one of these, seasonably presented, a man was able to have hisenemy deported, the father of a family, as a disturber of the peace;and with this other little one like it, red as one's heart-blood,as the feeling of revenge, and bright as an orphan's tears, he wasrestored to liberty, the man was returned to his home, the father tohis children, the husband to the wife, and a whole family saved froma wretched future."He slapped the chest and went on in a loud tone in bad Tagalog: "HereI have, as in a medicine-chest, life and death, poison and balm,and with this handful I can drive to tears all the inhabitants ofthe Philippines!"The listeners gazed at him awe-struck, knowing him to be right. Inhis voice there could be detected a strange ring, while sinisterflashes seemed to issue from behind the blue goggles.Then as if to relieve the strain of the impression made by the gems onsuch simple folk, he lifted up the tray and exposed at the bottom the_sanctum sanctorum_. Cases of Russian leather, separated by layers ofcotton, covered a bottom lined with gray velvet. All expected wonders,and Sinang's husband thought he saw carbuncles, gems that flashedfire and shone in the midst of the shadows. Capitan Basilio was onthe threshold of immortality: he was going to behold something real,something beyond his dreams."This was a necklace of Cleopatra's," said Simoun, taking out carefullya flat case in the shape of a half-moon. "It's a jewel that can't beappraised, an object for a museum, only for a rich government."It was a necklace fashioned of bits of gold representing little idolsamong green and blue beetles, with a vulture's head made from a singlepiece of rare jasper at the center between two extended wings--thesymbol and decoration of Egyptian queens.Sinang turned up her nose and made a grimace of childish depreciation,while Capitan Basilio, with all his love for antiquity, could notrestrain an exclamation of disappointment."It's a magnificent jewel, well-preserved, almost two thousandyears old.""Pshaw!" Sinang made haste to exclaim, to prevent her father's fallinginto temptation."Fool!" he chided her, after overcoming his first disappointment. "Howdo you know but that to this necklace is due the present conditionof the world? With this Cleopatra may have captivated Caesar, MarkAntony! This has heard the burning declarations of love from thegreatest warriors of their time, it has listened to speeches in thepurest and most elegant Latin, and yet you would want to wear it!""I? I wouldn't give three pesos for it.""You could give twenty, silly," said Capitana Tika in a judicialtone. "The gold is good and melted down would serve for other jewelry.""This is a ring that must have belonged to Sulla," continued Simoun,exhibiting a heavy ring of solid gold with a seal on it."With that he must have signed the death-wrarrants during hisdictatorship!" exclaimed Capitan Basilio, pale with emotion. Heexamined it and tried to decipher the seal, but though he turnedit over and over he did not understand paleography, so he could notread it."What a finger Sulla had!" he observed finally. "This would fit twoof ours--as I've said, we're degenerating!""I still have many other jewels--""If they're all that kind, never mind!" interrupted Sinang. "I thinkI prefer the modern."Each one selected some piece of jewelry, one a ring, another a watch,another a locket. Capitana Tika bought a reliquary that contained afragment of the stone on which Our Saviour rested at his third fall;Sinang a pair of earrings; and Capitan Basilio the watch-chain forthe alferez, the lady's earrings for the curate, and other gifts. Thefamilies from the town of Tiani, not to be outdone by those of SanDiego, in like manner emptied their purses.Simoun bought or exchanged old jewelry, brought there by economicalmothers, to whom it was no longer of use."You, haven't you something to sell?" he asked Cabesang Tales,noticing the latter watching the sales and exchanges with covetouseyes, but the reply was that all his daughter's jewels had been sold,nothing of value remained."What about Maria Clara's locket?" inquired Sinang."True!" the man exclaimed, and his eyes blazed for a moment."It's a locket set with diamonds and emeralds," Sinang told thejeweler. "My old friend wore it before she became a nun."Simoun said nothing, but anxiously watched Cabesang Tales, who, afteropening several boxes, found the locket. He examined it carefully,opening and shutting it repeatedly. It was the same locket that MariaClara had worn during the fiesta in San Diego and which she had ina moment of compassion given to a leper."I like the design," said Simoun. "How much do you want for it?"Cabesang Tales scratched his head in perplexity, then his ear, thenlooked at the women."I've taken a fancy to this locket," Simoun went on. "Will you take ahundred, five hundred pesos? Do you want to exchange it for somethingelse? Take your choice here!"Tales stared foolishly at Simoun, as if in doubt of what heheard. "Five hundred pesos?" he murmured."Five hundred," repeated the jeweler in a voice shaking with emotion.Cabesang Tales took the locket and made several turns about the room,with his heart beating violently and his hands trembling. Dared he askmore? That locket could save him, this was an excellent opportunity,such as might not again present itself.The women winked at him to encourage him to make the sale, exceptingPenchang, who, fearing that Juli would be ransomed, observed piously:"I would keep it as a relic. Those who have seen Maria Clara in thenunnery say she has got so thin and weak that she can scarcely talkand it's thought that she'll die a saint. Padre Salvi speaks veryhighly of her and he's her confessor. That's why Juli didn't wantito give it up, but rather preferred to pawn herself."This speech had its effect--the thought of his daughter restrainedTales. "If you will allow me," he said, "I'll go to the town toconsult my daughter. I'll be back before night."This was agreed upon and Tales set out at once. But when he foundhimself outside of the village, he made out at a distance, on a path,that entered the woods, the friar-administrator and a man whom herecognized as the usurper of his land. A husband seeing his wifeenter a private room with another man could not feel more wrath orjealousy than Cabesang Tales experienced when he saw them movingover his fields, the fields cleared by him, which he had thought toleave to his children. It seemed to him that they were mocking him,laughing at his powerlessness. There flashed into his memory what hehad said about never giving up his fields except to him who irrigatedthem with his own blood and buried in them his wife and daughter.He stopped, rubbed his hand over his forehead, and shut his eyes. Whenhe again opened them, he saw that the man had turned to laugh andthat the friar had caught his sides as though to save himself frombursting with merriment, then he saw them point toward his house andlaugh again.A buzz sounded in his ears, he felt the crack of a whip around hischest, the red mist reappeared before his eyes, he again saw thecorpses of his wife and daughter, and beside them the usurper withthe friar laughing and holding his sides. Forgetting everything else,he turned aside into the path they had taken, the one leading tohis fields.Simoun waited in vain for Cabesang Tales to return that night. Butthe next morning when he arose he noticed that the leather holster ofhis revolver was empty. Opening it he found inside a scrap of paperwrapped around the locket set with emeralds and diamonds, with thesefew lines written on it in Tagalog:    "Pardon, sir, that in my own house I relieve you of what    belongs to you, but necessity drives me to it. In exchange    for your revolver I leave the locket you desired so much. I    need the weapon, for I am going out to join the tulisanes.    "I advise you not to keep on your present road, because if    you fall into our power, not then being my guest, we will    require of you a large ransom.        Telesforo Juan de Dios.""At last I've found my man!" muttered Simoun with a deep breath. "He'ssomewhat scrupulous, but so much the better--he'll keep his promises."He then ordered a servant to go by boat over the lake to Los Banos withthe larger chest and await him there. He would go on overland, takingthe smaller chest, the one containing his famous jewels. The arrivalof four civil-guards completed his good humor. They came to arrestCabesang Tales and not finding him took Tandang Selo away instead.Three murders had been committed during the night. Thefriar-administrator and the new tenant of Cabesang Tales' land hadbeen found dead, with their heads split open and their mouths fullof earth, on the border of the fields. In the town the wife of theusurper was found dead at dawn, her mouth also filled with earth andher throat cut, with a fragment of paper beside her, on which wasthe name _Tales_, written in blood as though traced by a finger.Calm yourselves, peaceful inhabitants of Kalamba! None of you arenamed Tales, none of you have committed any crime! You are calledLuis Habana, Matias Belarmino, Nicasio Eigasani, Cayetano de Jesus,Mateo Elejorde, Leandro Lopez, Antonino Lopez, Silvestre Ubaldo,Manuel Hidalgo, Paciano Mercado, your name is the whole village ofKalamba. [19] You cleared your fields, on them you have spent thelabor of your whole lives, your savings, your vigils and privations,and you have been despoiled of them, driven from your homes, with therest forbidden to show you hospitality! Not content with outragingjustice, they [20] have trampled upon the sacred traditions of yourcountry! You have served Spain and the King, and when in their nameyou have asked for justice, you were banished without trial, tornfrom your wives' arms and your children's caresses! Any one of you hassuffered more than Cabesang Tales, and yet none, not one of you, hasreceived justice! Neither pity nor humanity has been shown you--youhave been persecuted beyond the tomb, as was Mariano Herbosa! [21]Weep or laugh, there in those lonely isles where you wander vaguely,uncertain of the future! Spain, the generous Spain, is watching overyou, and sooner or later you will have justice!CHAPTER XILOS BANOSHis Excellency, the Captain-General and Governor of the PhilippineIslands, had been hunting in Bosoboso. But as he had to beaccompanied by a band of music,--since such an exalted personagewas not to be esteemed less than the wooden images carried in theprocessions,--and as devotion to the divine art of St. Cecilia hasnot yet been popularized among the deer and wild boars of Bosoboso,his Excellency, with the band of music and train of friars, soldiers,and clerks, had not been able to catch a single rat or a solitary bird.The provincial authorities foresaw dismissals and transfers, the poorgobernadorcillos and cabezas de barangay were restless and sleepless,fearing that the mighty hunter in his wrath might have a notion to makeup with their persons for the lack of submissiveness on the part of thebeasts of the forest, as had been done years before by an alcalde whohad traveled on the shoulders of impressed porters because he found nohorses gentle enough to guarantee his safety. There was not lackingan evil rumor that his Excellency had decided to take some action,since in this he saw the first symptoms of a rebellion which should bestrangled in its infancy, that a fruitless hunt hurt the prestige ofthe Spanish name, that he already had his eye on a wretch to be dressedup as a deer, when his Excellency, with clemency that Ben-Zayb lackedwords to extol sufficiently, dispelled all the fears by declaring thatit pained him to sacrifice to his pleasure the beasts of the forest.But to tell the truth, his Excellency was secretly very well satisfied,for what would have happened had he missed a shot at a deer, one ofthose not familiar with political etiquette? What would the prestigeof the sovereign power have come to then? A Captain-General of thePhilippines missing a shot, like a raw hunter? What would have beensaid by the Indians, among whom there were some fair huntsmen? Theintegrity of the fatherland would have been endangered.So it was that his Excellency, with a sheepish smile, and posing as adisappointed hunter, ordered an immediate return to Los Banos. Duringthe journey he related with an indifferent air his hunting exploitsin this or that forest of the Peninsula, adopting a tone somewhatdepreciative, as suited the case, toward hunting in Filipinas. The bathin Dampalit, the hot springs on the shore of the lake, card-games inthe palace, with an occasional excursion to some neighboring waterfall,or the lake infested with caymans, offered more attractions and fewerrisks to the integrity of the fatherland.Thus on one of the last days of December, his Excellency found himselfin the sala, taking a hand at cards while he awaited the breakfasthour. He had come from the bath, with the usual glass of coconut-milkand its soft meat, so he was in the best of humors for granting favorsand privileges. His good humor was increased by his winning a good manyhands, for Padre Irene and Padre Sibyla, with whom he was playing,were exercising all their skill in secretly trying to lose, to thegreat irritation of Padre Camorra, who on account of his late arrivalonly that morning was not informed as to the game they were playingon the General. The friar-artilleryman was playing in good faith andwith great care, so he turned red and bit his lip every time PadreSibyla seemed inattentive or blundered, but he dared not say a wordby reason of the respect he felt for the Dominican. In exchange hetook his revenge out on Padre Irene, whom he looked upon as a basefawner and despised for his coarseness. Padre Sibyla let him scold,while the humbler Padre Irene tried to excuse himself by rubbing hislong nose. His Excellency was enjoying it and took advantage, likethe good tactician that the Canon hinted he was, of all the mistakesof his opponents. Padre Camorra was ignorant of the fact that acrossthe table they were playing for the intellectual development of theFilipinos, the instruction in Castilian, but had he known it he woulddoubtless have joyfully entered into that _game_.The open balcony admitted the fresh, pure breeze and revealed the lake,whose waters murmured sweetly around the base of the edifice, as ifrendering homage. On the right, at a distance, appeared Talim Island,a deep blue in the midst of the lake, while almost in front lay thegreen and deserted islet of Kalamba, in the shape of a half-moon. Tothe left the picturesque shores were fringed with clumps of bamboo,then a hill overlooking the lake, with wide ricefields beyond, thenred roofs amid the deep green of the trees,--the town of Kalamba,--andbeyond the shore-line fading into the distance, with the horizon atthe back closing down over the water, giving the lake the appearanceof a sea and justifying the name the Indians give it of _dagat natabang_, or fresh-water sea.At the end of the sala, seated before a table covered with documents,was the secretary. His Excellency was a great worker and did notlike to lose time, so he attended to business in the intervals ofthe game or while dealing the cards. Meanwhile, the bored secretaryyawned and despaired. That morning he had worked, as usual, overtransfers, suspensions of employees, deportations, pardons, and thelike, but had not yet touched the great question that had stirred somuch interest--the petition of the students requesting permission toestablish an academy of Castilian. Pacing from one end of the room tothe other and conversing animatedly but in low tones were to be seenDon Custodio, a high official, and a friar named Padre Fernandez, whohung his head with an air either of meditation or annoyance. From anadjoining room issued the click of balls striking together and burstsof laughter, amid which might be heard the sharp, dry voice of Simoun,who was playing billiards with Ben-Zayb.Suddenly Padre Camorra arose. "The devil with this game, _punales!_"he exclaimed, throwing his cards at Padre Irene's head. "_Punales_,that trick, if not all the others, was assured and we lost bydefault! _Punales!_ The devil with this game!"He explained the situation angrily to all the occupants of the sala,addressing himself especially to the three walking about, as if he hadselected them for judges. The general played thus, he replied withsuch a card, Padre Irene had a certain card; he led, and then thatfool of a Padre Irene didn't play his card! Padre Irene was givingthe game away! It was a devil of a way to play! His mother's son hadnot come here to rack his brains for nothing and lose his money!Then he added, turning very red, "If the booby thinks my money growson every bush!... On top of the fact that my Indians are beginning tohaggle over payments!" Fuming, and disregarding the excuses of PadreIrene, who tried to explain while he rubbed the tip of his beak inorder to conceal his sly smile, he went into the billiardroom."Padre Fernandez, would you like to take a hand?" asked Fray Sibyla."I'm a very poor player," replied the friar with a grimace."Then get Simoun," said the General. "Eh, Simoun! Eh, Mister, won'tyou try a hand?""What is your disposition concerning the arms for sportingpurposes?" asked the secretary, taking advantage of the pause.Simoun thrust his head through the doorway."Don't you want to take Padre Camorra's place, Senor Sindbad?" inquiredPadre Irene. "You can bet diamonds instead of chips.""I don't care if I do," replied Simoun, advancing while he brushedthe chalk from his hands. "What will you bet?""What should we bet?" returned Padre Sibyla. "The General can betwhat he likes, but we priests, clerics--""Bah!" interrupted Simoun ironically. "You and Padre Irene can paywith deeds of charity, prayers, and virtues, eh?""You know that the virtues a person may possess," gravely arguedPadre Sibyla, "are not like the diamonds that may pass from hand tohand, to be sold and resold. They are inherent in the being, theyare essential attributes of the subject--""I'll be satisfied then if you pay me with promises," replied Simounjestingly. "You, Padre Sibyla, instead of paying me five somethingor other in money, will say, for example: for five days I renouncepoverty, humility, and obedience. You, Padre Irene: I renouncechastity, liberality, and so on. Those are small matters, and I'mputting up my diamonds.""What a peculiar man this Simoun is, what notions he has!" exclaimedPadre Irene with a smile."And _he_," continued Simoun, slapping his Excellency familiarly onthe shoulder, "he will pay me with an order for five days in prison,or five months, or an order of deportation made out in blank, or letus say a summary execution by the Civil Guard while my man is beingconducted from one town to another."This was a strange proposition, so the three who had been pacingabout gathered around."But, Senor Simoun," asked the high official, "what good will youget out of winning promises of virtues, or lives and deportationsand summary executions?""A great deal! I'm tired of hearing virtues talked about and wouldlike to have the whole of them, all there are in the world, tied upin a sack, in order to throw them into the sea, even though I had touse my diamonds for sinkers.""What an idea!" exclaimed Padre Irene with another smile. "And thedeportations and executions, what of them?""Well, to clean the country and destroy every evil seed.""Get out! You're still sore at the tulisanes. But you were luckythat they didn't demand a larger ransom or keep all your jewels. Man,don't be ungrateful!"Simoun proceeded to relate how he had been intercepted by a band oftulisanes, who, after entertaining him for a day, had let him go onhis way without exacting other ransom than his two fine revolvers andthe two boxes of cartridges he carried with him. He added that thetulisanes had charged him with many kind regards for his Excellency,the Captain-General.As a result of this, and as Simoun reported that the tulisanes werewell provided with shotguns, rifles, and revolvers, and against suchpersons one man alone, no matter how well armed, could not defendhimself, his Excellency, to prevent the tulisanes from gettingweapons in the future, was about to dictate a new decree forbiddingthe introduction of sporting arms."On the contrary, on the contrary!" protested Simoun, "for me thetulisanes are the most respectable men in the country, they're theonly ones who earn their living honestly. Suppose I had fallen intothe hands--well, of you yourselves, for example, would you have letme escape without taking half of my jewels, at least?"Don Custodio was on the point of protesting; that Simoun was reallya rude American mulatto taking advantage of his friendship with theCaptain-General to insult Padre Irene, although it may be true alsothat Padre Irene would hardly have set him free for so little."The evil is not," went on Simoun, "in that there are tulisanes inthe mountains and uninhabited parts--the evil lies in the tulisanesin the towns and cities.""Like yourself," put in the Canon with a smile."Yes, like myself, like all of us! Let's be frank, for no Indianis listening to us here," continued the jeweler. "The evil is thatwe're not all openly declared tulisanes. When that happens and we alltake to the woods, on that day the country will be saved, on thatday will rise a new social order which will take care of itself,and his Excellency will be able to play his game in peace, withoutthe necessity of having his attention diverted by his secretary."The person mentioned at that moment yawned, extending his foldedarms above his head and stretching his crossed legs under the tableas far as possible, upon noticing which all laughed. His Excellencywished to change the course of the conversation, so, throwing downthe cards he had been shuffling, he said half seriously: "Come, come,enough of jokes and cards! Let's get to work, to work in earnest,since we still have a half-hour before breakfast. Are there manymatters to be got through with?"All now gave their attention. That was the day for joining battleover the question of instruction in Castilian, for which purposePadre Sibyla and Padre Irene had been there several days. It was knownthat the former, as Vice-Rector, was opposed to the project and thatthe latter supported it, and his activity was in turn supported bythe Countess."What is there, what is there?" asked his Excellency impatiently."The petition about sporting arms," replied the secretary with astifled yawn."Forbidden!""Pardon, General," said the high official gravely, "your Excellencywill permit me to invite your attention to the fact that the use ofsporting arms is permitted in all the countries of the world."The General shrugged his shoulders and remarked dryly, "We are notimitating any nation in the world."Between his Excellency and the high official there was always adifference of opinion, so it was sufficient that the latter offerany suggestion whatsoever to have the former remain stubborn.The high official tried another tack. "Sporting arms can harm onlyrats and chickens. They'll say--""But are we chickens?" interrupted the General, again shrugging hisshoulders. "Am I? I've demonstrated that I'm not.""But there's another thing," observed the secretary. "Four months ago,when the possession of arms was prohibited, the foreign importerswere assured that sporting arms would be admitted."His Excellency knitted his brows."That can be arranged," suggested Simoun."How?""Very simply. Sporting arms nearly all have a caliber of sixmillimeters, at least those now in the market. Authorize only thesale of those that haven't these six millimeters."All approved this idea of Simoun's, except the high official, whomuttered into Padre Fernandez's ear that this was not dignified,nor was it the way to govern."The schoolmaster of Tiani," proceeded the secretary, shuffling somepapers about, "asks for a better location for--""What better location can he want than the storehouse that he hasall to himself?" interrupted Padre Camorra, who had returned, havingforgotten about the card-game."He says that it's roofless," replied the secretary, "and that havingpurchased out of his own pocket some maps and pictures, he doesn'twant to expose them to the weather.""But I haven't anything to do with that," muttered his Excellency. "Heshould address the head secretary, [22] the governor of the province,or the nuncio.""I want to tell you," declared Padre Camorra, "that this littleschoolmaster is a discontented filibuster. Just imagine--the hereticteaches that corpses rot just the same, whether buried with great pompor without any! Some day I'm going to punch him!" Here he doubled uphis fists."To tell the truth," observed Padre Sibyla, as if speaking only toPadre Irene, "he who wishes to teach, teaches everywhere, in the openair. Socrates taught in the public streets, Plato in the gardens ofthe Academy, even Christ among the mountains and lakes.""I've heard several complaints against this schoolmaster," said hisExcellency, exchanging a glance with Simoun. "I think the best thingwould be to suspend him.""Suspended!" repeated the secretary.The luck of that unfortunate, who had asked for help and receivedhis dismissal, pained the high official and he tried to do somethingfor him."It's certain," he insinuated rather timidly, "that education is notat all well provided for--""I've already decreed large sums for the purchase of supplies,"exclaimed his Excellency haughtily, as if to say, "I've done morethan I ought to have done.""But since suitable locations are lacking, the supplies purchasedget ruined.""Everything can't be done at once," said his Excellency dryly. "Theschoolmasters here are doing wrong in asking for buildings when thosein Spain starve to death. It's great presumption to be better offhere than in the mother country itself!""Filibusterism--""Before everything the fatherland! Before everything else we areSpaniards!" added Ben-Zayb, his eyes glowing with patriotism, but heblushed somewhat when he noticed that he was speaking alone."In the future," decided the General, "all who complain will besuspended.""If my project were accepted--" Don Custodio ventured to remark,as if talking to himself."For the construction of schoolhouses?""It's simple, practical, economical, and, like all my projects,derived from long experience and knowledge of the country. The townswould have schools without costing the government a cuarto.""That's easy," observed the secretary sarcastically. "Compel thetowns to construct them at their own expense," whereupon all laughed."No, sir! No, sir!" cried the exasperated Don Custodio, turningvery red. "The buildings are already constructed and only wait to beutilized. Hygienic, unsurpassable, spacious--"The friars looked at one another uneasily. Would Don Custodio proposethat the churches and conventos be converted into schoolhouses?"Let's hear it," said the General with a frown."Well, General, it's very simple," replied Don Custodio, drawinghimself up and assuming his hollow voice of ceremony. "The schoolsare open only on week-days and the cockpits on holidays. Then convertthese into schoolhouses, at least during the week.""Man, man, man!""What a lovely idea!""What's the matter with you, Don Custodio?""That's a grand suggestion!""That beats them all!""But, gentlemen," cried Don Custodio, in answer to so manyexclamations, "let's be practical--what places are more suitablethan the cockpits? They're large, well constructed, and under acurse for the use to which they are put during the week-days. Froma moral standpoint my project would be acceptable, by serving as akind of expiation and weekly purification of the temple of chance,as we might say.""But the fact remains that sometimes there are cockfights during theweek," objected Padre Camorra, "and it wouldn't be right when thecontractors of the cockpits pay the government--" [23]"Well, on those days close the school!""Man, man!" exclaimed the scandalized Captain-General. "Such an outrageshall never be perpetrated while I govern! To close the schools inorder to gamble! Man, man, I'll resign first!" His Excellency wasreally horrified."But, General, it's better to close them for a few days than formonths.""It would be immoral," observed Padre Irene, more indignant even thanhis Excellency."It's more immoral that vice has good buildings and learningnone. Let's be practical, gentlemen, and not be carried away bysentiment. In politics there's nothing worse than sentiment. Whilefrom humane considerations we forbid the cultivation of opium in ourcolonies, we tolerate the smoking of it, and the result is that wedo not combat the vice but impoverish ourselves.""But remember that it yields to the government, without any effort,more than four hundred and fifty thousand pesos," objected Padre Irene,who was getting more and more on the governmental side."Enough, enough, enough!" exclaimed his Excellency, to end thediscussion. "I have my own plans in this regard and will devote specialattention to the matter of public instruction. Is there anything else?"The secretary looked uneasily toward Padre Sibyla and Padre Irene. Thecat was about to come out of the bag. Both prepared themselves."The petition of the students requesting authorization to open anacademy of Castilian," answered the secretary.A general movement was noted among those in the room. After glancingat one another they fixed their eyes on the General to learn whathis disposition would be. For six months the petition had lain thereawaiting a decision and had become converted into a kind of _casusbelli_ in certain circles. His Excellency had lowered his eyes,as if to keep his thoughts from being read.The silence became embarrassing, as the General understood, so heasked the high official, "What do you think?""What should I think, General?" responded the person addressed, witha shrug of his shoulders and a bitter smile. "What should I thinkbut that the petition is just, very just, and that I am surprisedthat six months should have been taken to consider it.""The fact is that it involves other considerations," said Padre Sibylacoldly, as he half closed his eyes.The high official again shrugged his shoulders, like one who did notcomprehend what those considerations could be."Besides the intemperateness of the demand," went on the Dominican,"besides the fact that it is in the nature of an infringement onour prerogatives--"Padre Sibyla dared not go on, but looked at Simoun."The petition has a somewhat suspicious character," corroboratedthat individual, exchanging a look with the Dominican, who winkedseveral times.Padre Irene noticed these things and realized that his cause wasalmost lost--Simoun was against him."It's a peaceful rebellion, a revolution on stamped paper," addedPadre Sibyla."Revolution? Rebellion?" inquired the high official, staring fromone to the other as if he did not understand what they could mean."It's headed by some young men charged with being too radical andtoo much interested in reforms, not to use stronger terms," remarkedthe secretary, with a look at the Dominican. "Among them is a certainIsagani, a poorly balanced head, nephew of a native priest--""He's a pupil of mine," put in Padre Fernandez, "and I'm much pleasedwith him.""_Punales,_ I like your taste!" exclaimed Padre Camorra. "On thesteamer we nearly had a fight. He's so insolent that when I gave hima shove aside he returned it.""There's also one Makaragui or Makarai--""Makaraig," Padre Irene joined in. "A very pleasant and agreeableyoung man."Then he murmured into the General's ear, "He's the one I've talkedto you about, he's very rich. The Countess recommends him strongly.""Ah!""A medical student, one Basilio--""Of that Basilio, I'll say nothing," observed Padre Irene, raisinghis hands and opening them, as if to say _Dominus vobiscum_. "He'stoo deep for me. I've never succeeded in fathoming what he wants orwhat he is thinking about. It's a pity that Padre Salvi isn't presentto tell us something about his antecedents. I believe that I've heardthat when a boy he got into trouble with the Civil Guard. His fatherwas killed in--I don't remember what disturbance."Simoun smiled faintly, silently, showing his sharp white teeth."Aha! Aha!" said his Excellency nodding. "That's the kind we have! Makea note of that name.""But, General," objected the high official, seeing that the matterwas taking a bad turn, "up to now nothing positive is known againstthese young men. Their position is a very just one, and we have noright to deny it on the ground of mere conjectures. My opinion is thatthe government, by exhibiting confidence in the people and in its ownstability, should grant what is asked, then it could freely revoke thepermission when it saw that its kindness was being abused--reasonsand pretexts would not be wanting, we can watch them. Why causedisaffection among some young men, who later on may feel resentment,when what they ask is commanded by royal decrees?"Padre Irene, Don Custodio, and Padre Fernandez nodded in agreement."But the Indians must not understand Castilian, you know," cried PadreCamorra. "They mustn't learn it, for then they'll enter into argumentswith us, and the Indians must not argue, but obey and pay. They mustn'ttry to interpret the meaning of the laws and the books, they're sotricky and pettifogish! Just as soon as they learn Castilian theybecome enemies of God and of Spain. Just read the _Tandang BasioMacunat_--that's a book! It tells truths like this!" And he held uphis clenched fists.Padre Sibyla rubbed his hand over his tonsure in sign ofimpatience. "One word," he began in the most conciliatory tone, thoughfuming with irritation, "here we're not dealing with the instructionin Castilian alone. Here there is an underhand fight between thestudents and the University of Santo Tomas. If the students win this,our prestige will be trampled in the dirt, they will say that they'vebeaten us and will exult accordingly. Then, good-by to moral strength,good-by to everything! The first dike broken down, who will restrainthis youth? With our fall we do no more than signal your own. Afterus, the government!""_Punales_, that's not so!" exclaimed Padre Camorra. "We'll see firstwho has the biggest fists!"At this point Padre Fernandez, who thus far in the discussion hadmerely contented himself with smiling, began to talk. All gave himtheir attention, for they knew him to be a thoughtful man."Don't take it ill of me, Padre Sibyla, if I differ from your viewof the affair, but it's my peculiar fate to be almost always inopposition to my brethren. I say, then, that we ought not to be sopessimistic. The instruction in Castilian can be allowed without anyrisk whatever, and in order that it may not appear to be a defeatof the University, we Dominicans ought to put forth our efforts andbe the first to rejoice over it--that should be our policy. To whatend are we to be engaged in an everlasting struggle with the people,when after all we are the few and they are the many, when we need themand they do not need us? Wait, Padre Camorra, wait! Admit that now thepeople may be weak and ignorant--I also believe that--but it will notbe true tomorrow or the day after. Tomorrow and the next day they willbe the stronger, they will know what is good for them, and we cannotkeep it from them, just as it is not possible to keep from childrenthe knowledge of many things when they reach a certain age. I say,then, why should we not take advantage of this condition of ignoranceto change our policy completely, to place it upon a basis solid andenduring--on the basis of justice, for example, instead of on the basisof ignorance? There's nothing like being just; that I've always said tomy brethren, but they won't believe me. The Indian idolizes justice,like every race in its youth; he asks for punishment when he hasdone wrong, just as he is exasperated when he has not deserved it. Istheirs a just desire? Then grant it! Let's give them all the schoolsthey want, until they are tired of them. Youth is lazy, and what urgesthem to activity is our opposition. Our bond of prestige, Padre Sibyla,is about worn out, so let's prepare another, the bond of gratitude,for example. Let's not be fools, let's do as the crafty Jesuits--""Padre Fernandez!" Anything could be tolerated by Padre Sibyla exceptto propose the Jesuits to him as a model. Pale and trembling, hebroke out into bitter recrimination. "A Franciscan first! Anythingbefore a Jesuit!" He was beside himself."Oh, oh!""Eh, Padre--"A general discussion broke out, regardless of the Captain-General. Alltalked at once, they yelled, they misunderstood and contradictedone another. Ben-Zayb and Padre Camorra shook their fists in eachother's faces, one talking of simpletons and the other of ink-slingers,Padre Sibyla kept harping on the _Capitulum_, and Padre Fernandez onthe _Summa_ of St. Thomas, until the curate of Los Banos entered toannounce that breakfast was served.His Excellency arose and so ended the discussion. "Well, gentlemen,"he said, "we've worked like niggers and yet we're on a vacation. Someone has said that grave matters should he considered at dessert. I'mentirely of that opinion.""We might get indigestion," remarked the secretary, alluding to theheat of the discussion."Then we'll lay it aside until tomorrow."As they rose the high official whispered to the General, "YourExcellency, the daughter of Cabesang Tales has been here again beggingfor the release of her sick grandfather, who was arrested in placeof her father."His Excellency looked at him with an expression of impatience andrubbed his hand across his broad forehead. "_Carambas_! Can't one beleft to eat his breakfast in peace?""This is the third day she has come. She's a poor girl--""Oh, the devil!" exclaimed Padre Camorra. "I've just thought of it. Ihave something to say to the General about that--that's what I cameover for--to support that girl's petition."The General scratched the back of his ear and said, "Oh, go along! Havethe secretary make out an order to the lieutenant of the Civil Guardfor the old man's release. They sha'n't say that we're not clementand merciful."He looked at Ben-Zayb. The journalist winked.CHAPTER XIIPLACIDO PENITENTEReluctantly, and almost with tearful eyes, Placido Penitente was goingalong the Escolta on his way to the University of Santo Tomas. Ithad hardly been a week since he had come from his town, yet he hadalready written to his mother twice, reiterating his desire to abandonhis studies and go back there to work. His mother answered that heshould have patience, that at the least he must be graduated as abachelor of arts, since it would be unwise to desert his books afterfour years of expense and sacrifices on both their parts.Whence came to Penitente this aversion to study, when he had beenone of the most diligent in the famous college conducted by PadreValerio in Tanawan? There Penitente had been considered one of thebest Latinists and the subtlest disputants, one who could tangle oruntangle the simplest as well as the most abstruse questions. Histownspeople considered him very clever, and his curate, influenced bythat opinion, already classified him as a filibuster--a sure proof thathe was neither foolish nor incapable. His friends could not explainthose desires for abandoning his studies and returning: he had nosweethearts, was not a gambler, hardly knew anything about _hunkian_and rarely tried his luck at the more familiar _revesino_. He didnot believe in the advice of the curates, laughed at _Tandang BasioMacunat_, had plenty of money and good clothes, yet he went to schoolreluctantly and looked with repugnance on his books.On the Bridge of Spain, a bridge whose name alone came from Spain,since even its ironwork came from foreign countries, he fell in withthe long procession of young men on their way to the Walled City totheir respective schools. Some were dressed in the European fashion andwalked rapidly, carrying books and notes, absorbed in thoughts of theirlessons and essays--these were the students of the Ateneo. Those fromSan Juan de Letran were nearly all dressed in the Filipino costume, butwere more numerous and carried fewer books. Those from the Universityare dressed more carefully and elegantly and saunter along carryingcanes instead of books. The collegians of the Philippines are not verynoisy or turbulent. They move along in a preoccupied manner, such thatupon seeing them one would say that before their eyes shone no hope,no smiling future. Even though here and there the line is brightenedby the attractive appearance of the schoolgirls of the _EscuelaMunicipal_, [24] with their sashes across their shoulders and theirbooks in their hands, followed by their servants, yet scarcely a laughresounds or a joke can be heard--nothing of song or jest, at best a fewheavy jokes or scuffles among the smaller boys. The older ones nearlyalways proceed seriously and composedly, like the German students.Placido was proceeding along the Paseo de Magallanes toward thebreach--formerly the gate--of Santo Domingo, when he suddenly felta slap on the shoulder, which made him turn quickly in ill humor."Hello, Penitente! Hello, Penitente!"It was his schoolmate Juanito Pelaez, the _barbero_ or pet of theprofessors, as big a rascal as he could be, with a roguish look anda clownish smile. The son of a Spanish mestizo--a rich merchant inone of the suburbs, who based all his hopes and joys on the boy'stalent--he promised well with his roguery, and, thanks to his customof playing tricks on every one and then hiding behind his companions,he had acquired a peculiar hump, which grew larger whenever he waslaughing over his deviltry."What kind of time did you have, Penitente?" was his question as heagain slapped him on the shoulder."So, so," answered Placido, rather bored. "And you?""Well, it was great! Just imagine--the curate of Tiani invited me tospend the vacation in his town, and I went. Old man, you know PadreCamorra, I suppose? Well, he's a liberal curate, very jolly, frank,very frank, one of those like Padre Paco. As there were pretty girls,we serenaded them all, he with his guitar and songs and I with myviolin. I tell you, old man, we had a great time--there wasn't ahouse we didn't try!"He whispered a few words in Placido's ear and then broke out intolaughter. As the latter exhibited some surprise, he resumed:"I'll swear to it! They can't help themselves, because with agovernmental order you get rid of the father, husband, or brother,and then--merry Christmas! However, we did run up against a littlefool, the sweetheart, I believe, of Basilio, you know? Look, what afool this Basilio is! To have a sweetheart who doesn't know a wordof Spanish, who hasn't any money, and who has been a servant! She'sas shy as she can be, but pretty. Padre Camorra one night started toclub two fellows who were serenading her and I don't know how it washe didn't kill them, yet with all that she was just as shy as ever. Butit'll result for her as it does with all the women, all of them!"Juanito Pelaez laughed with a full mouth, as though he thought thisa glorious thing, while Placido stared at him in disgust."Listen, what did the professor explain yesterday?" asked Juanito,changing the conversation."Yesterday there was no class.""Oho, and the day before yesterday?""Man, it was Thursday!""Right! What an ass I am! Don't you know, Placido, that I'm gettingto be a regular ass? What about Wednesday?""Wednesday? Wait--Wednesday, it was a little wet.""Fine! What about Tuesday, old man?""Tuesday was the professor's nameday and we went to entertain himwith an orchestra, present him flowers and some gifts.""Ah, _carambas!_" exclaimed Juanito, "that I should have forgottenabout it! What an ass I am! Listen, did he ask for me?"Penitente shrugged his shoulders. "I don't know, but they gave hima list of his entertainers.""_Carambas!_ Listen--Monday, what happened?""As it was the first school-day, he called the roll and assigned thelesson--about mirrors. Look, from here to here, by memory, word forword. We jump all this section, we take that." He was pointing outwith his finger in the "Physics" the portions that were to be learned,when suddenly the book flew through the air, as a result of the slapJuanito gave it from below."Thunder, let the lessons go! Let's have a _dia pichido!_"The students in Manila call _dia pichido_ a school-day that fallsbetween two holidays and is consequently suppressed, as though forcedout by their wish."Do you know that you really are an ass?" exclaimed Placido, pickingup his book and papers."Let's have a _dia pichido!_" repeated Juanito.Placido was unwilling, since for only two the authorities were hardlygoing to suspend a class of more than a hundred and fifty. He recalledthe struggles and privations his mother was suffering in order to keephim in Manila, while she went without even the necessities of life.They were just passing through the breach of Santo Domingo, andJuanito, gazing across the little plaza [25] in front of the oldCustoms building, exclaimed, "Now I think of it, I'm appointed totake up the collection.""What collection?""For the monument.""What monument?""Get out! For Padre Balthazar, you know.""And who was Padre Balthazar?""Fool! A Dominican, of course--that's why the padres call on thestudents. Come on now, loosen up with three or four pesos, so that theymay see we are sports. Don't let them say afterwards that in orderto erect a statue they had to dig down into their own pockets. Do,Placido, it's not money thrown away."He accompanied these words with a significant wink. Placido recalledthe case of a student who had passed through the entire course bypresenting canary-birds, so he subscribed three pesos."Look now, I'll write your name plainly so that the professor will readit, you see--Placido Penitente, three pesos. Ah, listen! In a coupleof weeks comes the nameday of the professor of natural history. Youknow that he's a good fellow, never marks absences or asks about thelesson. Man, we must show our appreciation!""That's right!""Then don't you think that we ought to give him a celebration? Theorchestra must not be smaller than the one you had for the professorof physics.""That's right!""What do you think about making the contribution two pesos? Come,Placido, you start it, so you'll be at the head of the list."Then, seeing that Placido gave the two pesos without hesitation,he added, "Listen, put up four, and afterwards I'll return youtwo. They'll serve as a decoy.""Well, if you're going to return them to me, why give them toyou? It'll be sufficient, for you to write four.""Ah, that's right! What an ass I am! Do you know, I'm getting to bea regular ass! But let me have them anyhow, so that I can show them."Placido, in order not to give the lie to the priest who christened him,gave what was asked, just as they reached the University.In the entrance and along the walks on each side of it were gatheredthe students, awaiting the appearance of the professors. Students ofthe preparatory year of law, of the fifth of the secondary course,of the preparatory in medicine, formed lively groups. The latterwere easily distinguished by their clothing and by a certain airthat was lacking in the others, since the greater part of them camefrom the Ateneo Municipal. Among them could be seen the poet Isagani,explaining to a companion the theory of the refraction of light. Inanother group they were talking, disputing, citing the statementsof the professor, the text-books, and scholastic principles; inyet another they were gesticulating and waving their books in theair or making demonstrations with their canes by drawing diagramson the ground; farther on, they were entertaining themselves inwatching the pious women go into the neighboring church, all thestudents making facetious remarks. An old woman leaning on a younggirl limped piously, while the girl moved along writh downcast eyes,timid and abashed to pass before so many curious eyes. The old lady,catching up her coffee-colored skirt, of the Sisterhood of St. Rita,to reveal her big feet and white stockings, scolded her companionand shot furious glances at the staring bystanders."The rascals!" she grunted. "Don't look at them, keep your eyes down."Everything was noticed; everything called forth jokes and comments. Nowit was a magnificent victoria which stopped at the door to set down afamily of votaries on their way to visit the Virgin of the Rosary [26]on her favorite day, while the inquisitive sharpened their eyes to geta glimpse of the shape and size of the young ladies' feet as they gotout of the carriages; now it was a student who came out of the doorwith devotion still shining in his eyes, for he had passed throughthe church to beg the Virgin's help in understanding his lesson andto see if his sweetheart was there, to exchange a few glances withher and go on to his class with the recollection of her loving eyes.Soon there was noticed some movement in the groups, a certain air ofexpectancy, while Isagani paused and turned pale. A carriage drawnby a pair of well-known white horses had stopped at the door. Itwas that of Paulita Gomez, and she had already jumped down, lightas a bird, without giving the rascals time to see her foot. With abewitching whirl of her body and a sweep of her hand she arrangedthe folds of her skirt, shot a rapid and apparently careless glancetoward Isagani, spoke to him and smiled. Dona Victorina descendedin her turn, gazed over her spectacles, saw Juanito Pelaez, smiled,and bowed to him affably.Isagani, flushed with excitement, returned a timid salute, whileJuanito bowed profoundly, took off his hat, and made the same gestureas the celebrated clown and caricaturist Panza when he receivedapplause."Heavens, what a girl!" exclaimed one of the students, startingforward. "Tell the professor that I'm seriously ill." So Tadeo,as this invalid youth was known, entered the church to follow the girl.Tadeo went to the University every day to ask if the classes would beheld and each time seemed to be more and more astonished that theywould. He had a fixed idea of a latent and eternal _holiday_, andexpected it to come any day. So each morning, after vainly proposingthat they play truant, he would go away alleging important business,an appointment, or illness, just at the very moment when his companionswere going to their classes. But by some occult, thaumaturgic artTadeo passed the examinations, was beloved by the professors, andhad before him a promising future.Meanwhile, the groups began to move inside, for the professorof physics and chemistry had put in his appearance. The studentsappeared to be cheated in their hopes and went toward the interiorof the building with exclamations of discontent. Placido went alongwith the crowd."Penitente, Penitente!" called a student with a certain mysteriousair. "Sign this!""What is it?""Never mind--sign it!"It seemed to Placido that some one was twitching his ears. He recalledthe story of a cabeza de barangay in his town who, for having signeda document that he did not understand, was kept a prisoner for monthsand months, and came near to deportation. An uncle of Placido's,in order to fix the lesson in his memory, had given him a severeear-pulling, so that always whenever he heard signatures spoken of,his ears reproduced the sensation."Excuse me, but I can't sign anything without first understandingwhat it's about.""What a fool you are! If two _celestial carbineers_ have signed it,what have you to fear?"The name of _celestial carbineers_ inspired confidence, being, as itwas, a sacred company created to aid God in the warfare against theevil spirit and to prevent the smuggling of heretical contraband intothe markets of the New Zion. [27]Placido was about to sign to make an end of it, because he was ina hurry,--already his classmates were reciting the _O Thoma_,--butagain his ears twitched, so he said, "After the class! I want to readit first.""It's very long, don't you see? It concerns the presentation of acounter-petition, or rather, a protest. Don't you understand? Makaraigand some others have asked that an academy of Castilian be opened,which is a piece of genuine foolishness--""All right, all right, after awhile. They're already beginning,"answered Placido, trying to get away."But your professor may not call the roll--""Yes, yes; but he calls it sometimes. Later on, later on! Besides,I don't want to put myself in opposition to Makaraig.""But it's not putting yourself in opposition, it's only--"Placido heard no more, for he was already far away, hurrying to hisclass. He heard the different voices--_adsum, adsum_--the roll wasbeing called! Hastening his steps he got to the door just as theletter Q was reached."_Tinamaan ng--!_" [28] he muttered, biting his lips.He hesitated about entering, for the mark was already down againsthim and was not to be erased. One did not go to the class tolearn but in order not to get this absence mark, for the class wasreduced to reciting the lesson from memory, reading the book, andat the most answering a few abstract, profound, captious, enigmaticquestions. True, the usual preachment was never lacking--the sameas ever, about humility, submission, and respect to the clerics,and he, Placido, was humble, submissive, and respectful. So he wasabout to turn away when he remembered that the examinations wereapproaching and his professor had not yet asked him a question norappeared to notice him--this would be a good opportunity to attracthis attention and become known! To be known was to gain a year, forif it cost nothing to suspend one who was not known, it required ahard heart not to be touched by the sight of a youth who by his dailypresence was a reproach over a year of his life wasted.So Placido went in, not on tiptoe as was his custom, but noisily on hisheels, and only too well did he succeed in his intent! The professorstared at him, knitted his brows, and shook his head, as though to say,"Ah, little impudence, you'll pay for that!"CHAPTER XIIITHE CLASS IN PHYSICSThe classroom was a spacious rectangular hall with large gratedwindows that admitted an abundance of light and air. Along the twosides extended three wide tiers of stone covered with wood, filledwith students arranged in alphabetical order. At the end opposite theentrance, under a print of St. Thomas Aquinas, rose the professor'schair on an elevated platform with a little stairway on each side. Withthe exception of a beautiful blackboard in a narra frame, scarcelyever used, since there was still written on it the _viva_ that hadappeared on the opening day, no furniture, either useful or useless,was to be seen. The walls, painted white and covered with glazed tilesto prevent scratches, were entirely bare, having neither a drawingnor a picture, nor even an outline of any physical apparatus. Thestudents had no need of any, no one missed the practical instructionin an extremely experimental science; for years and years it has beenso taught and the country has not been upset, but continues just asever. Now and then some little instrument descended from heaven andwas exhibited to the class from a distance, like the monstrance tothe prostrate worshipers--look, but touch not! From time to time,when some complacent professor appeared, one day in the year wasset aside for visiting the mysterious laboratory and gazing fromwithout at the puzzling apparatus arranged in glass cases. No onecould complain, for on that day there were to be seen quantities ofbrass and glassware, tubes, disks, wheels, bells, and the like--theexhibition did not get beyond that, and the country was not upset.Besides, the students were convinced that those instruments had notbeen purchased for them--the friars would be fools! The laboratorywas intended to be shown to the visitors and the high officials whocame from the Peninsula, so that upon seeing it they would nod theirheads with satisfaction, while their guide would smile, as if to say,"Eh, you thought you were going to find some backward monks! Well,we're right up with the times--we have a laboratory!"The visitors and high officials, after being handsomely entertained,would then write in their _Travels_ or _Memoirs_: "The Royaland Pontifical University of Santo Tomas of Manila, in charge ofthe enlightened Dominican Order, possesses a magnificent physicallaboratory for the instruction of youth. Some two hundred and fiftystudents annually study this subject, but whether from apathy,indolence, the limited capacity of the Indian, or some otherethnological or incomprehensible reason, up to now there has notdeveloped a Lavoisier, a Secchi, or a Tyndall, not even in miniature,in the Malay-Filipino race."Yet, to be exact, we will say that in this laboratory are held theclasses of thirty or forty _advanced_ students, under the direction ofan instructor who performs his duties well enough, but as the greaterpart of these students come from the Ateneo of the Jesuits, wherescience is taught practically in the laboratory itself, its utilitydoes not come to be so great as it would be if it could be utilized bythe two hundred and fifty who pay their matriculation fees, buy theirbooks, memorize them, and waste a year to know nothing afterwards. Asa result, with the exception of some rare usher or janitor who hashad charge of the museum for years, no one has ever been known toget any advantage from the lessons memorized with so great effort.But let us return to the class. The professor was a young Dominican,who had filled several chairs in San Juan de Letran with zeal andgood repute. He had the reputation of being a great logician as wellas a profound philosopher, and was one of the most promising in hisclique. His elders treated him with consideration, while the youngermen envied him, for there were also cliques among them. This was thethird year of his professorship and, although the first in which hehad taught physics and chemistry, he already passed for a sage, notonly with the complaisant students but also among the other nomadicprofessors. Padre Millon did not belong to the common crowd who eachyear change their subject in order to acquire scientific knowledge,students among other students, with the difference only that theyfollow a single course, that they quiz instead of being quizzed,that they have a better knowledge of Castilian, and that they are notexamined at the completion of the course. Padre Millon went deeplyinto science, knew the physics of Aristotle and Padre Amat, readcarefully his "Ramos," and sometimes glanced at "Ganot." With all that,he would often shake his head with an air of doubt, as he smiled andmurmured: "_transeat_." In regard to chemistry, no common knowledgewas attributed to him after he had taken as a premise the statement ofSt. Thomas that water is a mixture and proved plainly that the AngelicDoctor had long forestalled Berzelius, Gay-Lussac, Bunsen, and othermore or less presumptuous materialists. Moreover, in spite of havingbeen an instructor in geography, he still entertained certain doubts asto the rotundity of the earth and smiled maliciously when its rotationand revolution around the sun were mentioned, as he recited the verses    "El mentir de las estrellas    Es un comodo mentir." [29]He also smiled maliciously in the presence of certain physicaltheories and considered visionary, if not actually insane, theJesuit Secchi, to whom he imputed the making of triangulations onthe host as a result of his astronomical mania, for which reason itwas said that he had been forbidden to celebrate mass. Many personsalso noticed in him some aversion to the sciences that he taught,but these vagaries were trifles, scholarly and religious prejudicesthat were easily explained, not only by the fact that the physicalsciences were eminently practical, of pure observation and deduction,while his forte was philosophy, purely speculative, of abstractionand induction, but also because, like any good Dominican, jealousof the fame of his order, he could hardly feel any affection for ascience in which none of his brethren had excelled--he was the firstwho did not accept the chemistry of St. Thomas Aquinas--and in whichso much renown had been acquired by hostile, or rather, let us say,rival orders.This was the professor who that morning called the roll and directedmany of the students to recite the lesson from memory, word forword. The phonographs got into operation, some well, some ill, somestammering, and received their grades. He who recited without an errorearned a good mark and he who made more than three mistakes a bad mark.A fat boy with a sleepy face and hair as stiff and hard as the bristlesof a brush yawned until he seemed to be about to dislocate his jaws,and stretched himself with his arms extended as though he were inhis bed. The professor saw this and wished to startle him."Eh, there, sleepy-head! What's this? Lazy, too, so it's sure you[30] don't know the lesson, ha?"Padre Millon not only used the depreciative _tu_ with the students,like a good friar, but he also addressed them in the slang of themarkets, a practise that he had acquired from the professor ofcanonical law: whether that reverend gentleman wished to humble thestudents or the sacred decrees of the councils is a question not yetsettled, in spite of the great attention that has been given to it.This question, instead of offending the class, amused them, and manylaughed--it was a daily occurrence. But the sleeper did not laugh;he arose with a bound, rubbed his eyes, and, as though a steam-enginewere turning the phonograph, began to recite."The name of mirror is applied to all polished surfaces intended toproduce by the reflection of light the images of the objects placedbefore said surfaces. From the substances that form these surfaces,they are divided into metallic mirrors and glass mirrors--""Stop, stop, stop!" interrupted the professor. "Heavens, what arattle! We are at the point where the mirrors are divided intometallic and glass, eh? Now if I should present to you a block ofwood, a piece of kamagon for instance, well polished and varnished,or a slab of black marble well burnished, or a square of jet, whichwould reflect the images of objects placed before them, how wouldyou classify those mirrors?"Whether he did not know what to answer or did not understandthe question, the student tried to get out of the difficulty bydemonstrating that he knew the lesson, so he rushed on like a torrent."The first are composed of brass or an alloy of different metals andthe second of a sheet of glass, with its two sides well polished,one of which has an amalgam of tin adhering to it.""Tut, tut, tut! That's not it! I say to you '_Dominus vobiscum_,'and you answer me with '_Requiescat in pace!_' "The worthy professor then repeated the question in the vernacular ofthe markets, interspersed with _cosas_ and _abas_ at every moment.The poor youth did not know how to get out of the quandary: he doubtedwhether to include the kamagon with the metals, or the marble withglasses, and leave the jet as a neutral substance, until JuanitoPelaez maliciously prompted him:"The mirror of kamagon among the wooden mirrors."The incautious youth repeated this aloud and half the class wasconvulsed with laughter."A good sample of wood you are yourself!" exclaimed the professor,laughing in spite of himself. "Let's see from what you would define amirror--from a surface _per se, in quantum est superficies_, or from asubstance that forms the surface, or from the substance upon which thesurface rests, the raw material, modified by the attribute 'surface,'since it is clear that, surface being an accidental property of bodies,it cannot exist without substance. Let's see now--what do you say?""I? Nothing!" the wretched boy was about to reply, for he did notunderstand what it was all about, confused as he was by so manysurfaces and so many accidents that smote cruelly on his ears, buta sense of shame restrained him. Filled with anguish and breakinginto a cold perspiration, he began to repeat between his teeth:"The name of mirror is applied to all polished surfaces--""_Ergo, per te_, the mirror is the surface," angled theprofessor. "Well, then, clear up this difficulty. If the surface is themirror, it must be of no consequence to the 'essence' of the mirrorwhat may be found behind this surface, since what is behind it doesnot affect the 'essence' that is before it, _id est_, the surface,_quae super faciem est, quia vocatur superficies, facies ea quaesupra videtur_. Do you admit that or do you not admit it?"The poor youth's hair stood up straighter than ever, as though actedupon by some magnetic force."Do you admit it or do you not admit it?""Anything! Whatever you wish, Padre," was his thought, but he didnot dare to express it from fear of ridicule. That was a dilemmaindeed, and he had never been in a worse one. He had a vague ideathat the most innocent thing could not be admitted to the friarsbut that they, or rather their estates and curacies, would get outof it all the results and advantages imaginable. So his good angelprompted him to deny everything with all the energy of his soul andrefractoriness of his hair, and he was about to shout a proud _nego_,for the reason that he who denies everything does not compromisehimself in anything, as a certain lawyer had once told him; but theevil habit of disregarding the dictates of one's own conscience,of having little faith in legal folk, and of seeking aid from otherswhere one is sufficient unto himself, was his undoing. His companions,especially Juanito Pelaez, were making signs to him to admit it,so he let himself be carried away by his evil destiny and exclaimed,"_Concedo_, Padre," in a voice as faltering as though he were saying,"_In manus tuas commendo spiritum meum._""_Concedo antecedentum_," echoed the professor, smilingmaliciously. "_Ergo_, I can scratch the mercury off a looking-glass,put in its place a piece of _bibinka_, and we shall still have amirror, eh? Now what shall we have?"The youth gazed at his prompters, but seeing them surprised andspeechless, contracted his features into an expression of bitterestreproach. "_Deus meus, Deus meus, quare dereliquiste me,_" said histroubled eyes, while his lips muttered "_Linintikan!_" Vainly hecoughed, fumbled at his shirt-bosom, stood first on one foot and thenon the other, but found no answer."Come now, what have we?" urged the professor, enjoying the effectof his reasoning."_Bibinka!_" whispered Juanito Pelaez. "_Bibinka!_""Shut up, you fool!" cried the desperate youth, hoping to get out ofthe difficulty by turning it into a complaint."Let's see, Juanito, if you can answer the question for me," theprofessor then said to Pelaez, who was one of his pets.The latter rose slowly, not without first giving Penitente, whofollowed him on the roll, a nudge that meant, "Don't forget toprompt me.""_Nego consequentiam_, Padre," he replied resolutely."Aha, then _probo consequentiam! Per te_, the polished surfaceconstitutes the 'essence' of the mirror--"_"Nego suppositum!"_ interrupted Juanito, as he felt Placido pullingat his coat."How? _Per te_--""_Nego!_""_Ergo,_ you believe that what is behind affects what is in front?"_"Nego!"_ the student cried with still more ardor, feeling anotherjerk at his coat.Juanito, or rather Placido, who was prompting him, was unconsciouslyadopting Chinese tactics: not to admit the most inoffensive foreignerin order not to be invaded."Then where are we?" asked the professor, somewhat disconcerted,and looking uneasily at the refractory student. "Does the substancebehind affect, or does it not affect, the surface?"To this precise and categorical question, a kind of ultimatum, Juanitodid not know what to reply and his coat offered no suggestions. In vainhe made signs to Placido, but Placido himself was in doubt. Juanitothen took advantage of a moment in which the professor was staringat a student who was cautiously and secretly taking off the shoesthat hurt his feet, to step heavily on Placido's toes and whisper,"Tell me, hurry up, tell me!""I distinguish--Get out! What an ass you are!" yelled Placidounreservedly, as he stared with angry eyes and rubbed his hand overhis patent-leather shoe.The professor heard the cry, stared at the pair, and guessed whathad happened."Listen, you meddler," he addressed Placido, "I wasn't questioningyou, but since you think you can save others, let's see if you cansave yourself, _salva te ipsum,_ and decide this question."Juanito sat down in content, and as a mark of gratitude stuck outhis tongue at his prompter, who had arisen blushing with shame andmuttering incoherent excuses.For a moment Padre Millon regarded him as one gloating over a favoritedish. What a good thing it would be to humiliate and hold up toridicule that dudish boy, always smartly dressed, with head erectand serene look! It would be a deed of charity, so the charitableprofessor applied himself to it with all his heart, slowly repeatingthe question."The book says that the metallic mirrors are made of brass and analloy of different metals--is that true or is it not true?""So the book says, Padre.""_Liber dixit, ergo ita est_. Don't pretend that you know more than thebook does. It then adds that the glass mirrors are made of a sheet ofglass whose two surfaces are well polished, one of them having appliedto it an amalgam of tin, _nota bene_, an amalgam of tin! Is that true?""If the book says so, Padre.""Is tin a metal?""It seems so, Padre. The book says so.""It is, it is, and the word amalgam means that it is compounded withmercury, which is also a metal. _Ergo_, a glass mirror is a metallicmirror; _ergo_, the terms of the distinction are confused; _ergo_,the classification is imperfect--how do you explain that, meddler?"He emphasized the _ergos_ and the familiar "you's" with indescribablerelish, at the same time winking, as though to say, "You're done for.""It means that, it means that--" stammered Placido."It means that you haven't learned the lesson, you petty meddler,you don't understand it yourself, and yet you prompt your neighbor!"The class took no offense, but on the contrary many thought theepithet funny and laughed. Placido bit his lips."What's your name?" the professor asked him."Placido," was the curt reply."Aha! Placido Penitente, although you look more like Placido thePrompter--or the Prompted. But, _Penitent_, I'm going to impose some_penance_ on you for your promptings."Pleased with his play on words, he ordered the youth to recite thelesson, and the latter, in the state of mind to which he was reduced,made more than three mistakes. Shaking his head up and down, theprofessor slowly opened the register and slowly scanned it while hecalled off the names in a low voice."Palencia--Palomo--Panganiban--Pedraza--Pelado--Pelaez--Penitents,aha! Placido Penitente, fifteen unexcused absences--"Placido started up. "Fifteen absences, Padre?""Fifteen unexcused absences," continued the professor, "so that youonly lack one to be dropped from the roll.""Fifteen absences, fifteen absences," repeated Placido inamazement. "I've never been absent more than four times, and withtoday, perhaps five.""Jesso, jesso, monseer," [31] replied the professor, examining theyouth over his gold eye-glasses. "You confess that you have missedfive times, and God knows if you may have missed oftener. _Atqui_,as I rarely call the roll, every time I catch any one I put fivemarks against him; _ergo_, how many are five times five? Have youforgotten the multiplication table? Five times five?""Twenty-five.""Correct, correct! Thus you've still got away with ten, because I havecaught you only three times. Huh, if I had caught you every time--Now,how many are three times five?""Fifteen.""Fifteen, right you are!" concluded the professor, closing theregister. "If you miss once more--out of doors with you, get out! Ah,now a mark for the failure in the daily lesson."He again opened the register, sought out the name, and entered themark. "Come, only one mark," he said, "since you hadn't any before.""But, Padre," exclaimed Placido, restraining himself, "if yourReverence puts a mark against me for failing in the lesson, yourReverence owes it to me to erase the one for absence that you haveput against me for today."His Reverence made no answer. First he slowly entered the mark,then contemplated it with his head on one side,--the mark must beartistic,--closed the register, and asked with great sarcasm, "_Aba_,and why so, sir?""Because I can't conceive, Padre, how one can be absent from theclass and at the same time recite the lesson in it. Your Reverenceis saying that to be is not to be.""_Naku_, a metaphysician, but a rather premature one! So you can'tconceive of it, eh? _Sed patet experientia_ and _contra experientiamnegantem, fusilibus est arguendum_, do you understand? And can'tyou conceive, with your philosophical head, that one can be absentfrom the class and not know the lesson at the same time? Is it a factthat absence necessarily implies knowledge? What do you say to that,philosophaster?"This last epithet was the drop of water that made the full cupoverflow. Placido enjoyed among his friends the reputation of beinga philosopher, so he lost his patience, threw down his book, arose,and faced the professor."Enough, Padre, enough! Your Reverence can put all the marks against methat you wish, but you haven't the right to insult me. Your Reverencemay stay with the class, I can't stand any more." Without furtherfarewell, he stalked away.The class was astounded; such an assumption of dignity had scarcelyever been seen, and who would have thought it of Placido Penitente? Thesurprised professor bit his lips and shook his head threateningly as hewatched him depart. Then in a trembling voice he began his preachmenton the same old theme, delivered however with more energy and moreeloquence. It dealt with the growing arrogance, the innate ingratitude,the presumption, the lack of respect for superiors, the pride thatthe spirit of darkness infused in the young, the lack of manners,the absence of courtesy, and so on. From this he passed to coarsejests and sarcasm over the presumption which some good-for-nothing"prompters" had of teaching their teachers by establishing an academyfor instruction in Castilian."Aha, aha!" he moralized, "those who the day before yesterday scarcelyknew how to say, 'Yes, Padre,' 'No, Padre,' now want to know morethan those who have grown gray teaching them. He who wishes to learn,will learn, academies or no academies! Undoubtedly that fellow whohas just gone out is one of those in the project. Castilian is in goodhands with such guardians! When are you going to get the time to attendthe academy if you have scarcely enough to fulfill your duties in theregular classes? We wish that you may all know Spanish and that youpronounce it well, so that you won't split our ear-drums with yourtwist of expression and your 'p's'; [32] but first business and thenpleasure: finish your studies first, and afterwards learn Castilian,and all become clerks, if you so wish."So he went on with his harangue until the bell rang and the class wasover. The two hundred and thirty-four students, after reciting theirprayers, went out as ignorant as when they went in, but breathing morefreely, as if a great weight had been lifted from them. Each youth hadlost another hour of his life and with it a portion of his dignity andself-respect, and in exchange there was an increase of discontent,of aversion to study, of resentment in their hearts. After all thisask for knowledge, dignity, gratitude!_De nobis, post haec, tristis sententia fertur_!Just as the two hundred and thirty-four spent their class hours,so the thousands of students who preceded them have spent theirs,and, if matters do not mend, so will those yet to come spend theirs,and be brutalized, while wounded dignity and youthful enthusiasmwill be converted into hatred and sloth, like the waves that becomepolluted along one part of the shore and roll on one after another,each in succession depositing a larger sediment of filth. But yet Hewho from eternity watches the consequences of a deed develop like athread through the loom of the centuries, He who weighs the valueof a second and has ordained for His creatures as an elementallaw progress and development, He, if He is just, will demand astrict accounting from those who must render it, of the millions ofintelligences darkened and blinded, of human dignity trampled uponin millions of His creatures, and of the incalculable time lost andeffort wasted! And if the teachings of the Gospel are based on truth,so also will these have to answer--the millions and millions who donot know how to preserve the light of their intelligences and theirdignity of mind, as the master demanded an accounting from the cowardlyservant for the talent that he let be taken from him.CHAPTER XIVIN THE HOUSE OF THE STUDENTSThe house where Makaraig lived was worth visiting. Large and spacious,with two entresols provided with elegant gratings, it seemed to bea school during the first hours of the morning and pandemonium fromten o'clock on. During the boarders' recreation hours, from the lowerhallway of the spacious entrance up to the main floor, there was abubbling of laughter, shouts, and movement. Boys in scanty clothingplayed _sipa_ or practised gymnastic exercises on improvised trapezes,while on the staircase a fight was in progress between eight or ninearmed with canes, sticks, and ropes, but neither attackers nor attackeddid any great damage, their blows generally falling sidewise upon theshoulders of the Chinese pedler who was there selling his outlandishmixtures and indigestible pastries. Crowds of boys surrounded him,pulled at his already disordered queue, snatched pies from him,haggled over the prices, and committed a thousand deviltries. TheChinese yelled, swore, forswore, in all the languages he could jabber,not omitting his own; he whimpered, laughed, pleaded, put on a smilingface when an ugly one would not serve, or the reverse.He cursed them as devils, savages, _no kilistanos_ [33] but thatmattered nothing. A whack would bring his face around smiling, andif the blow fell only upon his shoulders he would calmly continuehis business transactions, contenting himself with crying out tothem that he was not in the game, but if it struck the flat basketon which were placed his wares, then he would swear never to comeagain, as he poured out upon them all the imprecations and anathemasimaginable. Then the boys would redouble their efforts to make himrage the more, and when at last his vocabulary was exhausted and theywere satiated with his fearful mixtures, they paid him religiously,and sent him away happy, winking, chuckling to himself, and receivingas caresses the light blows from their canes that the students gavehim as tokens of farewell.Concerts on the piano and violin, the guitar, and the accordion,alternated with the continual clashing of blades from the fencinglessons. Around a long, wide table the students of the Ateneo preparedtheir compositions or solved their problems by the side of otherswriting to their sweethearts on pink perforated note-paper coveredwith drawings. Here one was composing a melodrama at the side ofanother practising on the flute, from which he drew wheezy notes. Overthere, the older boys, students in professional courses, who affectedsilk socks and embroidered slippers, amused themselves in teasingthe smaller boys by pulling their ears, already red from repeatedfillips, while two or three held down a little fellow who yelled andcried, defending himself with his feet against being reduced to thecondition in which he was born, kicking and howling. In one room,around a small table, four were playing _revesino_ with laughter andjokes, to the great annoyance of another who pretended to be studyinghis lesson but who was in reality waiting his turn to play.Still another came in with exaggerated wonder, scandalized as heapproached the table. "How wicked you are! So early in the morningand already gambling! Let's see, let's see! You fool, take it withthe three of spades!" Closing his book, he too joined in the game.Cries and blows were heard. Two boys were fighting in the adjoiningroom--a lame student who was very sensitive about his infirmity andan unhappy newcomer from the provinces who was just commencing hisstudies. He was working over a treatise on philosophy and readinginnocently in a loud voice, with a wrong accent, the Cartesianprinciple: "_Cogito, ergo sum!_"The little lame boy (_el cojito_) took this as an insult and the othersintervened to restore peace, but in reality only to sow discord andcome to blows themselves.In the dining-room a young man with a can of sardines, a bottle ofwine, and the provisions that he had just brought from his town, wasmaking heroic efforts to the end that his friends might participatein his lunch, while they were offering in their turn heroic resistanceto his invitation. Others were bathing on the azotea, playing firemenwith the water from the well, and joining in combats with pails ofwater, to the great delight of the spectators.But the noise and shouts gradually died away with the coming of leadingstudents, summoned by Makaraig to report to them the progress of theacademy of Castilian. Isagani was cordially greeted, as was also thePeninsular, Sandoval, who had come to Manila as a government employeeand was finishing his studies, and who had completely identifiedhimself with the cause of the Filipino students. The barriers thatpolitics had established between the races had disappeared in theschoolroom as though dissolved by the zeal of science and youth.From lack of lyceums and scientific, literary, or political centers,Sandoval took advantage of all the meetings to cultivate his greatoratorical gifts, delivering speeches and arguing on any subject,to draw forth applause from his friends and listeners. At that momentthe subject of conversation was the instruction in Castilian, but asMakaraig had not yet arrived conjecture was still the order of the day."What can have happened?""What has the General decided?""Has he refused the permit?""Has Padre Irene or Padre Sibyla won?"Such were the questions they asked one another, questions that couldbe answered only by Makaraig.Among the young men gathered together there were optimists like Isaganiand Sandoval, who saw the thing already accomplished and talked ofcongratulations and praise from the government for the patriotism ofthe students--outbursts of optimism that led Juanito Pelaez to claimfor himself a large part of the glory of founding the society.All this was answered by the pessimist Pecson, a chubby youth witha wide, clownish grin, who spoke of outside influences, whether theBishop A., the Padre B., or the Provincial C., had been consulted ornot, whether or not they had advised that the whole association shouldbe put in jail--a suggestion that made Juanito Pelaez so uneasy thathe stammered out, "_Carambas_, don't you drag me into--"Sandoval, as a Peninsular and a liberal, became furious atthis. "But pshaw!" he exclaimed, "that is holding a bad opinion of hisExcellency! I know that he's quite a friar-lover, but in such a matteras this he won't let the friars interfere. Will you tell me, Pecson, onwhat you base your belief that the General has no judgment of his own?""I didn't say that, Sandoval," replied Pecson, grinning until heexposed his wisdom-tooth. "For me the General has _his own_ judgment,that is, the judgment of all those within his reach. That's plain!""You're dodging--cite me a fact, cite me a fact!" criedSandoval. "Let's get away from hollow arguments, from empty phrases,and get on the solid ground of facts,"--this with an elegantgesture. "Facts, gentlemen, facts! The rest is prejudice--I won'tcall it filibusterism."Pecson smiled like one of the blessed as he retorted, "There comes thefilibusterism. But can't we enter into a discussion without resortingto accusations?"Sandoval protested in a little extemporaneous speech, again demandingfacts."Well, not long ago there was a dispute between some private personsand certain friars, and the acting Governor rendered a decisionthat it should be settled by the Provincial of the Order concerned,"replied Pecson, again breaking out into a laugh, as though he weredealing with an insignificant matter, he cited names and dates,and promised documents that would prove how justice was dispensed."But, on what ground, tell me this, on what ground can they refusepermission for what plainly appears to be extremely useful andnecessary?" asked Sandoval.Pecson shrugged his shoulders. "It's that it endangers the integrityof the fatherland," he replied in the tone of a notary reading anallegation."That's pretty good! What has the integrity of the fatherland to dowith the rules of syntax?""The Holy Mother Church has learned doctors--what do I know? Perhapsit is feared that we may come to understand the laws so that we canobey them. What will become of the Philippines on the day when weunderstand one another?"Sandoval did not relish the dialectic and jesting turn of theconversation; along that path could rise no speech worth thewhile. "Don't make a joke of things!" he exclaimed. "This is aserious matter.""The Lord deliver me from joking when there are friars concerned!""But, on what do you base--""On the fact that, the hours for the classes having to come atnight," continued Pecson in the same tone, as if he were quotingknown and recognized formulas, "there may be invoked as an obstaclethe immorality of the thing, as was done in the case of the schoolat Malolos.""Another! But don't the classes of the Academy of Drawing, and thenovenaries and the processions, cover themselves with the mantleof night?""The scheme affects the dignity of the University," went on the chubbyyouth, taking no notice of the question."Affects nothing! The University has to accommodate itself to the needsof the students. And granting that, what is a university then? Is itan institution to discourage study? Have a few men banded themselvestogether in the name of learning and instruction in order to preventothers from becoming enlightened?""The fact is that movements initiated from below are regarded asdiscontent--""What about projects that come from above?" interpolated one of thestudents. "There's the School of Arts and Trades!""Slowly, slowly, gentlemen," protested Sandoval. "I'm not afriar-lover, my liberal views being well known, but render unto Caesarthat which is Caesar's. Of that School of Arts and Trades, of which Ihave been the most enthusiastic supporter and the realization of whichI shall greet as the first streak of dawn for these fortunate islands,of that School of Arts and Trades the friars have taken charge--""Or the cat of the canary, which amounts to the same thing," addedPecson, in his turn interrupting the speech."Get out!" cried Sandoval, enraged at the interruption, which hadcaused him to lose the thread of his long, well-rounded sentence. "Aslong as we hear nothing bad, let's not be pessimists, let's not beunjust, doubting the liberty and independence of the government."Here he entered upon a defense in beautiful phraseology of thegovernment and its good intentions, a subject that Pecson dared notbreak in upon."The Spanish government," he said among other things, "has givenyou everything, it has denied you nothing! We had absolutism inSpain and you had absolutism here; the friars covered our soil withconventos, and conventos occupy a third part of Manila; in Spainthe garrote prevails and here the garrote is the extreme punishment;we are Catholics and we have made you Catholics; we were scholasticsand scholasticism sheds its light in your college halls; in short,gentlemen, we weep when you weep, we suffer when you suffer, we havethe same altars, the same courts, the same punishments, and it isonly just that we should give you our rights and our joys."As no one interrupted him, he became more and more enthusiastic,until he came to speak of the future of the Philippines."As I have said, gentlemen, the dawn is not far distant. Spain is nowbreaking the eastern sky for her beloved Philippines, and the timesare changing, as I positively know, faster than we imagine. Thisgovernment, which, according to you, is vacillating and weak, shouldbe strengthened by our confidence, that we may make it see that it isthe custodian of our hopes. Let us remind it by our conduct (shouldit ever forget itself, which I do not believe can happen) that wehave faith in its good intentions and that it should be guided by noother standard than justice and the welfare of all the governed. No,gentlemen," he went on in a tone more and more declamatory, "we mustnot admit at all in this matter the possibility of a consultation withother more or less hostile entities, as such a supposition would implyour resignation to the fact. Your conduct up to the present has beenfrank, loyal, without vacillation, above suspicion; you have addressedit simply and directly; the reasons you have presented could not bemore sound; your aim is to lighten the labor of the teachers in thefirst years and to facilitate study among the hundreds of studentswho fill the college halls and for whom one solitary professor cannotsuffice. If up to the present the petition has not been granted, ithas been for the reason, as I feel sure, that there has been a greatdeal of material accumulated, but I predict that the campaign iswon, that the summons of Makaraig is to announce to us the victory,and tomorrow we shall see our efforts crowned with the applause andappreciation of the country, and who knows, gentlemen, but that thegovernment may confer upon you some handsome decoration of merit,benefactors as you are of the fatherland!"Enthusiastic applause resounded. All immediately believed in thetriumph, and many in the decoration."Let it be remembered, gentlemen," observed Juanito, "that I was oneof the first to propose it."The pessimist Pecson was not so enthusiastic. "Just so we don't getthat decoration on our ankles," he remarked, but fortunately forPelaez this comment was not heard in the midst of the applause.When they had quieted down a little, Pecson replied, "Good, good,very good, but one supposition: if in spite of all that, the Generalconsults and consults and consults, and afterwards refuses the permit?"This question fell like a dash of cold water. All turned to Sandoval,who was taken aback. "Then--" he stammered."Then?""Then," he exclaimed in a burst of enthusiasm, still excited by theapplause, "seeing that in writing and in printing it boasts of desiringyour enlightenment, and yet hinders and denies it when called upon tomake it a reality--then, gentlemen, your efforts will not have beenin vain, you will have accomplished what no one else has been ableto do. Make them drop the mask and fling down the gauntlet to you!""Bravo, bravo!" cried several enthusiastically."Good for Sandoval! Hurrah for the gauntlet!" added others."Let them fling down the gauntlet to us!" repeated Pecsondisdainfully. "But afterwards?"Sandoval seemed to be cut short in his triumph, but with the vivacitypeculiar to his race and his oratorical temperament he had animmediate reply."Afterwards?" he asked. "Afterwards, if none of the Filipinos dareto accept the challenge, then I, Sandoval, in the name of Spain, willtake up the gauntlet, because such a policy would give the lie to thegood intentions that she has always cherished toward her provinces,and because he who is thus faithless to the trust reposed in him andabuses his unlimited authority deserves neither the protection ofthe fatherland nor the support of any Spanish citizen!"The enthusiasm of his hearers broke all bounds. Isagani embraced him,the others following his example. They talked of the fatherland,of union, of fraternity, of fidelity. The Filipinos declared thatif there were only Sandovals in Spain all would be Sandovals in thePhilippines. His eyes glistened, and it might well be believed that ifat that moment any kind of gauntlet had been flung at him he would haveleaped upon any kind of horse to ride to death for the Philippines.The "cold water" alone replied: "Good, that's very good, Sandoval. Icould also say the same if I were a Peninsular, but not being one,if I should say one half of what you have, you yourself would takeme for a filibuster."Sandoval began a speech in protest, but was interrupted."Rejoice, friends, rejoice! Victory!" cried a youth who entered atthat moment and began to embrace everybody."Rejoice, friends! Long live the Castilian tongue!"An outburst of applause greeted this announcement. They fell toembracing one another and their eyes filled with tears. Pecson alonepreserved his skeptical smile.The bearer of such good news was Makaraig, the young man at the headof the movement. This student occupied in that house, by himself, tworooms, luxuriously furnished, and had his servant and a cochero to lookafter his carriage and horses. He was of robust carriage, of refinedmanners, fastidiously dressed, and very rich. Although studying lawonly that he might have an academic degree, he enjoyed a reputation fordiligence, and as a logician in the scholastic way had no cause to envythe most frenzied quibblers of the University faculty. Neverthelesshe was not very far behind in regard to modern ideas and progress,for his fortune enabled him to have all the books and magazines that awatchful censor was unable to keep out. With these qualifications andhis reputation for courage, his fortunate associations in his earlieryears, and his refined and delicate courtesy, it was not strange thathe should exercise such great influence over his associates and thathe should have been chosen to carry out such a difficult undertakingas that of the instruction in Castilian.After the first outburst of enthusiasm, which in youth always takeshold in such exaggerated forms, since youth finds everything beautiful,they wanted to be informed how the affair had been managed."I saw Padre Irene this morning," said Makaraig with a certain airof mystery."Hurrah for Padre Irene!" cried an enthusiastic student."Padre Irene," continued Makaraig, "has told me about everything thattook place at Los Banos. It seems that they disputed for at leasta week, he supporting and defending our case against all of them,against Padre Sibyla, Padre Fernandez, Padre Salvi, the General,the jeweler Simoun--""The jeweler Simoun!" interrupted one of his listeners. "What has thatJew to do with the affairs of our country? We enrich him by buying--""Keep quiet!" admonished another impatiently, anxious to learn howPadre Irene had been able to overcome such formidable opponents."There were even high officials who were opposed to our project,the Head Secretary, the Civil Governor, Quiroga the Chinaman--""Quiroga the Chinaman! The pimp of the--""Shut up!""At last," resumed Makaraig, "they were going to pigeonhole thepetition and let it sleep for months and months, when Padre Ireneremembered the Superior Commission of Primary Instruction and proposed,since the matter concerned the teaching of the Castilian tongue,that the petition be referred to that body for a report upon it.""But that Commission hasn't been in operation for a long time,"observed Pecson."That's exactly what they replied to Padre Irene, and he answeredthat this was a good opportunity to revive it, and availing himselfof the presence of Don Custodio, one of its members, he proposed onthe spot that a committee should be appointed. Don Custodio's activitybeing known and recognized, he was named as arbiter and the petitionis now in his hands. He promised that he would settle it this month.""Hurrah for Don Custodio!""But suppose Don Custodio should report unfavorably upon it?" inquiredthe pessimist Pecson.Upon this they had not reckoned, being intoxicated with the thoughtthat the matter would not be pigeonholed, so they all turned toMakaraig to learn how it could be arranged."The same objection I presented to Padre Irene, but with his sly smilehe said to me: 'We've won a great deal, we have succeeded in gettingthe matter on the road to a decision, the opposition sees itselfforced to join battle.' If we can bring some influence to bear uponDon Custodio so that he, in accordance with his liberal tendencies,may report favorably, all is won, for the General showed himself tobe absolutely neutral."Makaraig paused, and an impatient listener asked, "How can weinfluence him?""Padre Irene pointed out to me two ways--""Quiroga," some one suggested."Pshaw, great use Quiroga--""A fine present.""No, that won't do, for he prides himself upon being incorruptible.""Ah, yes, I know!" exclaimed Pecson with a laugh. "Pepay the dancinggirl.""Ah, yes, Pepay the dancing girl," echoed several.This Pepay was a showy girl, supposed to be a great friend ofDon Custodio. To her resorted the contractors, the employees, theintriguers, when they wanted to get something from the celebratedcouncilor. Juanito Pelaez, who was also a great friend of the dancinggirl, offered to look after the matter, but Isagani shook his head,saying that it was sufficient that they had made use of Padre Ireneand that it would be going too far to avail themselves of Pepay insuch an affair."Show us the other way.""The other way is to apply to his attorney and adviser, Senor Pasta,the oracle before whom Don Custodio bows.""I prefer that," said Isagani. "Senor Pasta is a Filipino, and wasa schoolmate of my uncle's. But how can we interest him?""There's the _quid_," replied Makaraig, looking earnestly atIsagani. "Senor Pasta has a dancing girl--I mean, a seamstress."Isagani again shook his head."Don't be such a puritan," Juanito Pelaez said to him. "The endjustifies the means! I know the seamstress, Matea, for she has a shopwhere a lot of girls work.""No, gentlemen," declared Isagani, "let's first employ decentmethods. I'll go to Senor Pasta and, if I don't accomplish anything,then you can do what you wish with the dancing girls and seamstresses."They had to accept this proposition, agreeing that Isagani shouldtalk to Senor Pasta that very day, and in the afternoon report tohis associates at the University the result of the interview.CHAPTER XVSENOR PASTAIsagani presented himself in the house of the lawyer, one of themost talented minds in Manila, whom the friars consulted in theirgreat difficulties. The youth had to wait some time on account of thenumerous clients, but at last his turn came and he entered the office,or _bufete_, as it is generally called in the Philippines. The lawyerreceived him with a slight cough, looking down furtively at his feet,but he did not rise or offer a seat, as he went on writing. This gaveIsagani an opportunity for observation and careful study of the lawyer,who had aged greatly. His hair was gray and his baldness extendedover nearly the whole crown of his head. His countenance was sourand austere.There was complete silence in the study, except for the whispers of theclerks and understudies who were at work in an adjoining room. Theirpens scratched as though quarreling with the paper.At length the lawyer finished what he was writing, laid down his pen,raised his head, and, recognizing the youth, let his face light upwith a smile as he extended his hand affectionately."Welcome, young man! But sit down, and excuse me, for I didn't knowthat it was you. How is your uncle?"Isagani took courage, believing that his case would get on well. Herelated briefly what had been done, the while studying the effect ofhis words. Senor Pasta listened impassively at first and, althoughhe was informed of the efforts of the students, pretended ignorance,as if to show that he had nothing to do with such childish matters,but when he began to suspect what was wanted of him and heard mentionof the Vice-Rector, friars, the Captain-General, a project, and so on,his face slowly darkened and he finally exclaimed, "This is the landof projects! But go on, go on!"Isagani was not yet discouraged. He spoke of the manner in which adecision was to be reached and concluded with an expression of theconfidence which the young men entertained that he, Senor Pasta,would _intercede_ in their behalf in case Don Custodio should consulthim, as was to be expected. He did not dare to say would _advise_,deterred by the wry face the lawyer put on.But Senor Pasta had already formed his resolution, and it was notto mix at all in the affair, either as consulter or consulted. Hewas familiar with what had occurred at Los Banos, he knew that thereexisted two factions, and that Padre Irene was not the only championon the side of the students, nor had he been the one who proposedsubmitting the petition to the Commission of Primary Instruction,but quite the contrary. Padre Irene, Padre Fernandez, the Countess,a merchant who expected to sell the materials for the new academy,and the high official who had been citing royal decree after royaldecree, were about to triumph, when Padre Sibyla, wishing to gaintime, had thought of the Commission. All these facts the great lawyerhad present in his mind, so that when Isagani had finished speaking,he determined to confuse him with evasions, tangle the matter up,and lead the conversation to other subjects."Yes," he said, pursing his lips and scratching his head, "there isno one who surpasses me in love for the country and in aspirationstoward progress, but--I can't compromise myself, I don't know whetheryou clearly understand my position, a position that is very delicate,I have so many interests, I have to labor within the limits of strictprudence, it's a risk--"The lawyer sought to bewilder the youth with an exuberance of words,so he went on speaking of laws and decrees, and talked so much thatinstead of confusing the youth, he came very near to entanglinghimself in a labyrinth of citations."In no way do we wish to compromise you," replied Isagani with greatcalmness. "God deliver us from injuring in the least the personswhose lives are so useful to the rest of the Filipinos! But, aslittle versed as I may be in the laws, royal decrees, writs, andresolutions that obtain in this country, I can't believe that therecan be any harm in furthering the high purposes of the government,in trying to secure a proper interpretation of these purposes. Weare seeking the same end and differ only about the means."The lawyer smiled, for the youth had allowed himself to wander awayfrom the subject, and there where the former was going to entanglehim he had already entangled himself."That's exactly the _quid_, as is vulgarly said. It's clear that itis laudable to aid the government, when one aids it submissively,following out its desires and the true spirit of the laws in agreementwith the just beliefs of the governing powers, and when not incontradiction to the fundamental and general way of thinking of thepersons to whom is intrusted the common welfare of the individuals thatform a social organism. Therefore, it is criminal, it is punishable,because it is offensive to the high principle of authority, to attemptany action contrary to its initiative, even supposing it to be betterthan the governmental proposition, because such action would injureits prestige, which is the elementary basis upon which all colonialedifices rest."Confident that this broadside had at least stunned Isagani, the oldlawyer fell back in his armchair, outwardly very serious, but laughingto himself.Isagani, however, ventured to reply. "I should think that governments,the more they are threatened, would be all the more careful to seekbases that are impregnable. The basis of prestige for colonialgovernments is the weakest of all, since it does not depend uponthemselves but upon the consent of the governed, while the latterare willing to recognize it. The basis of justice or reason wouldseem to be the most durable."The lawyer raised his head. How was this--did that youth dare to replyand argue with him, _him_, Senor Pasta? Was he not yet bewilderedwith his big words?"Young man, you must put those considerations aside, for they aredangerous," he declared with a wave of his hand. "What I advise isthat you let the government attend to its own business.""Governments are established for the welfare of the peoples, andin order to accomplish this purpose properly they have to followthe suggestions of the citizens, who are the ones best qualified tounderstand their own needs.""Those who constitute the government are also citizens, and amongthe most enlightened.""But, being men, they are fallible, and ought not to disregard theopinions of others.""They must be trusted, they have to attend to everything.""There is a Spanish proverb which says, 'No tears, no milk,' in otherwords, 'To him who does not ask, nothing is given.' ""Quite the reverse," replied the lawyer with a sarcastic smile;"with the government exactly the reverse occurs--"But he suddenly checked himself, as if he had said too much andwished to correct his imprudence. "The government has given us thingsthat we have not asked for, and that we could not ask for, becauseto ask--to ask, presupposes that it is in some way incompetent andconsequently is not performing its functions. To suggest to it a courseof action, to try to guide it, when not really antagonizing it, is topresuppose that it is capable of erring, and as I have already saidto you such suppositions are menaces to the existence of colonialgovernments. The common crowd overlooks this and the young men whoset to work thoughtlessly do not know, do not comprehend, do not tryto comprehend the counter-effect of asking, the menace to order thereis in that idea--""Pardon me," interrupted Isagani, offended by the arguments the juristwas using with him, "but when by legal methods people ask a governmentfor something, it is because they think it good and disposed to grant ablessing, and such action, instead of irritating it, should flatter it--to the mother one appeals, never to the stepmother. The government,in my humble opinion, is not an omniscient being that can see andanticipate everything, and even if it could, it ought not to feeloffended, for here you have the church itself doing nothing but askingand begging of God, who sees and knows everything, and you yourselfask and demand many things in the courts of this same government,yet neither God nor the courts have yet taken offense. Every onerealizes that the government, being the human institution that it is,needs the support of all the people, it needs to be made to see andfeel the reality of things. You yourself are not convinced of thetruth of your objection, you yourself know that it is a tyrannicaland despotic government which, in order to make a display of forceand independence, denies everything through fear or distrust, andthat the tyrannized and enslaved peoples are the only ones whose dutyit is never to ask for anything. A people that hates its governmentought to ask for nothing but that it abdicate its power."The old lawyer grimaced and shook his head from side to side, in signof discontent, while he rubbed his hand over his bald pate and saidin a tone of condescending pity: "Ahem! those are bad doctrines, badtheories, ahem! How plain it is that you are young and inexperiencedin life. Look what is happening with the inexperienced young menwho in Madrid are asking for so many reforms. They are accused offilibusterism, many of them don't dare return here, and yet, whatare they asking for? Things holy, ancient, and recognized as quiteharmless. But there are matters that can't be explained, they're sodelicate. Let's see--I confess to you that there are other reasonsbesides those expressed that might lead a sensible government todeny systematically the wishes of the people--no--but it may happenthat we find ourselves under rulers so fatuous and ridiculous--butthere are always other reasons, even though what is asked be quitejust--different governments encounter different conditions--"The old man hesitated, stared fixedly at Isagani, and then with asudden resolution made a sign with his hand as though he would dispelsome idea."I can guess what you mean," said Isagani, smiling sadly. "You meanthat a colonial government, for the very reason that it is imperfectlyconstituted and that it is based on premises--""No, no, not that, no!" quickly interrupted the old lawyer, as hesought for something among his papers. "No, I meant--but where aremy spectacles?""There they are," replied Isagani.The old man put them on and pretended to look over some papers, butseeing that the youth was waiting, he mumbled, "I wanted to tell yousomething, I wanted to say--but it has slipped from my mind. Youinterrupted me in your eagerness--but it was an insignificantmatter. If you only knew what a whirl my head is in, I have so muchto do!"Isagani understood that he was being dismissed. "So," he said, rising,"we--""Ah, you will do well to leave the matter in the hands of thegovernment, which will settle it as it sees fit. You say that theVice-Rector is opposed to the teaching of Castilian. Perhaps he maybe, not as to the fact but as to the form. It is said that the Rectorwho is on his way will bring a project for reform in education. Waita while, give time a chance, apply yourself to your studies asthe examinations are near, and--_carambas!_--you who already speakCastilian and express yourself easily, what are you bothering yourselfabout? What interest have you in seeing it specially taught? SurelyPadre Florentino thinks as I do! Give him my regards.""My uncle," replied Isagani, "has always admonished me to think ofothers as much as of myself. I didn't come for myself, I came in thename of those who are in worse condition.""What the devil! Let them do as you have done, let them singe theireyebrows studying and come to be bald like myself, stuffing wholeparagraphs into their memories! I believe that if you talk Spanish itis because you have studied it--you're not of Manila or of Spanishparents! Then let them learn it as you have, and do as I have done:I've been a servant to all the friars, I've prepared their chocolate,and while with my right hand I stirred it, with the left I held agrammar, I learned, and, thank God! have never needed other teachersor academies or permits from the government. Believe me, he who wishesto learn, learns and becomes wise!""But how many among those who wish to learn come to be what youare? One in ten thousand, and more!""Pish! Why any more?" retorted the old man, shrugging hisshoulders. "There are too many lawyers now, many of them become mereclerks. Doctors? They insult and abuse one another, and even killeach other in competition for a patient. Laborers, sir, laborers,are what we need, for agriculture!"Isagani realized that he was losing time, but still could not forbearreplying: "Undoubtedly, there are many doctors and lawyers, but I won'tsay there are too many, since we have towns that lack them entirely,and if they do abound in quantity, perhaps they are deficient inquality. Since the young men can't be prevented from studying, andno other professions are open to us, why let them waste their timeand effort? And if the instruction, deficient as it is, does not keepmany from becoming lawyers and doctors, if we must finally have them,why not have good ones? After all, even if the sole wish is to makethe country a country of farmers and laborers, and condemn in it allintellectual activity, I don't see any evil in enlightening thosesame farmers and laborers, in giving them at least an education thatwill aid them in perfecting themselves and in perfecting their work,in placing them in a condition to understand many things of whichthey are at present ignorant.""Bah, bah, bah!" exclaimed the lawyer, drawing circles in the airwith his hand to dispel the ideas suggested. "To be a good farmer nogreat amount of rhetoric is needed. Dreams, illusions, fancies! Eh,will you take a piece of advice?"He arose and placed his hand affectionately on the youth's shoulder,as he continued: "I'm going to give you one, and a very good one,because I see that you are intelligent and the advice will not bewasted. You're going to study medicine? Well, confine yourself tolearning how to put on plasters and apply leeches, and don't ever tryto improve or impair the condition of your kind. When you become alicentiate, marry a rich and devout girl, try to make cures and chargewell, shun everything that has any relation to the general state ofthe country, attend mass, confession, and communion when the rest do,and you will see afterwards how you will thank me, and I shall seeit, if I am still alive. Always remember that charity begins at home,for man ought not to seek on earth more than the greatest amount ofhappiness for himself, as Bentham says. If you involve yourself inquixotisms you will have no career, nor will you get married, norwill you ever amount to anything. All will abandon you, your owncountrymen will be the first to laugh at your simplicity. Believeme, you will remember me and see that I am right, when you have grayhairs like myself, gray hairs such as these!"Here the old lawyer stroked his scanty white hair, as he smiled sadlyand shook his head."When I have gray hairs like those, sir," replied Isagani with equalsadness, "and turn my gaze back over my past and see that I haveworked only for myself, without having done what I plainly couldand should have done for the country that has given me everything,for the citizens that have helped me to live--then, sir, every grayhair will be a thorn, and instead of rejoicing, they will shame me!"So saying, he took his leave with a profound bow. The lawyer remainedmotionless in his place, with an amazed look on his face. He listenedto the footfalls that gradually died away, then resumed his seat."Poor boy!" he murmured, "similar thoughts also crossed my mindonce! What more could any one desire than to be able to say: 'Ihave done this for the good of the fatherland, I have consecratedmy life to the welfare of others!' A crown of laurel, steeped inaloes, dry leaves that cover thorns and worms! That is not life,that does not get us our daily bread, nor does it bring us honors--the laurel would hardly serve for a salad, nor produce ease, nor aidus in winning lawsuits, but quite the reverse! Every country has itscode of ethics, as it has its climate and its diseases, differentfrom the climate and the diseases of other countries."After a pause, he added: "Poor boy! If all should think and act ashe does, I don't say but that--Poor boy! Poor Florentino!"CHAPTER XVITHE TRIBULATIONS OF A CHINESEIn the evening of that same Saturday, Quiroga, the Chinese, whoaspired to the creation of a consulate for his nation, gave a dinnerin the rooms over his bazaar, located in the Escolta. His feast waswell attended: friars, government employees, soldiers, merchants,all of them his customers, partners or patrons, were to be seenthere, for his store supplied the curates and the conventos withall their necessities, he accepted the chits of all the employees,and he had servants who were discreet, prompt, and complaisant. Thefriars themselves did not disdain to pass whole hours in his store,sometimes in view of the public, sometimes in the chambers withagreeable company.That night, then, the sala presented a curious aspect, being filledwith friars and clerks seated on Vienna chairs, stools of black wood,and marble benches of Cantonese origin, before little square tables,playing cards or conversing among themselves, under the brilliant glareof the gilt chandeliers or the subdued light of the Chinese lanterns,which were brilliantly decorated with long silken tassels. On thewalls there was a lamentable medley of landscapes in dim and gaudycolors, painted in Canton or Hongkong, mingled with tawdry chromosof odalisks, half-nude women, effeminate lithographs of Christ,the deaths of the just and of the sinners--made by Jewish houses inGermany to be sold in the Catholic countries. Nor were there lackingthe Chinese prints on red paper representing a man seated, of venerableaspect, with a calm, smiling face, behind whom stood a servant, ugly,horrible, diabolical, threatening, armed with a lance having a wide,keen blade. Among the Indians some call this figure Mohammed, othersSantiago, [34] we do not know why, nor do the Chinese themselves givea very clear explanation of this popular pair. The pop of champagnecorks, the rattle of glasses, laughter, cigar smoke, and that odorpeculiar to a Chinese habitation--a mixture of punk, opium, and driedfruits--completed the collection.Dressed as a Chinese mandarin in a blue-tasseled cap, Quiroga movedfrom room to room, stiff and straight, but casting watchful glanceshere and there as though to assure himself that nothing was beingstolen. Yet in spite of this natural distrust, he exchanged handshakeswith each guest, greeted some with a smile sagacious and humble,others with a patronizing air, and still others with a certain shrewdlook that seemed to say, "I know! You didn't come on my account,you came for the dinner!"And Quiroga was right! That fat gentleman who is now praising himand speaking of the advisability of a Chinese consulate in Manila,intimating that to manage it there could be no one but Quiroga, is theSenor Gonzalez who hides behind the pseudonym _Pitili_ when he attacksChinese immigration through the columns of the newspapers. Thatother, an elderly man who closely examines the lamps, pictures,and other furnishings with grimaces and ejaculations of disdain,is Don Timoteo Pelaez, Juanito's father, a merchant who inveighsagainst the Chinese competition that is ruining his business. Theone over there, that thin, brown individual with a sharp look and apale smile, is the celebrated originator of the dispute over Mexicanpesos, which so troubled one of Quiroga's proteges: that governmentclerk is regarded in Manila as very clever. That one farther on, heof the frowning look and unkempt mustache, is a government officialwho passes for a most meritorious fellow because he has the courageto speak ill of the business in lottery tickets carried on betweenQuiroga and an exalted dame in Manila society. The fact is thattwo thirds of the tickets go to China and the few that are left inManila are sold at a premium of a half-real. The honorable gentlemanentertains the conviction that some day he will draw the first prize,and is in a rage at finding himself confronted with such tricks.The dinner, meanwhile, was drawing to an end. From the dining-roomfloated into the sala snatches of toasts, interruptions, bursts andripples of laughter. The name of Quiroga was often heard mingled withthe words "consul," "equality," "justice." The amphitryon himselfdid not eat European dishes, so he contented himself with drinkinga glass of wine with his guests from time to time, promising to dinewith those who were not seated at the first table.Simoun, who was present, having already dined, was in the sala talkingwith some merchants, who were complaining of business conditions:everything was going wrong, trade was paralyzed, the European exchangeswere exorbitantly high. They sought information from the jeweleror insinuated to him a few ideas, with the hope that these would becommunicated to the Captain-General. To all the remedies suggestedSimoun responded with a sarcastic and unfeeling exclamation aboutnonsense, until one of them in exasperation asked him for his opinion."My opinion?" he retorted. "Study how other nations prosper, and thendo as they do.""And why do they prosper, Senor Simoun?"Simoun replied with a shrug of his shoulders."The port works, which weigh so heavily upon commerce, and the portnot yet completed!" sighed Don Timoteo Pelaez. "A Penelope's web,as my son says, that is spun and unspun. The taxes--""You complaining!" exclaimed another. "Just as the General has decreedthe destruction of houses of light materials! [35] And you with ashipment of galvanized iron!""Yes," rejoined Don Timoteo, "but look what that decree cost me! Then,the destruction will not be carried out for a month, not until Lentbegins, and other shipments may arrive. I would have wished themdestroyed right away, but--Besides, what are the owners of thosehouses going to buy from me if they are all poor, all equally beggars?""You can always buy up their shacks for a trifle.""And afterwards have the decree revoked and sell them back at doublethe price--that's business!"Simoun smiled his frigid smile. Seeing Quiroga approach, he left thequerulous merchants to greet the future consul, who on catching sightof him lost his satisfied expression and assigned a countenance likethose of the merchants, while he bent almost double.Quiroga respected the jeweler greatly, not only because he knew himto be very wealthy, but also on account of his rumored influencewith the Captain-General. It was reported that Simoun favoredQuiroga's ambitions, that he was an advocate for the consulate,and a certain newspaper hostile to the Chinese had alluded to himin many paraphrases, veiled allusions, and suspension points, in thecelebrated controversy with another sheet that was favorable to thequeued folk. Some prudent persons added with winks and half-utteredwords that his Black Eminence was advising the General to avail himselfof the Chinese in order to humble the tenacious pride of the natives."To hold the people in subjection," he was reported to have said,"there's nothing like humiliating them and humbling them in theirown eyes."To this end an opportunity had soon presented itself. The guildsof mestizos and natives were continually watching one another,venting their bellicose spirits and their activities in jealousyand distrust. At mass one day the gobernadorcillo of the natives wasseated on a bench to the right, and, being extremely thin, happenedto cross one of his legs over the other, thus adopting a nonchalantattitude, in order to expose his thighs more and display his prettyshoes. The gobernadorcillo of the guild of mestizos, who was seated onthe opposite bench, as he had bunions, and could not cross his legs onaccount of his obesity, spread his legs wide apart to expose a plainwaistcoat adorned with a beautiful gold chain set with diamonds. Thetwo cliques comprehended these maneuvers and joined battle. On thefollowing Sunday all the mestizos, even the thinnest, had largepaunches and spread their legs wide apart as though on horseback,while the natives placed one leg over the other, even the fattest,there being one cabeza de barangay who turned a somersault. Seeingthese movements, the Chinese all adopted their own peculiar attitude,that of sitting as they do in their shops, with one leg drawn backand upward, the other swinging loose. There resulted protests andpetitions, the police rushed to arms ready to start a civil war,the curates rejoiced, the Spaniards were amused and made money outof everybody, until the General settled the quarrel by ordering thatevery one should sit as the Chinese did, since they were the heaviestcontributors, even though they were not the best Catholics. Thedifficulty for the mestizos and natives then was that their trouserswere too tight to permit of their imitating the Chinese. But to makethe intention of humiliating them the more evident, the measure wascarried out with great pomp and ceremony, the church being surroundedby a troop of cavalry, while all those within were sweating. The matterwas carried to the Cortes, but it was repeated that the Chinese, asthe ones who paid, should have their way in the religious ceremonies,even though they apostatized and laughed at Christianity immediatelyafter. The natives and the mestizos had to be content, learning thusnot to waste time over such fatuity. [36]Quiroga, with his smooth tongue and humble smile, was lavishly andflatteringly attentive to Simoun. His voice was caressing and hisbows numerous, but the jeweler cut his blandishments short by askingbrusquely:"Did the bracelets suit her?"At this question all Quiroga's liveliness vanished like a dream. Hiscaressing voice became plaintive; he bowed lower, gave the Chinesesalutation of raising his clasped hands to the height of his face,and groaned: "Ah, Senor Simoun! I'm lost, I'm ruined!" [37]"How, Quiroga, lost and ruined when you have so many bottles ofchampagne and so many guests?"Quiroga closed his eyes and made a grimace. Yes, the affair of thatafternoon, that affair of the bracelets, had ruined him. Simoun smiled,for when a Chinese merchant complains it is because all is going well,and when he makes a show that things are booming it is quite certainthat he is planning an assignment or flight to his own country."You didn't know that I'm lost, I'm ruined? Ah, Senor Simoun, I'm_busted!_" To make his condition plainer, he illustrated the word bymaking a movement as though he were falling in collapse.Simoun wanted to laugh, but restrained himself and said that he knewnothing, nothing at all, as Quiroga led him to a room and closed thedoor. He then explained the cause of his misfortune.Three diamond bracelets that he had secured from Simoun on pretenseof showing them to his wife were not for her, a poor native shut up inher room like a Chinese woman, but for a beautiful and charming lady,the friend of a powerful man, whose influence was needed by him ina certain deal in which he could clear some six thousand pesos. Ashe did not understand feminine tastes and wished to be gallant, theChinese had asked for the three finest bracelets the jeweler had, eachpriced at three to four thousand pesos. With affected simplicity andhis most caressing smile, Quiroga had begged the lady to select theone she liked best, and the lady, more simple and caressing still,had declared that she liked all three, and had kept them.Simoun burst out into laughter."Ah, sir, I'm lost, I'm ruined!" cried the Chinese, slapping himselflightly with his delicate hands; but the jeweler continued hislaughter."Ugh, bad people, surely not a real lady," went on the Chinaman,shaking his head in disgust. "What! She has no decency, while me,a Chinaman, me always polite! Ah, surely she not a real lady--a_cigarrera_ has more decency!""They've caught you, they've caught you!" exclaimed Simoun, pokinghim in the chest."And everybody's asking for loans and never pays--what aboutthat? Clerks, officials, lieutenants, soldiers--" he checked them offon his long-nailed fingers--"ah, Senor Simoun, I'm lost, I'm _busted_!""Get out with your complaints," said Simoun. "I've saved you from manyofficials that wanted money from you. I've lent it to them so thatthey wouldn't bother you, even when I knew that they couldn't pay.""But, Senor Simoun, you lend to officials; I lend to women, sailors,everybody.""I bet you get your money back.""Me, money back? Ah, surely you don't understand! When it's lost ingambling they never pay. Besides, you have a consul, you can forcethem, but I haven't."Simoun became thoughtful. "Listen, Quiroga," he said, somewhatabstractedly, "I'll undertake to collect what the officers and sailorsowe you. Give me their notes."Quiroga again fell to whining: they had never given him any notes."When they come to you asking for money, send them to me. I want tohelp you."The grateful Quiroga thanked him, but soon fell to lamenting againabout the bracelets. "A _cigarrera_ wouldn't be so shameless!" herepeated."The devil!" exclaimed Simoun, looking askance at the Chinese, asthough studying him. "Exactly when I need the money and thought thatyou could pay me! But it can all be arranged, as I don't want youto fail for such a small amount. Come, a favor, and I'll reduce toseven the nine thousand pesos you owe me. You can get anything youwish through the Customs--boxes of lamps, iron, copper, glassware,Mexican pesos--you furnish arms to the conventos, don't you?"The Chinese nodded affirmation, but remarked that he had to do a gooddeal of bribing. "I furnish the padres everything!""Well, then," added Simoun in a low voice, "I need you to get in forme some boxes of rifles that arrived this evening. I want you to keepthem in your warehouse; there isn't room for all of them in my house."Quiroga began to show symptoms of fright."Don't get scared, you don't run any risk. These rifles are to beconcealed, a few at a time, in various dwellings, then a search willbe instituted, and many people will be sent to prison. You and I canmake a haul getting them set free. Understand me?"Quiroga wavered, for he was afraid of firearms. In his desk he hadan empty revolver that he never touched without turning his head awayand closing his eyes."If you can't do it, I'll have to apply to some one else, but then I'llneed the nine thousand pesos to cross their palms and shut their eyes.""All right, all right!" Quiroga finally agreed. "But many people willbe arrested? There'll be a search, eh?"When Quiroga and Simoun returned to the sala they found there, inanimated conversation, those who had finished their dinner, for thechampagne had loosened their tongues and stirred their brains. Theywere talking rather freely.In a group where there were a number of government clerks, some ladies,and Don Custodio, the topic was a commission sent to India to makecertain investigations about footwear for the soldiers."Who compose it?" asked an elderly lady."A colonel, two other officers, and his Excellency's nephew.""Four?" rejoined a clerk. "What a commission! Suppose theydisagree--are they competent?""That's what I asked," replied a clerk. "It's said that one civilianought to go, one who has no military prejudices--a shoemaker,for instance.""That's right," added an importer of shoes, "but it wouldn't doto send an Indian or a Chinaman, and the only Peninsular shoemakerdemanded such large fees--""But why do they have to make any investigations aboutfootwear?" inquired the elderly lady. "It isn't for the Peninsularartillerymen. The Indian soldiers can go barefoot, as they do intheir towns." [38]"Exactly so, and the treasury would save more," corroborated anotherlady, a widow who was not satisfied with her pension."But you must remember," remarked another in the group, a friend ofthe officers on the commission, "that while it's true they go barefootin the towns, it's not the same as moving about under orders in theservice. They can't choose the hour, nor the road, nor rest whenthey wish. Remember, madam, that, with the noonday sun overhead andthe earth below baking like an oven, they have to march over sandystretches, where there are stones, the sun above and fire below,bullets in front--""It's only a question of getting used to it!""Like the donkey that got used to not eating! In our present campaignthe greater part of our losses have been due to wounds on the solesof the feet. Remember the donkey, madam, remember the donkey!""But, my dear sir," retorted the lady, "look how much money is wastedon shoe-leather. There's enough to pension many widows and orphansin order to maintain our prestige. Don't smile, for I'm not talkingabout myself, and I have my pension, even though a very small one,insignificant considering the services my husband rendered, but I'mtalking of others who are dragging out miserable lives! It's notright that after so much persuasion to come and so many hardships incrossing the sea they should end here by dying of hunger. What you sayabout the soldiers may be true, but the fact is that I've been in thecountry more than three years, and I haven't seen any soldier limping.""In that I agree with the lady," said her neighbor. "Why issue themshoes when they were born without them?""And why shirts?""And why trousers?""Just calculate what we should economize on soldiers clothed only intheir skins!" concluded he who was defending the army.In another group the conversation was more heated. Ben-Zayb wastalking and declaiming, while Padre Camorra, as usual, was constantlyinterrupting him. The friar-journalist, in spite of his respect forthe cowled gentry, was always at loggerheads with Padre Camorra,whom he regarded as a silly half-friar, thus giving himself theappearance of being independent and refuting the accusations of thosewho called him Fray Ibanez. Padre Camorra liked his adversary, as thelatter was the only person who would take seriously what he styledhis arguments. They were discussing magnetism, spiritualism, magic,and the like. Their words flew through the air like the knives andballs of jugglers, tossed back and forth from one to the other.That year great attention had been attracted in the Quiapo fairby a head, wrongly called a sphinx, exhibited by Mr. Leeds, anAmerican. Glaring advertisements covered the walls of the houses,mysterious and funereal, to excite the curiosity of the public. NeitherBen-Zayb nor any of the padres had yet seen it; Juanito Pelaez was theonly one who had, and he was describing his wonderment to the party.Ben-Zayb, as a journalist, looked for a natural explanation. PadreCamorra talked of the devil, Padre Irene smiled, Padre Salvi remainedgrave."But, Padre, the devil doesn't need to come--we are sufficient todamn ourselves--""It can't be explained any other way.""If science--""Get out with science, _punales_!""But, listen to me and I'll convince you. It's all a question ofoptics. I haven't yet seen the head nor do I know how it looks, butthis gentleman"--indicating Juanito Pelaez--"tells us that it does notlook like the talking heads that are usually exhibited. So be it! Butthe principle is the same--it's all a question of optics. Wait! Amirror is placed thus, another mirror behind it, the image isreflected--I say, it is purely a problem in physics."Taking down from the walls several mirrors, he arranged them, turnedthem round and round, but, not getting the desired result, concluded:"As I say, it's nothing more or less than a question of optics.""But what do you want mirrors for, if Juanito tells us that the head isinside a box placed on the table? I see in it spiritualism, because thespiritualists always make use of tables, and I think that Padre Salvi,as the ecclesiastical governor, ought to prohibit the exhibition."Padre Salvi remained silent, saying neither yes nor no."In order to learn if there are devils or mirrors inside it,"suggested Simoun, "the best thing would be for you to go and see thefamous sphinx."The proposal was a good one, so it was accepted, although PadreSalvi and Don Custodio showed some repugnance. They at a fair, to rubshoulders with the public, to see sphinxes and talking heads! Whatwould the natives say? These might take them for mere men, endowedwith the same passions and weaknesses as others. But Ben-Zayb, withhis journalistic ingenuity, promised to request Mr. Leeds not toadmit the public while they were inside. They would be honoring himsufficiently by the visit not to admit of his refusal, and besideshe would not charge any admission fee. To give a show of probabilityto this, he concluded: "Because, remember, if I should expose thetrick of the mirrors to the public, it would ruin the poor American'sbusiness." Ben-Zayb was a conscientious individual.About a dozen set out, among them our acquaintances, Padres Salvi,Camorra, and Irene, Don Custodio, Ben-Zayb, and Juanito Pelaez. Theircarriages set them down at the entrance to the Quiapo Plaza.CHAPTER XVIITHE QUIAPO FAIRIt was a beautiful night and the plaza presented a most animatedaspect. Taking advantage of the freshness of the breeze and thesplendor of the January moon, the people filled the fair to see, beseen, and amuse themselves. The music of the cosmoramas and the lightsof the lanterns gave life and merriment to every one. Long rows ofbooths, brilliant with tinsel and gauds, exposed to view clusters ofballs, masks strung by the eyes, tin toys, trains, carts, mechanicalhorses, carriages, steam-engines with diminutive boilers, Lilliputiantableware of porcelain, pine Nativities, dolls both foreign anddomestic, the former red and smiling, the latter sad and pensive likelittle ladies beside gigantic children. The beating of drums, the roarof tin horns, the wheezy music of the accordions and the hand-organs,all mingled in a carnival concert, amid the coming and going of thecrowd, pushing, stumbling over one another, with their faces turnedtoward the booths, so that the collisions were frequent and oftenamusing. The carriages were forced to move slowly, with the _tabi_ ofthe cocheros repeated every moment. Met and mingled government clerks,soldiers, friars, students, Chinese, girls with their mammas or aunts,all greeting, signaling, calling to one another merrily.Padre Camorra was in the seventh heaven at the sight of so many prettygirls. He stopped, looked back, nudged Ben-Zayb, chuckled and swore,saying, "And that one, and that one, my ink-slinger? And that oneover there, what say you?" In his contentment he even fell to usingthe familiar _tu_ toward his friend and adversary. Padre Salvi staredat him from time to time, but he took little note of Padre Salvi. Onthe contrary, he pretended to stumble so that he might brush againstthe girls, he winked and made eyes at them."_Punales!_" he kept saying to himself. "When shall I be the curateof Quiapo?"Suddenly Ben-Zayb let go an oath, jumped aside, and slapped his handon his arm; Padre Camorra in his excess of enthusiasm had pinchedhim. They were approaching a dazzling senorita who was attracting theattention of the whole plaza, and Padre Camorra, unable to restrainhis delight, had taken Ben-Zayb's arm as a substitute for the girl's.It was Paulita Gomez, the prettiest of the pretty, in company withIsagani, followed by Dona Victorina. The young woman was resplendentin her beauty: all stopped and craned their necks, while they ceasedtheir conversation and followed her with their eyes--even DonaVictorina was respectfully saluted.Paulita was arrayed in a rich camisa and panuelo of embroidered pina,different from those she had worn that morning to the church. Thegauzy texture of the pina set off her shapely head, and the Indianswho saw her compared her to the moon surrounded by fleecy clouds. Asilk rose-colored skirt, caught up in rich and graceful folds by herlittle hand, gave majesty to her erect figure, the movement of which,harmonizing with her curving neck, displayed all the triumphs of vanityand satisfied coquetry. Isagani appeared to be rather disgusted,for so many curious eyes fixed upon the beauty of his sweetheartannoyed him. The stares seemed to him robbery and the girl's smilesfaithlessness.Juanito saw her and his hump increased when he spoke to her. Paulitareplied negligently, while Dona Victorina called to him, for Juanitowas her favorite, she preferring him to Isagani."What a girl, what a girl!" muttered the entranced Padre Camorra."Come, Padre, pinch yourself and let me alone," said Ben-Zaybfretfully."What a girl, what a girl!" repeated the friar. "And she has for asweetheart a pupil of mine, the boy I had the quarrel with.""Just my luck that she's not of my town," he added, after turninghis head several times to follow her with his looks. He was eventempted to leave his companions to follow the girl, and Ben-Zayb haddifficulty in dissuading him. Paulita's beautiful figure moved on,her graceful little head nodding with inborn coquetry.Our promenaders kept on their way, not without sighs on the partof the friar-artilleryman, until they reached a booth surrounded bysightseers, who quickly made way for them. It was a shop of littlewooden figures, of local manufacture, representing in all shapes andsizes the costumes, races, and occupations of the country: Indians,Spaniards, Chinese, mestizos, friars, clergymen, government clerks,gobernadorcillos, students, soldiers, and so on.Whether the artists had more affection for the priests, the foldsof whose habits were better suited to their esthetic purposes, orwhether the friars, holding such an important place in Philippine life,engaged the attention of the sculptor more, the fact was that, for onecause or another, images of them abounded, well-turned and finished,representing them in the sublimest moments of their lives--the oppositeof what is done in Europe, where they are pictured as sleeping oncasks of wine, playing cards, emptying tankards, rousing themselvesto gaiety, or patting the cheeks of a buxom girl. No, the friarsof the Philippines were different: elegant, handsome, well-dressed,their tonsures neatly shaven, their features symmetrical and serene,their gaze meditative, their expression saintly, somewhat rosy-cheeked,cane in hand and patent-leather shoes on their feet, inviting adorationand a place in a glass case. Instead of the symbols of gluttony andincontinence of their brethren in Europe, those of Manila carried thebook, the crucifix, and the palm of martyrdom; instead of kissing thesimple country lasses, those of Manila gravely extended the hand tobe kissed by children and grown men doubled over almost to kneeling;instead of the full refectory and dining-hall, their stage in Europe,in Manila they had the oratory, the study-table; instead of themendicant friar who goes from door to door with his donkey and sack,begging alms, the friars of the Philippines scattered gold from fullhands among the miserable Indians."Look, here's Padre Camorra!" exclaimed Ben-Zayb, upon whom the effectof the champagne still lingered. He pointed to a picture of a leanfriar of thoughtful mien who was seated at a table with his headresting on the palm of his hand, apparently writing a sermon by thelight of a lamp. The contrast suggested drew laughter from the crowd.Padre Camorra, who had already forgotten about Paulita, saw what wasmeant and laughing his clownish laugh, asked in turn, "Whom does thisother figure resemble, Ben-Zayb?"It was an old woman with one eye, with disheveled hair, seated onthe ground like an Indian idol, ironing clothes. The sad-iron wascarefully imitated, being of copper with coals of red tinsel andsmoke-wreaths of dirty twisted cotton."Eh, Ben-Zayb, it wasn't a fool who designed that" asked Padre Camorrawith a laugh."Well, I don't see the point," replied the journalist."But, _punales_, don't you see the title, _The Philippine Press_? Thatutensil with which the old woman is ironing is here called the press!"All laughed at this, Ben-Zayb himself joining in good-naturedly.Two soldiers of the Civil Guard, appropriately labeled, were placedbehind a man who was tightly bound and had his face covered by hishat. It was entitled _The Country of Abaka_, [39] and from appearancesthey were going to shoot him.Many of our visitors were displeased with the exhibition. They talkedof rules of art, they sought proportion--one said that this figure didnot have seven heads, that the face lacked a nose, having only three,all of which made Padre Camorra somewhat thoughtful, for he did notcomprehend how a figure, to be correct, need have four noses andseven heads. Others said, if they were muscular, that they could notbe Indians; still others remarked that it was not sculpture, but merecarpentry. Each added his spoonful of criticism, until Padre Camorra,not to be outdone, ventured to ask for at least thirty legs for eachdoll, because, if the others wanted noses, couldn't he require feet? Sothey fell to discussing whether the Indian had or had not any aptitudefor sculpture, and whether it would be advisable to encourage thatart, until there arose a general dispute, which was cut short by DonCustodio's declaration that the Indians had the aptitude, but thatthey should devote themselves exclusively to the manufacture of saints."One would say," observed Ben-Zayb, who was full of bright ideasthat night, "that this Chinaman is Quiroga, but on close examinationit looks like Padre Irene. And what do you say about that BritishIndian? He looks like Simoun!"Fresh peals of laughter resounded, while Padre Irene rubbed his nose."That's right!""It's the very image of him!""But where is Simoun? Simoun should buy it."But the jeweler had disappeared, unnoticed by any one."_Punales!_" exclaimed Padre Camorra, "how stingy the Americanis! He's afraid we would make him pay the admission for all of usinto Mr. Leeds' show.""No!" rejoined Ben-Zayb, "what he's afraid of is that he'll compromisehimself. He may have foreseen the joke in store for his friendMr. Leeds and has got out of the way."Thus, without purchasing the least trifle, they continued on theirway to see the famous sphinx. Ben-Zayb offered to manage the affair,for the American would not rebuff a journalist who could take revengein an unfavorable article. "You'll see that it's all a questionof mirrors," he said, "because, you see--" Again he plunged into along demonstration, and as he had no mirrors at hand to discredithis theory he tangled himself up in all kinds of blunders and woundup by not knowing himself what he was saying. "In short, you'll seehow it's all a question of optics."CHAPTER XVIIILEGERDEMAINMr. Leeds, a genuine Yankee, dressed completely in black, received hisvisitors with great deference. He spoke Spanish well, from having beenfor many years in South America, and offered no objection to theirrequest, saying that they might examine everything, both before andafter the exhibition, but begged that they remain quiet while it wasin progress. Ben-Zayb smiled in pleasant anticipation of the vexationhe had prepared for the American.The room, hung entirely in black, was lighted by ancient lamps burningalcohol. A rail wrapped in black velvet divided it into two almostequal parts, one of which was filled with seats for the spectators andthe other occupied by a platform covered with a checkered carpet. Inthe center of this platform was placed a table, over which was spreada piece of black cloth adorned with skulls and cabalistic signs. The_mise en scene_ was therefore lugubrious and had its effect uponthe merry visitors. The jokes died away, they spoke in whispers,and however much some tried to appear indifferent, their lips framedno smiles. All felt as if they had entered a house where there was acorpse, an illusion accentuated by an odor of wax and incense. DonCustodio and Padre Salvi consulted in whispers over the expediencyof prohibiting such shows.Ben-Zayb, in order to cheer the dispirited group and embarrassMr. Leeds, said to him in a familiar tone: "Eh, Mister, since thereare none but ourselves here and we aren't Indians who can be fooled,won't you let us see the trick? We know of course that it's purelya question of optics, but as Padre Camorra won't be convinced--"Here he started to jump over the rail, instead of going through theproper opening, while Padre Camorra broke out into protests, fearingthat Ben-Zayb might be right."And why not, sir?" rejoined the American. "But don't break anything,will you?"The journalist was already on the platform. "You will allow me,then?" he asked, and without waiting for the permission, fearing thatit might not be granted, raised the cloth to look for the mirrorsthat he expected should be between the legs of the table. Ben-Zaybuttered an exclamation and stepped back, again placed both hands underthe table and waved them about; he encountered only empty space. Thetable had three thin iron legs, sunk into the floor.The journalist looked all about as though seeking something."Where are the mirrors?" asked Padre Camorra.Ben-Zayb looked and looked, felt the table with his fingers, raisedthe cloth again, and rubbed his hand over his forehead from time totime, as if trying to remember something."Have you lost anything?" inquired Mr. Leeds."The mirrors, Mister, where are the mirrors?""I don't know where yours are--mine are at the hotel. Do you want tolook at yourself? You're somewhat pale and excited."Many laughed, in spite of their weird impressions, on seeing thejesting coolness of the American, while Ben-Zayb retired, quiteabashed, to his seat, muttering, "It can't be. You'll see that hedoesn't do it without mirrors. The table will have to be changedlater."Mr. Leeds placed the cloth on the table again and turning toward hisillustrious audience, asked them, "Are you satisfied? May we begin?""Hurry up! How cold-blooded he is!" said the widow."Then, ladies and gentlemen, take your seats and get your questionsready."Mr. Leeds disappeared through a doorway and in a few moments returnedwith a black box of worm-eaten wood, covered with inscriptions inthe form of birds, beasts, and human heads."Ladies and gentlemen," he began solemnly, "once having had occasionto visit the great pyramid of Khufu, a Pharaoh of the fourth dynasty,I chanced upon a sarcophagus of red granite in a forgotten chamber. Myjoy was great, for I thought that I had found a royal mummy, but whatwas my disappointment on opening the coffin, at the cost of infinitelabor, to find nothing more than this box, which you may examine."He handed the box to those in the front row. Padre Camorra drew back inloathing, Padre Salvi looked at it closely as if he enjoyed sepulchralthings, Padre Irene smiled a knowing smile, Don Custodio affectedgravity and disdain, while Ben-Zayb hunted for his mirrors--therethey must be, for it was a question of mirrors."It smells like a corpse," observed one lady, fanning herselffuriously. "Ugh!""It smells of forty centuries," remarked some one with emphasis.Ben-Zayb forgot about his mirrors to discover who had made thisremark. It was a military official who had read the history ofNapoleon.Ben-Zayb felt jealous and to utter another epigram that might annoyPadre Camorra a little said, "It smells of the Church.""This box, ladies and gentlemen," continued the American, "containeda handful of ashes and a piece of papyrus on which were writtensome words. Examine them yourselves, but I beg of you not to breatheheavily, because if any of the dust is lost my sphinx will appear ina mutilated condition."The humbug, described with such seriousness and conviction, wasgradually having its effect, so much so that when the box was passedaround, no one dared to breathe. Padre Camorra, who had so oftendepicted from the pulpit of Tiani the torments and sufferings of hell,while he laughed in his sleeves at the terrified looks of the sinners,held his nose, and Padre Salvi--the same Padre Salvi who had on AllSouls' Day prepared a phantasmagoria of the souls in purgatory withflames and transparencies illuminated with alcohol lamps and coveredwith tinsel, on the high altar of the church in a suburb, in orderto get alms and orders for masses--the lean and taciturn Padre Salviheld his breath and gazed suspiciously at that handful of ashes."_Memento, homo, quia pulvis es_!" muttered Padre Irene with a smile."Pish!" sneered Ben-Zayb--the same thought had occurred to him,and the Canon had taken the words out of his mouth."Not knowing what to do," resumed Mr. Leeds, closing the box carefully,"I examined the papyrus and discovered two words whose meaningwas unknown to me. I deciphered them, and tried to pronounce themaloud. Scarcely had I uttered the first word when I felt the boxslipping from my hands, as if pressed down by an enormous weight,and it glided along the floor, whence I vainly endeavored to removeit. But my surprise was converted into terror when it opened and Ifound within a human head that stared at me fixedly. Paralyzed withfright and uncertain what to do in the presence of such a phenomenon,I remained for a time stupefied, trembling like a person poisonedwith mercury, but after a while recovered myself and, thinking thatit was a vain illusion, tried to divert my attention by readingthe second word. Hardly had I pronounced it when the box closed,the head disappeared, and in its place I again found the handful ofashes. Without suspecting it I had discovered the two most potentwords in nature, the words of creation and destruction, of life andof death!"He paused for a few moments to note the effect of his story, thenwith grave and measured steps approached the table and placed themysterious box upon it."The cloth, Mister!" exclaimed the incorrigible Ben-Zayb."Why not?" rejoined Mr. Leeds, very complaisantly.Lifting the box with his right hand, he caught up the cloth with hisleft, completely exposing the table sustained by its three legs. Againhe placed the box upon the center and with great gravity turned tohis audience."Here's what I want to see," said Ben-Zayb to his neighbor. "Younotice how he makes some excuse."Great attention was depicted on all countenances and silencereigned. The noise and roar of the street could be distinctly heard,but all were so affected that a snatch of dialogue which reached themproduced no effect."Why can't we go in?" asked a woman's voice."_Aba_, there's a lot of friars and clerks in there," answered aman. "The sphinx is for them only.""The friars are inquisitive too," said the woman's voice, drawingaway. "They don't want us to know how they're being fooled. Why,is the head a friar's _querida_?"In the midst of a profound silence the American announced in a toneof emotion: "Ladies and gentlemen, with a word I am now going toreanimate the handful of ashes, and you will talk with a being thatknows the past, the present, and much of the future!"Here the prestidigitator uttered a soft cry, first mournful, thenlively, a medley of sharp sounds like imprecations and hoarse noteslike threats, which made Ben-Zayb's hair stand on end."_Deremof_!" cried the American.The curtains on the wall rustled, the lamps burned low, the tablecreaked. A feeble groan responded from the interior of the box. Paleand uneasy, all stared at one another, while one terrified senoracaught hold of Padre Salvi.The box then opened of its own accord and presented to the eyes ofthe audience a head of cadaverous aspect, surrounded by long andabundant black hair. It slowly opened its eyes and looked aroundthe whole audience. Those eyes had a vivid radiance, accentuated bytheir cavernous sockets, and, as if deep were calling unto deep,fixed themselves upon the profound, sunken eyes of the tremblingPadre Salvi, who was staring unnaturally, as though he saw a ghost."Sphinx," commanded Mr. Leeds, "tell the audience who you are."A deep silence prevailed, while a chill wind blew through the roomand made the blue flames of the sepulchral lamps flicker. The mostskeptical shivered."I am Imuthis," declared the head in a funereal, but strangelymenacing, voice. "I was born in the time of Amasis and died under thePersian domination, when Cambyses was returning from his disastrousexpedition into the interior of Libya. I had come to complete myeducation after extensive travels through Greece, Assyria, and Persia,and had returned to my native laud to dwell in it until Thoth shouldcall me before his terrible tribunal. But to my undoing, on passingthrough Babylonia, I discovered an awful secret--the secret of thefalse Smerdis who usurped the throne, the bold Magian Gaumata whogoverned as an impostor. Fearing that I would betray him to Cambyses,he determined upon my ruin through the instrumentality of the Egyptianpriests, who at that time ruled my native country. They were theowners of two-thirds of the land, the monopolizers of learning, theyheld the people down in ignorance and tyranny, they brutalized them,thus making them fit to pass without resistance from one dominationto another. The invaders availed themselves of them, and knowing theirusefulness, protected and enriched them. The rulers not only dependedon their will, but some were reduced to mere instruments of theirs. TheEgyptian priests hastened to execute Gaumata's orders, with greaterzeal from their fear of me, because they were afraid that I wouldreveal their impostures to the people. To accomplish their purpose,they made use of a young priest of Abydos, who passed for a saint."A painful silence followed these words. That head was talkingof priestly intrigues and impostures, and although referring toanother age and other creeds, all the friars present were annoyed,possibly because they could see in the general trend of the speechsome analogy to the existing situation. Padre Salvi was in the gripof convulsive shivering; he worked his lips and with bulging eyesfollowed the gaze of the head as though fascinated. Beads of sweatbegan to break out on his emaciated face, but no one noticed this,so deeply absorbed and affected were they."What was the plot concocted by the priests of your country againstyou?" asked Mr. Leeds.The head uttered a sorrowful groan, which seemed to come from thebottom of the heart, and the spectators saw its eyes, those fieryeyes, clouded and filled with tears. Many shuddered and felt theirhair rise. No, that was not an illusion, it was not a trick: the headwas the victim and what it told was its own story."Ay!" it moaned, shaking with affliction, "I loved a maiden,the daughter of a priest, pure as light, like the freshly openedlotus! The young priest of Abydos also desired her and planned arebellion, using my name and some papyri that he had secured frommy beloved. The rebellion broke out at the time when Cambyses wasreturning in rage over the disasters of his unfortunate campaign. I wasaccused of being a rebel, was made a prisoner, and having effected myescape was killed in the chase on Lake Moeris. From out of eternityI saw the imposture triumph. I saw the priest of Abydos night andday persecuting the maiden, who had taken refuge in a temple of Isison the island of Philae. I saw him persecute and harass her, evenin the subterranean chambers, I saw him drive her mad with terrorand suffering, like a huge bat pursuing a white dove. Ah, priest,priest of Abydos, I have returned to life to expose your infamy, andafter so many years of silence, I name thee murderer, hypocrite, liar!"A dry, hollow laugh accompanied these words, while a choked voiceresponded, "No! Mercy!"It was Padre Salvi, who had been overcome with terror and with armsextended was slipping in collapse to the floor."What's the matter with your Reverence? Are you ill?" asked PadreIrene."The heat of the room--""This odor of corpses we're breathing here--""Murderer, slanderer, hypocrite!" repeated the head. "I accuseyou--murderer, murderer, murderer!"Again the dry laugh, sepulchral and menacing, resounded, as thoughthat head were so absorbed in contemplation of its wrongs that itdid not see the tumult that prevailed in the room."Mercy! She still lives!" groaned Padre Salvi, and then lostconsciousness. He was as pallid as a corpse. Some of the ladiesthought it their duty to faint also, and proceeded to do so."He is out of his head! Padre Salvi!""I told him not to eat that bird's-nest soup," said Padre Irene. "Ithas made him sick.""But he didn't eat anything," rejoined Don Custodio shivering. "Asthe head has been staring at him fixedly, it has mesmerized him."So disorder prevailed, the room seemed to be a hospital or abattlefield. Padre Salvi looked like a corpse, and the ladies,seeing that no one was paying them any attention, made the best ofit by recovering.Meanwhile, the head had been reduced to ashes, and Mr. Leeds, havingreplaced the cloth on the table, bowed his audience out."This show must be prohibited," said Don Custodio on leaving. "It'swicked and highly immoral.""And above all, because it doesn't use mirrors," added Ben-Zayb,who before going out of the room tried to assure himself finally,so he leaped over the rail, went up to the table, and raised thecloth: nothing, absolutely nothing! [40] On the following day hewrote an article in which he spoke of occult sciences, spiritualism,and the like.An order came immediately from the ecclesiastical governor prohibitingthe show, but Mr. Leeds had already disappeared, carrying his secretwith him to Hongkong.CHAPTER XIXTHE FUSEPlacido Penitente left the class with his heart overflowing withbitterness and sullen gloom in his looks. He was worthy of his namewhen not driven from his usual course, but once irritated he was averitable torrent, a wild beast that could only be stopped by thedeath of himself or his foe. So many affronts, so many pinpricks,day after day, had made his heart quiver, lodging in it to sleep thesleep of lethargic vipers, and they now were awaking to shake andhiss with fury. The hisses resounded in his ears with the jestingepithets of the professor, the phrases in the slang of the markets,and he seemed to hear blows and laughter. A thousand schemes forrevenge rushed into his brain, crowding one another, only to fadeimmediately like phantoms in a dream. His vanity cried out to himwith desperate tenacity that he must do something."Placido Penitente," said the voice, "show these youths that youhave dignity, that you are the son of a valiant and noble province,where wrongs are washed out with blood. You're a Batangan, PlacidoPenitente! Avenge yourself, Placido Penitente!"The youth groaned and gnashed his teeth, stumbling against everyone in the street and on the Bridge of Spain, as if he were seekinga quarrel. In the latter place he saw a carriage in which was theVice-Rector, Padre Sibyla, accompanied by Don Custodio, and he hada great mind to seize the friar and throw him into the river.He proceeded along the Escolta and was tempted to assault twoAugustinians who were seated in the doorway of Quiroga's bazaar,laughing and joking with other friars who must have been inside injoyous conversation, for their merry voices and sonorous laughtercould be heard. Somewhat farther on, two cadets blocked up thesidewalk, talking with the clerk of a warehouse, who was in hisshirtsleeves. Penitents moved toward them to force a passage andthey, perceiving his dark intention, good-humoredly made way forhim. Placido was by this time under the influence of the _amok_,as the Malayists say.As he approached his home--the house of a silversmith where he lived asa boarder--he tried to collect his thoughts and make a plan--to returnto his town and avenge himself by showing the friars that they couldnot with impunity insult a youth or make a joke of him. He decided towrite a letter immediately to his mother, Cabesang Andang, to informher of what had happened and to tell her that the schoolroom had closedforever for him. Although there was the Ateneo of the Jesuits, where hemight study that year, yet it was not very likely that the Dominicanswould grant him the transfer, and, even though he should secure it,in the following year he would have to return to the University."They say that we don't know how to avenge ourselves!" hemuttered. "Let the lightning strike and we'll see!"But Placido was not reckoning upon what awaited him in the houseof the silversmith. Cabesang Andang had just arrived from Batangas,having come to do some shopping, to visit her son, and to bring himmoney, jerked venison, and silk handkerchiefs.The first greetings over, the poor woman, who had at once noticed herson's gloomy look, could no longer restrain her curiosity and beganto ask questions. His first explanations Cabesang Andang regarded assome subterfuge, so she smiled and soothed her son, reminding him oftheir sacrifices and privations. She spoke of Capitana Simona's son,who, having entered the seminary, now carried himself in the town likea bishop, and Capitana Simona already considered herself a Mother ofGod, clearly so, for her son was going to be another Christ."If the son becomes a priest," said she, "the mother won't have topay us what she owes us. Who will collect from her then?"But on seeing that Placido was speaking seriously and reading in hiseyes the storm that raged within him, she realized that what he wastelling her was unfortunately the strict truth. She remained silentfor a while and then broke out into lamentations."Ay!" she exclaimed. "I promised your father that I would care foryou, educate you, and make a lawyer of you! I've deprived myself ofeverything so that you might go to school! Instead of joining the_panguingui_ where the stake is a half peso, I Ve gone only where it'sa half real, enduring the bad smells and the dirty cards. Look at mypatched camisa; for instead of buying new ones I've spent the money inmasses and presents to St. Sebastian, even though I don't have greatconfidence in his power, because the curate recites the masses fastand hurriedly, he's an entirely new saint and doesn't yet know howto perform miracles, and isn't made of _batikulin_ but of _lanete._Ay, what will your father say to me when I die and see him again!"So the poor woman lamented and wept, while Placido became gloomierand let stifled sighs escape from his breast."What would I get out of being a lawyer?" was his response."What will become of you?" asked his mother, clasping herhands. "They'll call you a filibuster and garrote you. I've told youthat you must have patience, that you must be humble. I don't tellyou that you must kiss the hands of the curates, for I know thatyou have a delicate sense of smell, like your father, who couldn'tendure European cheese. [41] But we have to suffer, to be silent,to say yes to everything. What are we going to do? The friars owneverything, and if they are unwilling, no one will become a lawyeror a doctor. Have patience, my son, have patience!""But I've had a great deal, mother, I've suffered for months andmonths."Cabesang Andang then resumed her lamentations. She did not ask that hedeclare himself a partizan of the friars, she was not one herself--itwas enough to know that for one good friar there were ten bad, whotook the money from the poor and deported the rich. But one must besilent, suffer, and endure--there was no other course. She cited thisman and that one, who by being _patient_ and humble, even though inthe bottom of his heart he hated his masters, had risen from servantof the friars to high office; and such another who was rich andcould commit abuses, secure of having patrons who would protect himfrom the law, yet who had been nothing more than a poor sacristan,humble and obedient, and who had married a pretty girl whose son hadthe curate for a godfather. So Cabesang Andang continued her litanyof humble and _patient_ Filipinos, as she called them, and was aboutto cite others who by not being so had found themselves persecutedand exiled, when Placido on some trifling pretext left the house towander about the streets.He passed through Sibakong, [42] Tondo, San Nicolas, and Santo Cristo,absorbed in his ill-humor, without taking note of the sun or the hour,and only when he began to feel hungry and discovered that he had nomoney, having given it all for celebrations and contributions, didhe return to the house. He had expected that he would not meet hismother there, as she was in the habit, when in Manila, of going outat that hour to a neighboring house where _panguingui_ was played,but Cabesang Andang was waiting to propose her plan. She would availherself of the procurator of the Augustinians to restore her son tothe good graces of the Dominicans.Placido stopped her with a gesture. "I'll throw myself into the seafirst," he declared. "I'll become a tulisan before I'll go back tothe University."Again his mother began her preachment about patience and humility,so he went away again without having eaten anything, directing hissteps toward the quay where the steamers tied up. The sight of asteamer weighing anchor for Hongkong inspired him with an idea--to goto Hongkong, to run away, get rich there, and make war on the friars.The thought of Hongkong awoke in his mind the recollection ofa story about frontals, cirials, and candelabra of pure silver,which the piety of the faithful had led them to present to a certainchurch. The friars, so the silversmith told, had sent to Hongkong tohave duplicate frontals, cirials, and candelabra made of German silver,which they substituted for the genuine ones, these being melted downand coined into Mexican pesos. Such was the story he had heard, andthough it was no more than a rumor or a story, his resentment gave itthe color of truth and reminded him of other tricks of theirs in thatsame style. The desire to live free, and certain half-formed plans,led him to decide upon Hongkong. If the corporations sent all theirmoney there, commerce must be flourishing and he could enrich himself."I want to be free, to live free!"Night surprised him wandering along San Fernando, but not meeting anysailor he knew, he decided to return home. As the night was beautiful,with a brilliant moon transforming the squalid city into a fantasticfairy kingdom, he went to the fair. There he wandered back and forth,passing booths without taking any notice of the articles in them, everwith the thought of Hongkong, of living free, of enriching himself.He was about to leave the fair when he thought he recognized thejeweler Simoun bidding good-by to a foreigner, both of them speakingin English. To Placido every language spoken in the Philippinesby Europeans, when not Spanish, had to be English, and besides, hecaught the name Hongkong. If only the jeweler would recommend him tothat foreigner, who must be setting out for Hongkong!Placido paused. He was acquainted with the jeweler, as the latter hadbeen in his town peddling his wares, and he had accompanied him onone of his trips, when Simoun had made himself very amiable indeed,telling him of the life in the universities of the free countries--whata difference!So he followed the jeweler. "Senor Simoun, Senor Simoun!" he called.The jeweler was at that moment entering his carriage. RecognizingPlacido, he checked himself."I want to ask a favor of you, to say a few words to you."Simoun made a sign of impatience which Placido in his perturbationdid not observe. In a few words the youth related what had happenedand made known his desire to go to Hongkong."Why?" asked Simoun, staring fixedly at Placido through his bluegoggles.Placido did not answer, so Simoun threw back his head, smiled his cold,silent smile and said, "All right! Come with me. To Calle Iris!" hedirected the cochero.Simoun remained silent throughout the whole drive, apparently absorbedin meditation of a very important nature. Placido kept quiet, waitingfor him to speak first, and entertained himself in watching thepromenaders who were enjoying the clear moonlight: pairs of infatuatedlovers, followed by watchful mammas or aunts; groups of studentsin white clothes that the moonlight made whiter still; half-drunkensoldiers in a carriage, six together, on their way to visit some nipatemple dedicated to Cytherea; children playing their games and Chineseselling sugar-cane. All these filled the streets, taking on in thebrilliant moonlight fantastic forms and ideal outlines. In one housean orchestra was playing waltzes, and couples might be seen dancingunder the bright lamps and chandeliers--what a sordid spectacle theypresented in comparison with the sight the streets afforded! Thinkingof Hongkong, he asked himself if the moonlit nights in that islandwere so poetical and sweetly melancholy as those of the Philippines,and a deep sadness settled down over his heart.Simoun ordered the carriage to stop and both alighted, just at themoment when Isagani and Paulita Gomez passed them murmuring sweetinanities. Behind them came Dona Victorina with Juanito Pelaez, whowas talking in a loud voice, busily gesticulating, and appearing tohave a larger hump than ever. In his preoccupation Pelaez did notnotice his former schoolmate."There's a fellow who's happy!" muttered Placido with a sigh,as he gazed toward the group, which became converted into vaporoussilhouettes, with Juanito's arms plainly visible, rising and fallinglike the arms of a windmill."That's all he's good for," observed Simoun. "It's fine to be young!"To whom did Placido and Simoun each allude?The jeweler made a sign to the young man, and they left the streetto pick their way through a labyrinth of paths and passageways amongvarious houses, at times leaping upon stones to avoid the mudholesor stepping aside from the sidewalks that were badly constructed andstill more badly tended. Placido was surprised to see the rich jewelermove through such places as if he were familiar with them. They atlength reached an open lot where a wretched hut stood off by itselfsurrounded by banana-plants and areca-palms. Some bamboo frames andsections of the same material led Placido to suspect that they wereapproaching the house of a pyrotechnist.Simoun rapped on the window and a man's face appeared."Ah, sir!" he exclaimed, and immediately came outside."Is the powder here?" asked Simoun."In sacks. I'm waiting for the shells.""And the bombs?""Are all ready.""All right, then. This very night you must go and inform the lieutenantand the corporal. Then keep on your way, and in Lamayan you will find aman in a banka. You will say _Cabesa_ and he will answer _Tales_. It'snecessary that he be here tomorrow. There's no time to be lost."Saying this, he gave him some gold coins."How's this, sir?" the man inquired in very good Spanish. "Is thereany news?""Yes, it'll be done within the coming week.""The coming week!" exclaimed the unknown, stepping backward. "Thesuburbs are not yet ready, they hope that the General will withdrawthe decree. I thought it was postponed until the beginning of Lent."Simoun shook his head. "We won't need the suburbs," he said. "WithCabesang Tales' people, the ex-carbineers, and a regiment, we'll haveenough. Later, Maria Clara may be dead. Start at once!"The man disappeared. Placido, who had stood by and heard all of thisbrief interview, felt his hair rise and stared with startled eyes atSimoun, who smiled."You're surprised," he said with his icy smile, "that this Indian,so poorly dressed, speaks Spanish well? He was a schoolmaster whopersisted in teaching Spanish to the children and did not stop untilhe had lost his position and had been deported as a disturber ofthe public peace, and for having been a friend of the unfortunateIbarra. I got him back from his deportation, where he had been workingas a pruner of coconut-palms, and have made him a pyrotechnist."They returned to the street and set out for Trozo. Before a woodenhouse of pleasant and well-kept appearance was a Spaniard on crutches,enjoying the moonlight. When Simoun accosted him, his attempt to risewas accompanied by a stifled groan."You're ready?" Simoun inquired of him."I always am!""The coming week?""So soon?""At the first cannon-shot!"He moved away, followed by Placido, who was beginning to ask himselfif he were not dreaming."Does it surprise you," Simoun asked him, "to see a Spaniard so youngand so afflicted with disease? Two years ago he was as robust as youare, but his enemies succeeded in sending him to Balabak to work in apenal settlement, and there he caught the rheumatism and fever thatare dragging him into the grave. The poor devil had married a verybeautiful woman."As an empty carriage was passing, Simoun hailed it and with Placidodirected it to his house in the Escolta, just at the moment when theclocks were striking half-past ten.Two hours later Placido left the jeweler's house and walked gravelyand thoughtfully along the Escolta, then almost deserted, in spiteof the fact that the cafes were still quite animated. Now and thena carriage passed rapidly, clattering noisily over the worn pavement.From a room in his house that overlooked the Pasig, Simoun turnedhis gaze toward the Walled City, which could be seen through the openwindows, with its roofs of galvanized iron gleaming in the moonlightand its somber towers showing dull and gloomy in the midst of theserene night. He laid aside his blue goggles, and his white hair,like a frame of silver, surrounded his energetic bronzed features,dimly lighted by a lamp whose flame was dying out from lack ofoil. Apparently wrapped in thought, he took no notice of the fadinglight and impending darkness."Within a few days," he murmured, "when on all sides that accursed cityis burning, den of presumptuous nothingness and impious exploitationof the ignorant and the distressed, when the tumults break out in thesuburbs and there rush into the terrorized streets my avenging hordes,engendered by rapacity and wrongs, then will I burst the walls ofyour prison, I will tear you from the clutches of fanaticism, and mywhite dove, you will be the Phoenix that will rise from the glowingembers! A revolution plotted by men in darkness tore me from yourside--another revolution will sweep me into your arms and reviveme! That moon, before reaching the apogee of its brilliance, willlight the Philippines cleansed of loathsome filth!"Simoun, stopped suddenly, as though interrupted. A voice in his innerconsciousness was asking if he, Simoun, were not also a part of thefilth of that accursed city, perhaps its most poisonous ferment. Likethe dead who are to rise at the sound of the last trumpet, a thousandbloody specters--desperate shades of murdered men, women violated,fathers torn from their families, vices stimulated and encouraged,virtues mocked, now rose in answer to the mysterious question. Forthe first time in his criminal career, since in Havana he had bymeans of corruption and bribery set out to fashion an instrumentfor the execution of his plans--a man without faith, patriotism, orconscience--for the first time in that life, something within rose upand protested against his actions. He closed his eyes and remainedfor some time motionless, then rubbed his hand over his forehead,tried to be deaf to his conscience, and felt fear creeping overhim. No, he must not analyze himself, he lacked the courage to turnhis gaze toward his past. The idea of his courage, his conviction,his self-confidence failing him at the very moment when his work wasset before him! As the ghosts of the wretches in whose misfortuneshe had taken a hand continued to hover before his eyes, as if issuingfrom the shining surface of the river to invade the room with appealsand hands extended toward him, as reproaches and laments seemed tofill the air with threats and cries for vengeance, he turned his gazefrom the window and for the first time began to tremble."No, I must be ill, I can't be feeling well," he muttered. "Thereare many who hate me, who ascribe their misfortunes to me, but--"He felt his forehead begin to burn, so he arose to approach the windowand inhale the fresh night breeze. Below him the Pasig dragged alongits silvered stream, on whose bright surface the foam glittered,winding slowly about, receding and advancing, following the course ofthe little eddies. The city loomed up on the opposite bank, and itsblack walls looked fateful, mysterious, losing their sordidness inthe moonlight that idealizes and embellishes everything. But againSimoun shivered; he seemed to see before him the severe countenanceof his father, dying in prison, but dying for having done good; thenthe face of another man, severer still, who had given his life for himbecause he believed that he was going to bring about the regenerationof his country."No, I can't turn back," he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration fromhis forehead. "The work is at hand and its success will justify me! IfI had conducted myself as you did, I should have succumbed. Nothingof idealism, nothing of fallacious theories! Fire and steel to thecancer, chastisement to vice, and afterwards destroy the instrument,if it be bad! No, I have planned well, but now I feel feverish, myreason wavers, it is natural--If I have done ill, it has been that Imay do good, and the end justifies the means. What I will do is notto expose myself--"With his thoughts thus confused he lay down, and tried to fall asleep.On the following morning Placido listened submissively, with a smileon his lips, to his mother's preachment. When she spoke of her plan ofinteresting the Augustinian procurator he did not protest or object,but on the contrary offered himself to carry it out, in order tosave trouble for his mother, whom he begged to return at once to theprovince, that very day, if possible. Cabesang Andang asked him thereason for such haste."Because--because if the procurator learns that you are here he won'tdo anything until you send him a present and order some masses."CHAPTER XXTHE ARBITERTrue it was that Padre Irene had said: the question of the academy ofCastilian, so long before broached, was on the road to a solution. DonCustodio, the active Don Custodio, the most active of all the arbitersin the world, according to Ben-Zayb, was occupied with it, spendinghis days reading the petition and falling asleep without reaching anydecision, waking on the following day to repeat the same performance,dropping off to sleep again, and so on continuously.How the good man labored, the most active of all the arbitersin the world! He wished to get out of the predicament by pleasingeverybody--the friars, the high official, the Countess, Padre Irene,and his own liberal principles. He had consulted with Senor Pasta, andSenor Pasta had left him stupefied and confused, after advising him todo a million contradictory and impossible things. He had consulted withPepay the dancing girl, and Pepay, who had no idea what he was talkingabout, executed a pirouette and asked him for twenty-five pesos tobury an aunt of hers who had suddenly died for the fifth time, or thefifth aunt who had suddenly died, according to fuller explanations, atthe same time requesting that he get a cousin of hers who could read,write, and play the violin, a job as assistant on the public works--allthings that were far from inspiring Don Custodio with any saving idea.Two days after the events in the Quiapo fair, Don Custodio was asusual busily studying the petition, without hitting upon the happysolution. While he yawns, coughs, smokes, and thinks about Pepay'slegs and her pirouettes, let us give some account of this exaltedpersonage, in order to understand Padre Sibyla's reason for proposinghim as the arbiter of such a vexatious matter and why the other cliqueaccepted him.Don Custodio de Salazar y Sanchez de Monteredondo, often referredto as _Good Authority_, belonged to that class of Manila societywhich cannot take a step without having the newspapers heap titlesupon them, calling each _indedefatigable, distinguished, zealous,active, profound, intelligent, well-informed, influential_, and soon, as if they feared that he might be confused with some idle andignorant possessor of the same name. Besides, no harm resulted fromit, and the watchful censor was not disturbed. The _Good Authority_resulted from his friendship with Ben-Zayb, when the latter, in his twonoisiest controversies, which he carried on for weeks and months in thecolumns of the newspapers about whether it was proper to wear a highhat, a derby, or a _salakot,_ and whether the plural of _caracter_should be _caracteres_ or _caracteres,_ in order to strengthen hisargument always came out with, "We have this on good authority,""We learn this from good authority," later letting it be known,for in Manila everything becomes known, that this _Good Authority_was no other than Don Custodio de Salazar y Sanchez de Monteredondo.He had come to Manila very young, with a good position that had enabledhim to marry a pretty mestiza belonging to one of the wealthiestfamilies of the city. As he had natural talent, boldness, and greatself-possession, and knew how to make use of the society in whichhe found himself, he launched into business with his wife's money,filling contracts for the government, by reason of which he wasmade alderman, afterwards alcalde, member of the Economic Society,[43] councilor of the administration, president of the directory ofthe _Obras Pias_, [44] member of the Society of Mercy, director ofthe Spanish-Filipino Bank, etc., etc. Nor are these _etceteras_ to betaken like those ordinarily placed after a long enumeration of titles:Don Custodio, although never having seen a treatise on hygiene, cameto be vice-chairman of the Board of Health, for the truth was that ofthe eight who composed this board only one had to be a physician andhe could not be that one. So also he was a member of the VaccinationBoard, which was composed of three physicians and seven laymen, amongthese being the Archbishop and three Provincials. He was a brother inall the confraternities of the common and of the most exalted dignity,and, as we have seen, director of the Superior Commission of PrimaryInstruction, which usually did not do anything--all these being quitesufficient reason for the newspapers to heap adjectives upon him noless when he traveled than when he sneezed.In spite of so many offices, Don Custodio was not among those whoslept through the sessions, contenting themselves, like lazy and timiddelegates, in voting with the majority. The opposite of the numerouskings of Europe who bear the title of King of Jerusalem, Don Custodiomade his dignity felt and got from it all the benefit possible, oftenfrowning, making his voice impressive, coughing out his words, oftentaking up the whole session telling a story, presenting a project, ordisputing with a colleague who had placed himself in open oppositionto him. Although not past forty, he already talked of acting withcircumspection, of letting the figs ripen (adding under his breath"pumpkins"), of pondering deeply and of stepping with careful tread,of the necessity for understanding the country, because the nature ofthe Indians, because the prestige of the Spanish name, because theywere first of all Spaniards, because religion--and so on. Rememberedyet in Manila is a speech of his when for the first time it wasproposed to light the city with kerosene in place of the old coconutoil: in such an innovation, far from seeing the extinction of thecoconut-oil industry, he merely discerned the interests of a certainalderman--because Don Custodio saw a long way--and opposed it withall the resonance of his bucal cavity, considering the project toopremature and predicting great social cataclysms. No less celebratedwas his opposition to a sentimental serenade that some wished to tendera certain governor on the eve of his departure. Don Custodio, who felta little resentment over some slight or other, succeeded in insinuatingthe idea that the rising star was the mortal enemy of the setting one,whereat the frightened promoters of the serenade gave it up.One day he was advised to return to Spain to be cured of a livercomplaint, and the newspapers spoke of him as an Antaeus who hadto set foot in the mother country to gain new strength. But theManila Antaeus found himself a small and insignificant person at thecapital. There he was nobody, and he missed his beloved adjectives. Hedid not mingle with the upper set, and his lack of education preventedhim from amounting to much in the academies and scientific centers,while his backwardness and his parish-house politics drove him fromthe clubs disgusted, vexed, seeing nothing clearly but that therethey were forever borrowing money and gambling heavily. He missed thesubmissive servants of Manila, who endured all his peevishness, andwho now seemed to be far preferable; when a winter kept him betweena fireplace and an attack of pneumonia, he sighed for the Manilawinter during which a single quilt is sufficient, while in summer hemissed the easy-chair and the boy to fan him. In short, in Madrid hewas only one among many, and in spite of his diamonds he was oncetaken for a rustic who did not know how to comport himself and atanother time for an _Indiano_. His scruples were scoffed at, and hewas shamelessly flouted by some borrowers whom he offended. Disgustedwith the conservatives, who took no great notice of his advice, as wellas with the sponges who rifled his pockets, he declared himself to beof the liberal party and returned within a year to the Philippines,if not sound in his liver, yet completely changed in his beliefs.The eleven months spent at the capital among cafe politicians, nearlyall retired half-pay office-holders, the various speeches caught hereand there, this or that article of the opposition, all the politicallife that permeates the air, from the barber-shop where amid thescissors-clips the Figaro announces his program to the banquetswhere in harmonious periods and telling phrases the differentshades of political opinion, the divergences and disagreements,are adjusted--all these things awoke in him the farther he got fromEurope, like the life-giving sap within the sown seed prevented frombursting out by the thick husk, in such a way that when he reachedManila he believed that he was going to regenerate it and actuallyhad the holiest plans and the purest ideals.During the first months after his return he was continually talkingabout the capital, about his good friends, about Minister So-and-So,ex-Minister Such-a-One, the delegate C., the author B., and there wasnot a political event, a court scandal, of which he was not informedto the last detail, nor was there a public man the secrets of whoseprivate life were unknown to him, nor could anything occur that hehad not foreseen, nor any reform be ordered but he had first beenconsulted. All this was seasoned with attacks on the conservativesin righteous indignation, with apologies of the liberal party, witha little anecdote here, a phrase there from some great man, droppedin as one who did not wish offices and employments, which same hehad refused in order not to be beholden to the conservatives. Suchwas his enthusiasm in these first days that various cronies inthe grocery-store which he visited from time to time affiliatedthemselves with the liberal party and began to style themselvesliberals: Don Eulogio Badana, a retired sergeant of carbineers;the honest Armendia, by profession a pilot, and a rampant Carlist;Don Eusebio Picote, customs inspector; and Don Bonifacio Tacon, shoe-and harness-maker. [45]But nevertheless, from lack of encouragement and of opposition, hisenthusiasm gradually waned. He did not read the newspapers that camefrom Spain, because they arrived in packages, the sight of which madehim yawn. The ideas that he had caught having been all expended, heneeded reinforcement, and his orators were not there, and although inthe casinos of Manila there was enough gambling, and money was borrowedas in Madrid, no speech that would nourish his political ideas waspermitted in them. But Don Custodio was not lazy, he did more thanwish--he worked. Foreseeing that he was going to leave his bones inthe Philippines, he began to consider that country his proper sphereand to devote his efforts to its welfare. Thinking to liberalize it,he commenced to draw up a series of reforms or projects, which wereingenious, to say the least. It was he who, having heard in Madridmention of the wooden street pavements of Paris, not yet adopted inSpain, proposed the introduction of them in Manila by covering thestreets with boards nailed down as they are on the sides of houses;it was he who, deploring the accidents to two-wheeled vehicles,planned to avoid them by putting on at least three wheels; it wasalso he who, while acting as vice-president of the Board of Health,ordered everything fumigated, even the telegrams that came frominfected places; it was also he who, in compassion for the convictsthat worked in the sun and with a desire of saving to the governmentthe cost of their equipment, suggested that they be clothed in asimple breech-clout and set to work not by day but at night. Hemarveled, he stormed, that his projects should encounter objectors,but consoled himself with the reflection that the man who is worthenemies has them, and revenged himself by attacking and tearing topieces any project, good or bad, presented by others.As he prided himself on being a liberal, upon being asked what hethought of the Indians he would answer, like one conferring a greatfavor, that they were fitted for manual labor and the _imitativearts_ (meaning thereby music, painting, and sculpture), adding hisold postscript that to know them one must have resided many, manyyears in the country. Yet when he heard of any one of them excellingin something that was not manual labor or an _imitative art_--inchemistry, medicine, or philosophy, for example--he would exclaim:"Ah, he promises fairly, fairly well, he's not a fool!" and feel surethat a great deal of Spanish blood must flow in the veins of such an_Indian_. If unable to discover any in spite of his good intentions,he then sought a Japanese origin, for it was at that time the fashionbegan of attributing to the Japanese or the Arabs whatever good theFilipinos might have in them. For him the native songs were Arabicmusic, as was also the alphabet of the ancient Filipinos--he wascertain of this, although he did not know Arabic nor had he ever seenthat alphabet."Arabic, the purest Arabic," he said to Ben-Zayb in a tone thatadmitted no reply. "At best, Chinese!"Then he would add, with a significant wink: "Nothing can be, nothingought to be, original with the Indians, you understand! I like themgreatly, but they mustn't be allowed to pride themselves upon anything,for then they would take heart and turn into a lot of wretches."At other times he would say: "I love the Indians fondly, I'veconstituted myself their father and defender, but it's necessary tokeep everything in its proper place. Some were born to command andothers to serve--plainly, that is a truism which can't be uttered veryloudly, but it can be put into practise without many words. For look,the trick depends upon trifles. When you wish to reduce a peopleto subjection, assure it that it is in subjection. The first day itwill laugh, the second protest, the third doubt, and the fourth beconvinced. To keep the Filipino docile, he must have repeated to himday after day what he is, to convince him that he is incompetent. Whatgood would it do, besides, to have him believe in something else thatwould make him wretched? Believe me, it's an act of charity to holdevery creature in his place--that is order, harmony. That constitutesthe _science_ of government."In referring to his policies, Don Custodio was not satisfied with theword _art_, and upon pronouncing the word _government_, he would extendhis hand downwards to the height of a man bent over on his knees.In regard to his religious ideas, he prided himself on being aCatholic, very much a Catholic--ah, Catholic Spain, the land of_Maria Santisima_! A liberal could be and ought to be a Catholic,when the reactionaries were setting themselves up as gods or saints,just as a mulatto passes for a white man in Kaffirland. But with allthat, he ate meat during Lent, except on Good Friday, never went toconfession, believed neither in miracles nor the infallibility of thePope, and when he attended mass, went to the one at ten o'clock, orto the shortest, the military mass. Although in Madrid he had spokenill of the religious orders, so as not to be out of harmony with hissurroundings, considering them anachronisms, and had hurled cursesagainst the Inquisition, while relating this or that lurid or drollstory wherein the habits danced, or rather friars without habits,yet in speaking of the Philippines, which should be ruled by speciallaws, he would cough, look wise, and again extend his hand downwardsto that mysterious altitude."The friars are necessary, they're a necessary evil," he would declare.But how he would rage when any Indian dared to doubt the miraclesor did not acknowledge the Pope! All the tortures of the Inquisitionwere insufficient to punish such temerity.When it was objected that to rule or to live at the expense ofignorance has another and somewhat ugly name and is punished by lawwhen the culprit is a single person, he would justify his positionby referring to other colonies. "We," he would announce in hisofficial tone, "can speak out plainly! We're not like the Britishand the Dutch who, in order to hold people in subjection, make useof the lash. We avail ourselves of other means, milder and surer. Thesalutary influence of the friars is superior to the British lash."This last remark made his fortune. For a long time Ben-Zayb continuedto use adaptations of it, and with him all Manila. The thinkingpart of Manila applauded it, and it even got to Madrid, where itwas quoted in the Parliament as from _a liberal of long residencethere_. The friars, flattered by the comparison and seeing theirprestige enhanced, sent him sacks of chocolate, presents which theincorruptible Don Custodio returned, so that Ben-Zayb immediatelycompared him to Epaminondas. Nevertheless, this modern Epaminondasmade use of the rattan in his choleric moments, and advised its use!At that time the conventos, fearful that he would render a decisionfavorable to the petition of the students, increased their gifts,so that on the afternoon when we see him he was more perplexed thanever, his reputation for energy was being compromised. It had beenmore than a fortnight since he had had the petition in his hands,and only that morning the high official, after praising his zeal,had asked for a decision. Don Custodio had replied with mysteriousgravity, giving him to understand that it was not yet completed. Thehigh official had smiled a smile that still worried and haunted him.As we were saying, he yawned and yawned. In one of these movements, atthe moment when he opened his eyes and closed his mouth, his attentionwas caught by a file of red envelopes, arranged in regular order on amagnificent kamagon desk. On the back of each could be read in largeletters: PROJECTS.For a moment he forgot his troubles and Pepay's pirouettes, toreflect upon all that those files contained, which had issued from hisprolific brain in his hours of inspiration. How many original ideas,how many sublime thoughts, how many means of ameliorating the woesof the Philippines! Immortality and the gratitude of the country weresurely his!Like an old lover who discovers a moldy package of amorous epistles,Don Custodio arose and approached the desk. The first envelope, thick,swollen, and plethoric, bore the title: PROJECTS IN PROJECT."No," he murmured, "they're excellent things, but it would take ayear to read them over."The second, also quite voluminous, was entitled: PROJECTS UNDERCONSIDERATION. "No, not those either."Then came the PROJECTS NEARING COMPLETION, PROJECTS PRESENTED, PROJECTSREJECTED, PROJECTS APPROVED, PROJECTS POSTPONED. These last envelopesheld little, but the least of all was that of the PROJECTS EXECUTED.Don Custodio wrinkled up his nose--what did it contain? He hadcompletely forgotten what was in it. A sheet of yellowish papershowed from under the flap, as though the envelope were sticking outits tongue. This he drew out and unfolded: it was the famous projectfor the School of Arts and Trades!"What the devil!" he exclaimed. "If the Augustinian padres took chargeof it--"Suddenly he slapped his forehead and arched his eyebrows, while a lookof triumph overspread his face. "I have reached a decision!" he criedwith an oath that was not exactly _eureka_. "My decision is made!"Repeating his peculiar _eureka_ five or six times, which struck theair like so many gleeful lashes, he sat down at his desk, radiantwith joy, and began to write furiously.CHAPTER XXIMANILA TYPESThat night there was a grand function at the Teatro deVariedades. Mr. Jouay's French operetta company was giving its initialperformance, _Les Cloches de Corneville_. To the eyes of the publicwas to be exhibited his select troupe, whose fame the newspapers hadfor days been proclaiming. It was reported that among the actresseswas a very beautiful voice, with a figure even more beautiful, andif credit could be given to rumor, her amiability surpassed even hervoice and figure.At half-past seven in the evening there were no more tickets to behad, not even though they had been for Padre Salvi himself in hisdirect need, and the persons waiting to enter the general admissionalready formed a long queue. In the ticket-office there were scufflesand fights, talk of filibusterism and races, but this did not produceany tickets, so that by a quarter before eight fabulous prices werebeing offered for them. The appearance of the building, profuselyilluminated, with flowers and plants in all the doors and windows,enchanted the new arrivals to such an extent that they burst out intoexclamations and applause. A large crowd surged about the entrance,gazing enviously at those going in, those who came early from fearof missing their seats. Laughter, whispering, expectation greeted thelater arrivals, who disconsolately joined the curious crowd, and nowthat they could not get in contented themselves with watching thosewho did.Yet there was one person who seemed out of place amid such greateagerness and curiosity. He was a tall, meager man, who dragged oneleg stiffly when he walked, dressed in a wretched brown coat and dirtycheckered trousers that fitted his lean, bony limbs tightly. A strawsombrero, artistic in spite of being broken, covered an enormoushead and allowed his dirty gray, almost red, hair to straggle outlong and kinky at the end like a poet's curls. But the most notablething about this man was not his clothing or his European features,guiltless of beard or mustache, but his fiery red face, from which hegot the nickname by which he was known, _Camaroncocido_. [46] He wasa curious character belonging to a prominent Spanish family, but helived like a vagabond and a beggar, scoffing at the prestige which heflouted indifferently with his rags. He was reputed to be a kind ofreporter, and in fact his gray goggle-eyes, so cold and thoughtful,always showed up where anything publishable was happening. His mannerof living was a mystery to all, as no one seemed to know where heate and slept. Perhaps he had an empty hogshead somewhere.But at that moment Camaroncocido lacked his usual hard and indifferentexpression, something like mirthful pity being reflected in hislooks. A funny little man accosted him merrily."Friend!" exclaimed the latter, in a raucous voice, as hoarse as afrog's, while he displayed several Mexican pesos, which Camaroncocidomerely glanced at and then shrugged his shoulders. What did theymatter to him?The little old man was a fitting contrast to him. Small, very small,he wore on his head a high hat, which presented the appearance of ahuge hairy worm, and lost himself in an enormous frock coat, too wideand too long for him, to reappear in trousers too short, not reachingbelow his calves. His body seemed to be the grandfather and his legsthe grandchildren, while as for his shoes he appeared to be floatingon the land, for they were of an enormous sailor type, apparentlyprotesting against the hairy worm worn on his head with all the energyof a convento beside a World's Exposition. If Camaroncocido was red,he was brown; while the former, although of Spanish extraction, hadnot a single hair on his face, yet he, an Indian, had a goatee andmustache, both long, white, and sparse. His expression was lively. Hewas known as _Tio Quico_, [47] and like his friend lived on publicity,advertising the shows and posting the theatrical announcements,being perhaps the only Filipino who could appear with impunity in asilk hat and frock coat, just as his friend was the first Spaniardwho laughed at the prestige of his race."The Frenchman has paid me well," he said smiling and showing hispicturesque gums, which looked like a street after a conflagration. "Idid a good job in posting the bills."Camaroncocido shrugged his shoulders again. "Quico," he rejoined ina cavernous voice, "if they've given you six pesos for your work,how much will they give the friars?"Tio Quico threw back his head in his usual lively manner. "To thefriars?""Because you surely know," continued Camaroncocido, "that all thiscrowd was secured for them by the conventos."The fact was that the friars, headed by Padre Salvi, and some laybrethren captained by Don Custodio, had opposed such shows. PadreCamorra, who could not attend, watered at the eyes and mouth, butargued with Ben-Zayb, who defended them feebly, thinking of the freetickets they would send his newspaper. Don Custodio spoke of morality,religion, good manners, and the like."But," stammered the writer, "if our own farces with their plays onwords and phrases of double meaning--""But at least they're in Castilian!" the virtuous councilor interruptedwith a roar, inflamed to righteous wrath. "Obscenities in French,man, Ben-Zayb, for God's sake, in French! Never!"He uttered this _never_ with the energy of three Guzmans threatenedwith being killed like fleas if they did not surrender twentyTarifas. Padre Irene naturally agreed with Don Custodio and execratedFrench operetta. Whew, he had been in Paris, but had never set footin a theater, the Lord deliver him!Yet the French operetta also counted numerous partizans. The officersof the army and navy, among them the General's aides, the clerks,and many society people were anxious to enjoy the delicacies of theFrench language from the mouths of genuine _Parisiennes_, and withthem were affiliated those who had traveled by the M.M. [48] and hadjabbered a little French during the voyage, those who had visitedParis, and all those who wished to appear learned.Hence, Manila society was divided into two factions, operettistsand anti-operettists. The latter were supported by the elderlyladies, wives jealous and careful of their husbands' love, and bythose who were engaged, while those who were free and those whowere beautiful declared themselves enthusiastic operettists. Notesand then more notes were exchanged, there were goings and comings,mutual recriminations, meetings, lobbyings, arguments, even talk ofan insurrection of the natives, of their indolence, of inferior andsuperior races, of prestige and other humbugs, so that after muchgossip and more recrimination, the permit was granted, Padre Salviat the same time publishing a pastoral that was read by no one butthe proof-reader. There were questionings whether the General hadquarreled with the Countess, whether she spent her time in the hallsof pleasure, whether His Excellency was greatly annoyed, whetherthere had been presents exchanged, whether the French consul--, andso on and on. Many names were bandied about: Quiroga the Chinaman's,Simoun's, and even those of many actresses.Thanks to these scandalous preliminaries, the people's impatience hadbeen aroused, and since the evening before, when the troupe arrived,there was talk of nothing but attending the first performance. Fromthe hour when the red posters announced _Les Cloches de Corneville_ thevictors prepared to celebrate their triumph. In some offices, insteadof the time being spent in reading newspapers and gossiping, it wasdevoted to devouring the synopsis and spelling out French novels, whilemany feigned business outside to consult their pocket-dictionarieson the sly. So no business was transacted, callers were told to comeback the next day, but the public could not take offense, for theyencountered some very polite and affable clerks, who received anddismissed them with grand salutations in the French style. The clerkswere practising, brushing the dust off their French, and calling toone another _oui, monsieur, s'il vous plait_, and _pardon_! at everyturn, so that it was a pleasure to see and hear them.But the place where the excitement reached its climax was the newspaperoffice. Ben-Zayb, having been appointed critic and translator of thesynopsis, trembled like a poor woman accused of witchcraft, as he sawhis enemies picking out his blunders and throwing up to his face hisdeficient knowledge of French. When the Italian opera was on, he hadvery nearly received a challenge for having mistranslated a tenor'sname, while an envious rival had immediately published an articlereferring to him as an ignoramus--him, the foremost thinking head inthe Philippines! All the trouble he had had to defend himself! Hehad had to write at least seventeen articles and consult fifteendictionaries, so with these salutary recollections, the wretchedBen-Zayb moved about with leaden hands, to say nothing of his feet,for that would be plagiarizing Padre Camorra, who had once intimatedthat the journalist wrote with them."You see, Quico?" said Camaroncocido. "One half of the people havecome because the friars told them not to, making it a kind of publicprotest, and the other half because they say to themselves, 'Do thefriars object to it? Then it must be instructive!' Believe me, Quico,your advertisements are a good thing but the pastoral was better,even taking into consideration the fact that it was read by no one.""Friend, do you believe," asked Tio Quico uneasily, "that on accountof the competition with Padre Salvi my business will in the futurebe prohibited?""Maybe so, Quico, maybe so," replied the other, gazing at thesky. "Money's getting scarce."Tio Quico muttered some incoherent words: if the friars were going toturn theatrical advertisers, he would become a friar. After bidding hisfriend good-by, he moved away coughing and rattling his silver coins.With his eternal indifference Camaroncocido continued to wander abouthere and there with his crippled leg and sleepy looks. The arrivalof unfamiliar faces caught his attention, coming as they did fromdifferent parts and signaling to one another with a wink or a cough. Itwas the first time that he had ever seen these individuals on suchan occasion, he who knew all the faces and features in the city. Menwith dark faces, humped shoulders, uneasy and uncertain movements,poorly disguised, as though they had for the first time put on sackcoats, slipped about among the shadows, shunning attention, insteadof getting in the front rows where they could see well."Detectives or thieves?" Camaroncocido asked himself and immediatelyshrugged his shoulders. "But what is it to me?"The lamp of a carriage that drove up lighted in passing a group offour or five of these individuals talking with a man who appeared tobe an army officer."Detectives! It must be a new corps," he muttered with his shrugof indifference. Soon, however, he noticed that the officer, afterspeaking to two or three more groups, approached a carriage and seemedto be talking vigorously with some person inside. Camaroncocido tooka few steps forward and without surprise thought that he recognizedthe jeweler Simoun, while his sharp ears caught this short dialogue."The signal will be a gunshot!""Yes, sir.""Don't worry--it's the General who is ordering it, but be careful aboutsaying so. If you follow my instructions, you'll get a promotion.""Yes, sir.""So, be ready!"The voice ceased and a second later the carriage drove away. In spiteof his indifference Camaroncocido could not but mutter, "Something'safoot--hands on pockets!"But feeling his own to be empty, he again shrugged his shoulders. Whatdid it matter to him, even though the heavens should fall?So he continued his pacing about. On passing near two persons engagedin conversation, he caught what one of them, who had rosaries andscapularies around his neck, was saying in Tagalog: "The friars aremore powerful than the General, don't be a fool! He'll go away andthey'll stay here. So, if we do well, we'll get rich. The signal isa gunshot.""Hold hard, hold hard," murmured Camaroncocido, tightening hisfingers. "On that side the General, on this Padre Salvi. Poorcountry! But what is it to me?"Again shrugging his shoulders and expectorating at the same time,two actions that with him were indications of supreme indifference,he continued his observations.Meanwhile, the carriages were arriving in dizzy streams, stoppingdirectly before the door to set down the members of the selectsociety. Although the weather was scarcely even cool, the ladiessported magnificent shawls, silk neckerchiefs, and even lightcloaks. Among the escorts, some who were in frock coats with whiteties wore overcoats, while others carried them on their arms todisplay the rich silk linings.In a group of spectators, Tadeo, he who was always taken ill themoment the professor appeared, was accompanied by a fellow townsmanof his, the novice whom we saw suffer evil consequences from readingwrongly the Cartesian principle. This novice was very inquisitive andaddicted to tiresome questions, and Tadeo was taking advantage of hisingenuousness and inexperience to relate to him the most stupendouslies. Every Spaniard that spoke to him, whether clerkling or underling,was presented as a leading merchant, a marquis, or a count, while onthe other hand any one who passed him by was a greenhorn, a pettyofficial, a nobody! When pedestrians failed him in keeping up thenovice's astonishment, he resorted to the resplendent carriages thatcame up. Tadeo would bow politely, wave his hand in a friendly manner,and call out a familiar greeting."Who's he?""Bah!" was the negligent reply. "The Civil Governor, the Vice-Governor,Judge ----, Senora ----, all friends of mine!"The novice marveled and listened in fascination, taking care to keepon the left. Tadeo the friend of judges and governors!Tadeo named all the persons who arrived, when he did not know theminventing titles, biographies, and interesting sketches."You see that tall gentleman with dark whiskers, somewhat squint-eyed,dressed in black--he's Judge A ----, an intimate friend of the wife ofColonel B ----. One day if it hadn't been for me they would have cometo blows. Hello, here comes that Colonel! What if they should fight?"The novice held his breath, but the colonel and the judge shook handscordially, the soldier, an old bachelor, inquiring about the healthof the judge's family."Ah, thank heaven!" breathed Tadeo. "I'm the one who made themfriends.""What if they should invite us to go in?" asked the novice timidly."Get out, boy! I never accept favors!" retorted Tadeo majestically. "Iconfer them, but disinterestedly."The novice bit his lip and felt smaller than ever, while he placeda respectful distance between himself and his fellow townsman.Tadeo resumed: "That is the musician H----; that one, the lawyerJ----, who delivered as his own a speech printed in all the books andwas congratulated and admired for it; Doctor K----, that man justgetting out of a hansom, is a specialist in diseases of children,so he's called Herod; that's the banker L----, who can talk only ofhis money and his hoards; the poet M----, who is always dealing withthe stars and _the beyond_. There goes the beautiful wife of N----,whom Padre Q----is accustomed to meet when he calls upon the absenthusband; the Jewish merchant P----, who came to the islands with athousand pesos and is now a millionaire. That fellow with the longbeard is the physician R----, who has become rich by making invalidsmore than by curing them.""Making invalids?""Yes, boy, in the examination of the conscripts. Attention! Thatfinely dressed gentleman is not a physician but a homeopathist _suigeneris_--he professes completely the _similis similibus_. The youngcavalry captain with him is his chosen disciple. That man in a lightsuit with his hat tilted back is the government clerk whose maximis never to be polite and who rages like a demon when he sees a haton any one else's head--they say that he does it to ruin the Germanhatters. The man just arriving with his family is the wealthy merchantC----, who has an income of over a hundred thousand pesos. But whatwould you say if I should tell you that he still owes me four pesos,five reales, and twelve cuartos? But who would collect from a richman like him?""That gentleman in debt to you?""Sure! One day I got him out of a bad fix. It was on a Friday athalf-past six in the morning, I still remember, because I hadn'tbreakfasted. That lady who is followed by a duenna is the celebratedPepay, the dancing girl, but she doesn't dance any more now that avery Catholic gentleman and a great friend of mine has--forbiddenit. There's the death's-head Z----, who's surely following her to gether to dance again. He's a good fellow, and a great friend of mine,but has one defect--he's a Chinese mestizo and yet calls himself aPeninsular Spaniard. Sssh! Look at Ben-Zayb, him with the face of afriar, who's carrying a pencil and a roll of paper in his hand. He'sthe great writer, Ben-Zayb, a good friend of mine--he has talent!""You don't say! And that little man with white whiskers?""He's the official who has appointed his daughters, those three littlegirls, assistants in his department, so as to get their names on thepay-roll. He's a clever man, very clever! When he makes a mistake heblames it on somebody else, he buys things and pays for them out ofthe treasury. He's clever, very, very clever!"Tadeo was about to say more, but suddenly checked himself."And that gentleman who has a fierce air and gazes at everybody overhis shoulders?" inquired the novice, pointing to a man who noddedhaughtily.But Tadeo did not answer. He was craning his neck to see PaulitaGomez, who was approaching with a friend, Dona Victorina, and JuanitoPelaez. The latter had presented her with a box and was more humpedthan ever.Carriage after carriage drove up; the actors and actresses arrivedand entered by a separate door, followed by their friends and admirers.After Paulita had gone in, Tadeo resumed: "Those are the nieces ofthe rich Captain D----, those coming up in a landau; you see howpretty and healthy they are? Well, in a few years they'll be dead orcrazy. Captain D---- is opposed to their marrying, and the insanityof the uncle is appearing in the nieces. That's the Senorita E----,the rich heiress whom the world and the conventos are disputingover. Hello, I know that fellow! It's Padre Irene, in disguise, witha false mustache. I recognize him by his nose. And he was so greatlyopposed to this!"The scandalized novice watched a neatly cut coat disappear behind agroup of ladies."The Three Fates!" went on Tadeo, watching the arrival of threewithered, bony, hollow-eyed, wide-mouthed, and shabbily dressedwomen. "They're called--""Atropos?" ventured the novice, who wished to show that he also knewsomebody, at least in mythology."No, boy, they're called the Weary Waiters--old, censorious, anddull. They pretend to hate everybody--men, women, and children. Butlook how the Lord always places beside the evil a remedy, only thatsometimes it comes late. There behind the Fates, the frights ofthe city, come those three girls, the pride of their friends, amongwhom I count myself. That thin young man with goggle-eyes, somewhatstooped, who is wildly gesticulating because he can't get tickets,is the chemist S----, author of many essays and scientific treatises,some of which are notable and have captured prizes. The Spaniards sayof him, 'There's some hope for him, some hope for him.' The fellow whois soothing him with his Voltairian smile is the poet T----, a youngman of talent, a great friend of mine, and, for the very reason thathe has talent, he has thrown away his pen. That fellow who is trying toget in with the actors by the other door is the young physician U----,who has effected some remarkable cures--it's also said of him that hepromises well. He's not such a scoundrel as Pelaez but he's clevererand slyer still. I believe that he'd shake dice with death and win.""And that brown gentleman with a mustache like hog-bristles?""Ah, that's the merchant F----, who forges everything, even hisbaptismal certificate. He wants to be a Spanish mestizo at any cost,and is making heroic efforts to forget his native language.""But his daughters are very white.""Yes, that's the reason rice has gone up in price, and yet they eatnothing but bread."The novice did not understand the connection between the price ofrice and the whiteness of those girls, but he held his peace."There goes the fellow that's engaged to one of them, that thin brownyouth who is following them with a lingering movement and speaking witha protecting air to the three friends who are laughing at him. He'sa martyr to his beliefs, to his consistency."The novice was filled with admiration and respect for the young man."He has the look of a fool, and he is one," continued Tadeo. "Hewas born in San Pedro Makati and has inflicted many privations uponhimself. He scarcely ever bathes or eats pork, because, according tohim, the Spaniards don't do those things, and for the same reason hedoesn't eat rice and dried fish, although he may be watering at themouth and dying of hunger. Anything that comes from Europe, rottenor preserved, he considers divine--a month ago Basilio cured him ofa severe attack of gastritis, for he had eaten a jar of mustard toprove that he's a European."At that moment the orchestra struck up a waltz."You see that gentleman--that hypochondriac who goes along turninghis head from side to side, seeking salutes? That's the celebratedgovernor of Pangasinan, a good man who loses his appetite whenever anyIndian fails to salute him. He would have died if he hadn't issued theproclamation about salutes to which he owes his celebrity. Poor fellow,it's only been three days since he came from the province and look howthin he has become! Oh, here's the great man, the illustrious--openyour eyes!""Who? That man with knitted brows?""Yes, that's Don Custodio, the liberal, Don Custodio. His brows areknit because he's meditating over some important project. If theideas he has in his head were carried out, this would be a differentworld! Ah, here comes Makaraig, your housemate."It was in fact Makaraig, with Pecson, Sandoval, and Isagani. Uponseeing them, Tadeo advanced and spoke to them."Aren't you coming in?" Makaraig asked him."We haven't been able to get tickets.""Fortunately, we have a box," replied Makaraig. "Basilio couldn'tcome. Both of you, come in with us."Tadeo did not wait for the invitation to be repeated, but the novice,fearing that he would intrude, with the timidity natural to theprovincial Indian, excused himself, nor could he be persuaded to enter.CHAPTER XXIITHE PERFORMANCEThe interior of the theater presented a lively aspect. It was filledfrom top to bottom, with people standing in the corridors and inthe aisles, fighting to withdraw a head from some hole where theyhad inserted it, or to shove an eye between a collar and an ear. Theopen boxes, occupied for the most part by ladies, looked like basketsof flowers, whose petals--the fans--shook in a light breeze, whereinhummed a thousand bees. However, just as there are flowers of strongor delicate fragrance, flowers that kill and flowers that console,so from our baskets were exhaled like emanations: there were to beheard dialogues, conversations, remarks that bit and stung. Threeor four boxes, however, were still vacant, in spite of the latenessof the hour. The performance had been advertised for half-past eightand it was already a quarter to nine, but the curtain did not go up,as his Excellency had not yet arrived. The gallery-gods, impatientand uncomfortable in their seats, started a racket, clapping theirhands and pounding the floor with their canes."Boom--boom--boom! Ring up the curtain! Boom--boom--boom!"The artillerymen were not the least noisy. Emulators of Mars, asBen-Zayb called them, they were not satisfied with this music; thinkingthemselves perhaps at a bullfight, they made remarks at the ladies whopassed before them in words that are euphemistically called flowersin Madrid, although at times they seem more like foul weeds. Withoutheeding the furious looks of the husbands, they bandied from one toanother the sentiments and longings inspired by so many beauties.In the reserved seats, where the ladies seemed to be afraid to venture,as few were to be seen there, a murmur of voices prevailed amidsuppressed laughter and clouds of tobacco smoke. They discussed themerits of the players and talked scandal, wondering if his Excellencyhad quarreled with the friars, if his presence at such a show wasa defiance or mere curiosity. Others gave no heed to these matters,but were engaged in attracting the attention of the ladies, throwingthemselves into attitudes more or less interesting and statuesque,flashing diamond rings, especially when they thought themselves thefoci of insistent opera-glasses, while yet another would address arespectful salute to this or that senora or senorita, at the same timelowering his head gravely to whisper to a neighbor, "How ridiculousshe is! And such a bore!"The lady would respond with one of her most gracious smiles and anenchanting nod of her head, while murmuring to a friend sitting near,amid lazy flourishes of her fan, "How impudent he is! He's madly inlove, my dear."Meanwhile, the noise increased. There remained only two vacantboxes, besides that of his Excellency, which was distinguished byits curtains of red velvet. The orchestra played another waltz, theaudience protested, when fortunately there arose a charitable hero todistract their attention and relieve the manager, in the person ofa man who had occupied a reserved seat and refused to give it up toits owner, the philosopher Don Primitivo. Finding his own argumentsuseless, Don Primitivo had appealed to an usher. "I don't care to,"the hero responded to the latter's protests, placidly puffing at hiscigarette. The usher appealed to the manager. "I don't care to," wasthe response, as he settled back in the seat. The manager went away,while the artillerymen in the gallery began to sing out encouragementto the usurper.Our hero, now that he had attracted general attention, thought thatto yield would be to lower himself, so he held on to the seat, whilehe repeated his answer to a pair of guards the manager had calledin. These, in consideration of the rebel's rank, went in search oftheir corporal, while the whole house broke out into applause at thefirmness of the hero, who remained seated like a Roman senator.Hisses were heard, and the inflexible gentleman turned angrily to seeif they were meant for him, but the galloping of horses resoundedand the stir increased. One might have said that a revolution hadbroken out, or at least a riot, but no, the orchestra had suspendedthe waltz and was playing the royal march: it was his Excellency, theCaptain-General and Governor of the islands, who was entering. Alleyes sought and followed him, then lost sight of him, until hefinally appeared in his box. After looking all about him and makingsome persons happy with a lordly salute, he sat down, as though hewere indeed the man for whom the chair was waiting. The artillerymenthen became silent and the orchestra tore into the prelude.Our students occupied a box directly facing that of Pepay, thedancing girl. Her box was a present from Makaraig, who had alreadygot on good terms with her in order to propitiate Don Custodio. Pepayhad that very afternoon written a note to the illustrious arbiter,asking for an answer and appointing an interview in the theater. Forthis reason, Don Custodio, in spite of the active opposition hehad manifested toward the French operetta, had gone to the theater,which action won him some caustic remarks on the part of Don Manuel,his ancient adversary in the sessions of the Ayuntamiento."I've come to judge the operetta," he had replied in the tone of aCato whose conscience was clear.So Makaraig was exchanging looks of intelligence with Pepay, who wasgiving him to understand that she had something to tell him. As thedancing girl's face wore a happy expression, the students auguredthat a favorable outcome was assured. Sandoval, who had just returnedfrom making calls in other boxes, also assured them that the decisionhad been favorable, that that very afternoon the Superior Commissionhad considered and approved it. Every one was jubilant, even Pecsonhaving laid aside his pessimism when he saw the smiling Pepay displaya note. Sandoval and Makaraig congratulated one another, Isagani aloneremaining cold and unsmiling. What had happened to this young man?Upon entering the theater, Isagani had caught sight of Paulita in abox, with Juanito Pelaez talking to her. He had turned pale, thinkingthat he must be mistaken. But no, it was she herself, she who greetedhim with a gracious smile, while her beautiful eyes seemed to beasking pardon and promising explanations. The fact was that they hadagreed upon Isagani's going first to the theater to see if the showcontained anything improper for a young woman, but now he found herthere, and in no other company than that of his rival. What passed inhis mind is indescribable: wrath, jealousy, humiliation, resentmentraged within him, and there were moments even when he wished thatthe theater would fall in; he had a violent desire to laugh aloud,to insult his sweetheart, to challenge his rival, to make a scene, butfinally contented himself with sitting quiet and not looking at her atall. He was conscious of the beautiful plans Makaraig and Sandoval weremaking, but they sounded like distant echoes, while the notes of thewaltz seemed sad and lugubrious, the whole audience stupid and foolish,and several times he had to make an effort to keep back the tears. Ofthe trouble stirred up by the hero who refused to give up the seat,of the arrival of the Captain-General, he was scarcely conscious. Hestared toward the drop-curtain, on which was depicted a kind ofgallery with sumptuous red hangings, affording a view of a garden inwhich a fountain played, yet how sad the gallery looked to him and howmelancholy the painted landscape! A thousand vague recollections surgedinto his memory like distant echoes of music heard in the night, likesongs of infancy, the murmur of lonely forests and gloomy rivulets,moonlit nights on the shore of the sea spread wide before his eyes. Sothe enamored youth considered himself very wretched and stared fixedlyat the ceiling so that the tears should not fall from his eyes.A burst of applause drew him from these meditations. The curtainhad just risen, and the merry chorus of peasants of Corneville waspresented, all dressed in cotton caps, with heavy wooden sabots ontheir feet. Some six or seven girls, well-rouged on the lips andcheeks, with large black circles around their eyes to increase theirbrilliance, displayed white arms, fingers covered with diamonds,round and shapely limbs. While they were chanting the Norman phrase"_Allez, marchez! Allez, marchez!_" they smiled at their differentadmirers in the reserved seats with such openness that Don Custodio,after looking toward Pepay's box to assure himself that she wasnot doing the same thing with some other admirer, set down in hisnote-book this indecency, and to make sure of it lowered his head alittle to see if the actresses were not showing their knees."Oh, these Frenchwomen!" he muttered, while his imagination lostitself in considerations somewhat more elevated, as he made comparisonsand projects."_Quoi v'la tous les cancans d'la s'maine!_" sang Gertrude, a prouddamsel, who was looking roguishly askance at the Captain-General."We're going to have the cancan!" exclaimed Tadeo, the winner of thefirst prize in the French class, who had managed to make out thisword. "Makaraig, they're going to dance the cancan!"He rubbed his hands gleefully. From the moment the curtain rose,Tadeo had been heedless of the music. He was looking only for theprurient, the indecent, the immoral in actions and dress, and withhis scanty French was sharpening his ears to catch the obscenitiesthat the austere guardians of the fatherland had foretold.Sandoval, pretending to know French, had converted himself into akind of interpreter for his friends. He knew as much about it asTadeo, but the published synopsis helped him and his fancy suppliedthe rest. "Yes," he said, "they're going to dance the cancan--she'sgoing to lead it."Makaraig and Pecson redoubled their attention, smiling in anticipation,while Isagani looked away, mortified to think that Paulita shouldbe present at such a show and reflecting that it was his duty tochallenge Juanito Pelaez the next day.But the young men waited in vain. Serpolette came on, a charming girl,in her cotton cap, provoking and challenging. "_Hein, qui parle deSerpolette?_" she demanded of the gossips, with her arms akimbo ina combative attitude. Some one applauded, and after him all those inthe reserved seats. Without changing her girlish attitude, Serpolettegazed at the person who had started the applause and paid him with asmile, displaying rows of little teeth that looked like a string ofpearls in a case of red velvet.Tadeo followed her gaze and saw a man in a false mustache with anextraordinarily large nose. "By the monk's cowl!" he exclaimed. "It'sIrene!""Yes," corroborated Sandoval, "I saw him behind the scenes talkingwith the actresses."The truth was that Padre Irene, who was a melomaniac of the firstdegree and knew French well, had been sent to the theater by PadreSalvi as a sort of religious detective, or so at least he toldthe persons who recognized him. As a faithful critic, who shouldnot be satisfied with viewing the piece from a distance, he wishedto examine the actresses at first hand, so he had mingled in thegroups of admirers and gallants, had penetrated into the greenroom,where was whispered and talked a French required by the situation,a _market French_, a language that is readily comprehensible for thevender when the buyer seems disposed to pay well.Serpolette was surrounded by two gallant officers, a sailor, and alawyer, when she caught sight of him moving about, sticking the tipof his long nose into all the nooks and corners, as though with ithe were ferreting out all the mysteries of the stage. She ceased herchatter, knitted her eyebrows, then raised them, opened her lips andwith the vivacity of a _Parisienne_ left her admirers to hurl herselflike a torpedo upon our critic."_Tiens, tiens, Toutou! Mon lapin!_" she cried, catching Padre Irene'sarm and shaking it merrily, while the air rang with her silvery laugh."Tut, tut!" objected Padre Irene, endeavoring to conceal himself."_Mais, comment! Toi ici, grosse bete! Et moi qui t'croyais--_""_'Tais pas d'tapage, Lily! Il faut m'respecter! 'Suis ici l'Pape!_"With great difficulty Padre Irene made her listen to reason, for Lilywas _enchantee_ to meet in Manila an old friend who reminded her ofthe _coulisses_ of the Grand Opera House. So it was that Padre Irene,fulfilling at the same time his duties as a friend and a critic, hadinitiated the applause to encourage her, for Serpolette deserved it.Meanwhile, the young men were waiting for the cancan. Pecson becameall eyes, but there was everything except cancan. There was presentedthe scene in which, but for the timely arrival of the representativesof the law, the women would have come to blows and torn one another'shair out, incited thereto by the mischievous peasants, who, like ourstudents, hoped to see something more than the cancan.    Scit, scit, scit, scit, scit, scit,    Disputez-vous, battez-vous,    Scit, scit, scit, scit, scit, scit,    Nous allons compter les coups.The music ceased, the men went away, the women returned, a few ata time, and started a conversation among themselves, of which ourfriends understood nothing. They were slandering some absent person."They look like the Chinamen of the _pansiteria!_" whispered Pecson."But, the cancan?" asked Makaraig."They're talking about the most suitable place to dance it," gravelyresponded Sandoval."They look like the Chinamen of the _pansiteria_," repeated Pecsonin disgust.A lady accompanied by her husband entered at that moment and took herplace in one of the two vacant boxes. She had the air of a queen andgazed disdainfully at the whole house, as if to say, "I've come laterthan all of you, you crowd of upstarts and provincials, I've come laterthan you!" There are persons who go to the theater like the contestantsin a mule-race: the last one in, wins, and we know very sensible menwho would ascend the scaffold rather than enter a theater before thefirst act. But the lady's triumph was of short duration--she caughtsight of the other box that was still empty, and began to scold herbetter half, thus starting such a disturbance that many were annoyed."Ssh! Ssh!""The blockheads! As if they understood French!" remarked the lady,gazing with supreme disdain in all directions, finally fixing herattention on Juanito's box, whence she thought she had heard animpudent hiss.Juanito was in fact guilty, for he had been pretending to understandeverything, holding himself up proudly and applauding at times asthough nothing that was said escaped him, and this too without guidinghimself by the actors' pantomime, because he scarcely looked towardthe stage. The rogue had intentionally remarked to Paulita that,as there was so much more beautiful a woman close at hand, he didnot care to strain his eyes looking beyond her. Paulita had blushed,covered her face with her fan, and glanced stealthily toward whereIsagani, silent and morose, was abstractedly watching the show.Paulita felt nettled and jealous. Would Isagani fall in love withany of those alluring actresses? The thought put her in a bad humor,so she scarcely heard the praises that Dona Victorina was heapingupon her own favorite.Juanito was playing his part well: he shook his head at times in signof disapproval, and then there could be heard coughs and murmurs insome parts, at other times he smiled in approbation, and a second laterapplause resounded. Dona Victorina was charmed, even conceiving somevague ideas of marrying the young man the day Don Tiburcio shoulddie--Juanito knew French and De Espadana didn't! Then she began toflatter him, nor did he perceive the change in the drift of her talk,so occupied was he in watching a Catalan merchant who was sittingnext to the Swiss consul. Having observed that they were conversing inFrench, Juanito was getting his inspiration from their countenances,and thus grandly giving the cue to those about him.Scene followed scene, character succeeded character, comic andridiculous like the bailiff and Grenicheux, imposing and winsome likethe marquis and Germaine. The audience laughed heartily at the slapdelivered by Gaspard and intended for the coward Grenicheux, which wasreceived by the grave bailiff, whose wig went flying through the air,producing disorder and confusion as the curtain dropped."Where's the cancan?" inquired Tadeo.But the curtain rose again immediately, revealing a scene in a servantmarket, with three posts on which were affixed signs bearing theannouncements: _servantes_, _cochers_, and _domestiques_. Juanito, toimprove the opportunity, turned to Dona Victorina and said in a loudvoice, so that Paulita might hear and he convinced of his learning:"_Servantes_ means servants, _domestiques_ domestics.""And in what way do the _servantes_ differ from the_domestiques_?" asked Paulita.Juanito was not found wanting. "_Domestiques_ are those that aredomesticated--haven't you noticed that some of them have the air ofsavages? Those are the _servantes_.""That's right," added Dona Victorina, "some have very bad manners--andyet I thought that in Europe everybody was cultivated. But as ithappens in France,--well, I see!""Ssh! Ssh!"But what was Juanito's predicament when the time came for the openingof the market and the beginning of the sale, and the servants who wereto be hired placed themselves beside the signs that indicated theirclass! The men, some ten or twelve rough characters in livery, carryingbranches in their hands, took their place under the sign _domestiques_!"Those are the domestics," explained Juanito."Really, they have the appearance of being only recently domesticated,"observed Dona Victorina. "Now let's have a look at the savages."Then the dozen girls headed by the lively and merry Serpolette, deckedout in their best clothes, each wearing a big bouquet of flowers atthe waist, laughing, smiling, fresh and attractive, placed themselves,to Juanito's great desperation, beside the post of the _servantes_."How's this?" asked Paulita guilelessly. "Are those the savages thatyou spoke of?""No," replied the imperturbable Juanito, "there's a mistake--they'vegot their places mixed--those coming behind--""Those with the whips?"Juanito nodded assent, but he was rather perplexed and uneasy."So those girls are the _cochers_?"Here Juanito was attacked by such a violent fit of coughing that someof the spectators became annoyed."Put him out! Put the consumptive out!" called a voice.Consumptive! To be called a consumptive before Paulita! Juanitowanted to find the blackguard and make him swallow that"consumptive." Observing that the women were trying to hold him back,his bravado increased, and he became more conspicuously ferocious. Butfortunately it was Don Custodio who had made the diagnosis, and he,fearful of attracting attention to himself, pretended to hear nothing,apparently busy with his criticism of the play."If it weren't that I am with you," remarked Juanito, rolling hiseyes like some dolls that are moved by clockwork, and to make theresemblance more real he stuck out his tongue occasionally.Thus that night he acquired in Dona Victorina's eyes the reputationof being brave and punctilious, so she decided in her heart thatshe would marry him just as soon as Don Tiburcio was out of theway. Paulita became sadder and sadder in thinking about how the girlscalled _cochers_ could occupy Isagani's attention, for the name hadcertain disagreeable associations that came from the slang of herconvent school-days.At length the first act was concluded, the marquis taking away asservants Serpolette and Germaine, the representative of timid beautyin the troupe, and for coachman the stupid Grenicheux. A burst ofapplause brought them out again holding hands, those who five secondsbefore had been tormenting one another and were about to come to blows,bowing and smiling here and there to the gallant Manila public andexchanging knowing looks with various spectators.While there prevailed the passing tumult occasioned by those whocrowded one another to get into the greenroom and felicitate theactresses and by those who were going to make calls on the ladies inthe boxes, some expressed their opinions of the play and the players."Undoubtedly, Serpolette is the best," said one with a knowing air."I prefer Germaine, she's an ideal blonde.""But she hasn't any voice.""What do I care about the voice?""Well, for shape, the tall one.""Pshaw," said Ben-Zayb, "not a one is worth a straw, not a one isan artist!"Ben-Zayb was the critic for _El Grito de la Integridad_, and hisdisdainful air gave him great importance in the eyes of those whowere satisfied with so little."Serpolette hasn't any voice, nor Germaine grace, nor is thatmusic, nor is it art, nor is it anything!" he concluded with markedcontempt. To set oneself up as a great critic there is nothing likeappearing to be discontented with everything. Besides, the managementhad sent only two seats for the newspaper staff.In the boxes curiosity was aroused as to who could be the possessorof the empty one, for that person, would surpass every one in chic,since he would be the last to arrive. The rumor started somewherethat it belonged to Simoun, and was confirmed: no one had seen thejeweler in the reserved seats, the greenroom, or anywhere else."Yet I saw him this afternoon with Mr. Jouay," some one said. "Hepresented a necklace to one of the actresses.""To which one?" asked some of the inquisitive ladies."To the finest of all, the one who made eyes at his Excellency."This information was received with looks of intelligence, winks,exclamations of doubt, of confirmation, and half-uttered commentaries."He's trying to play the Monte Cristo," remarked a lady who pridedherself on being literary."Or purveyor to the Palace!" added her escort, jealous of Simoun.In the students' box, Pecson, Sandoval, and Isagani had remained,while Tadeo had gone to engage Don Custodio in conversation abouthis projects, and Makaraig to hold an interview with Pepay."In no way, as I have observed to you before, friend Isagani,"declared Sandoval with violent gestures and a sonorous voice, sothat the ladies near the box, the daughters of the rich man who wasin debt to Tadeo, might hear him, "in no way does the French languagepossess the rich sonorousness or the varied and elegant cadence of theCastilian tongue. I cannot conceive, I cannot imagine, I cannot formany idea of French orators, and I doubt that they have ever had anyor can have any now in the strict construction of the term orator,because we must not confuse the name orator with the words babblerand charlatan, for these can exist in any country, in all the regionsof the inhabited world, among the cold and curt Englishmen as amongthe lively and impressionable Frenchmen."Thus he delivered a magnificent review of the nations, with hispoetical characterizations and most resounding epithets. Isagani noddedassent, with his thoughts fixed on Paulita, whom he had surprisedgazing at him with an expressive look which contained a wealth ofmeaning. He tried to divine what those eyes were expressing--thoseeyes that were so eloquent and not at all deceptive."Now you who are a poet, a slave to rhyme and meter, a son of theMuses," continued Sandoval, with an elegant wave of his hand, asthough he were saluting, on the horizon, the Nine Sisters, "do youcomprehend, can you conceive, how a language so harsh and unmusicalas French can give birth to poets of such gigantic stature as ourGarcilasos, our Herreras, our Esproncedas, our Calderons?""Nevertheless," objected Pecson, "Victor Hugo--""Victor Hugo, my friend Pecson, if Victor Hugo is a poet, it isbecause he owes it to Spain, because it is an established fact, itis a matter beyond all doubt, a thing admitted even by the Frenchmenthemselves, so envious of Spain, that if Victor Hugo has genius, ifhe really is a poet, it is because his childhood was spent in Madrid;there he drank in his first impressions, there his brain was molded,there his imagination was colored, his heart modeled, and the mostbeautiful concepts of his mind born. And after all, who is VictorHugo? Is he to be compared at all with our modern--"This peroration was cut short by the return of Makaraig with adespondent air and a bitter smile on his lips, carrying in his handa note, which he offered silently to Sandoval, who read:    "MY DOVE: Your letter has reached me late, for I have already    handed in my decision, and it has been approved. However,    as if I had guessed your wish, I have decided the matter    according to the desires of your proteges. I'll be at the    theater and wait for you after the performance.        "Your duckling,            "CUSTODINING.""How tender the man is!" exclaimed Tadeo with emotion."Well?" said Sandoval. "I don't see anything wrong about this--quitethe reverse!""Yes," rejoined Makaraig with his bitter smile, "decidedfavorably! I've just seen Padre Irene.""What does Padre Irene say?" inquired Pecson."The same as Don Custodio, and the rascal still had the audacityto congratulate me. The Commission, which has taken as its own thedecision of the arbiter, approves the idea and felicitates the studentson their patriotism and their thirst for knowledge--""Well?""Only that, considering our duties--in short, it says that in orderthat the idea may not be lost, it concludes that the directionand execution of the plan should be placed in charge of one ofthe religious corporations, in case the Dominicans do not wish toincorporate the academy with the University."Exclamations of disappointment greeted the announcement. Isagani rose,but said nothing."And in order that we may participate in the management of theacademy," Makaraig went on, "we are intrusted with the collectionof contributions and dues, with the obligation of turning them overto the treasurer whom the corporation may designate, which treasurerwill issue us receipts.""Then we're tax-collectors!" remarked Tadeo."Sandoval," said Pecson, "there's the gauntlet--take it up!""Huh! That's not a gauntlet--from its odor it seems more like a sock.""The funniest, part of it," Makaraig added, "is that Padre Irene hasadvised us to celebrate the event with a banquet or a torchlightprocession--a public demonstration of the students _en masse_ torender thanks to all the persons who have intervened in the affair.""Yes, after the blow, let's sing and give thanks. _Super fluminaBabylonis sedimus_!""Yes, a banquet like that of the convicts," said Tadeo."A banquet at which we all wear mourning and deliver funeral orations,"added Sandoval."A serenade with the Marseillaise and funeral marches," proposedIsagani."No, gentlemen," observed Pecson with his clownish grin, "to celebratethe event there's nothing like a banquet in a _pansiteria_, servedby the Chinamen without camisas. I insist, without camisas!"The sarcasm and grotesqueness of this idea won it ready acceptance,Sandoval being the first to applaud it, for he had long wished to seethe interior of one of those establishments which at night appearedto be so merry and cheerful.Just as the orchestra struck up for the second act, the young menarose and left the theater, to the scandal of the whole house.CHAPTER XXIIIA CORPSESimoun had not, in fact, gone to the theater. Already, at seven o'clockin the evening, he had left his house looking worried and gloomy. Hisservants saw him return twice, accompanied by different individuals,and at eight o'clock Makaraig encountered him pacing along CalleHospital near the nunnery of St. Clara, just when the bells of itschurch were ringing a funeral knell. At nine Camaroncocido saw himagain, in the neighborhood of the theater, speak with a person whoseemed to be a student, pay the latter's admission to the show,and again disappear among the shadows of the trees."What is it to me?" again muttered Camaroncocido. "What do I get outof watching over the populace?"Basilio, as Makaraig said, had not gone to the show. The poor student,after returning from San Diego, whither he had gone to ransom Juli,his future bride, from her servitude, had turned again to his studies,spending his time in the hospital, in studying, or in nursing CapitanTiago, whose affliction he was trying to cure.The invalid had become an intolerable character. During his bad spells,when he felt depressed from lack of opium, the doses of which Basiliowas trying to reduce, he would scold, mistreat, and abuse the boy, whobore it resignedly, conscious that he was doing good to one to whomhe owed so much, and yielded only in the last extremity. His viciousappetite satisfied, Capitan Tiago would fall into a good humor, becometender, and call him his son, tearfully recalling the youth's services,how well he administered the estates, and would even talk of making himhis heir. Basilio would smile bitterly and reflect that in this worldcomplaisance with vice is rewarded better than fulfilment of duty. Nota few times did he feel tempted to give free rein to the craving andconduct his benefactor to the grave by a path of flowers and smilingillusions rather than lengthen his life along a road of sacrifice."What a fool I am!" he often said to himself. "People are stupid andthen pay for it."But he would shake his head as he thought of Juli, of the widefuture before him. He counted upon living without a stain on hisconscience, so he continued the treatment prescribed, and boreeverything patiently.Yet with all his care the sick man, except for short periods ofimprovement, grew worse. Basilio had planned gradually to reducethe amount of the dose, or at least not to let him injure himselfby increasing it, but on returning from the hospital or some visithe would find his patient in the heavy slumber produced by the opium,driveling, pale as a corpse. The young man could not explain whence thedrug came: the only two persons who visited the house were Simoun andPadre Irene, the former rarely, while the latter never ceased exhortinghim to be severe and inexorable with the treatment, to take no noticeof the invalid's ravings, for the main object was to save him."Do your duty, young man," was Padre Irene's constant admonition. "Doyour duty." Then he would deliver a sermon on this topic with suchgreat conviction and enthusiasm that Basilio would begin to feelkindly toward the preacher. Besides, Padre Irene promised to get him afine assignment, a good province, and even hinted at the possibilityof having him appointed a professor. Without being carried away byillusions, Basilio pretended to believe in them and went on obeyingthe dictates of his own conscience.That night, while _Les Cloches de Corneville_ was being presented,Basilio was studying at an old table by the light of an oil-lamp, whosethick glass globe partly illuminated his melancholy features. An oldskull, some human bones, and a few books carefully arranged coveredthe table, whereon there was also a pan of water with a sponge. Thesmell of opium that proceeded from the adjoining bedroom made theair heavy and inclined him to sleep, but he overcame the desire bybathing his temples and eyes from time to time, determined not to goto sleep until he had finished the book, which he had borrowed andmust return as soon as possible. It was a volume of the _MedicinaLegal y Toxicologia_ of Dr. Friata, the only book that the professorwould use, and Basilio lacked money to buy a copy, since, underthe pretext of its being forbidden by the censor in Manila and thenecessity for bribing many government employees to get it in, thebooksellers charged a high price for it.So absorbed wras the youth in his studies that he had not given anyattention at all to some pamphlets that had been sent to him fromsome unknown source, pamphlets that treated of the Philippines, amongwhich figured those that were attracting the greatest notice at thetime because of their harsh and insulting manner of referring to thenatives of the country. Basilio had no time to open them, and he wasperhaps restrained also by the thought that there is nothing pleasantabout receiving an insult or a provocation without having any meansof replying or defending oneself. The censorship, in fact, permittedinsults to the Filipinos but prohibited replies on their part.In the midst of the silence that reigned in the house, broken only bya feeble snore that issued now and then from the adjoining bedroom,Basilio heard light footfalls on the stairs, footfalls that sooncrossed the hallway and approached the room where he was. Raisinghis head, he saw the door open and to his great surprise appearedthe sinister figure of the jeweler Simoun, who since the scene inSan Diego had not come to visit either himself or Capitan Tiago."How is the sick man?" he inquired, throwing a rapid glance about theroom and fixing his attention on the pamphlets, the leaves of whichwere still uncut."The beating of his heart is scarcely perceptible, his pulse is veryweak, his appetite entirely gone," replied Basilio in a low voicewith a sad smile. "He sweats profusely in the early morning."Noticing that Simoun kept his face turned toward the pamphlets andfearing that he might reopen the subject of their conversation inthe wood, he went on: "His system is saturated with poison. He maydie any day, as though struck by lightning. The least irritation,any excitement may kill him.""Like the Philippines!" observed Simoun lugubriously.Basilio was unable to refrain from a gesture of impatience, but hewas determined not to recur to the old subject, so he proceeded as ifhe had heard nothing: "What weakens him the most is the nightmares,his terrors--""Like the government!" again interrupted Simoun."Several nights ago he awoke in the dark and thought that he hadgone blind. He raised a disturbance, lamenting and scolding me,saying that I had put his eyes out. When I entered his room with alight he mistook me for Padre Irene and called me his saviour.""Like the government, exactly!""Last night," continued Basilio, paying no attention, "he got upbegging for his favorite game-cock, the one that died three yearsago, and I had to give him a chicken. Then he heaped blessings uponme and promised me many thousands--"At that instant a clock struck half-past ten. Simoun shuddered andstopped the youth with a gesture."Basilio," he said in a low, tense voice, "listen to me carefully,for the moments are precious. I see that you haven't opened thepamphlets that I sent you. You're not interested in your country."The youth started to protest."It's useless," went on Simoun dryly. "Within an hour the revolutionis going to break out at a signal from me, and tomorrow there'llbe no studies, there'll be no University, there'll be nothing butfighting and butchery. I have everything ready and my success isassured. When we triumph, all those who could have helped us and didnot do so will be treated as enemies. Basilio, I've come to offeryou death or a future!""Death or a future!" the boy echoed, as though he did not understand."With us or with the government," rejoined Simoun. "With your countryor with your oppressors. Decide, for time presses! I've come to saveyou because of the memories that unite us!""With my country or with the oppressors!" repeated Basilio in a lowtone. The youth was stupefied. He gazed at the jeweler with eyesin which terror was reflected, he felt his limbs turn cold, while athousand confused ideas whirled about in his mind. He saw the streetsrunning blood, he heard the firing, he found himself among the dead andwounded, and by the peculiar force of his inclinations fancied himselfin an operator's blouse, cutting off legs and extracting bullets."The will of the government is in my hands," said Simoun. "I'vediverted and wasted its feeble strength and resources on foolishexpeditions, dazzling it with the plunder it might seize. Its headsare now in the theater, calm and unsuspecting, thinking of a nightof pleasure, but not one shall again repose upon a pillow. I havemen and regiments at my disposition: some I have led to believe thatthe uprising is ordered by the General; others that the friars arebringing it about; some I have bought with promises, with employments,with money; many, very many, are acting from revenge, because they areoppressed and see it as a matter of killing or being killed. CabesangTales is below, he has come with me here! Again I ask you--will youcome with us or do you prefer to expose yourself to the resentmentof my followers? In critical moments, to declare oneself neutral isto be exposed to the wrath of both the contending parties."Basilio rubbed his hand over his face several times, as if he weretrying to wake from a nightmare. He felt that his brow was cold."Decide!" repeated Simoun."And what--what would I have to do?" asked the youth in a weak andbroken voice."A very simple thing," replied Simoun, his face lighting up with aray of hope. "As I have to direct the movement, I cannot get away fromthe scene of action. I want you, while the attention of the whole cityis directed elsewhere, at the head of a company to force the doors ofthe nunnery of St. Clara and take from there a person whom only you,besides myself and Capitan Tiago, can recognize. You'll run no riskat all.""Maria Clara!" exclaimed Basilio."Yes, Maria Clara," repeated Simoun, and for the first time his voicebecame human and compassionate. "I want to save her; to save her Ihave wished to live, I have returned. I am starting the revolution,because only a revolution can open the doors of the nunneries.""Ay!" sighed Basilio, clasping his hands. "You've come late, too late!""Why?" inquired Simoun with a frown."Maria Clara is dead!"Simoun arose with a bound and stood over the youth. "She's dead?" hedemanded in a terrible voice."This afternoon, at six. By now she must be--""It's a lie!" roared Simoun, pale and beside himself. "It'sfalse! Maria Clara lives, Maria Clara must live! It's a cowardlyexcuse! She's not dead, and this night I'll free her or tomorrowyou die!"Basilio shrugged his shoulders. "Several days ago she was taken illand I went to the nunnery for news of her. Look, here is Padre Salvi'sletter, brought by Padre Irene. Capitan Tiago wept all the evening,kissing his daughter's picture and begging her forgiveness, until atlast he smoked an enormous quantity of opium. This evening her knellwas tolled.""Ah!" exclaimed Simoun, pressing his hands to his head and standingmotionless. He remembered to have actually heard the knell while hewas pacing about in the vicinity of the nunnery."Dead!" he murmured in a voice so low that it seemed to be a ghostwhispering. "Dead! Dead without my having seen her, dead withoutknowing that I lived for her--dead!"Feeling a terrible storm, a tempest of whirlwind and thunder withouta drop of water, sobs without tears, cries without words, rage in hisbreast and threaten to burst out like burning lava long repressed,he rushed precipitately from the room. Basilio heard him descend thestairs with unsteady tread, stepping heavily, he heard a stifled cry,a cry that seemed to presage death, so solemn, deep, and sad thathe arose from his chair pale and trembling, but he could hear thefootsteps die away and the noisy closing of the door to the street."Poor fellow!" he murmured, while his eyes filled with tears. Heedlessnow of his studies, he let his gaze wander into space as he ponderedover the fate of those two beings: he--young, rich, educated, masterof his fortunes, with a brilliant future before him; she--fair asa dream, pure, full of faith and innocence, nurtured amid love andlaughter, destined to a happy existence, to be adored in the familyand respected in the world; and yet of those two beings, filled withlove, with illusions and hopes, by a fatal destiny he wandered overthe world, dragged ceaselessly through a whirl of blood and tears,sowing evil instead of doing good, undoing virtue and encouraging vice,while she was dying in the mysterious shadows of the cloister whereshe had sought peace and perhaps found suffering, where she enteredpure and stainless and expired like a crushed flower!Sleep in peace, ill-starred daughter of my hapless fatherland! Buryin the grave the enchantments of youth, faded in their prime! When apeople cannot offer its daughters a tranquil home under the protectionof sacred liberty, when a man can only leave to his widow blushes,tears to his mother, and slavery to his children, you do well tocondemn yourself to perpetual chastity, stifling within you the germof a future generation accursed! Well for you that you have notto shudder in your grave, hearing the cries of those who groan indarkness, of those who feel that they have wings and yet are fettered,of those who are stifled from lack of liberty! Go, go with your poet'sdreams into the regions of the infinite, spirit of woman dim-shadowedin the moonlight's beam, whispered in the bending arches of thebamboo-brakes! Happy she who dies lamented, she who leaves in theheart that loves her a pure picture, a sacred remembrance, unspottedby the base passions engendered by the years! Go, we shall rememberyou! In the clear air of our native land, under its azure sky, abovethe billows of the lake set amid sapphire hills and emerald shores,in the crystal streams shaded by the bamboos, bordered by flowers,enlivened by the beetles and butterflies with their uncertain andwavering flight as though playing with the air, in the silence ofour forests, in the singing of our rivers, in the diamond showers ofour waterfalls, in the resplendent light of our moon, in the sighs ofthe night breeze, in all that may call up the vision of the beloved,we must eternally see you as we dreamed of you, fair, beautiful,radiant with hope, pure as the light, yet still sad and melancholyin the contemplation of our woes!CHAPTER XXIVDREAMS    Amor, que astro eres?On the following day, Thursday, at the hour of sunset, Isaganiwas walking along the beautiful promenade of Maria Cristina in thedirection of the Malecon to keep an appointment which Paulita had thatmorning given him. The young man had no doubt that they were to talkabout what had happened on the previous night, and as he was determinedto ask for an explanation, and knew how proud and haughty she was,he foresaw an estrangement. In view of this eventuality he had broughtwith him the only two letters he had ever received from Paulita, twoscraps of paper, whereon were merely a few hurriedly written lineswith various blots, but in an even handwriting, things that did notprevent the enamored youth from preserving them with more solicitudethan if they had been the autographs of Sappho and the Muse Polyhymnia.This decision to sacrifice his love on the altar of dignity, theconsciousness of suffering in the discharge of duty, did not preventa profound melancholy from taking possession of Isagani and broughtback into his mind the beautiful days, and nights more beautifulstill, when they had whispered sweet nothings through the floweredgratings of the entresol, nothings that to the youth took on such acharacter of seriousness and importance that they seemed to him theonly matters worthy of meriting the attention of the most exalted humanunderstanding. He recalled the walks on moonlit nights, the fair, thedark December mornings after the mass of Nativity, the holy water thathe used to offer her, when she would thank him with a look chargedwith a whole epic of love, both of them trembling as their fingerstouched. Heavy sighs, like small rockets, issued from his breastand brought back to him all the verses, all the sayings of poets andwriters about the inconstancy of woman. Inwardly he cursed the creationof theaters, the French operetta, and vowed to get revenge on Pelaez atthe first opportunity. Everything about him appeared under the saddestand somberest colors: the bay, deserted and solitary, seemed moresolitary still on account of the few steamers that were anchored init; the sun was dying behind Mariveles without poetry or enchantment,without the capricious and richly tinted clouds of happier evenings;the Anda monument, in bad taste, mean and squat, without style, withoutgrandeur, looked like a lump of ice-cream or at best a chunk of cake;the people who were promenading along the Malecon, in spite of theircomplacent and contented air, appeared distant, haughty, and vain;mischievous and bad-mannered, the boys that played on the beach,skipping flat stones over the surface of the water or searching inthe sand for mollusks and crustaceans which they caught for the merefun of catching and killed without benefit to themselves; in short,even the eternal port works to which he had dedicated more than threeodes, looked to him absurd, ridiculous child's play.The port, ah, the port of Manila, a bastard that since its conceptionhad brought tears of humiliation and shame to all! If only after somany tears there were not being brought forth a useless abortion!Abstractedly he saluted two Jesuits, former teachers of his, andscarcely noticed a tandem in which an American rode and excitedthe envy of the gallants who were in calesas only. Near the Andamonument he heard Ben-Zayb talking with another person aboutSimoun, learning that the latter had on the previous night beentaken suddenly ill, that he refused to see any one, even the veryaides of the General. "Yes!" exclaimed Isagani with a bitter smile,"for him attentions because he is rich. The soldiers return fromtheir expeditions sick and wounded, but no one visits them."Musing over these expeditions, over the fate of the poor soldiers,over the resistance offered by the islanders to the foreign yoke, hethought that, death for death, if that of the soldiers was gloriousbecause they were obeying orders, that of the islanders was sublimebecause they were defending their homes. [49]"A strange destiny, that of some peoples!" he mused. "Because atraveler arrives at their shores, they lose their liberty and becomesubjects and slaves, not only of the traveler, not only of his heirs,but even of all his countrymen, and not for a generation, but forall time! A strange conception of justice! Such a state of affairsgives ample right to exterminate every foreigner as the most ferociousmonster that the sea can cast up!"He reflected that those islanders, against whom his country was wagingwar, after all were guilty of no crime other than that of weakness. Thetravelers also arrived at the shores of other peoples, but findingthem strong made no display of their strange pretension. With alltheir weakness the spectacle they presented seemed beautiful to him,and the names of the enemies, whom the newspapers did not fail to callcowards and traitors, appeared glorious to him, as they succumbed withglory amid the ruins of their crude fortifications, with greater gloryeven than the ancient Trojan heroes, for those islanders had carriedaway no Philippine Helen! In his poetic enthusiasm he thought of theyoung men of those islands who could cover themselves with glory inthe eyes of their women, and in his amorous desperation he enviedthem because they could find a brilliant suicide."Ah, I should like to die," he exclaimed, "be reduced to nothingness,leave to my native land a glorious name, perish in its cause, defendingit from foreign invasion, and then let the sun afterwards illuminemy corpse, like a motionless sentinel on the rocks of the sea!"The conflict with the Germans [50] came into his mind and he almostfelt sorry that it had been adjusted: he would gladly have died forthe Spanish-Filipino banner before submitting to the foreigner."Because, after all," he mused, "with Spain we are united by firmbonds--the past, history, religion, language--"Language, yes, language! A sarcastic smile curled his lips. That verynight they would hold a banquet in the _pansiteria_ to _celebrate_the demise of the academy of Castilian."Ay!" he sighed, "provided the liberals in Spain are like those wehave here, in a little while the mother country will be able to countthe number of the faithful!"Slowly the night descended, and with it melancholy settled more heavilyupon the heart of the young man, who had almost lost hope of seeingPaulita. The promenaders one by one left the Malecon for the Luneta,the music from which was borne to him in snatches of melodies on thefresh evening breeze; the sailors on a warship anchored in the riverperformed their evening drill, skipping about among the slender ropeslike spiders; the boats one by one lighted their lamps, thus givingsigns of life; while the beach,    Do el viento riza las calladas olas    Que con blando murmullo en la ribera    Se deslizan veloces por si solas. [51]as Alaejos says, exhaled in the distance thin, vapors that the moon,now at its full, gradually converted into mysterious transparent gauze.A distant sound became audible, a noise that rapidlyapproached. Isagani turned his head and his heart began to beatviolently. A carriage was coming, drawn by white horses, the whitehorses that he would know among a hundred thousand. In the carriagerode Paulita and her friend of the night before, with Dona Victorina.Before the young man could take a step, Paulita had leaped to theground with sylph-like agility and smiled at him with a smile full ofconciliation. He smiled in return, and it seemed to him that all theclouds, all the black thoughts that before had beset him, vanishedlike smoke, the sky lighted up, the breeze sang, flowers covered thegrass by the roadside. But unfortunately Dona Victorina was there andshe pounced upon the young man to ask him for news of Don Tiburcio,since Isagani had undertaken to discover his hiding-place by inquiryamong the students he knew."No one has been able to tell me up to now," he answered, and he wastelling the truth, for Don Tiburcio was really hidden in the houseof the youth's own uncle, Padre Florentino."Let him know," declared Dona Victorina furiously, "that I'll call inthe Civil Guard. Alive or dead, I want to know where he is--becauseone has to wait ten years before marrying again."Isagani gazed at her in fright--Dona Victorina was thinking ofremarrying! Who could the unfortunate be?"What do you think of Juanito Pelaez?" she asked him suddenly.Juanito! Isagani knew not what to reply. He was tempted to tell allthe evil he knew of Pelaez, but a feeling of delicacy triumphed in hisheart and he spoke well of his rival, for the very reason that he wassuch. Dona Victorina, entirely satisfied and becoming enthusiastic,then broke out into exaggerations of Pelaez's merits and was alreadygoing to make Isagani a confidant of her new passion when Paulita'sfriend came running to say that the former's fan had fallen amongthe stones of the beach, near the Malecon. Stratagem or accident, thefact is that this mischance gave an excuse for the friend to remainwith the old woman, while Isagani might talk with Paulita. Moreover,it was a matter of rejoicing to Dona Victorina, since to get Juanitofor herself she was favoring Isagani's love.Paulita had her plan ready. On thanking him she assumed the role ofthe offended party, showed resentment, and gave him to understand thatshe was surprised to meet him there when everybody was on the Luneta,even the French actresses."You made the appointment for me, how could I be elsewhere?""Yet last night you did not even notice that I was in the theater. Iwas watching you all the time and you never took your eyes off those_cochers_."So they exchanged parts: Isagani, who had come to demand explanations,found himself compelled to give them and considered himself very happywhen Paulita said that she forgave him. In regard to her presenceat the theater, he even had to thank her for that: forced by heraunt, she had decided to go in the hope of seeing him during theperformance. Little she cared for Juanito Pelaez!"My aunt's the one who is in love with him," she said with a merrylaugh.Then they both laughed, for the marriage of Pelaez with Dona Victorinamade them really happy, and they saw it already an accomplishedfact, until Isagani remembered that Don Tiburcio was still living andconfided the secret to his sweetheart, after exacting her promise thatshe would tell no one. Paulita promised, with the mental reservationof relating it to her friend.This led the conversation to Isagani's town, surrounded by forests,situated on the shore of the sea which roared at the base of thehigh cliffs. Isagani's gaze lighted up when he spoke of that obscurespot, a flush of pride overspread his cheeks, his voice trembled,his poetic imagination glowed, his words poured forth burning,charged with enthusiasm, as if he were talking of love to his love,and he could not but exclaim:"Oh, in the solitude of my mountains I feel free, free as the air,as the light that shoots unbridled through space! A thousand cities, athousand palaces, would I give for that spot in the Philippines, where,far from men, I could feel myself to have genuine liberty. There,face to face with nature, in the presence of the mysterious and theinfinite, the forest and the sea, I think, speak, and work like aman who knows not tyrants."In the presence of such enthusiasm for his native place, an enthusiasmthat she did not comprehend, for she was accustomed to hear her countryspoken ill of, and sometimes joined in the chorus herself, Paulitamanifested some jealousy, as usual making herself the offended party.But Isagani very quickly pacified her. "Yes," he said, "I loved itabove all things before I knew you! It was my delight to wander throughthe thickets, to sleep in the shade of the trees, to seat myself upona cliff to take in with my gaze the Pacific which rolled its bluewaves before me, bringing to me echoes of songs learned on the shoresof free America. Before knowing you, that sea was for me my world,my delight, my love, my dream! When it slept in calm with the sunshining overhead, it was my delight to gaze into the abyss hundredsof feet below me, seeking monsters in the forests of madrepores andcoral that were revealed through the limpid blue, enormous serpentsthat the country folk say leave the forests to dwell in the sea, andthere take on frightful forms. Evening, they say, is the time whenthe sirens appear, and I saw them between the waves--so great wasmy eagerness that once I thought I could discern them amid the foam,busy in their divine sports, I distinctly heard their songs, songs ofliberty, and I made out the sounds of their silvery harps. FormerlyI spent hours and hours watching the transformations in the clouds,or gazing at a solitary tree in the plain or a high rock, withoutknowing why, without being able to explain the vague feelings theyawoke in me. My uncle used to preach long sermons to me, and fearingthat I would become a hypochondriac, talked of placing me undera doctor's care. But I met you, I loved you, and during the lastvacation it seemed that something was lacking there, the forest wasgloomy, sad the river that glides through the shadows, dreary the sea,deserted the sky. Ah, if you should go there once, if your feet shouldpress those paths, if you should stir the waters of the rivulet withyour fingers, if you should gaze upon the sea, sit upon the cliff,or make the air ring with your melodious songs, my forest would betransformed into an Eden, the ripples of the brook would sing, lightwould burst from the dark leaves, into diamonds would be convertedthe dewdrops and into pearls the foam of the sea."But Paulita had heard that to reach Isagani's home it was necessaryto cross mountains where little leeches abounded, and at the merethought of them the little coward shivered convulsively. Humored andpetted, she declared that she would travel only in a carriage or arailway train.Having now forgotten all his pessimism and seeing only thornlessroses about him, Isagani answered, "Within a short time all theislands are going to be crossed with networks of iron rails.    "'Por donde rapidas    Y voladoras    Locomotoras    Corriendo iran,' [52]as some one said. Then the most beautiful spots of the islands willbe accessible to all.""Then, but when? When I'm an old woman?""Ah, you don't know what we can do in a few years," replied theyouth. "You don't realize the energy and enthusiasm that are awakeningin the country after the sleep of centuries. Spain heeds us; our youngmen in Madrid are working day and night, dedicating to the fatherlandall their intelligence, all their time, all their strength. Generousvoices there are mingled with ours, statesmen who realize that thereis no better bond than community of thought and interest. Justice willbe meted out to us, and everything points to a brilliant future forall. It's true that we've just met with a slight rebuff, we students,but victory is rolling along the whole line, it is in the consciousnessof all! The traitorous repulse that we have suffered indicates thelast gasp, the final convulsions of the dying. Tomorrow we shall becitizens of the Philippines, whose destiny will be a glorious one,because it will be in loving hands. Ah, yes, the future is ours! Isee it rose-tinted, I see the movement that stirs the life of theseregions so long dead, lethargic. I see towns arise along the railroads,and factories everywhere, edifices like that of Mandaloyan! I hearthe steam hiss, the trains roar, the engines rattle! I see the smokerise--their heavy breathing; I smell the oil--the sweat of monstersbusy at incessant toil. This port, so slow and laborious of creation,this river where commerce is in its death agony, we shall see coveredwith masts, giving us an idea of the forests of Europe in winter. Thispure air, and these stones, now so clean, will be crowded with coal,with boxes and barrels, the products of human industry, but let itnot matter, for we shall move about rapidly in comfortable coaches toseek in the interior other air, other scenes on other shores, coolertemperatures on the slopes of the mountains. The warships of our navywill guard our coasts, the Spaniard and the Filipino will rival eachother in zeal to repel all foreign invasion, to defend our homes, andlet you bask in peace and smiles, loved and respected. Free from thesystem of exploitation, without hatred or distrust, the people willlabor because then labor will cease to be a despicable thing, it willno longer be servile, imposed upon a slave. Then the Spaniard willnot embitter his character with ridiculous pretensions of despotism,but with a frank look and a stout heart we shall extend our handsto one another, and commerce, industry, agriculture, the sciences,will develop under the mantle of liberty, with wise and just laws,as in prosperous England." [53]Paulita smiled dubiously and shook her head. "Dreams, dreams!" shesighed. "I've heard it said that you have many enemies. Aunt saysthat this country must always be enslaved.""Because your aunt is a fool, because she can't live withoutslaves! When she hasn't them she dreams of them in the future, and ifthey are not obtainable she forces them into her imagination. Trueit is that we have enemies, that there will be a struggle, but weshall conquer. The old system may convert the ruins of its castleinto formless barricades, but we will take them singing hymns ofliberty, in the light of the eyes of you women, to the applauseof your lovely hands. But do not be uneasy--the struggle will be apacific one. Enough that you spur us to zeal, that you awake in usnoble and elevated thoughts and encourage us to constancy, to heroism,with your affection for our reward."Paulita preserved her enigmatic smile and seemed thoughtful, as shegazed toward the river, patting her cheek lightly with her fan. "Butif you accomplish nothing?" she asked abstractedly.The question hurt Isagani. He fixed his eyes on his sweetheart,caught her lightly by the hand, and began: "Listen, if we accomplishnothing--"He paused in doubt, then resumed: "You know how I love you, how Iadore you, you know that I feel myself a different creature whenyour gaze enfolds me, when I surprise in it the flash of love,but yet if we accomplish nothing, I would dream of another look ofyours and would die happy, because the light of pride could burnin your eyes when you pointed to my corpse and said to the world:'My love died fighting for the rights of my fatherland!' ""Come home, child, you're going to catch cold," screeched DonaVictorina at that instant, and the voice brought them back toreality. It was time to return, and they kindly invited him toenter the carriage, an invitation which the young man did not givethem cause to repeat. As it was Paulita's carriage, naturally DonaVictorina and the friend occupied the back seat, while the two loverssat on the smaller one in front.To ride in the same carriage, to have her at his side, to breatheher perfume, to rub against the silk of her dress, to see her pensivewith folded arms, lighted by the moon of the Philippines that lends tothe meanest things idealism and enchantment, were all dreams beyondIsagani's hopes! What wretches they who were returning alone on footand had to give way to the swift carriage! In the whole course of thedrive, along the beach and down the length of La Sabana, across theBridge of Spain, Isagani saw nothing but a sweet profile, gracefullyset off by beautiful hair, ending in an arching neck that lost itselfamid the gauzy pina. A diamond winked at him from the lobe of thelittle ear, like a star among silvery clouds. He heard faint echoesinquiring for Don Tiburcio de Espadana, the name of Juanito Pelaez,but they sounded to him like distant bells, the confused noises heardin a dream. It was necessary to tell him that they had reached PlazaSanta Cruz.CHAPTER XXVSMILES AND TEARSThe sala of the _Pansiteria Macanista de Buen Gusto_ [54] thatnight presented an extraordinary aspect. Fourteen young men of theprincipal islands of the archipelago, from the pure Indian (if therebe pure ones) to the Peninsular Spaniard, were met to hold the banquetadvised by Padre Irene in view of the happy solution of the affairabout instruction in Castilian. They had engaged all the tables forthemselves, ordered the lights to be increased, and had posted on thewall beside the landscapes and Chinese kakemonos this strange versicle:"GLORY TO CUSTODIO FOR HIS CLEVERNESS AND PANSIT ON EABTH TO THEYOUTHS OF GOOD WILL."In a country where everything grotesque is covered with a mantleof seriousness, where many rise by the force of wind and hot air,in a country where the deeply serious and sincere may do damage onissuing from the heart and may cause trouble, probably this was thebest way to celebrate the ingenious inspiration of the illustriousDon Custodio. The mocked replied to the mockery with a laugh, to thegovernmental joke with a plate of _pansit_, and yet--!They laughed and jested, but it could be seen that the merrimentwas forced. The laughter had a certain nervous ring, eyes flashed,and in more than one of these a tear glistened. Nevertheless, theseyoung men were cruel, they were unreasonable! It was not the firsttime that their most beautiful ideas had been so treated, that theirhopes had been defrauded with big words and small actions: beforethis Don Custodio there had been many, very many others.In the center of the room under the red lanterns were placed fourround tables, systematically arranged to form a square. Little woodenstools, equally round, served as seats. In the middle of each table,according to the practise of the establishment, were arranged foursmall colored plates with four pies on each one and four cups of tea,with the accompanying dishes, all of red porcelain. Before each seatwas a bottle and two glittering wine-glasses.Sandoval was curious and gazed about scrutinizing everything, tastingthe food, examining the pictures, reading the bill of fare. Theothers conversed on the topics of the day: about the French actresses,about the mysterious illness of Simoun, who, according to some, hadbeen found wounded in the street, while others averred that he hadattempted to commit suicide. As was natural, all lost themselves inconjectures. Tadeo gave his particular version, which according to himcame from a reliable source: Simoun had been assaulted by some unknownperson in the old Plaza Vivac, [55] the motive being revenge, in proofof which was the fact that Simoun himself refused to make the leastexplanation. From this they proceeded to talk of mysterious revenges,and naturally of monkish pranks, each one relating the exploits ofthe curate of his town.A notice in large black letters crowned the frieze of the room withthis warning:    De esta fonda el cabecilla    Al publico advierte    Que nada dejen absolutamente    Sobre alguna mesa o silla. [56]"What a notice!" exclaimed Sandoval. "As if he might have confidencein the police, eh? And what verses! Don Tiburcio converted into aquatrain--two feet, one longer than the other, between two crutches! IfIsagani sees them, he'll present them to his future aunt.""Here's Isagani!" called a voice from the stairway. The happy youthappeared radiant with joy, followed by two Chinese, without camisas,who carried on enormous waiters tureens that gave out an appetizingodor. Merry exclamations greeted them.Juanito Pelaez was missing, but the hour fixed had already passed, sothey sat down happily to the tables. Juanito was always unconventional."If in his place we had invited Basilio," said Tadeo, "we should havebeen better entertained. We might have got him drunk and drawn somesecrets from him.""What, does the prudent Basilio possess secrets?""I should say so!" replied Tadeo. "Of the most important kind. Thereare some enigmas to which he alone has the key: the boy whodisappeared, the nun--""Gentlemen, the _pansit lang-lang_ is the soup _par excellence_!" criedMakaraig. "As you will observe, Sandoval, it is composed of vermicelli,crabs or shrimps, egg paste, scraps of chicken, and I don't knowwhat else. As first-fruits, let us offer the bones to Don Custodio,to see if he will project something with them."A burst of merry laughter greeted this sally."If he should learn--""He'd come a-running!" concluded Sandoval. "This is excellentsoup--what is it called?""_Pansit lang-lang_, that is, Chinese _pansit_, to distinguish itfrom that which is peculiar to this country.""Bah! That's a hard name to remember. In honor of Don Custodio,I christen it the _soup project_!""Gentlemen," said Makaraig, who had prepared the menu, "there arethree courses yet. Chinese stew made of pork--""Which should be dedicated to Padre Irene.""Get out! Padre Irene doesn't eat pork, unless he turns his nose away,"whispered a young man from Iloilo to his neighbor."Let him turn his nose away!""Down with Padre Irene's nose," cried several at once."Respect, gentlemen, more respect!" demanded Pecson with comic gravity."The third course is a lobster pie--""Which should be dedicated to the friars," suggested he of the Visayas."For the lobsters' sake," added Sandoval."Right, and call it friar pie!"The whole crowd took this up, repeating in concert, "Friar pie!""I protest in the name of one of them," said Isagani."And I, in the name of the lobsters," added Tadeo."Respect, gentlemen, more respect!" again demanded Pecson with afull mouth."The fourth is stewed _pansit_, which is dedicated--to the governmentand the country!"All turned toward Makaraig, who went on: "Until recently, gentlemen,the _pansit_ was believed to be Chinese or Japanese, but thefact is that, being unknown in China or Japan, it would seem to beFilipino, yet those who prepare it and get the benefit from it are theChinese--the same, the very, very same that happens to the governmentand to the Philippines: they seem to be Chinese, but whether theyare or not, the Holy Mother has her doctors--all eat and enjoy it,yet characterize it as disagreeable and loathsome, the same as withthe country, the same as with the government. All live at its cost,all share in its feast, and afterwards there is no worse country thanthe Philippines, there is no government more imperfect. Let us thendedicate the _pansit_ to the country and to the government.""Agreed!" many exclaimed."I protest!" cried Isagani."Respect for the weaker, respect for the victims," called Pecson ina hollow voice, waving a chicken-bone in the air."Let's dedicate the _pansit_ to Quiroga the Chinaman, one of the fourpowers of the Filipino world," proposed Isagani."No, to his Black Eminence.""Silence!" cautioned one mysteriously. "There are people in the plazawatching us, and walls have ears."True it was that curious groups were standing by the windows, whilethe talk and laughter in the adjoining houses had ceased altogether, asif the people there were giving their attention to what was occurringat the banquet. There was something extraordinary about the silence."Tadeo, deliver your speech," Makaraig whispered to him.It had been agreed that Sandoval, who possessed the most oratoricalability, should deliver the last toast as a summing up.Tadeo, lazy as ever, had prepared nothing, so he found himself in aquandary. While disposing of a long string of vermicelli, he meditatedhow to get out of the difficulty, until he recalled a speech learnedin school and decided to plagiarize it, with adulterations."Beloved brethren in project!" he began, gesticulating with twoChinese chop-sticks."Brute! Keep that chop-stick out of my hair!" cried his neighbor."Called by you to fill the void that has been left in--""Plagiarism!" Sandoval interrupted him. "That speech was deliveredby the president of our lyceum.""Called by your election," continued the imperturbable Tadeo, "to fillthe void that has been left in my mind"--pointing to his stomach--"bya man famous for his Christian principles and for his inspirationsand projects, worthy of some little remembrance, what can one likemyself say of him, I who am very hungry, not having breakfasted?""Have a neck, my friend!" called a neighbor, offering that portionof a chicken."There is one course, gentlemen, the treasure of a people who aretoday a tale and a mockery in the world, wherein have thrust theirhands the greatest gluttons of the western regions of the earth--"Here he pointed with his chopsticks to Sandoval, who was strugglingwith a refractory chicken-wing."And eastern!" retorted the latter, describing a circle in the airwith his spoon, in order to include all the banqueters."No interruptions!""I demand the floor!""I demand pickles!" added Isagani."Bring on the stew!"All echoed this request, so Tadeo sat down, contented with havinggot out of his quandary.The dish consecrated to Padre Irene did not appear to be extra good,as Sandoval cruelly demonstrated thus: "Shining with grease outsideand with pork inside! Bring on the third course, the friar pie!"The pie was not yet ready, although the sizzling of the grease in thefrying-pan could be heard. They took advantage of the delay to drink,begging Pecson to talk.Pecson crossed himself gravely and arose, restraining his clownishlaugh with an effort, at the same time mimicking a certain Augustinianpreacher, then famous, and beginning in a murmur, as though he werereading a text."_Si tripa plena laudal Deum, tripa famelica laudabit fratres_--ifthe full stomach praises God, the hungry stomach will praise thefriars. Words spoken by the Lord Custodio through the mouth ofBen-Zayb, in the journal _El Grito de la Integridad_, the secondarticle, absurdity the one hundred and fifty-seventh."Beloved brethren in Christ: Evil blows its foul breath overthe verdant shores of Frailandia, commonly called the PhilippineArchipelago. No day passes but the attack is renewed, but thereis heard some sarcasm against the reverend, venerable, infalliblecorporations, defenseless and unsupported. Allow me, brethren, onthis occasion to constitute myself a knight-errant to sally forth indefense of the unprotected, of the holy corporations that have rearedus, thus again confirming the saving idea of the adage--a full stomachpraises God, which is to say, a hungry stomach will praise the friars.""Bravo, bravo!""Listen," said Isagani seriously, "I want you to understand that,speaking of friars, I respect one."Sandoval was getting merry, so he began to sing a shady couplet aboutthe friars."Hear me, brethren!" continued Pecson. "Turn your gaze toward thehappy days of your infancy, endeavor to analyze the present and askyourselves about the future. What do you find? Friars, friars, andfriars! A friar baptized you, confirmed you, visited you in schoolwith loving zeal; a friar heard your first secret; he was the first tobring you into communion with God, to set your feet upon the pathwayof life; friars were your first and friars will be your last teachers;a friar it is who opens the hearts of your sweethearts, disposingthem to heed your sighs; a friar marries you, makes you travel overdifferent islands to afford you changes of climate and diversion; hewill attend your death-bed, and even though you mount the scaffold,there will the friar be to accompany you with his prayers and tears,and you may rest assured that he will not desert you until he sees youthoroughly dead. Nor does his charity end there--dead, he will thenendeavor to bury you with all pomp, he will fight that your corpsepass through the church to receive his supplications, and he will onlyrest satisfied when he can deliver you into the hands of the Creator,purified here on earth, thanks to temporal punishments, tortures, andhumiliations. Learned in the doctrines of Christ, who closes heavenagainst the rich, they, our redeemers and genuine ministers of theSaviour, seek every means to lift away our sins and bear them far,far off, there where the accursed Chinese and Protestants dwell,to leave us this air, limpid, pure, healthful, in such a way thateven should we so wish afterwards, we could not find a real to bringabout our condemnation."If, then, their existence is necessary to our happiness,if wheresoever we turn we must encounter their delicate hands,hungering for kisses, that every day smooth the marks of abuse fromour countenances, why not adore them and fatten them--why demand theirimpolitic expulsion? Consider for a moment the immense void thattheir absence would leave in our social system. Tireless workers,they improve and propagate the races! Divided as we are, thanksto our jealousies and our susceptibilities, the friars unite us ina common lot, in a firm bond, so firm that many are unable to movetheir elbows. Take away the friar, gentlemen, and you will see how thePhilippine edifice will totter; lacking robust shoulders and hairylimbs to sustain it, Philippine life will again become monotonous,without the merry note of the playful and gracious friar, withoutthe booklets and sermons that split our sides with laughter, withoutthe amusing contrast between grand pretensions and small brains,without the actual, daily representations of the tales of Boccaccioand La Fontaine! Without the girdles and scapularies, what would youhave our women do in the future--save that money and perhaps becomemiserly and covetous? Without the masses, novenaries, and processions,where will you find games of _panguingui_ to entertain them in theirhours of leisure? They would then have to devote themselves to theirhousehold duties and instead of reading diverting stories of miracles,we should then have to get them works that are not extant."Take away the friar and heroism will disappear, the political virtueswill fall under the control of the vulgar. Take him away and the Indianwill cease to exist, for the friar is the Father, the Indian is theWord! The former is the sculptor, the latter the statue, because allthat we are, think, or do, we owe to the friar--to his patience,his toil, his perseverance of three centuries to modify the formNature gave us. The Philippines without the friar and without theIndian--what then would become of the unfortunate government in thehands of the Chinamen?""It will eat lobster pie," suggested Isagani, whom Pecson's speechbored."And that's what we ought to be doing. Enough of speeches!"As the Chinese who should have served the courses did not put in hisappearance, one of the students arose and went to the rear, towardthe balcony that overlooked the river. But he returned at once,making mysterious signs."We're watched! I've seen Padre Sibyla's pet!""Yes?" ejaculated Isagani, rising."It's no use now. When he saw me he disappeared."Approaching the window he looked toward the plaza, then made signs tohis companions to come nearer. They saw a young man leave the door ofthe _pansiteria_, gaze all about him, then with some unknown personenter a carriage that waited at the curb. It was Simoun's carriage."Ah!" exclaimed Makaraig. "The slave of the Vice-Rector attended bythe Master of the General!"CHAPTER XXVIPASQUINADESVery early the next morning Basilio arose to go to the hospital. Hehad his plans made: to visit his patients, to go afterwards to theUniversity to see about his licentiateship, and then have an interviewwith Makaraig about the expense this would entail, for he had used upthe greater part of his savings in ransoming Juli and in securing ahouse where she and her grandfather might live, and he had not daredto apply to Capitan Tiago, fearing that such a move would be construedas an advance on the legacy so often promised him.Preoccupied with these thoughts, he paid no attention to the groupsof students who were at such an early hour returning from the WalledCity, as though the classrooms had been closed, nor did he even notethe abstracted air of some of them, their whispered conversations,or the mysterious signals exchanged among them. So it was that whenhe reached San Juan de Dios and his friends asked him about theconspiracy, he gave a start, remembering what Simoun had planned,but which had miscarried, owing to the unexplained accident to thejeweler. Terrified, he asked in a trembling voice, at the same timeendeavoring to feign ignorance, "Ah, yes, what conspiracy?""It's been discovered," replied one, "and it seems that many areimplicated in it."With an effort Basilio controlled himself. "Many implicated?" heechoed, trying to learn something from the looks of the others. "Who?""Students, a lot of students."Basilio did not think it prudent to ask more, fearing that he wouldgive himself away, so on the pretext of visiting his patients he leftthe group. One of the clinical professors met him and placing his handmysteriously on the youth's shoulder--the professor was a friend ofhis--asked him in a low voice, "Were you at that supper last night?"In his excited frame of mind Basilio thought the professor hadsaid _night before last_, which was the time of his interview withSimoun. He tried to explain. "I assure you," he stammered, "that asCapitan Tiago was worse--and besides I had to finish that book--""You did well not to attend it," said the professor. "But you're amember of the students' association?""I pay my dues.""Well then, a piece of advice: go home at once and destroy any papersyou have that may compromise you."Basilio shrugged his shoulders--he had no papers, nothing more thanhis clinical notes."Has Senor Simoun--""Simoun has nothing to do with the affair, thank God!" interruptedthe physician. "He was opportunely wounded by some unknown hand andis now confined to his bed. No, other hands are concerned in this,but hands no less terrible."Basilio drew a breath of relief. Simoun was the only one who couldcompromise him, although he thought of Cabesang Tales."Are there tulisanes--""No, man, nothing more than students."Basilio recovered his serenity. "What has happened then?" he madebold to ask."Seditious pasquinades have been found; didn't you know about them?""Where?""In the University.""Nothing more than that?""Whew! What more do you want?" asked the professor, almost ina rage. "The pasquinades are attributed to the students of theassociation--but, keep quiet!"The professor of pathology came along, a man who had more the lookof a sacristan than of a physician. Appointed by the powerful mandateof the Vice-Rector, without other merit than unconditional servilityto the corporation, he passed for a spy and an informer in the eyesof the rest of the faculty.The first professor returned his greeting coldly, and winked toBasilio, as he said to him, "Now I know that Capitan Tiago smells likea corpse--the crows and vultures have been gathering around him." Sosaying, he went inside.Somewhat calmed, Basilio now ventured to inquire for more details,but all that he could learn was that pasquinades had been found onthe doors of the University, and that the Vice-Rector had orderedthem to be taken down and sent to the Civil Government. It was saidthat they were filled with threats of assassination, invasion, andother braggadocio.The students made their comments on the affair. Their informationcame from the janitor, who had it from a servant in Santo Tomas,who had it from an usher. They prognosticated future suspensions andimprisonments, even indicating who were to be the victims--naturallythe members of the association.Basilio then recalled Simoun's words: "The day in which they can getrid of you, you will not complete your course.""Could he have known anything?" he asked himself. "We'll see who isthe most powerful."Recovering his serenity, he went on toward the University, to learnwhat attitude it behooved him to take and at the same time to seeabout his licentiateship. He passed along Calle Legazpi, then downthrough Beaterio, and upon arriving at the corner of this streetand Calle Solana saw that something important must indeed havehappened. Instead of the former lively, chattering groups on thesidewalks were to be seen civil-guards making the students move on,and these latter issuing from the University silent, some gloomy,some agitated, to stand off at a distance or make their way home.The first acquaintance he met was Sandoval, but Basilio called to himin vain. He seemed to have been smitten deaf. "Effect of fear on thegastro-intestinal juices," thought Basilio.Later he met Tadeo, who wore a Christmas face--at last that eternalholiday seemed to be realized."What has happened, Tadeo?""We'll have no school, at least for a week, oldman! Sublime! Magnificent!" He rubbed his hands in glee."But what has happened?""They're going to arrest all of us in the association.""And are you glad of that?""There'll be no school, there'll be no school!" He moved away almostbursting with joy.Basilio saw Juanito Pelaez approaching, pale and suspicious. Thistime his hump had reached its maximum, so great was his haste to getaway. He had been one of the most active promoters of the associationwhile things were running smoothly."Eh, Pelaez, what's happened?""Nothing, I know nothing. I didn't have anything to do with it,"he responded nervously. "I was always telling you that these thingswere quixotisms. It's the truth, you know I've said so to you?"Basilio did not remember whether he had said so or not, but to humorhim replied, "Yes, man, but what's happened?""It's the truth, isn't it? Look, you're a witness: I've always beenopposed--you're a witness, don't forget it!""Yes, man, but what's going on?""Listen, you're a witness! I've never had anything to do with themembers of the association, except to give them advice. You're notgoing to deny it now. Be careful, won't you?""No, no, I won't deny it, but for goodness' sake, what has happened?"But Juanito was already far away. He had caught a glimpse of a guardapproaching and feared arrest.Basilio then went on toward the University to see if perhaps thesecretary's office might be open and if he could glean any furthernews. The office was closed, but there was an extraordinary commotionin the building. Hurrying up and down the stairways were friars, armyofficers, private persons, old lawyers and doctors, there doubtlessto offer their services to the endangered cause.At a distance he saw his friend Isagani, pale and agitated, but radiantwith youthful ardor, haranguing some fellow students with his voiceraised as though he cared little that he be heard by everybody."It seems preposterous, gentlemen, it seems unreal, that an incident soinsignificant should scatter us and send us into flight like sparrowsat whom a scarecrow has been shaken! But is this the first time thatstudents have gone to prison for the sake of liberty? Where are thosewho have died, those who have been shot? Would you apostatize now?""But who can the fool be that wrote such pasquinades?" demanded anindignant listener."What does that matter to us?" rejoined Isagani. "We don't haveto find out, let them find out! Before we know how they are drawnup, we have no need to make any show of agreement at a time likethis. There where the danger is, there must we hasten, because honoris there! If what the pasquinades say is compatible with our dignityand our feelings, be he who he may that wrote them, he has done well,and we ought to be grateful to him and hasten to add our signaturesto his! If they are unworthy of us, our conduct and our conscienceswill in themselves protest and defend us from every accusation!"Upon hearing such talk, Basilio, although he liked Isagani verymuch, turned and left. He had to go to Makaraig's house to see aboutthe loan.Near the house of the wealthy student he observed whisperings andmysterious signals among the neighbors, but not comprehending whatthey meant, continued serenely on his way and entered the doorway. Twoguards advanced and asked him what he wanted. Basilio realized thathe had made a bad move, but he could not now retreat."I've come to see my friend Makaraig," he replied calmly.The guards looked at each other. "Wait here," one of them said tohim. "Wait till the corporal comes down."Basilio bit his lips and Simoun's words again recurred to him. Hadthey come to arrest Makaraig?--was his thought, but he dared not giveit utterance. He did not have to wait long, for in a few momentsMakaraig came down, talking pleasantly with the corporal. The twowere preceded by a warrant officer."What, you too, Basilio?" he asked."I came to see you--""Noble conduct!" exclaimed Makaraig laughing. "In time of calm,you avoid us."The corporal asked Basilio his name, then scanned a list. "Medicalstudent, Calle Anloague?" he asked.Basilio bit his lip."You've saved us a trip," added the corporal, placing his hand onthe youth's shoulder. "You're under arrest!""What, I also?"Makaraig burst out into laughter."Don't worry, friend. Let's get into the carriage, while I tell youabout the supper last night."With a graceful gesture, as though he were in his own house, heinvited the warrant officer and the corporal to enter the carriagethat waited at the door."To the Civil Government!" he ordered the cochero.Now that Basilio had again regained his composure, he told Makaraigthe object of his visit. The rich student did not wait for him tofinish, but seized his hand. "Count on me, count on me, and to thefestivities celebrating our graduation we'll invite these gentlemen,"he said, indicating the corporal and the warrant officer.CHAPTER XXVIITHE FRIAR AND THE FILIPINO    Vox populi, vox DeiWe left Isagani haranguing his friends. In the midst of his enthusiasman usher approached him to say that Padre Fernandez, one of the higherprofessors, wished to talk with him.Isagani's face fell. Padre Fernandez was a person greatly respectedby him, being the _one_ always excepted by him whenever the friarswere attacked."What does Padre Fernandez want?" he inquired.The usher shrugged his shoulders and Isagani reluctantly followed him.Padre Fernandez, the friar whom we met in Los Banos, was waitingin his cell, grave and sad, with his brows knitted as if he werein deep thought. He arose as Isagani entered, shook hands with him,and closed the door. Then he began to pace from one end of the roomto the other. Isagani stood waiting for him to speak."Senor Isagani," he began at length with some emotion, "from thewindow I've heard you speaking, for though I am a consumptive I havegood ears, and I want to talk with you. I have always liked the youngmen who express themselves clearly and have their own way of thinkingand acting, no matter that their ideas may differ from mine. Youyoung men, from what I have heard, had a supper last night. Don'texcuse yourself--""I don't intend to excuse myself!" interrupted Isagani."So much the better--it shows that you accept the consequences of youractions. Besides, you would do ill in retracting, and I don't blameyou, I take no notice of what may have been said there last night,I don't accuse you, because after all you're free to say of theDominicans what seems best to you, you are not a pupil of ours--onlythis year have we had the pleasure of having you, and we shallprobably not have you longer. Don't think that I'm going to invokeconsiderations of gratitude; no, I'm not going to waste my time instupid vulgarisms. I've had you summoned here because I believe thatyou are one of the few students who act from conviction, and, as Ilike men of conviction, I'm going to explain myself to Senor Isagani."Padre Fernandez paused, then continued his walk with bowed head,his gaze riveted on the floor."You may sit down, if you wish," he remarked. "It's a habit of mineto walk about while talking, because my ideas come better then."Isagani remained standing, with his head erect, waiting for theprofessor to get to the point of the matter."For more than eight years I have been a professor here," resumedPadre Fernandez, still continuing to pace back and forth, "and inthat time I've known and dealt with more than twenty-five hundredstudents. I've taught them, I've tried to educate them, I've tried toinculcate in them principles of justice and of dignity, and yet inthese days when there is so much murmuring against us I've not seenone who has the temerity to maintain his accusations when he findshimself in the presence of a friar, not even aloud in the presenceof any numbers. Young men there are who behind our backs calumniateus and before us kiss our hands, with a base smile begging kind looksfrom us! Bah! What do you wish that we should do with such creatures?""The fault is not all theirs, Padre," replied Isagani. "The faultlies partly with those who have taught them to be hypocrites,with those who have tyrannized over freedom of thought and freedomof speech. Here every independent thought, every word that is not anecho of the will of those in power, is characterized as filibusterism,and you know well enough what that means. A fool would he be who toplease himself would say aloud what he thinks, who would lay himselfliable to suffer persecution!""What persecution have you had to suffer?" asked Padre Fernandez,raising his head. "Haven't I let you express yourself freely in myclass? Nevertheless, you are an exception that, if what you say istrue, I must correct, so as to make the rule as general as possibleand thus avoid setting a bad example."Isagani smiled. "I thank you, but I will not discuss with you whetherI am an exception. I will accept your qualification so that youmay accept mine: you also are an exception, and as here we are notgoing to talk about exceptions, nor plead for ourselves, at least,I mean, _I'm not_, I beg of my _professor_ to change the course ofthe conversation."In spite of his liberal principles, Padre Fernandez raised his headand stared in surprise at Isagani. That young man was more independentthan he had thought--although he called him _professor_, in realityhe was dealing with him as an equal, since he allowed himself tooffer suggestions. Like a wise diplomat, Padre Fernandez not onlyrecognized the fact but even took his stand upon it."Good enough!" he said. "But don't look upon me as your professor. I'ma friar and you are a Filipino student, nothing more nor less! NowI ask you--what do the Filipino students want of us?"The question came as a surprise; Isagani was not prepared for it. Itwas a thrust made suddenly while they were preparing their defense,as they say in fencing. Thus startled, Isagani responded with aviolent stand, like a beginner defending himself."That you do your duty!" he exclaimed.Fray Fernandez straightened up--that reply sounded to him like acannon-shot. "That we do our duty!" he repeated, holding himselferect. "Don't we, then, do our duty? What duties do you ascribe to us?""Those which you voluntarily placed upon yourselves on joiningthe order, and those which afterwards, once in it, you have beenwilling to assume. But, as a Filipino student, I don't think myselfcalled upon to examine your conduct with reference to your statutes,to Catholicism, to the government, to the Filipino people, and tohumanity in general--those are questions that you have to settlewith your founders, with the Pope, with the government, with thewhole people, and with God. As a Filipino student, I will confinemyself to your duties toward us. The friars in general, being thelocal supervisors of education in the provinces, and the Dominicansin particular, by monopolizing in their hands all the studies of theFilipino youth, have assumed the obligation to its eight millionsof inhabitants, to Spain, and to humanity, of which we form a part,of steadily bettering the young plant, morally and physically,of training it toward its happiness, of creating a people honest,prosperous, intelligent, virtuous, noble, and loyal. Now I ask youin my turn--have the friars fulfilled that obligation of theirs?""We're fulfilling--""Ah, Padre Fernandez," interrupted Isagani, "you with your hand on_your_ heart can say that you are fulfilling it, but with your handon the heart of your order, on the heart of all the orders, you cannotsay that without deceiving yourself. Ah, Padre Fernandez, when I findmyself in the presence of a person whom I esteem and respect, I preferto be the accused rather than the accuser, I prefer to defend myselfrather than take the offensive. But now that we have entered uponthe discussion, let us carry it to the end! How do they fulfill theirobligation, those who look after education in the towns? By hinderingit! And those who here monopolize education, those who try to mold themind of youth, to the exclusion of all others whomsoever, how do theycarry out their mission? By curtailing knowledge as much as possible,by extinguishing all ardor and enthusiasm, by trampling on all dignity,the soul's only refuge, by inculcating in us worn-out ideas, rancidbeliefs, false principles incompatible with a life of progress! Ah,yes, when it is a question of feeding convicts, of providing for themaintenance of criminals, the government calls for bids in orderto find the purveyor who offers the best means of subsistence,he who at least will not let them perish from hunger, but when itis a question of morally feeding a whole people, of nourishing theintellect of youth, the healthiest part, that which is later to be thecountry and the all, the government not only does not ask for any bid,but restricts the power to that very body which makes a boast of notdesiring education, of wishing no advancement. What should we say ifthe purveyor for the prisons, after securing the contract by intrigue,should then leave the prisoners to languish in want, giving them onlywhat is stale and rancid, excusing himself afterwards by saying thatit is not convenient for the prisoners to enjoy good health, becausegood health brings merry thoughts, because merriment improves the man,and the man ought not to be improved, because it is to the purveyor'sinterest that there be many criminals? What should we say if afterwardsthe government and the purveyor should agree between themselves thatof the ten or twelve cuartos which one received for each criminal,the other should receive five?"Padre Fernandek bit his lip. "Those are grave charges," he said,"and you are overstepping the limits of our agreement.""No, Padre, not if I continue to deal with the student question. Thefriars--and I do not say, you friars, since I do not confuse youwith the common herd--the friars of all the orders have constitutedthemselves our mental purveyors, yet they say and shamelessly proclaimthat it is not expedient for us to become enlightened, because someday we shall declare ourselves free! That is just the same as notwishing the prisoner to be well-fed so that he may improve and get outof prison. Liberty is to man what education is to the intelligence,and the friars' unwillingness that we have it is the origin of ourdiscontent.""Instruction is given only to those who deserve it," rejoined PadreFernandez dryly. "To give it to men without character and withoutmorality is to prostitute it.""Why are there men without character and without morality?"The Dominican shrugged his shoulders. "Defects that they imbibe withtheir mothers' milk, that they breathe in the bosom of the family--howdo I know?""Ah, no, Padre Fernandez!" exclaimed the young man impetuously. "Youhave not dared to go into the subject deeply, you have not wishedto gaze into the depths from fear of finding yourself there in thedarkness of your brethren. What we are, you have made us. A peopletyrannized over is forced to be hypocritical; a people denied thetruth must resort to lies; and he who makes himself a tyrant breedsslaves. There is no morality, you say, so let it be--even thoughstatistics can refute you in that here are not committed crimeslike those among other peoples, blinded by the fumes of theirmoralizers. But, without attempting now to analyze what it is thatforms the character and how far the education received determinesmorality, I will agree with you that we are defective. Who is toblame for that? You who for three centuries and a half have had inyour hands our education, or we who submit to everything? If afterthree centuries and a half the artist has been able to produce onlya caricature, stupid indeed he must be!""Or bad enough the material he works upon.""Stupider still then, when, knowing it to be bad, he does not giveit up, but goes on wasting time. Not only is he stupid, but he isa cheat and a robber, because he knows that his work is useless,yet continues to draw his salary. Not only is he stupid and a thief,he is a villain in that he prevents any other workman from tryinghis skill to see if he might not produce something worth while! Thedeadly jealousy of the incompetent!"The reply was sharp and Padre Fernandez felt himself caught. To hisgaze Isagani appeared gigantic, invincible, convincing, and for thefirst time in his life he felt beaten by a Filipino student. Herepented of having provoked the argument, but it was too late toturn back. In this quandary, finding himself confronted with sucha formidable adversary, he sought a strong shield and laid hold ofthe government."You impute all the faults to us, because you see only us, who arenear," he said in a less haughty tone. "It's natural and doesn'tsurprise me. A person hates the soldier or policeman who arrests himand not the judge who sends him to prison. You and we are both dancingto the same measure of music--if at the same note you lift your foot inunison with us, don't blame us for it, it's the music that is directingour movements. Do you think that we friars have no consciences andthat we do not desire what is right? Do you believe that we do notthink about you, that we do not heed our duty, that we only eat tolive, and live to rule? Would that it were so! But we, like you,follow the cadence, finding ourselves between Scylla and Charybdis:either you reject us or the government rejects us. The governmentcommands, and he who commands, commands,--and must be obeyed!""From which it may be inferred," remarked Isagani with a bitter smile,"that the government wishes our demoralization.""Oh, no, I didn't mean that! What I meant to say is that there arebeliefs, there are theories, there are laws, which, dictated withthe best intention, produce the most deplorable consequences. I'llexplain myself better by citing an example. To stamp out a smallevil, there are dictated many laws that cause greater evils still:'_corruptissima in republica plurimae leges,_' said Tacitus. Toprevent one case of fraud, there are provided a million and a halfpreventive or humiliating regulations, which produce the immediateeffect of awakening in the public the desire to elude and mocksuch regulations. To make a people criminal, there's nothing moreneeded than to doubt its virtue. Enact a law, not only here, buteven in Spain, and you will see how the means of evading it will besought, and this is for the very reason that the legislators haveoverlooked the fact that the more an object is hidden, the more asight of it is desired. Why are rascality and astuteness regardedas great qualities in the Spanish people, when there is no other sonoble, so proud, so chivalrous as it? Because our legislators, withthe best intentions, have doubted its nobility, wounded its pride,challenged its chivalry! Do you wish to open in Spain a road among therocks? Then place there an imperative notice forbidding the passage,and the people, in order to protest against the order, will leave thehighway to clamber over the rocks. The day on which some legislator inSpain forbids virtue and commands vice, then all will become virtuous!"The Dominican paused for a brief space, then resumed: "But you maysay that we are getting away from the subject, so I'll return toit. What I can say to you, to convince you, is that the vices fromwhich you suffer ought to be ascribed by you neither to us nor to thegovernment. They are due to the imperfect organization of our socialsystem: _qui multum probat, nihil probat_, one loses himself throughexcessive caution, lacking what is necessary and having too much ofwhat is superfluous.""If you admit those defects in your social system," replied Isagani,"why then do you undertake to regulate alien societies, instead offirst devoting your attention to yourselves?""We're getting away from the subject, young man. The theory inaccomplished facts must be accepted.""So let it be! I accept it because it is an accomplished fact, butI will further ask: why, if your social organization is defective,do you not change it or at least give heed to the cry of those whoare injured by it?""We're still far away. Let's talk about what the students want fromthe friars.""From the moment when the friars hide themselves behind the government,the students have to turn to it."This statement was true and there appeared no means of ignoring it."I'm not the government and I can't answer for its acts. What dothe students wish us to do for them within the limits by which weare confined?""Not to oppose the emancipation of education but to favor it."The Dominican shook his head. "Without stating my own opinion, thatis asking us to commit suicide," he said."On the contrary, it is asking you for room to pass in order not totrample upon and crush you.""Ahem!" coughed Padre Fernandez, stopping and remainingthoughtful. "Begin by asking something that does not cost so much,something that any one of us can grant without abatement of dignityor privilege, for if we can reach an understanding and dwell in peace,why this hatred, why this distrust?""Then let's get down to details.""Yes, because if we disturb the foundation, we'll bring down thewhole edifice.""Then let's get down to details, let's leave the region of abstractprinciples," rejoined Isagani with a smile, "and _also without statingmy own opinion,_"--the youth accented these words--"the studentswould desist from their attitude and soften certain asperities ifthe professors would try to treat them better than they have up tothe present. That is in their hands.""What?" demanded the Dominican. "Have the students any complaint tomake about my conduct?""Padre, we agreed from the start not to talk of yourself or of myself,we're speaking generally. The students, besides getting no greatbenefit out of the years spent in the classes, often leave thereremnants of their dignity, if not the whole of it."Padre Fernandez again bit his lip. "No one forces them to study--thefields are uncultivated," he observed dryly."Yes, there is something that impels them to study," replied Isaganiin the same tone, looking the Dominican full in the face. "Besidesthe duty of every one to seek his own perfection, there is the desireinnate in man to cultivate his intellect, a desire the more powerfulhere in that it is repressed. He who gives his gold and his life to theState has the right to require of it opporttmity better to get thatgold and better to care for his life. Yes, Padre, there is somethingthat impels them, and that something is the government itself. It isyou yourselves who pitilessly ridicule the uncultured Indian and denyhim his rights, on the ground that he is ignorant. You strip him andthen scoff at his nakedness."Padre Fernandez did not reply, but continued to pace about feverishly,as though very much agitated."You say that the fields are not cultivated," resumed Isagani in achanged tone, after a brief pause. "Let's not enter upon an analysisof the reason for this, because we should get far away. But you,Padre Fernandez, you, a teacher, you, a learned man, do you wish apeople of peons and laborers? In your opinion, is the laborer theperfect state at which man may arrive in his development? Or is itthat you wish knowledge for yourself and labor for the rest?""No, I want knowledge for him who deserves it, for him who knows howto use it," was the reply. "When the students demonstrate that theylove it, when young men of conviction appear, young men who know howto maintain their dignity and make it respected, then there will beknowledge, then there will be considerate professors! If there arenow professors who resort to abuse, it is because there are pupilswho submit to it.""When there are professors, there will be students!""Begin by reforming yourselves, you who have need of change, and wewill follow.""Yes," said Isagani with a bitter laugh, "let us begin it, becausethe difficulty is on our side. Well you know what is expected ofa pupil who stands before a professor--you yourself, with all yourlove of justice, with all your kind sentiments, have been restrainingyourself by a great effort while I have been telling you bitter truths,you yourself, Padre Fernandez! What good has been secured by him amongus who has tried to inculcate other ideas? What evils have not fallenupon you because you have tried to be just and perform your duty?""Senor Isagani," said the Dominican, extending his hand, "although itmay seem that nothing practical has resulted from this conversation,yet something has been gained. I'll talk to my brethren about whatyou have told me and I hope that something can be done. Only I fearthat they won't believe in your existence.""I fear the same," returned Isagani, shaking the Dominican's hand. "Ifear that my friends will not believe in your existence, as you haverevealed yourself to me today." [57]Considering the interview at an end, the young man took his leave.Padre Fernandez opened the door and followed him with his gaze untilhe disappeared around a corner in the corridor. For some time helistened to the retreating footsteps, then went back into his celland waited for the youth to appear in the street.He saw him and actually heard him say to a friend who asked where hewas going: "To the Civil Government! I'm going to see the pasquinadesand join the others!"His startled friend stared at him as one would look at a person whois about to commit suicide, then moved away from him hurriedly."Poor boy!" murmured Padre Fernandez, feeling his eyes moisten. "Igrudge you to the Jesuits who educated you."But Padre Fernandez was completely mistaken; the Jesuits repudiatedIsagani [58] when that afternoon they learned that he had beenarrested, saying that he would compromise them. "That young man hasthrown himself away, he's going to do us harm! Let it be understoodthat he didn't get those ideas here."Nor were the Jesuits wrong. No! Those ideas come only from God throughthe medium of Nature.CHAPTER XXVIIITATAKUTWith prophetic inspiration Ben-Zayb had been for some days pastmaintaining in his newspaper that education was disastrous, verydisastrous for the Philippine Islands, and now in view of the events ofthat Friday of pasquinades, the writer crowed and chanted his triumph,leaving belittled and overwhelmed his adversary _Horatius_, who inthe _Pirotecnia_ had dared to ridicule him in the following manner:    From our contemporary, _El Grito_:    "Education is disastrous, very disastrous, for the Philippine    Islands."    Admitted.    For some time _El Grito_ has pretended to represent the    Filipino people--_ergo_, as Fray Ibanez would say, if he    knew Latin.    But Fray Ibanez turns Mussulman when he writes, and we know    how the Mussulmans dealt with education. _In witness whereof_,    as a royal preacher said, the Alexandrian library!Now he was right, he, Ben-Zayb! He was the only one in the islandswho thought, the only one who foresaw events!Truly, the news that seditious pasquinades had been found on thedoors of the University not only took away the appetite from manyand disturbed the digestion of others, but it even rendered thephlegmatic Chinese uneasy, so that they no longer dared to sit intheir shops with one leg drawn up as usual, from fear of losing timein extending it in order to put themselves into flight. At eighto'clock in the morning, although the sun continued on its course andhis Excellency, the Captain-General, did not appear at the head ofhis victorious cohorts, still the excitement had increased. The friarswho were accustomed to frequent Quiroga's bazaar did not put in theirappearance, and this symptom presaged terrific cataclysms. If thesun had risen a square and the saints appeared only in pantaloons,Quiroga would not have been so greatly alarmed, for he would havetaken the sun for a gaming-table and the sacred images for gamblerswho had lost their camisas, but for the friars not to come, preciselywhen some novelties had just arrived for them!By means of a provincial friend of his, Quiroga forbade entrance intohis gaming-houses to every Indian who was not an old acquaintance,as the future Chinese consul feared that they might get possession ofthe sums that the wretches lost there. After arranging his bazaar insuch a way that he could close it quickly in case of need, he had apoliceman accompany him for the short distance that separated his housefrom Simoun's. Quiroga thought this occasion the most propitious formaking use of the rifles and cartridges that he had in his warehouse,in the way the jeweler had pointed out; so that on the followingdays there would be searches made, and then--how many prisoners, howmany terrified people would give up their savings! It was the game ofthe old carbineers, in slipping contraband cigars and tobacco-leavesunder a house, in order to pretend a search and force the unfortunateowner to bribery or fines, only now the art had been perfected and,the tobacco monopoly abolished, resort was had to the prohibited arms.But Simoun refused to see any one and sent word to the Chinese thathe should leave things as they were, whereupon he went to see DonCustodio to inquire whether he should fortify his bazaar, but neitherwould Don Custodio receive him, being at the time engaged in the studyof a project for defense in case of a siege. He thought of Ben-Zaybas a source of information, but finding the writer armed to the teethand using two loaded revolvers for paper-weights, took his leave inthe shortest possible time, to shut himself up in his house and taketo his bed under pretense of illness.At four in the afternoon the talk was no longer of simplepasquinades. There were whispered rumors of an understanding betweenthe students and the outlaws of San Mateo, it was certain that in the_pansiteria_ they had conspired to surprise the city, there was talkof German ships outside the bay to support the movement, of a bandof young men who under the pretext of protesting and demonstratingtheir Hispanism had gone to the Palace to place themselves at theGeneral's orders but had been arrested because it was discovered thatthey were armed. Providence had saved his Excellency, preventing himfrom receiving those precocious criminals, as he was at the time inconference with the Provincials, the Vice-Rector, and with Padre Irene,Padre Salvi's representative. There was considerable truth in theserumors, if we have to believe Padre Irene, who in the afternoon wentto visit Capitan Tiago. According to him, certain persons had advisedhis Excellency to improve the opportunity in order to inspire terrorand administer a lasting lesson to the filibusters."A number shot," one had advised, "some two dozen reformers deportedat once, in the silence of the night, would extinguish forever theflames of discontent.""No," rejoined another, who had a kind heart, "sufficient that thesoldiers parade through the streets, a troop of cavalry, for example,with drawn sabers--sufficient to drag along some cannon, that'senough! The people are timid and will all retire into their houses.""No, no," insinuated another. "This is the opportunity to get rid ofthe enemy. It's not sufficient that they retire into their houses, theyshould be made to come out, like evil humors by means of plasters. Ifthey are inclined to start riots, they should be stirred up by secretagitators. I am of the opinion that the troops should be resting ontheir arms and appearing careless and indifferent, so the people may beemboldened, and then in case of any disturbance--out on them, action!""The end justifies the means," remarked another. "Our end is ourholy religion and the integrity of the fatherland. Proclaim a stateof siege, and in case of the least disturbance, arrest all the richand educated, and--clean up the country!""If I hadn't got there in time to counsel moderation," added PadreIrene, speaking to Capitan Tiago, "it's certain that blood wouldnow be flowing through the streets. I thought of you, Capitan--Thepartizans of force couldn't do much with the General, and they missedSimoun. Ah, if Simoun had not been taken ill--"With the arrest of Basilio and the search made later among his booksand papers, Capitan Tiago had become much worse. Now Padre Irene hadcome to augment his terror with hair-raising tales. Ineffable fearseized upon the wretch, manifesting itself first by a light shiver,which was rapidly accentuated, until he was unable to speak. With hiseyes bulging and his brow covered with sweat, he caught Padre Irene'sarm and tried to rise, but could not, and then, uttering two groans,fell heavily back upon the pillow. His eyes were wide open and hewas slavering--but he was dead. The terrified Padre Irene fled, and,as the dying man had caught hold of him, in his flight he dragged thecorpse from the bed, leaving it sprawling in the middle of the room.By night the terror had reached a climax. Several incidents hadoccurred to make the timorous believe in the presence of secretagitators.During a baptism some cuartos were thrown to the boys and naturallythere was a scramble at the door of the church. It happened that atthe time there was passing a bold soldier, who, somewhat preoccupied,mistook the uproar for a gathering of filibusters and hurled himself,sword in hand, upon the boys. He went into the church, and had he notbecome entangled in the curtains suspended from the choir he wouldnot have left a single head on shoulders. It was but the matter of amoment for the timorous to witness this and take to flight, spreadingthe news that the revolution had begun. The few shops that had beenkept open were now hastily closed, there being Chinese who even leftbolts of cloth outside, and not a few women lost their slippers intheir flight through the streets. Fortunately, there was only oneperson wounded and a few bruised, among them the soldier himself,who suffered a fall fighting with the curtain, which smelt to him offilibusterism. Such prowess gained him great renown, and a renownso pure that it is to be wished all fame could be acquired in likemanner--mothers would then weep less and earth would be more populous!In a suburb the inhabitants caught two unknown individuals buryingarms under a house, whereupon a tumult arose and the people pursuedthe strangers in order to kill them and turn their bodies over to theauthorities, but some one pacified the excited crowd by telling themthat it would be sufficient to hand over the _corpora delictorum_,which proved to be some old shotguns that would surely have killedthe first person who tried to fire them."All right," exclaimed one braggart, "if they want us to rebel,let's go ahead!" But he was cuffed and kicked into silence, the womenpinching him as though he had been the owner of the shotguns.In Ermita the affair was more serious, even though there was lessexcitement, and that when there were shots fired. A certain cautiousgovernment employee, armed to the teeth, saw at nightfall an objectnear his house, and taking it for nothing less than a student, firedat it twice with a revolver. The object proved to be a policeman,and they buried him--_pax Christi! Mutis!_In Dulumbayan various shots also resounded, from which there resultedthe death of a poor old deaf man, who had not heard the sentinel's_quien vive_, and of a hog that had heard it and had not answered_Espana_! The old man was buried with difficulty, since there was nomoney to pay for the obsequies, but the hog was eaten.In Manila, [59] in a confectionery near the University much frequentedby the students, the arrests were thus commented upon."And have they arrested Tadeo?" [60] asked the proprietess."_Aba_!" answered a student who lived in Parian, "he's already shot!""Shot! _Naku_! He hasn't paid what he owes me.""Ay, don't mention that or you'll be taken for an accomplice. I'vealready burnt the book [61] you lent me. There might be a search andit would be found. Be careful!""Did you say that Isagani is a prisoner?""Crazy fool, too, that Isagani," replied the indignant student. "Theydidn't try to catch him, but he went and surrendered. Let him busthimself--he'll surely be shot."The senora shrugged her shoulders. "He doesn't owe me anything. Andwhat about Paulita?""She won't lack a husband. Sure, she'll cry a little, and then marrya Spaniard."The night was one of the gloomiest. In the houses the rosary wasrecited and pious women dedicated paternosters and requiems to eachof the souls of their relatives and friends. By eight o'clock hardlya pedestrian could be seen--only from time to time was heard thegalloping of a horse against whose sides a saber clanked noisily,then the whistles of the watchmen, and carriages that whirled alongat full speed, as though pursued by mobs of filibusters.Yet terror did not reign everywhere. In the house of the silversmith,where Placido Penitente boarded, the events were commented upon anddiscussed with some freedom."I don't believe in the pasquinades," declared a workman, lank andwithered from operating the blowpipe. "To me it looks like PadreSalvi's doings.""Ahem, ahem!" coughed the silversmith, a very prudent man, who did notdare to stop the conversation from fear that he would be considereda coward. The good man had to content himself with coughing, winkingto his helper, and gazing toward the street, as if to say, "They maybe watching us!""On account of the operetta," added another workman."Aha!" exclaimed one who had a foolish face, "I told you so!""Ahem!" rejoined a clerk, in a tone of compassion, "the affair ofthe pasquinades is true, Chichoy, and I can give you the explanation."Then he added mysteriously, "It's a trick of the Chinaman Quiroga's!""Ahem, ahem!" again coughed the silversmith, shifting his quid ofbuyo from one cheek to the other."Believe me, Chichoy, of Quiroga the Chinaman! I heard it in theoffice.""_Naku_, it's certain then," exclaimed the simpleton, believing itat once."Quiroga," explained the clerk, "has a hundred thousand pesos inMexican silver out in the bay. How is he to get it in? Very easily. Fixup the pasquinades, availing himself of the question of the students,and, while every-body is excited, grease the officials' palms, andin the cases come!""Just it! Just it!" cried the credulous fool, striking the tablewith his fist. "Just it! That's why Quiroga did it! That's why--"But he had to relapse into silence as he really did not know what tosay about Quiroga."And we must pay the damages?" asked the indignant Chichoy."Ahem, ahem, a-h-hem!" coughed the silversmith, hearing steps inthe street.The footsteps approached and all in the shop fell silent."St. Pascual Bailon is a great saint," declared the silversmithhypocritically, in a loud voice, at the same time winking to theothers. "St. Pascual Bailon--"At that moment there appeared the face of Placido Penitente, who wasaccompanied by the pyrotechnician that we saw receiving orders fromSimoun. The newcomers were surrounded and importuned for news."I haven't been able to talk with the prisoners," explainedPlacido. "There are some thirty of them.""Be on your guard," cautioned the pyrotechnician, exchanging aknowing look with Placido. "They say that to-night there's going tobe a massacre.""Aha! Thunder!" exclaimed Chichoy, looking about for a weapon. Seeingnone, he caught up his blowpipe.The silversmith sat down, trembling in every limb. The creduloussimpleton already saw himself beheaded and wept in anticipation overthe fate of his family."No," contradicted the clerk, "there's not going to be anymassacre. The adviser of"--he made a mysterious gesture--"isfortunately sick.""Simoun!""Ahem, ahem, a-h-hem!"Placido and the pyrotechnician exchanged another look."If he hadn't got sick--""It would look like a revolution," added the pyrotechniciannegligently, as he lighted a cigarette in the lamp chimney. "And whatshould we do then?""Then we'd start a real one, now that they're going to massacreus anyhow--"The violent fit of coughing that seized the silversmith preventedthe rest of this speech from being heard, but Chichoy must have beensaying terrible things, to judge from his murderous gestures withthe blowpipe and the face of a Japanese tragedian that he put on."Rather say that he's playing off sick because he's afraid to goout. As may be seen--"The silversmith was attacked by another fit of coughing so severethat he finally asked all to retire."Nevertheless, get ready," warned the pyrotechnician. "If they wantto force us to kill or be killed--"Another fit of coughing on the part of the poor silversmith preventedfurther conversation, so the workmen and apprentices retired to theirhomes, carrying with them hammers and saws, and other implements,more or less cutting, more or less bruising, disposed to sell theirlives dearly. Placido and the pyrotechnician went out again."Prudence, prudence!" cautioned the silversmith in a tearful voice."You'll take care of my widow and orphans!" begged the creduloussimpleton in a still more tearful voice, for he already saw himselfriddled with bullets and buried.That night the guards at the city gates were replaced with Peninsularartillerymen, and on the following morning as the sun rose, Ben-Zayb,who had ventured to take a morning stroll to examine the condition ofthe fortifications, found on the glacis near the Luneta the corpseof a native girl, half-naked and abandoned. Ben-Zayb was horrified,but after touching it with his cane and gazing toward the gatesproceeded on his way, musing over a sentimental tale he might baseupon the incident.However, no allusion to it appeared in the newspapers on the followingdays, engrossed as they were with the falls and slippings caused bybanana-peels. In the dearth of news Ben-Zayb had to comment at lengthon a cyclone that had destroyed in America whole towns, causing thedeath of more than two thousand persons. Among other beautiful thingshe said:    "_The sentiment of charity_, MORE PREVALENT IN CATHOLIC    COUNTRIES THAN IN OTHERS, and the thought of Him who,    influenced by that same feeling, sacrificed himself for    _humanity, moves (sic)_ us to compassion over the misfortunes    of our kind and to render thanks that _in this country_,    so scourged by cyclones, there are not enacted scenes so    desolating as that which the inhabitants of the United States    mus have witnessed!"_Horatius_ did not miss the opportunity, and, also without mentioningthe dead, or the murdered native girl, or the assaults, answered himin his _Pirotecnia_:    "After such great charity and such great humanity, Fray    Ibanez--I mean, Ben-Zayb--brings himself to pray for the    Philippines.    But he is understood.    Because he is not Catholic, and the sentiment of charity is    most prevalent," etc. [62]CHAPTER XXIXEXIT CAPITAN TIAGO    Talis vita, finis itaCapitan Tiago had a good end--that is, a quite exceptionalfuneral. True it is that the curate of the parish had venturedthe observation to Padre Irene that Capitan Tiago had died withoutconfession, but the good priest, smiling sardonically, had rubbedthe tip of his nose and answered:"Why say that to me? If we had to deny the obsequies to all whodie without confession, we should forget the _De profundis_! Theserestrictions, as you well know, are enforced when the impenitent isalso insolvent. But Capitan Tiago--out on you! You've buried infidelChinamen, and with a requiem mass!"Capitan Tiago had named Padre Irene as his executor and willed hisproperty in part to St. Clara, part to the Pope, to the Archbishop, thereligious corporations, leaving twenty pesos for the matriculation ofpoor students. This last clause had been dictated at the suggestion ofPadre Irene, in his capacity as protector of studious youths. CapitanTiago had annulled a legacy of twenty-five pesos that he had leftto Basilio, in view of the ungrateful conduct of the boy during thelast few days, but Padre Irene had restored it and announced that hewould take it upon his own purse and conscience.In the dead man's house, where were assembled on the following day manyold friends and acquaintances, considerable comment was indulged inover a miracle. It was reported that, at the very moment when he wasdying, the soul of Capitan Tiago had appeared to the nuns surroundedby a brilliant light. God had saved him, thanks to the pious legacies,and to the numerous masses he had paid for. The story was commentedupon, it was recounted vividly, it took on particulars, and wasdoubted by no one. The appearance of Capitan Tiago was minutelydescribed--of course the frock coat, the cheek bulged out by thequid of buyo, without omitting the game-cock and the opium-pipe. Thesenior sacristan, who was present, gravely affirmed these facts withhis head and reflected that, after death, he would appear with hiscup of white _taju_, for without that refreshing breakfast he couldnot comprehend happiness either on earth or in heaven.On this subject, because of their inability to discuss the eventsof the preceding day and because there were gamblers present, manystrange speculations were developed. They made conjectures as towhether Capitan Tiago would invite St. Peter to a _soltada_, whetherthey would place bets, whether the game-cocks were immortal, whetherinvulnerable, and in this case who would be the referee, who would win,and so on: discussions quite to the taste of those who found sciences,theories, and systems, based on a text which they esteem infallible,revealed or dogmatic. Moreover, there were cited passages from novenas,books of miracles, sayings of the curates, descriptions of heaven,and other embroidery. Don Primitivo, the philosopher, was in hisglory quoting opinions of the theologians."Because no one can lose," he stated with great authority. "Tolose would cause hard feelings and in heaven there can't be anyhard feelings.""But some one has to win," rejoined the gambler Aristorenas. "Thefun lies in winning!""Well, both win, that's easy!"This idea of both winning could not be admitted by Aristorenas,for he had passed his life in the cockpit and had always seen onecock lose and the other win--at best, there was a tie. Vainly DonPrimitivo argued in Latin. Aristorenas shook his head, and that toowhen Don Primitivo's Latin was easy to understand, for he talked of _angallus talisainus, acuto tari armatus, an gallus beati Petri bulikussasabungus sit_, [63] and so on, until at length he decided to resortto the argument which many use to convince and silence their opponents."You're going to be damned, friend Martin, you're falling intoheresy! _Cave ne cadas!_ I'm not going to play monte with you any more,and we'll not set up a bank together. You deny the omnipotence ofGod, _peccatum mortale!_ You deny the existence of the Holy Trinity--three are one and one is three! Take care! You indirectly deny thattwo natures, two understandings, and two wills can have only onememory! Be careful! _Quicumque non crederit anathema sit!_"Martin Aristorenas shrank away pale and trembling, while Quiroga,who had listened with great attention to the argument, with markeddeference offered the philosopher a magnificent cigar, at the same timeasking in his caressing voice: "Surely, one can make a contract for acockpit with Kilisto, [64] ha? When I die, I'll be the contractor, ha?"Among the others, they talked more of the deceased; at least theydiscussed what kind of clothing to put on him. Capitan Tinong proposeda Franciscan habit--and fortunately, he had one, old, threadbare, andpatched, a precious object which, according to the friar who gave it tohim as alms in exchange for thirty-six pesos, would preserve the corpsefrom the flames of hell and which reckoned in its support various piousanecdotes taken from the books distributed by the curates. Although heheld this relic in great esteem, Capitan Tinong was disposed to partwith it for the sake of his intimate friend, whom he had not been ableto visit during his illness. But a tailor objected, with good reason,that since the nuns had seen Capitan Tiago ascending to heaven in afrock coat, in a frock coat he should be dressed here on earth, norwas there any necessity for preservatives and fire-proof garments. Thedeceased had attended balls and fiestas in a frock coat, and nothingelse would be expected of him in the skies--and, wonderful to relate,the tailor accidentally happened to have one ready, which he would partwith for thirty-two pesos, four cheaper than the Franciscan habit,because he didn't want to make any profit on Capitan Tiago, who hadbeen his customer in life and would now be his patron in heaven. ButPadre Irene, trustee and executor, rejected both proposals and orderedthat the Capitan be dressed in one of his old suits of clothes,remarking with holy unction that God paid no attention to clothing.The obsequies were, therefore, of the very first class. There wereresponsories in the house, and in the street three friars officiated,as though one were not sufficient for such a great soul. All therites and ceremonies possible were performed, and it is reportedthat there were even _extras_, as in the benefits for actors. It wasindeed a delight: loads of incense were burned, there were plentyof Latin chants, large quantities of holy water were expended, andPadre Irene, out of regard for his old friend, sang the _Dies Irae_in a falsetto voice from the choir, while the neighbors suffered realheadaches from so much knell-ringing.Dona Patrocinio, the ancient rival of Capitan Tiago in religiosity,actually wanted to die on the next day, so that she might order evenmore sumptuous obsequies. The pious old lady could not bear the thoughtthat he, whom she had long considered vanquished forever, should indying come forward again with so much pomp. Yes, she desired to die,and it seemed that she could hear the exclamations of the people atthe funeral: "This indeed is what you call a funeral! This indeed isto know how to die, Dona Patrocinio!"CHAPTER XXXJULIThe death of Capitan Tiago and Basilio's imprisonment were soonreported in the province, and to the honor of the simple inhabitantsof San Diego, let it be recorded that the latter was the incident moreregretted and almost the only one discussed. As was to be expected,the report took on different forms, sad and startling details weregiven, what could not be understood was explained, the gaps beingfilled by conjectures, which soon passed for accomplished facts,and the phantoms thus created terrified their own creators.In the town of Tiani it was reported that at least, at the veryleast, the young man was going to be deported and would veryprobably be murdered on the journey. The timorous and pessimisticwere not satisfied with this but even talked about executions andcourts-martial--January was a fatal month; in January the Cavite affairhad occurred, and _they_ [65] even though curates, had been garroted,so a poor Basilio without protectors or friends--"I told him so!" sighed the Justice of the Peace, as if he had atsome time given advice to Basilio. "I told him so.""It was to be expected," commented Sister Penchang. "He would gointo the church and when he saw that the holy water was somewhatdirty he wouldn't cross himself with it. He talked about germs anddisease, _aba_, it's the chastisement of God! He deserved it, and hegot it! As though the holy water could transmit diseases! Quite thecontrary, _aba!_"She then related how she had cured herself of indigestion by moisteningher stomach with holy water, at the same time reciting the _SanctusDeus_, and she recommended the remedy to those present when they shouldsuffer from dysentery, or an epidemic occurred, only that then theymust pray in Spanish:    Santo Dios,    Santo fuerte,    Santo inmortal,    iLibranos, Senor, de la peste    Y de todo mal! [66]"It's an infallible remedy, but you must apply the holy water to thepart affected," she concluded.But there were many persons who did not believe in these things,nor did they attribute Basilio's imprisonment to the chastisement ofGod. Nor did they take any stock in insurrections and pasquinades,knowing the prudent and ultra-pacific character of the boy, butpreferred to ascribe it to revenge on the part of the friars, becauseof his having rescued from servitude Juli, the daughter of a tulisanwho was the mortal enemy of a certain powerful corporation. As theyhad quite a poor idea of the morality of that same corporation andcould recall cases of petty revenge, their conjecture was believedto have more probability and justification."What a good thing I did when I drove her from my house!" said SisterPenchang. "I don't want to have any trouble with the friars, so Iurged her to find the money."The truth was, however, that she regretted Juli's liberty, for Juliprayed and fasted for her, and if she had stayed a longer time, wouldalso have done penance. Why, if the curates pray for us and Christdied for our sins, couldn't Juli do the same for Sister Penchang?When the news reached the hut where the poor Juli and her grandfatherlived, the girl had to have it repeated to her. She stared at SisterBali, who was telling it, as though without comprehension, withoutability to collect her thoughts. Her ears buzzed, she felt a sinkingat the heart and had a vague presentiment that this event would havea disastrous influence on her own future. Yet she tried to seize upona ray of hope, she smiled, thinking that Sister Bali was joking withher, a rather strong joke, to be sure, but she forgave her beforehandif she would acknowledge that it was such. But Sister Bali made across with one of her thumbs and a forefinger, and kissed it, to provethat she was telling the truth. Then the smile faded forever from thegirl's lips, she turned pale, frightfully pale, she felt her strengthleave her and for the first time in her life she lost consciousness,falling into a swoon.When by dint of blows, pinches, dashes of water, crosses, and theapplication of sacred palms, the girl recovered and remembered thesituation, silent tears sprang from her eyes, drop by drop, withoutsobs, without laments, without complaints! She thought about Basilio,who had had no other protector than Capitan Tiago, and who now, withthe Capitan dead, was left completely unprotected and in prison. Inthe Philippines it is a well-known fact that patrons are needed foreverything, from the time one is christened until one dies, in orderto get justice, to secure a passport, or to develop an industry. Asit was said that his imprisonment was due to revenge on account ofherself and her father, the girl's sorrow turned to desperation. Nowit was her duty to liberate him, as he had done in rescuing her fromservitude, and the inner voice which suggested the idea offered toher imagination a horrible means."Padre Camorra, the curate," whispered the voice. Juli gnawed at herlips and became lost in gloomy meditation.As a result of her father's crime, her grandfather had been arrested inthe hope that by such means the son could be made to appear. The onlyone who could get him his liberty was Padre Camorra, and Padre Camorrahad shown himself to be poorly satisfied with her words of gratitude,having with his usual frankness asked for some sacrifices--since whichtime Juli had tried to avoid meeting him. But the curate made her kisshis hand, he twitched her nose and patted her cheeks, he joked withher, winking and laughing, and laughing he pinched her. Juli was alsothe cause of the beating the good curate had administered to some youngmen who were going about the village serenading the girls. Maliciousones, seeing her pass sad and dejected, would remark so that shemight hear: "If she only wished it, Cabesang Tales would be pardoned."Juli reached her home, gloomy and with wandering looks. She hadchanged greatly, having lost her merriment, and no one ever saw hersmile again. She scarcely spoke and seemed to be afraid to look ather own face. One day she was seen in the town with a big spot ofsoot on her forehead, she who used to go so trim and neat. Once sheasked Sister Bali if the people who committed suicide went to hell."Surely!" replied that woman, and proceeded to describe the place asthough she had been there.Upon Basilio's imprisonment, the simple and grateful relatives hadplanned to make all kinds of sacrifices to save the young man, butas they could collect among themselves no more than thirty pesos,Sister Bali, as usual, thought of a better plan."What we must do is to get some advice from the town clerk," shesaid. To these poor people, the town clerk was what the Delphic oraclewas to the ancient Greeks."By giving him a real and a cigar," she continued, "he'll tell youall the laws so that your head bursts listening to him. If you havea peso, he'll save you, even though you may be at the foot of thescaffold. When my friend Simon was put in jail and flogged for notbeing able to give evidence about a robbery perpetrated near hishouse, _aba_, for two reales and a half and a string of garlics,the town clerk got him out. And I saw Simon myself when he couldscarcely walk and he had to stay in bed at least a month. Ay, hisflesh rotted as a result and he died!"Sister Bali's advice was accepted and she herself volunteered tointerview the town clerk. Juli gave her four reales and added somestrips of jerked venison her grand-father had got, for Tandang Selohad again devoted himself to hunting.But the town clerk could do nothing--the prisoner was in Manila,and his power did not extend that far. "If at least he were at thecapital, then--" he ventured, to make a show of his authority, whichhe knew very well did not extend beyond the boundaries of Tiani, buthe had to maintain his prestige and keep the jerked venison. "But Ican give you a good piece of advice, and it is that you go with Julito see the Justice of the Peace. But it's very necessary that Juli go."The Justice of the Peace was a very rough fellow, but if he shouldsee Juli he might conduct himself less rudely--this is wherein laythe wisdom of the advice.With great gravity the honorable Justice listened to Sister Bali,who did the talking, but not without staring from time to time atthe girl, who hung her head with shame. People would say that shewas greatly interested in Basilio, people who did not remember herdebt of gratitude, nor that his imprisonment, according to report,was on her account.After belching three or four times, for his Honor had that ugly habit,he said that the only person who could save Basilio was Padre Camorra,_in case he should care to do so_. Here he stared meaningly at thegirl and advised her to deal with the curate in person."You know what influence he has,--he got your grand-father out ofjail. A report from him is enough to deport a new-born babe or savefrom death a man with the noose about his neck."Juli said nothing, but Sister Bali took this advice as though shehad read it in a novena, and was ready to accompany the girl to theconvento. It so happened that she was just going there to get as almsa scapulary in exchange for four full reales.But Juli shook her head and was unwilling to go to the convento. SisterBali thought she could guess the reason--Padre Camorra was reputedto be very fond of the women and was very frolicsome--so she triedto reassure her. "You've nothing to fear if I go with you. Haven'tyou read in the booklet _Tandang Basio_, given you by the curate,that the girls should go to the convento, even without the knowledgeof their elders, to relate what is going on at home? _Aba_, that bookis printed with the permission of the Archbishop!"Juli became impatient and wished to cut short such talk, so she beggedthe pious woman to go if she wished, but his Honor observed with abelch that the supplications of a youthful face were more moving thanthose of an old one, the sky poured its dew over the fresh flowersin greater abundance than over the withered ones. The metaphor wasfiendishly beautiful.Juli did not reply and the two left the house. In the street thegirl firmly refused to go to the convento and they returned to theirvillage. Sister Bali, who felt offended at this lack of confidencein herself, on the way home relieved her feelings by administeringa long preachment to the girl.The truth was that the girl could not take that step without damningherself in her own eyes, besides being cursed of men and cursedof God! It had been intimated to her several times, whether withreason or not, that if she would make that sacrifice her father wouldbe pardoned, and yet she had refused, in spite of the cries of herconscience reminding her of her filial duty. Now must she make it forBasilio, her sweetheart? That would be to fall to the sound of mockeryand laughter from all creation. Basilio himself would despise her! No,never! She would first hang herself or leap from some precipice. Atany rate, she was already damned for being a wicked daughter.The poor girl had besides to endure all the reproaches of herrelatives, who, knowing nothing of what had passed between her andPadre Camovra, laughed at her fears. Would Padre Camorra fix hisattention upon a country girl when there were so many others in thetown? Hero the good women cited names of unmarried girls, rich andbeautiful, who had been more or less unfortunate. Meanwhile, if theyshould shoot Basilio?Juli covered her ears and stared wildly about, as if seeking a voicethat might plead for her, but she saw only her grandfather, who wasdumb and had his gaze fixed on his hunting-spear.That night she scarcely slept at all. Dreams and nightmares, somefunereal, some bloody, danced before her sight and woke her often,bathed in cold perspiration. She fancied that she heard shots, sheimagined that she saw her father, that father who had done so muchfor her, fighting in the forests, hunted like a wild beast becauseshe had refused to save him. The figure of her father was transformedand she recognized Basilio, dying, with looks of reproach at her. Thewretched girl arose, prayed, wept, called upon her mother, upon death,and there was even a moment when, overcome with terror, if it hadnot been night-time, she would have run straight to the convento,let happen what would.With the coming of day the sad presentiments and the terrors ofdarkness were partly dissipated. The light inspired hopes in her. Butthe news of the afternoon was terrible, for there was talk of personsshot, so the next night was for the girl frightful. In her desperationshe decided to give herself up as soon as day dawned and then killherself afterwards--anything, rather than enditre such tortures! Butthe dawn brought new hope and she would not go to church or evenleave the house. She was afraid she would yield.So passed several days in praying and cursing, in calling upon Godand wishing for death. The day gave her a slight respite and shetrusted in some miracle. The reports that came from Manila, althoughthey reached there magnified, said that of the prisoners some hadsecured their liberty, thanks to patrons and influence. Some onehad to be sacrificed--who would it be? Juli shuddered and returnedhome biting her finger-nails. Then came the night with its terrors,which took on double proportions and seemed to be converted intorealities. Juli feared to fall asleep, for her slumbers were acontinuous nightmare. Looks of reproach would flash across her eyelidsjust as soon as they were closed, complaints and laments piercedher ears. She saw her father wandering about hungry, without rest orrepose; she saw Basilio dying in the road, pierced by two bullets,just as she had seen the corpse of that neighbor who had been killedwhile in the charge of the Civil Guard. She saw the bonds that cutinto the flesh, she saw the blood pouring from the mouth, she heardBasilio calling to her, "Save me! Save me! You alone can save me!" Thena burst of laughter would resound and she would turn her eyes to seeher father gazing at her with eyes full of reproach. Juli would wakeup, sit up on her _petate_, and draw her hands across her foreheadto arrange her hair--cold sweat, like the sweat of death, moistened it!"Mother, mother!" she sobbed.Meanwhile, they who were so carelessly disposing of people's fates,he who commanded the legal murders, he who violated justice and madeuse of the law to maintain himself by force, slept in peace.At last a traveler arrived from Manila and reported that allthe prisoners had been set free, all except Basilio, who had noprotector. It was reported in Manila, added the traveler, that theyoung man would be deported to the Carolines, having been forced tosign a petition beforehand, in which he declared that he asked itvoluntarily. [67] The traveler had seen the very steamer that wasgoing to take him away.This report put an end to all the girl's hesitation. Besides, her mindwas already quite weak from so many nights of watching and horribledreams. Pale and with unsteady eyes, she sought out Sister Bali and,in a voice that was cause for alarm, told her that she was ready,asking her to accompany her. Sister Bali thereupon rejoiced and triedto soothe her, but Juli paid no attention to her, apparently intentonly upon hurrying to the convento. She had decked herself out in herfinest clothes, and even pretended to be quite gay, talking a greatdeal, although in a rather incoherent way.So they set out. Juli went ahead, becoming impatient that her companionlagged behind. But as they neared the town, her nervous energy begangradually to abate, she fell silent and wavered in her resolution,lessened her pace and soon dropped behind, so that Sister Bali hadto encourage her."We'll get there late," she remonstrated.Juli now followed, pale, with downcast eyes, which she was afraid toraise. She felt that the whole world was staring at her and pointingits finger at her. A vile name whistled in her ears, but still shedisregarded it and continued on her way. Nevertheless, when they camein sight of the convento, she stopped and began to tremble."Let's go home, let's go home," she begged, holding her companion back.Sister Bali had to take her by the arm and half drag her along,reassuring her and telling her about the books of the friars. Shewould not desert her, so there was nothing to fear. Padre Camorrahad other things in mind--Juli was only a poor country girl.But upon arriving at the door of the convento, Juli firmly refusedto go in, catching hold of the wall."No, no," she pleaded in terror. "No, no, no! Have pity!""But what a fool--"Sister Bali pushed her gently along, Juli, pallid and with wildfeatures, offering resistance. The expression of her face said thatshe saw death before her."All right, let's go back, if you don't want to!" at length the goodwoman exclaimed in irritation, as she did not believe there was anyreal danger. Padre Camorra, in spite of all his reputation, woulddare do nothing before her."Let them carry poor Basilio into exile, let them shoot him on theway, saying that he tried to escape," she added. "When he's dead,then remorse will come. But as for myself, I owe him no favors,so he can't reproach me!"That was the decisive stroke. In the face of that reproach, with wrathand desperation mingled, like one who rushes to suicide, Juli closedher eyes in order not to see the abyss into which she was hurlingherself and resolutely entered the convento. A sigh that soundedlike the rattle of death escaped from her lips. Sister Bali followed,telling her how to act.That night comments were mysteriously whispered about certain eventswhich had occurred that afternoon. A girl had leaped from a windowof the convento, falling upon some stones and killing herself. Almostat the same time another woman had rushed out of the convento to runthrough the streets shouting and screaming like a lunatic. The prudenttownsfolk dared not utter any names and many mothers pinched theirdaughters for letting slip expressions that might compromise them.Later, very much later, at twilight, an old man came from a villageand stood calling at the door of the convento, which was closed andguarded by sacristans. The old man beat the door with his fists andwith his head, while he littered cries stifled and inarticulate, likethose of a dumb person, until he was at length driven away by blows andshoves. Then he made his way to the gobernadorcillo's house, but wastold that the gobernadorcillo was not there, he was at the convento;he went to the Justice of the Peace, but neither was the Justice ofthe Peace at home--he had been summoned to the convento; he went tothe teniente-mayor, but he too was at the convento; he directed hissteps to the barracks, but the lieutenant of the Civil Guard was atthe convento. The old man then returned to his village, weeping like achild. His wails were heard in the middle of the night, causing men tobite their lips and women to clasp their hands, while the dogs slunkfearfully back into the houses with their tails between their legs."Ah, God, God!" said a poor woman, lean from fasting, "in Thy presencethere is no rich, no poor, no white, no black--Thou wilt grant usjustice!""Yes," rejoined her husband, "just so that God they preach is not apure invention, a fraud! They themselves are the first not to believein Him."At eight o'clock in the evening it was rumored that more thanseven friars, proceeding from neighboring towns, were assembled inthe convento to hold a conference. On the following day, TandangSelo disappeared forever from the village, carrying with him hishunting-spear.CHAPTER XXXITHE HIGH OFFICIAL    L'Espagne et sa, vertu, l'Espagne et sa grandeur    Tout s'en va!--Victor HugoThe newspapers of Manila were so engrossed in accounts of a notoriousmurder committed in Europe, in panegyrics and puffs for variouspreachers in the city, in the constantly increasing success of theFrench operetta, that they could scarcely devote space to the crimesperpetrated in the provinces by a band of tulisanes headed by a fierceand terrible leader who was called _Matanglawin._ [68] Only when theobject of the attack was a convento or a Spaniard there then appearedlong articles giving frightful details and asking for martial law,energetic measures, and so on. So it was that they could take no noticeof what had occurred in the town of Tiani, nor was there the slightesthint or allusion to it. In private circles something was whispered,but so confused, so vague, and so little consistent, that not eventhe name of the victim was known, while those who showed the greatestinterest forgot it quickly, trusting that the affair had been settledin some way with the wronged family. The only one who knew anythingcertain was Padre Camorra, who had to leave the town, to be transferredto another or to remain for some time in the convento in Manila."Poor Padre Camorra!" exclaimed Ben-Zayb in a fit of generosity. "Hewas so jolly and had such a good heart!"It was true that the students had recovered their liberty, thanks tothe exertions of their relatives, who did not hesitate at expense,gifts, or any sacrifice whatsoever. The first to see himself free, aswas to be expected, was Makaraig, and the last Isagani, because PadreFlorentine did not reach Manila until a week after the events. Somany acts of clemency secured for the General the title of clementand merciful, which Ben-Zayb hastened to add to his long list ofadjectives.The only one who did not obtain his liberty was Basilio, since he wasalso accused of having in his possession prohibited books. We don'tknow whether this referred to his text-book on legal medicine or tothe pamphlets that were found, dealing with the Philippines, or bothtogether--the fact is that it was said that prohibited literaturewas being secretly sold, and upon the unfortunate boy fell all theweight of the rod of justice.It was reported that his Excellency had been thus advised: "It'snecessary that there be some one, so that the prestige of authoritymay be sustained and that it may not be said that we made a great fussover nothing. Authority before everything. It's necessary that someone be made an example of. Let there be just one, one who, accordingto Padre Irene, was the servant of Capitan Tiago--there'll be no oneto enter a complaint--""Servant and student?" asked his Excellency. "That fellow, then! Letit be he!""Your Excellency will pardon me," observed the high official, whohappened to be present, "but I've been told that this boy is a medicalstudent and his teachers speak well of him. If he remains a prisonerhe'll lose a year, and as this year he finishes--"The high official's interference in behalf of Basilio, insteadof helping, harmed him. For some time there had been between thisofficial and his Excellency strained relations and bad feelings,augmented by frequent clashes."Yes? So much the greater reason that he should be kept prisoner;a year longer in his studies, instead of injuring him, will do good,not only to himself but to all who afterwards fall into his hands. Onedoesn't become a bad physician by extensive practise. So much themore reason that he should remain! Soon the filibustering reformerswill say that we are not looking out for the country!" concluded hisExcellency with a sarcastic laugh.The high official realized that he had made a false move and tookBasilio's case to heart. "But it seems to me that this young man isthe most innocent of all," he rejoined rather timidly."Books have been seized in his possession," observed the secretary."Yes, works on medicine and pamphlets written by Peninsulars, withthe leaves uncut, and besides, what does that signify? Moreover,this young man was not present at the banquet in the _pansiteria_,he hasn't mixed up in anything. As I've said, he's the most innocent--""So much the better!" exclaimed his Excellency jocosely. "In thatway the punishment will prove more salutary and exemplary, since itinspires greater terror. To govern is to act in this way, my dearsir, as it is often expedient to sacrifice the welfare of one to thewelfare of many. But I'm doing more--from the welfare of one willresult the welfare of all, the principle of endangered authority ispreserved, prestige is respected and maintained. By this act of mineI'm correcting my own and other people's faults."The high official restrained himself with an effort and, disregardingthe allusion, decided to take another tack. "But doesn't yourExcellency fear the--responsibility?""What have I to fear?" rejoined the General impatiently. "Haven'tI discretionary powers? Can't I do what I please for the bettergovernment of these islands? What have I to fear? Can somemenial perhaps arraign me before the tribunals and exact from meresponsibility? Even though he had the means, he would have to consultthe Ministry first, and the Minister--"He waved his hand and burst out into laughter."The Minister who appointed me, the devil knows where he is, andhe will feel honored in being able to welcome me when I return. Thepresent one, I don't even think of him, and the devil take him too! Theone that relieves him will find himself in so many difficulties withhis new duties that he won't be able to fool with trifles. I, my dearsir, have nothing over me but my conscience, I act according to myconscience, and my conscience is satisfied, so I don't care a strawfor the opinions of this one and that. My conscience, my dear sir,my conscience!""Yes, General, but the country--""Tut, tut, tut, tut! The country--what have I to do Avith thecountry? Have I perhaps contracted any obligations to it? Do I owemy office to it? Was it the country that elected me?"A brief pause ensued, during which the high official stood with bowedhead. Then, as if reaching a decision, he raised it to stare fixedlyat the General. Pale and trembling, he said with repressed energy:"That doesn't matter, General, that doesn't matter at all! YourExcellency has not been chosen by the Filipino people, but by Spain,all the more reason why you should treat the Filipinos well so thatthey may not be able to reproach Spain. The greater reason, General,the greater reason! Your Excellency, by coming here, has contractedthe obligation to govern justly, to seek the welfare--""Am I not doing it?" interrupted his Excellency in exasperation,taking a step forward. "Haven't I told you that I am getting from thegood of one the good of all? Are you now going to give me lessons? Ifyou don't understand my actions, how am I to blame? Do I compel youto share my responsibility?""Certainly not," replied the high official, drawing himself upproudly. "Your Excellency does not compel me, your Excellency cannotcompel me, _me,_ to share _your_ responsibility. I understand mine inquite another way, and because I have it, I'm going to speak--I've heldmy peace a long time. Oh, your Excellency needn't make those gestures,because the fact that I've come here in this or that capacity doesn'tmean that I have given up my rights, that I have been reduced to thepart of a slave, without voice or dignity."I don't want Spain to lose this beautiful empire, these eightmillions of patient and submissive subjects, who live on hopes anddelusions, but neither do I wish to soil my hands in their barbarousexploitation. I don't wish it ever to be said that, the slave-tradeabolished, Spain has continued to cloak it with her banner andperfect it under a wealth of specious institutions. No, to be greatSpain does not have to be a tyrant, Spain is sufficient unto herself,Spain was greater when she had only her own territory, wrested fromthe clutches of the Moor. I too am a Spaniard, but before being aSpaniard I am a man, and before Spain and above Spain is her honor,the lofty principles of morality, the eternal principles of immutablejustice! Ah, you are surprised that I think thus, because you have noidea of the grandeur of the Spanish name, no, you haven't any idea ofit, you identify it with persons and interests. To you the Spaniard maybe a pirate, he may be a murderer, a hypocrite, a cheat, anything,just so he keep what he has--but to me the Spaniard should loseeverything, empire, power, wealth, everything, before his honor! Ah,my dear sir, we protest when we read that might is placed before right,yet we applaud when in practise we see might play the hypocrite innot only perverting right but even in using it as a tool in order togain control. For the very reason that I love Spain, I'm speaking now,and I defy your frown!"I don't wish that the coming ages accuse Spain of being the stepmotherof the nations, the vampire of races, the tyrant of small islands,since it would be a horrible mockery of the noble principles of ourancient kings. How are we carrying out their sacred legacy? Theypromised to these islands protection and justice, and we are playingwith the lives and liberties of the inhabitants; they promisedcivilization, and^we are curtailing it, fearful that they may aspireto a nobler existence; they promised them light, and we cover theireyes that they may not witness our orgies; they promised to teach themvirtue and we are encouraging their vice. Instead of peace, wealth,and justice, confusion reigns, commerce languishes, and skepticismis fostered among the masses."Let us put ourselves in the place of the Filipinos and ask ourselveswhat we would do in their place. Ah, in your silence I read theirright to rebel, and if matters do not mend they will rebel some day,and justice will be on their side, with them will go the sympathyof all honest men, of every patriot in the world! When a people isdenied light, home, liberty, and justice--things that are essentialto life, and therefore man's patrimony--that people has the right totreat him who so despoils it as we would the robber who intercepts uson the highway. There are no distinctions, there are no exceptions,nothing but a fact, a right, an aggression, and every honest man whodoes not place himself on the side of the wronged makes himself anaccomplice and stains his conscience."True, I am not a soldier, and the years are cooling the little firein my blood, but just as I would risk being torn to pieces to defendthe integrity of Spain against any foreign invader or against anunjustified disloyalty in her provinces, so I also assure you that Iwould place myself beside the oppressed Filipinos, because I wouldprefer to fall in the cause of the outraged rights of humanity totriumphing with the selfish interests of a nation, even when thatnation be called as it is called--Spain!""Do you know when the mail-boat leaves?" inquired his Excellencycoldly, when the high official had finished speaking.The latter stared at him fixedly, then dropped his head and silentlyleft the palace.Outside he found his carriage awaiting him. "Some day when you declareyourselves independent," he said somewhat abstractedly to the nativelackey who opened the carriage-door for him, "remember that therewere not lacking in Spain hearts that beat for you and struggled foryour rights!""Where, sir?" asked the lackey, who had understood nothing of thisand was inquiring whither they should go.Two hours later the high official handed in his resignation andannounced his intention of returning to Spain by the next mail-steamer.CHAPTER XXXIIEFFECT OF THE PASQUINADESAs a result of the events narrated, many mothers ordered their sonsimmediately to leave off their studies and devote themselves toidleness or to agriculture. When the examinations came, suspensionswere plentiful, and he was a rare exception who finished the course,if he had belonged to the famous association, to which no one paidany more attention. Pecson, Tadeo, and Juanito Pelaez were all alikesuspended--the first receiving his dismissal with his foolish grinand declaring his intention of becoming an officer in some court,while Tadeo, with his eternal holiday realized at last, paid for anillumination and made a bonfire of his books. Nor did the others getoff much better, and at length they too had to abandon their studies,to the great satisfaction of their mothers, who always fancy their sonshanged if they should come to understand what the books teach. JuanitoPelaez alone took the blow ill, since it forced him to leave school forhis father's store, with whom he was thenceforward to be associatedin the business: the rascal found the store much less entertaining,but after some time his friends again noticed his hump appear,a symptom that his good humor was returning. The rich Makaraig,in view of the catastrophe, took good care not to expose himself,and having secured a passport by means of money set out in haste forEurope. It was said that his Excellency, the Captain-General, in hisdesire to do good by good means, and careful of the interests of theFilipinos, hindered the departure of every one who could not firstprove substantially that he had the money to spend and could live inidleness in European cities. Among our acquaintances those who got offbest were Isagani and Sandoval: the former passed in the subject hestudied under Padre Fernandez and was suspended in the others, whilethe latter was able to confuse the examining-board with his oratory.Basilio was the only one who did not pass in any subject, who wasnot suspended, and who did not go to Europe, for he remained inBilibid prison, subjected every three days to examinations, almostalways the same in principle, without other variation than a change ofinquisitors, since it seemed that in the presence of such great guiltall gave up or fell away in horror. And while the documents molderedor were shifted about, while the stamped papers increased like theplasters of an ignorant physician on the body of a hypochondriac,Basilio became informed of all the details of what had happenedin Tiani, of the death of Juli and the disappearance of TandangSelo. Sinong, the abused cochero, who had driven him to San Diego,happened to be in Manila at that time and called to give him allthe news.Meanwhile, Simoun had recovered his health, or so at least thenewspapers said. Ben-Zayb rendered thanks to "the Omnipotent whowatches over such a precious life," and manifested the hope that theHighest would some day reveal the malefactor, whose crime remainedunpunished, thanks to the charity of the victim, who was too closelyfollowing the words of the Great Martyr: _Father, forgive them, forthey know not what they do._ These and other things Ben-Zayb said inprint, while by mouth he was inquiring whether there was any truth inthe rumor that the opulent jeweler was going to give a grand fiesta,a banquet such as had never before been seen, in part to celebratehis recovery and in part as a farewell to the country in which he hadincreased his fortune. It was whispered as certain that Simoun, whowould have to leave with the Captain-General, whose command expiredin May, was making every effort to secure from Madrid an extension,and that he was advising his Excellency to start a campaign in order tohave an excuse for remaining, but it was further reported that for thefirst time his Excellency had disregarded the advice of his favorite,making it a point of honor not to retain for a single additional daythe power that had been conferred upon him, a rumor which encouragedbelief that the fiesta announced would take place; very soon. Forthe rest, Simoun remained unfathomable, since he had become veryuncommunicative, showed himself seldom, and smiled mysteriously whenthe rumored fiesta was mentioned."Come, Senor Sindbad," Ben-Zayb had once rallied him, "dazzle us withsomething Yankee! You owe something to this country.""Doubtless!" was Simoun's response, with a dry smile."You'll throw the house wide open, eh?""Maybe, but as I have no house--""You ought to have secured Capitan Tiago's, which Senor Pelaez gotfor nothing."Simoun became silent, and from that time on he was often seen in thestore of Don Timoteo Pelaez, with whom it was said he had enteredinto partnership. Some weeks afterward, in the month of April, it wasrumored that Juanito Pelaez, Don Timoteo's son, was going to marryPaulita Gomez, the girl coveted by Spaniards and foreigners."Some men are lucky!" exclaimed other envious merchants. "To buy ahouse for nothing, sell his consignment of galvanized iron well,get into partnership with a Simoun, and marry his son to a richheiress--just say if those aren't strokes of luck that all honorablemen don't have!""If you only knew whence came that luck of Senor Pelaez's!" anotherresponded, in a tone which indicated that the speaker did know. "It'salso assured that there'll be a fiesta and on a grand scale," wasadded with mystery.It was really true that Paulita was going to marry Juanito Pelaez. Herlove for Isagani had gradually waned, like all first loves basedon poetry and sentiment. The events of the pasquinades and theimprisonment of the youth had shorn him of all his charms. To whomwould it have occurred to seek danger, to desire to share the fateof his comrades, to surrender himself, when every one was hiding anddenying any complicity in the affair? It was quixotic, it was madnessthat no sensible person in Manila could pardon, and Juanito was quiteright in ridiculing him, representing what a sorry figure he cut whenhe went to the Civil Government. Naturally, the brilliant Paulitacould no longer love a young man who so erroneously understood socialmatters and whom all condemned. Then she began to reflect. Juanito wasclever, capable, gay, shrewd, the son of a rich merchant of Manila,and a Spanish mestizo besides--if Don Timoteo was to be believed,a full-blooded Spaniard. On the other hand, Isagani was a provincialnative who dreamed of forests infested with leeches, he was of doubtfulfamily, with a priest for an uncle, who would perhaps be an enemy toluxury and balls, of which she was very fond. One beautiful morningtherefore it occurred to her that she had been a downright fool toprefer him to his rival, and from that time on Pelaez's hump steadilyincreased. Unconsciously, yet rigorously, Paulita was obeying thelaw discovered by Darwin, that the female surrenders herself to thefittest male, to him who knows how to adapt himself to the medium inwhich he lives, and to live in Manila there was no other like Pelaez,who from his infancy had had chicanery at his finger-tips. Lent passedwith its Holy Week, its array of processions and pompous displays,without other novelty than a mysterious mutiny among the artillerymen,the cause of which was never disclosed. The houses of light materialswere torn down in the presence of a troop of cavalry, ready to fallupon the owners in case they should offer resistance. There was agreat deal of weeping and many lamentations, but the affair did notget beyond that. The curious, among them Simoun, went to see thosewho were left homeless, walking about indifferently and assuring eachother that thenceforward they could sleep in peace.Towards the end of April, all the fears being now forgotten, Manilawas engrossed with one topic: the fiesta that Don Timoteo Pelaez wasgoing to celebrate at the wedding of his son, for which the Generalhad graciously and condescendingly agreed to be the patron. Simounwas reported to have arranged the matter. The ceremony wouldbe solemnized two days before the departure of the General, whowould honor the house and make a present to the bridegroom. It waswhispered that the jeweler would pour out cascades of diamonds andthrow away handfuls of pearls in honor of his partner's son, thus,since he could hold no fiesta of his own, as he was a bachelor andhad no house, improving the opportunity to dazzle the Filipino peoplewith a memorable farewell. All Manila prepared to be invited, andnever did uneasiness take stronger hold of the mind than in view ofthe thought of not being among those bidden. Friendship with Simounbecame a matter of dispute, and many husbands were forced by theirwives to purchase bars of steel and sheets of galvanized iron inorder to make friends with Don Timoteo Pelaez.CHAPTER XXXIIILA ULTIMA RAZON [69]At last the great day arrived. During the morning Simoun had not lefthis house, busied as he was in packing his arms and his jewels. Hisfabulous wealth was already locked up in the big steel chest with itscanvas cover, there remaining only a few cases containing braceletsand pins, doubtless gifts that he meant to make. He was going to leavewith the Captain-General, who cared in no way to lengthen his stay,fearful of what people would say. Malicious ones insinuated that Simoundid not dare remain alone, since without the General's support he didnot care to expose himself to the vengeance of the many wretches hehad exploited, all the more reason for which was the fact that theGeneral who was coming was reported to be a model of rectitude andmight make him disgorge his gains. The superstitious Indians, on theother hand, believed that Simoun was the devil who did not wish toseparate himself from his prey. The pessimists winked maliciously andsaid, "The field laid waste, the locust leaves for other parts!" Onlya few, a very few, smiled and said nothing.In the afternoon Simoun had given orders to his servant that if thereappeared a young man calling himself Basilio he should be admittedat once. Then he shut himself up in his room and seemed to becomelost in deep thought. Since his illness the jeweler's countenance hadbecome harder and gloomier, while the wrinkles between his eyebrowshad deepened greatly. He did not hold himself so erect as formerly,and his head was bowed.So absorbed was he in his meditations that he did not hear a knockat the door, and it had to be repeated. He shuddered and called out,"Come in!"It was Basilio, but how altered! If the change that had taken placein Simoun during those two months was great, in the young student itwas frightful. His cheeks were hollow, his hair unkempt, his clothingdisordered. The tender melancholy had disappeared from his eyes,and in its place glittered a dark light, so that it might be saidthat he had died and his corpse had revived, horrified with what ithad seen in eternity. If not crime, then the shadow of crime, hadfixed itself upon his whole appearance. Simoun himself was startledand felt pity for the wretch.Without any greeting Basilio slowly advanced into the room, and ina voice that made the jeweler shudder said to him, "Senor Simoun,I've been a wicked son and a bad brother--I've overlooked the murderof one and the tortures of the other, and God has chastised me! Nowthere remains to me only one desire, and it is to return evil for evil,crime for crime, violence for violence!"Simoun listened in silence, while Basilio continued; "Four months agoyou talked to me about your plans. I refused to take part in them,but I did wrong, you have been right. Three months and a half agothe revolution was on the point of breaking out, but I did not thencare to participate in it, and the movement failed. In payment formy conduct I've been arrested and owe my liberty to your effortsonly. You are right and now I've come to say to you: put a weaponin my hand and let the revolution come! I am ready to serve you,along with all the rest of the unfortunates."The cloud that had darkened Simoun's brow suddenly disappeared, a rayof triumph darted from his eyes, and like one who has found what hesought he exclaimed: "I'm right, yes, I'm right! Right and Justiceare on my side, because my cause is that of the persecuted. Thanks,young man, thanks! You've come to clear away my doubts, to end myhesitation."He had risen and his face was beaming. The zeal that had animated himwhen four months before he had explained his plans to Basilio in thewood of his ancestors reappeared in his countenance like a red sunsetafter a cloudy day."Yes," he resumed, "the movement failed and many have deserted mebecause they saw me disheartened and wavering at the supreme moment. Istill cherished something in my heart, I was not the master of allmy feelings, I still loved! Now everything is dead in me, no longeris there even a corpse sacred enough for me to respect its sleep. Nolonger will there be any vacillation, for you yourself, an idealisticyouth, a gentle dove, understand the necessity and come to spur me toaction. Somewhat late you have opened your eyes, for between you andme together we might have executed marvelous plans, I above in thehigher circles spreading death amid perfume and gold, brutalizing thevicious and corrupting or paralyzing the few good, and you below amongthe people, among the young men, stirring them to life amid blood andtears. Our task, instead of being bloody and barbarous, would havebeen holy, perfect, artistic, and surely success would have crownedour efforts. But no intelligence would support me, I encountered fearor effeminacy among the enlightened classes, selfishness among therich, simplicity among the youth, and only in the mountains, in thewaste places, among the outcasts, have I found my men. But no matternow! If we can't get a finished statue, rounded out in all its details,of the rough block we work upon let those to come take charge!"Seizing the arm of Basilio, who was listening without comprehendingall he said, he led him to the laboratory where he kept his chemicalmixtures. Upon the table was placed a large case made of dark shagreen,similar to those that hold the silver plate exchanged as gifts amongthe rich and powerful. Opening this, Simoun revealed to sight, upona bottom of red satin, a lamp of very peculiar shape, Its body was inthe form of a pomegranate as large as a man's head, with fissures init exposing to view the seeds inside, which were fashioned of enormouscarnelians. The covering was of oxidized gold in exact imitation ofthe wrinkles on the fruit.Simoun took it out with great care and, removing the burner,exposed to view the interior of the tank, which was lined withsteel two centimeters in thickness and which had a capacity of over aliter. Basilio questioned him with his eyes, for as yet he comprehendednothing. Without entering upon explanations, Simoun carefully took froma cabinet a flask and showed the young man the formula written upon it."Nitro-glycerin!" murmured Basilio, stepping backward and instinctivelythrusting his hands behind him. "Nitro-glycerin! Dynamite!" Beginningnow to understand, he felt his hair stand on end."Yes, nitro-glycerin!" repeated Simoun slowly, with his cold smile anda look of delight at the glass flask. "It's also something more thannitro-glycerin--it's concentrated tears, repressed hatred, wrongs,injustice, outrage. It's the last resort of the weak, force againstforce, violence against violence. A moment ago I was hesitating,but you have come and decided me. This night the most dangeroustyrants will be blown to pieces, the irresponsible rulers that hidethemselves behind God and the State, whose abuses remain unpunishedbecause no one can bring them to justice. This night the Philippineswill hear the explosion that will convert into rubbish the formlessmonument whose decay I have fostered."Basilio was so terrified that his lips worked without producing anysound, his tongue was paralyzed, his throat parched. For the firsttime he was looking at the powerful liquid which he had heard talkedof as a thing distilled in gloom by gloomy men, in open war againstsociety. Now he had it before him, transparent and slightly yellowish,poured with great caution into the artistic pomegranate. Simoun lookedto him like the jinnee of the _Arabian Nights_ that sprang from thesea, he took on gigantic proportions, his head touched the sky, hemade the house tremble and shook the whole city with a shrug of hisshoulders. The pomegranate assumed the form of a colossal sphere,the fissures became hellish grins whence escaped names and glowingcinders. For the first time in his life Basilio was overcome withfright and completely lost his composure.Simoun, meanwhile, screwed on solidly a curious and complicatedmechanism, put in place a glass chimney, then the bomb, and crownedthe whole with an elegant shade. Then he moved away some distance tocontemplate the effect, inclining his head now to one side, now tothe other, thus better to appreciate its magnificent appearance.Noticing that Basilio was watching him with questioning and suspiciouseyes, he said, "Tonight there will be a fiesta and this lamp willbe placed in a little dining-kiosk that I've had constructed forthe purpose. The lamp will give a brilliant light, bright enough tosuffice for the illumination of the whole place by itself, but atthe end of twenty minutes the light will fade, and then when someone tries to turn up the wick a cap of fulminate of mercury willexplode, the pomegranate will blow up and with it the dining-room,in the roof and floor of which I have concealed sacks of powder,so that no one shall escape."There wras a moment's silence, while Simoun stared at his mechanismand Basilio scarcely breathed."So my assistance is not needed," observed the young man."No, you have another mission to fulfill," replied Simounthoughtfully. "At nine the mechanism will have exploded and the reportwill have been heard in the country round, in the mountains, in thecaves. The uprising that I had arranged with the artillerymen wasa failure from lack of plan and timeliness, but this time it won'tbe so. Upon hearing the explosion, the wretched and the oppressed,those who wander about pursued by force, will sally forth armed tojoin Cabesang Tales in Santa Mesa, whence they will fall upon the city,[70] while the soldiers, whom I have made to believe that the Generalis shamming an insurrection in order to remain, will issue from theirbarracks ready to fire upon whomsoever I may designate. Meanwhile,the cowed populace, thinking that the hour of massacre has come,will rush out prepared to kill or be killed, and as they have neitherarms nor organization, you with some others will put yourself attheir head and direct them to the warehouses of Quiroga, where Ikeep my rifles. Cabesang Tales and I will join one another in thecity and take possession of it, while you in the suburbs will seizethe bridges and throw up barricades, and then be ready to come toour aid to butcher not only those opposing the revolution but alsoevery man who refuses to take up arms and join us.""All?" stammered Basilio in a choking voice."All!" repeated Simoun in a sinister tone. "All--Indians, mestizos,Chinese, Spaniards, all who are found to be without courage, withoutenergy. The race must be renewed! Cowardly fathers will only breedslavish sons, and it wouldn't be worth while to destroy and then try torebuild with rotten materials. What, do you shudder? Do you tremble,do you fear to scatter death? What is death? What does a hecatomb oftwenty thousand wretches signify? Twenty thousand miseries less, andmillions of wretches saved from birth! The most timid ruler does nothesitate to dictate a law that produces misery and lingering deathfor thousands and thousands of prosperous and industrious subjects,happy perchance, merely to satisfy a caprice, a whim, his pride,and yet you shudder because in one night are to be ended forever themental tortures of many helots, because a vitiated and paralytic peoplehas to die to give place to another, young, active, full of energy!"What is death? Nothingness, or a dream? Can its specters be comparedto the reality of the agonies of a whole miserable generation? Theneedful thing is to destroy the evil, to kill the dragon andbathe the new people in the blood, in order to make it strong andinvulnerable. What else is the inexorable law of Nature, the law ofstrife in which the weak has to succumb so that the vitiated speciesbe not perpetuated and creation thus travel backwards? Away then witheffeminate scruples! Fulfill the eternal laws, foster them, and thenthe earth will be so much the more fecund the more it is fertilizedwith blood, and the thrones the more solid the more they rest uponcrimes and corpses. Let there be no hesitation, no doubtings! What isthe pain of death? A momentary sensation, perhaps confused, perhapsagreeable, like the transition from waking to sleep. What is it thatis being destroyed? Evil, suffering--feeble weeds, in order to set intheir place luxuriant plants. Do you call that destruction? I shouldcall it creating, producing, nourishing, vivifying!"Such bloody sophisms, uttered with conviction and coolness, overwhelmedthe youth, weakened as he was by more than three months in prisonand blinded by his passion for revenge, so he was not in a mood toanalyze the moral basis of the matter. Instead of replying that theworst and cowardliest of men is always something more than a plant,because he has a soul and an intelligence, which, however vitiatedand brutalized they may be, can be redeemed; instead of replying thatman has no right to dispose of one life for the benefit of another,that the right to life is inherent in every individual like the rightto liberty and to light; instead of replying that if it is an abuse onthe part of governments to punish in a culprit the faults and crimesto which they have driven him by their own negligence or stupidity,how much more so would it be in a man, however great and howeverunfortunate he might be, to punish in a wretched people the faults ofits governments and its ancestors; instead of declaring that God alonecan use such methods, that God can destroy because He can create,God who holds in His hands recompense, eternity, and the future,to justify His acts, and man never; instead of these reflections,Basilio merely interposed a cant reflection."What will the world say at the sight of such butchery?""The world will applaud, as usual, conceding the right ofthe strongest, the most violent!" replied Simoun with his cruelsmile. "Europe applauded when the western nations sacrificed millionsof Indians in America, and not by any means to found nations much moremoral or more pacific: there is the North with its egotistic liberty,its lynch-law, its political frauds--the South with its turbulentrepublics, its barbarous revolutions, civil wars, pronunciamientos,as in its mother Spain! Europe applauded when the powerful Portugaldespoiled the Moluccas, it applauds while England is destroying theprimitive races in the Pacific to make room for its emigrants. Europewill applaud as the end of a drama, the close of a tragedy, isapplauded, for the vulgar do not fix their attention on principles,they look only at results. Commit the crime well, and you will beadmired and have more partizans than if you had carried out virtuousactions with modesty and timidity.""Exactly," rejoined the youth, "what does it matter to me, after all,whether they praise or censure, when this world takes no care of theoppressed, of the poor, and of weak womankind? What obligations haveI to recognize toward society when it has recognized none toward me?""That's what I like to hear," declared the tempter triumphantly. Hetook a revolver from a case and gave it to Basilio, saying, "Atten o'clock wait for me in front of the church of St. Sebastian toreceive my final instructions. Ah, at nine you must be far, very farfrom Calle Anloague."Basilio examined the weapon, loaded it, and placed it in the insidepocket of his coat, then took his leave with a curt, "I'll seeyou later."CHAPTER XXXIVTHE WEDDINGOnce in the street, Basilio began to consider how he might spend thetime until the fatal hour arrived, for it was then not later than seveno'clock. It was the vacation period and all the students were back intheir towns, Isagani being the only one who had not cared to leave,but he had disappeared that morning and no one knew his whereabouts--soBasilio had been informed when after leaving the prison he had goneto visit his friend and ask him for lodging. The young man did notknow where to go, for he had no money, nothing but the revolver. Thememory of the lamp filled his imagination, the great catastrophe thatwould occur within two hours. Pondering over this, he seemed to seethe men who passed before his eyes walking without heads, and he felt athrill of ferocious joy in telling himself that, hungry and destitute,he that night was going to be dreaded, that from a poor student andservant, perhaps the sun would see him transformed into some oneterrible and sinister, standing upon pyramids of corpses, dictatinglaws to all those who were passing before his gaze now in magnificentcarriages. He laughed like one condemned to death and patted the buttof the revolver. The boxes of cartridges were also in his pockets.A question suddenly occurred to him--where would the drama begin? Inhis bewilderment he had not thought of asking Simoun, but thelatter had warned him to keep away from Calle Anloague. Then came asuspicion: that afternoon, upon leaving the prison, he had proceededto the former house of Capitan Tiago to get his few personal effectsand had found it transformed, prepared for a fiesta--the wedding ofJuanito Pelaez! Simoun had spoken of a fiesta.At this moment he noticed passing in front of him a long line ofcarriages filled with ladies and gentlemen, conversing in a livelymanner, and he even thought he could make out big bouquets of flowers,but he gave the detail no thought. The carriages were going towardCalle Rosario and in meeting those that came down off the Bridgeof Spain had to move along slowly and stop frequently. In one hesaw Juanito Pelaez at the side of a woman dressed in white with atransparent veil, in whom he recognized Paulita Gomez."Paulita!" he ejaculated in surprise, realizing that it was indeedshe, in a bridal gown, along with Juanito Pelaez, as though theywere just coming from the church. "Poor Isagani!" he murmured,"what can have become of him?"He thought for a while about his friend, a great and generous soul,and mentally asked himself if it would not be well to tell him aboutthe plan, then answered himself that Isagani would never take partin such a butchery. They had not treated Isagani as they had him.Then he thought that had there been no imprisonment, he would havebeen betrothed, or a husband, at this time, a licentiate in medicine,living and working in some corner of his province. The ghost ofJuli, crushed in her fall, crossed his mind, and dark flames ofhatred lighted his eyes; again he caressed the butt of the revolver,regretting that the terrible hour had not yet come. Just then he sawSimoun come out of the door of his house, carrying in his hands thecase containing the lamp, carefully wrapped up, and enter a carriage,which then followed those bearing the bridal party. In order not tolose track of Simoun, Basilio took a good look at the cochero andwith astonishment recognized in him the wretch who had driven him toSan Diego, Sinong, the fellow maltreated by the Civil Guard, the samewho had come to the prison to tell him about the occurrences in Tiani.Conjecturing that Calle Anloague was to be the scene of action, thitherthe youth directed his steps, hurrying forward and getting ahead ofthe carriages, which were, in fact, all moving toward the former houseof Capitan Tiago--there they were assembling in search of a ball,but actually to dance in the air! Basilio smiled when he noticed thepairs of civil-guards who formed the escort, and from their number hecould guess the importance of the fiesta and the guests. The houseoverflowed with people and poured floods of light from its windows,the entrance was carpeted and strewn with flowers. Upstairs there,perhaps in his former solitary room, an orchestra was playing livelyairs, which did not completely drown the confused tumult of talkand laughter.Don Timoteo Pelaez was reaching the pinnacle of fortune, and thereality surpassed his dreams. He was, at last, marrying his son tothe rich Gomez heiress, and, thanks to the money Simoun had lent him,he had royally furnished that big house, purchased for half its value,and was giving in it a splendid fiesta, with the foremost divinitiesof the Manila Olympus for his guests, to gild him with the light oftheir prestige. Since that morning there had been recurring to him,with the persistence of a popular song, some vague phrases that he hadread in the communion service. "Now has the fortunate hour come! Nowdraws nigh the happy moment! Soon there will be fulfilled in you theadmirable words of Simoun--'I live, and yet not I alone, but theCaptain-General liveth in me.'" The Captain-General the patron ofhis son! True, he had not attended the ceremony, where Don Custodiohad represented him, but he would come to dine, he would bring awedding-gift, a lamp which not even Aladdin's--between you and me,Simoun was presenting the lamp. Timoteo, what more could you desire?The transformation that Capitan Tiago's house had undergone wasconsiderable--it had been richly repapered, while the smoke andthe smell of opium had been completely eradicated. The immensesala, widened still more by the colossal mirrors that infinitelymultiplied the lights of the chandeliers, was carpeted throughout,for the salons of Europe had carpets, and even though the floorwas of wide boards brilliantly polished, a carpet it must have too,since nothing should be lacking. The rich furniture of Capitan Tiagohad disappeared and in its place was to be seen another kind, in thestyle of Louis XV. Heavy curtains of red velvet, trimmed with gold,with the initials of the bridal couple worked on them, and upheld bygarlands of artificial orange-blossoms, hung as portieres and sweptthe floor with their wide fringes, likewise of gold. In the cornersappeared enormous Japanese vases, alternating with those of Sevresof a clear dark-blue, placed upon square pedestals of carved wood.The only decorations not in good taste were the screaming chromoswhich Don Timoteo had substituted for the old drawings and picturesof saints of Capitan Tiago. Simoun had been unable to dissuade him,for the merchant did not want oil-paintings--some one might ascribethem to Filipino artists! He, a patron of Filipino artists, never! Onthat point depended his peace of mind and perhaps his life, and heknew how to get along in the Philippines! It is true that he had heardforeign painters mentioned--Raphael, Murillo, Velasquez--but he didnot know their addresses, and then they might prove to be somewhatseditious. With the chromos he ran no risk, as the Filipinos did notmake them, they came cheaper, the effect was the same, if not better,the colors brighter and the execution very fine. Don't say that DonTimoteo did not know how to comport himself in the Philippines!The large hallway was decorated with flowers, having been convertedinto a dining-room, with a long table for thirty persons in the center,and around the sides, pushed against the walls, other smaller ones fortwo or three persons each. Bouquets of flowers, pyramids of fruitsamong ribbons and lights, covered their centers. The groom's placewas designated by a bunch of roses and the bride's by another oforange-blossoms and tuberoses. In the presence of so much finery andflowers one could imagine that nymphs in gauzy garments and Cupidswith iridescent wings were going to serve nectar and ambrosia toaerial guests, to the sound of lyres and Aeolian harps.But the table for the greater gods was not there, being placedyonder in the middle of the wide azotea within a magnificent kioskconstructed especially for the occasion. A lattice of gilded woodover which clambered fragrant vines screened the interior from theeyes of the vulgar without impeding the free circulation of air topreserve the coolness necessary at that season. A raised platformlifted the table above the level of the others at which the ordinarymortals were going to dine and an arch decorated by the best artistswould protect the august heads from the jealous gaze of the stars.On this table were laid only seven plates. The dishes were of solidsilver, the cloth and napkins of the finest linen, the wines themost costly and exquisite. Don Timoteo had sought the most rare andexpensive in everything, nor would he have hesitated at crime had hebeen assured that the Captain-General liked to eat human flesh.CHAPTER XXXVTHE FIESTA    "Danzar sobre un volcan."By seven in the evening the guests had begun to arrive: first, thelesser divinities, petty government officials, clerks, and merchants,with the most ceremonious greetings and the gravest airs at the start,as if they were parvenus, for so much light, so many decorations,and so much glassware had some effect. Afterwards, they began tobe more at ease, shaking their fists playfully, with pats on theshoulders, and even familiar slaps on the back. Some, it is true,adopted a rather disdainful air, to let it be seen that they wereaccustomed to better things--of course they were! There was one goddesswho yawned, for she found everything vulgar and even remarked thatshe was ravenously hungry, while another quarreled with her god,threatening to box his ears.Don Timoteo bowed here and bowed there, scattered his best smiles,tightened his belt, stepped backward, turned halfway round, thencompletely around, and so on again and again, until one goddess couldnot refrain from remarking to her neighbor, under cover of her fan:"My dear, how important the old man is! Doesn't he look like ajumping-jack?"Later came the bridal couple, escorted by Dona Victorina and the restof the party. Congratulations, hand-shakings, patronizing pats for thegroom: for the bride, insistent stares and anatomical observationson the part of the men, with analyses of her gown, her toilette,speculations as to her health and strength on the part of the women."Cupid and Psyche appearing on Olympus," thought Ben-Zayb,making a mental note of the comparison to spring it at some betteropportunity. The groom had in fact the mischievous features of the godof love, and with a little good-will his hump, which the severity ofhis frock coat did not altogether conceal, could be taken for a quiver.Don Timoteo began to feel his belt squeezing him, the corns on hisfeet began to ache, his neck became tired, but still the Generalhad not come. The greater gods, among them Padre Irene and PadreSalvi, had already arrived, it was true, but the chief thunderer wasstill lacking. The poor man became uneasy, nervous; his heart beatviolently, but still he had to bow and smile; he sat down, he arose,failed to hear what was said to him, did not say what he meant. Inthe meantime, an amateur god made remarks to him about his chromos,criticizing them with the statement that they spoiled the walls."Spoil the walls!" repeated Don Timoteo, with a smile and a desireto choke him. "But they were made in Europe and are the most costlyI could get in Manila! Spoil the walls!" Don Timoteo swore to himselfthat on the very next day he would present for payment all the chitsthat the critic had signed in his store.Whistles resounded, the galloping of horses was heard--at last! "TheGeneral! The Captain-General!"Pale with emotion, Don Timoteo, dissembling the pain of his cornsand accompanied by his son and some of the greater gods, descendedto receive the Mighty Jove. The pain at his belt vanished beforethe doubts that now assailed him: should he frame a smile or affectgravity; should he extend his hand or wait for the General to offerhis? _Carambas!_ Why had nothing of this occurred to him before,so that he might have consulted his good friend Simoun?To conceal his agitation, he whispered to his son in a low, shakyvoice, "Have you a speech prepared?""Speeches are no longer in vogue, papa, especially on such an occasionas this."Jupiter arrived in the company of Juno, who was converted into a towerof artificial lights--with diamonds in her hair, diamonds around herneck, on her arms, on her shoulders, she was literally covered withdiamonds. She was arrayed in a magnificent silk gown having a longtrain decorated with embossed flowers.His Excellency literally took possession of the house, as Don Timoteostammeringly begged him to do. [71] The orchestra played the royalmarch while the divine couple majestically ascended the carpetedstairway.Nor was his Excellency's gravity altogether affected. Perhaps for thefirst time since his arrival in the islands he felt sad, a strainof melancholy tinged his thoughts. This was the last triumph ofhis three years of government, and within two days he would descendforever from such an exalted height. What was he leaving behind? HisExcellency did not care to turn his head backwards, but preferred tolook ahead, to gaze into the future. Although he was carrying away afortune, large sums to his credit were awaiting him in European banks,and he had residences, yet he had injured many, he had made enemiesat the Court, the high official was waiting for him there. OtherGenerals had enriched themselves as rapidly as he, and now they wereruined. Why not stay longer, as Simoun had advised him to do? No,good taste before everything else. The bows, moreover, were not nowso profound as before, he noticed insistent stares and even looks ofdislike, but still he replied affably and even attempted to smile."It's plain that the sun is setting," observed Padre Irene inBen-Zayb's ear. "Many now stare him in the face."The devil with the curate--that was just what he was going to remark!"My dear," murmured into the ear of a neighbor the lady who hadreferred to Don Timoteo as a jumping-jack, "did you ever see sucha skirt?""Ugh, the curtains from the Palace!""You don't say! But it's true! They're carrying everything away. You'llsee how they make wraps out of the carpets.""That only goes to show that she has talent and taste," observed herhusband, reproving her with a look. "Women should be economical." Thispoor god was still suffering from the dressmaker's bill."My dear, give me curtains at twelve pesos a yard, and you'll see ifI put on these rags!" retorted the goddess in pique. "Heavens! Youcan talk when you have done something fine like that to give youthe right!"Meanwhile, Basilio stood before the house, lost in the throngof curious spectators, counting those who alighted from theircarriages. When he looked upon so many persons, happy and confident,when he saw the bride and groom followed by their train of freshand innocent little girls, and reflected that they were goingto meet there a horrible death, he was sorry and felt his hatredwaning within him. He wanted to save so many innocents, he thoughtof notifying the police, but a carriage drove up to set down PadreSalvi and Padre Irene, both beaming with content, and like a passingcloud his good intentions vanished. "What does it matter to me?" heasked himself. "Let the righteous suffer with the sinners."Then he added, to silence his scruples: "I'm not an informer, I mustn'tabuse the confidence he has placed in me. I owe him, _him_ more thanI do _them_: he dug my mother's grave, they killed her! What haveI to do with them? I did everything possible to be good and useful,I tried to forgive and forget, I suffered every imposition, and onlyasked that they leave me in peace. I got in no one's way. What havethey done to me? Let their mangled limbs fly through the air! We'vesuffered enough."Then he saw Simoun alight with the terrible lamp in his hands, saw himcross the entrance with bowed head, as though deep in thought. Basiliofelt his heart beat fainter, his feet and hands turn cold, while theblack silhouette of the jeweler assumed fantastic shapes enveloped inflames. There at the foot of the stairway Simoun checked his steps,as if in doubt, and Basilio held his breath. But the hesitation wastransient--Simoun raised his head, resolutely ascended the stairway,and disappeared.It then seemed to the student that the house was going to blow up atany moment, and that walls, lamps, guests, roof, windows, orchestra,would be hurtling through the air like a handful of coals in the midstof an infernal explosion. He gazed about him and fancied that he sawcorpses in place of idle spectators, he saw them torn to shreds, itseemed to him that the air was filled with flames, but his calmer selftriumphed over this transient hallucination, which was due somewhatto his hunger."Until he comes out, there's no danger," he said to himself. "TheCaptain-General hasn't arrived yet."He tried to appear calm and control the convulsive trembling in hislimbs, endeavoring to divert his thoughts to other things. Somethingwithin was ridiculing him, saying, "If you tremble now, before thesupreme moment, how will you conduct yourself when you see bloodflowing, houses burning, and bullets whistling?"His Excellency arrived, but the young man paid no attention tohim. He was watching the face of Simoun, who was among those thatdescended to receive him, and he read in that implacable countenancethe sentence of death for all those men, so that fresh terror seizedupon him. He felt cold, he leaned against the wall, and, with hiseyes fixed on the windows and his ears cocked, tried to guess whatmight be happening. In the sala he saw the crowd surround Simounto look at the lamp, he heard congratulations and exclamations ofadmiration--the words "dining-room," "novelty," were repeated manytimes--he saw the General smile and conjectured that the noveltywas to be exhibited that very night, by the jeweler's arrangement,on the table whereat his Excellency was to dine. Simoun disappeared,followed by a crowd of admirers.At that supreme moment his good angel triumphed, he forgot his hatreds,he forgot Juli, he wanted to save the innocent. Come what might, hewould cross the street and try to enter. But Basilio had forgottenthat he was miserably dressed. The porter stopped him and accostedhim roughly, and finally, upon his insisting, threatened to callthe police.Just then Simoun came down, slightly pale, and the porter turnedfrom Basilio to salute the jeweler as though he had been a saintpassing. Basilio realized from the expression of Simoun's face that hewas leaving the fated house forever, that the lamp was lighted. _Aleajacta est!_ Seized by the instinct of self-preservation, he thoughtthen of saving himself. It might occur to any of the guests throughcuriosity to tamper with the wick and then would come the explosionto overwhelm them all. Still he heard Simoun say to the cochero,"The Escolta, hurry!"Terrified, dreading that he might at any moment hear the awfulexplosion, Basilio hurried as fast as his legs would carry him to getaway from the accursed spot, but his legs seemed to lack the necessaryagility, his feet slipped on the sidewalk as though they were movingbut not advancing. The people he met blocked the way, and before he hadgone twenty steps he thought that at least five minutes had elapsed.Some distance away he stumbled against a young man who was standingwith his head thrown back, gazing fixedly at the house, and in himhe recognized Isagani. "What are you doing here?" he demanded. "Comeaway!"Isagani stared at him vaguely, smiled sadly, and again turned his gazetoward the open balconies, across which was revealed the etherealsilhouette of the bride clinging to the groom's arm as they movedslowly out of sight."Come, Isagani, let's get away from that house. Come!" Basilio urgedin a hoarse voice, catching his friend by the arm.Isagani gently shook himself free and continued to stare with thesame sad smile upon his lips."For God's sake, let's get away from here!""Why should I go away? Tomorrow it will not be she."There was so much sorrow in those words that Basilio for a momentforgot his own terror. "Do you want to die?" he demanded.Isagani shrugged his shoulders and continued to gaze toward the house.Basilio again tried to drag him away. "Isagani, Isagani, listento me! Let's not waste any time! That house is mined, it's goingto blow up at any moment, by the least imprudent act, the leastcuriosity! Isagani, all will perish in its ruins.""In its ruins?" echoed Isagani, as if trying to understand, butwithout removing his gaze from the window."Yes, in its ruins, yes, Isagani! For God's sake, come! I'll explainafterwards. Come! One who has been more unfortunate than either youor I has doomed them all. Do you see that white, clear light, like anelectric lamp, shining from the azotea? It's the light of death! Alamp charged with dynamite, in a mined dining-room, will burst andnot a rat will escape alive. Come!""No," answered Isagani, shaking his head sadly. "I want to stay here,I want to see her for the last time. Tomorrow, you see, she will besomething different.""Let fate have its way!" Basilio then exclaimed, hurrying away.Isagani watched his friend rush away with a precipitation thatindicated real terror, but continued to stare toward the charmedwindow, like the cavalier of Toggenburg waiting for his sweetheartto appear, as Schiller tells. Now the sala was deserted, all havingrepaired to the dining-rooms, and it occurred to Isagani that Basilio'sfears may have been well-founded. He recalled the terrified countenanceof him who was always so calm and composed, and it set him to thinking.Suddenly an idea appeared clear in his imagination--the house wasgoing to blow up and Paulita was there, Paulita was going to die afrightful death. In the presence of this idea everything was forgotten:jealousy, suffering, mental torture, and the generous youth thoughtonly of his love. Without reflecting, without hesitation, he rantoward the house, and thanks to his stylish clothes and determinedmien, easily secured admittance.While these short scenes were occurring in the street, in thedining-kiosk of the greater gods there was passed from hand to handa piece of parchment on which were written in red ink these fatefulwords:    _Mene, Tekel, Phares_ [72]    _Juan Crisostomo Ibarra_"Juan Crisostomo Ibarra? Who is he?" asked his Excellency, handingthe paper to his neighbor."A joke in very bad taste!" exclaimed Don Custodio. "To sign the nameof a filibuster dead more than ten years!""A filibuster!""It's a seditious joke!""There being ladies present--"Padre Irene looked around for the joker and saw Padre Salvi, who wasseated at the right of the Countess, turn as white as his napkin,while he stared at the mysterious words with bulging eyes. The sceneof the sphinx recurred to him."What's the matter, Padre Salvi?" he asked. "Do you recognize yourfriend's signature?"Padre Salvi did not reply. He made an effort to speak and without beingconscious of what he was doing wiped his forehead with his napkin."What has happened to your Reverence?""It is his very handwriting!" was the whispered reply in a scarcelyperceptible voice. "It's the very handwriting of Ibarra." Leaningagainst the back of his chair, he let his arms fall as though allstrength had deserted him.Uneasiness became converted into fright, they all stared at one anotherwithout uttering a single word. His Excellency started to rise, butapprehending that such a move would be ascribed to fear, controlledhimself and looked about him. There were no soldiers present, eventhe waiters were unknown to him."Let's go on eating, gentlemen," he exclaimed, "and pay no attentionto the joke." But his voice, instead of reassuring, increased thegeneral uneasiness, for it trembled."I don't suppose that that _Mene, Tekel, Phares_, means that we'reto be assassinated tonight?" speculated Don Custodio.All remained motionless, but when he added, "Yet they might poison us,"they leaped up from their chairs.The light, meanwhile, had begun slowly to fade. "The lamp is goingout," observed the General uneasily. "Will you turn up the wick,Padre Irene?"But at that instant, with the swiftness of a flash of lightning,a figure rushed in, overturning a chair and knocking a servant down,and in the midst of the general surprise seized the lamp, rushed tothe azotea, and threw it into the river. The whole thing happened ina second and the dining-kiosk was left in darkness.The lamp had already struck the water before the servants could cryout, "Thief, thief!" and rush toward the azotea. "A revolver!" criedone of them. "A revolver, quick! After the thief!"But the figure, more agile than they, had already mounted thebalustrade and before a light could be brought, precipitated itselfinto the river, striking the water with a loud splash.CHAPTER XXXVIBEN-ZAYB'S AFFLICTIONSImmediately upon hearing of the incident, after lights had been broughtand the scarcely dignified attitudes of the startled gods revealed,Ben-Zayb, filled with holy indignation, and with the approval of thepress-censor secured beforehand, hastened home--an entresol wherehe lived in a mess with others--to write an article that would bethe sublimest ever penned under the skies of the Philippines. TheCaptain-General would leave disconsolate if he did not first enjoyhis dithyrambs, and this Ben-Zayb, in his kindness of heart, couldnot allow. Hence he sacrificed the dinner and ball, nor did he sleepthat night.Sonorous exclamations of horror, of indignation, to fancy thatthe world was smashing to pieces and the stars, the eternal stars,were clashing together! Then a mysterious introduction, filled withallusions, veiled hints, then an account of the affair, and thefinal peroration. He multiplied the flourishes and exhausted all hiseuphemisms in describing the drooping shoulders and the tardy baptismof salad his Excellency had received on his Olympian brow, he eulogizedthe agility with which the General had recovered a vertical position,placing his head where his legs had been, and vice versa, then intoneda hymn to Providence for having so solicitously guarded those sacredbones. The paragraph turned out to be so perfect that his Excellencyappeared as a hero, and fell higher, as Victor Hugo said.He wrote, erased, added, and polished, so that, without wantingin veracity--this was his special merit as a journalist--the wholewould be an epic, grand for the seven gods, cowardly and base forthe unknown thief, "who had executed himself, terror-stricken, andin the very act convinced of the enormity of his crime."He explained Padre Irene's act of plunging under the table as"an impulse of innate valor, which the habit of a God of peaceand gentleness, worn throughout a whole life, had been unable toextinguish," for Padre Irene had tried to hurl himself upon thethief and had taken a straight course along the submensal route. Inpassing, he spoke of submarine passages, mentioned a project of DonCustodio's, called attention to the liberal education and wide travelsof the priest. Padre Salvi's swoon was the excessive sorrow that tookpossession of the virtuous Franciscan to see the little fruit borneamong the Indians by his pious sermons, while the immobility andfright of the other guests, among them the Countess, who "sustained"Padre Salvi (she grabbed him), were the serenity and sang-froid ofheroes, inured to danger in the performance of their duties, besidewhom the Roman senators surprised by the Gallic invaders were nervousschoolgirls frightened at painted cockroaches.Afterwards, to form a contrast, the picture of the thief: fear,madness, confusion, the fierce look, the distorted features,and--force of moral superiority in the race--his religious awe tosee assembled there such august personages! Here came in opportunelya long imprecation, a harangue, a diatribe against the perversion ofgood customs, hence the necessity of a permanent military tribunal,"a declaration of martial law within the limits already so declared,special legislation, energetic and repressive, because it is inevery way needful, it is of imperative importance to impress upon themalefactors and criminals that if the heart is generous and paternalfor those who are submissive and obedient to the law, the hand isstrong, firm, inexorable, hard, and severe for those who against allreason fail to respect it and who insult the sacred institutions of thefatherland. Yes, gentlemen, this is demanded not only for the welfareof these islands, not only for the welfare of all mankind, but alsoin the name of Spain, the honor of the Spanish name, the prestige ofthe Iberian people, because before all things else Spaniards we are,and the flag of Spain," etc.He terminated the article with this farewell: "Go in peace, gallantwarrior, you who with expert hand have guided the destinies ofthis country in such calamitous times! Go in peace to breathe thebalmy breezes of Manzanares! [73] We shall remain here like faithfulsentinels to venerate your memory, to admire your wise dispositions,to avenge the infamous attempt upon your splendid gift, which wewill recover even if we have to dry up the seas! Such a preciousrelic will be for this country an eternal monument to your splendor,your presence of mind, your gallantry!"In this rather confused way he concluded the article and beforedawn sent it to the printing-office, of course with the censor'spermit. Then he went to sleep like Napoleon, after he had arrangedthe plan for the battle of Jena.But at dawn he was awakened to have the sheets of copy returned witha note from the editor saying that his Excellency had positivelyand severely forbidden any mention of the affair, and had furtherordered the denial of any versions and comments that might get abroad,discrediting them as exaggerated rumors.To Ben-Zayb this blow was the murder of a beautiful and sturdy child,born and nurtured with such great pain and fatigue. Where now hurl theCatilinarian pride, the splendid exhibition of warlike crime-avengingmaterials? And to think that within a month or two he was going toleave the Philippines, and the article could not be published in Spain,since how could he say those things about the criminals of Madrid,where other ideas prevailed, where extenuating circumstances weresought, where facts were weighed, where there were juries, and soon? Articles such as his were like certain poisonous rums that aremanufactured in Europe, good enough to be sold among the negroes,_good for negroes_, [74] with the difference that if the negroes didnot drink them they would not be destroyed, while Ben-Zayb's articles,whether the Filipinos read them or not, had their effect."If only some other crime might be committed today or tomorrow,"he mused.With the thought of that child dead before seeing the light, thosefrozen buds, and feeling his eyes fill with tears, he dressed himselfto call upon the editor. But the editor shrugged his shoulders; hisExcellency had forbidden it because if it should be divulged that sevenof the greater gods had let themselves be surprised and robbed by anobody, while they brandished knives and forks, that would endangerthe integrity of the fatherland! So he had ordered that no search bemade for the lamp or the thief, and had recommended to his successorsthat they should not run the risk of dining in any private house,without being surrounded by halberdiers and guards. As those who knewanything about the events that night in Don Timoteo's house were forthe most part military officials and government employees, it wasnot difficult to suppress the affair in public, for it concerned theintegrity of the fatherland. Before this name Ben-Zayb bowed his headheroically, thinking about Abraham, Guzman El Bueno, [75] or at least,Brutus and other heroes of antiquity.Such a sacrifice could not remain unrewarded, the gods of journalismbeing pleased with Abraham Ben-Zayb. Almost upon the hour camethe reporting angel bearing the sacrificial lamb in the shape ofan assault committed at a country-house on the Pasig, where certainfriars were spending the heated season. Here was his opportunity andBen-Zayb praised his gods."The robbers got over two thousand pesos, leaving badly wounded onefriar and two servants. The curate defended himself as well as hecould behind a chair, which was smashed in his hands.""Wait, wait!" said Ben-Zayb, taking notes. "Forty or fiftyoutlaws traitorously--revolvers, bolos, shotguns, pistols--lion atbay--chair--splinters flying--barbarously wounded--ten thousand pesos!"So great was his enthusiasm that he was not content with mere reports,but proceeded in person to the scene of the crime, composing on theroad a Homeric description of the fight. A harangue in the mouth ofthe leader? A scornful defiance on the part of the priest? All themetaphors and similes applied to his Excellency, Padre Irene, andPadre Salvi would exactly fit the wounded friar and the descriptionof the thief would serve for each of the outlaws. The imprecationcould be expanded, since he could talk of religion, of the faith,of charity, of the ringing of bells, of what the Indians owed tothe friars, he could get sentimental and melt into Castelarian [76]epigrams and lyric periods. The senoritas of the city would read thearticle and murmur, "Ben-Zayb, bold as a lion and tender as a lamb!"But when he reached the scene, to his great astonishment he learnedthat the wounded friar was no other than Padre Camorra, sentenced byhis Provincial to expiate in the pleasant country-house on the banksof the Pasig his pranks in Tiani. He had a slight scratch on his handand a bruise on his head received from flattening himself out on thefloor. The robbers numbered three or four, armed only with bolos,the sum stolen fifty pesos!"It won't do!" exclaimed Ben-Zayb. "Shut up! You don't know whatyou're talking about.""How don't I know, _punales?_""Don't be a fool--the robbers must have numbered more.""You ink-slinger--"So they had quite an altercation. What chiefly concerned Ben-Zaybwas not to throw away the article, to give importance to the affair,so that he could use the peroration.But a fearful rumor cut short their dispute. The robbers caughthad made some important revelations. One of the outlaws under_Matanglawin_ (Cabesang Tales) had made an appointment with them tojoin his band in Santa Mesa, thence to sack the conventos and housesof the wealthy. They would be guided by a Spaniard, tall and sunburnt,with white hair, who said that he was acting under the orders of theGeneral, whose great friend he was, and they had been further assuredthat the artillery and various regiments would join them, whereforethey were to entertain no fear at all. The tulisanes would be pardonedand have a third part of the booty assigned to them. The signal wasto have been a cannon-shot, but having waited for it in vain thetulisanes, thinking themselves deceived, separated, some going backto their homes, some returning to the mountains vowing vengeance onthe Spaniard, who had thus failed twice to keep his word. Then they,the robbers caught, had decided to do something on their own account,attacking the country-house that they found closest at hand, resolvingreligiously to give two-thirds of the booty to the Spaniard withwhite hair, if perchance he should call upon them for it.The description being recognized as that of Simoun, the declarationwas received as an absurdity and the robber subjected to all kindsof tortures, including the electric machine, for his impiousblasphemy. But news of the disappearance of the jeweler havingattracted the attention of the whole Escolta, and the sacks of powderand great quantities of cartridges having been discovered in hishouse, the story began to wear an appearance of truth. Mystery beganto enwrap the affair, enveloping it in clouds; there were whisperedconversations, coughs, suspicious looks, suggestive comments, andtrite second-hand remarks. Those who were on the inside were unableto get over their astonishment, they put on long faces, turned pale,and but little was wanting for many persons to lose their minds inrealizing certain things that had before passed unnoticed."We've had a narrow escape! Who would have said--"In the afternoon Ben-Zayb, his pockets filled with revolvers andcartridges, went to see Don Custodio, whom he found hard at work overa project against American jewelers. In a hushed voice he whisperedbetween the palms of his hands into the journalist's ear mysteriouswords."Really?" questioned Ben-Zayb, slapping his hand on his pocket andpaling visibly."Wherever he may be found--" The sentence was completed with anexpressive pantomime. Don Custodio raised both arms to the height ofhis face, with the right more bent than the left, turned the palmsof his hands toward the floor, closed one eye, and made two movementsin advance. "Ssh! Ssh!" he hissed."And the diamonds?" inquired Ben-Zayb."If they find him--" He went through another pantomime with thefingers of his right hand, spreading them out and clenching themtogether like the closing of a fan, clutching out with them somewhatin the manner of the wings of a wind-mill sweeping imaginary objectstoward itself with practised skill. Ben-Zayb responded with anotherpantomime, opening his eyes wide, arching his eyebrows and sucking inhis breath eagerly as though nutritious air had just been discovered."Sssh!"CHAPTER XXXVIITHE MYSTERY    Todo se sabeNotwithstanding so many precautions, rumors reached the public,even though quite changed and mutilated. On the following nightthey were the theme of comment in the house of Orenda, a rich jewelmerchant in the industrious district of Santa Cruz, and the numerousfriends of the family gave attention to nothing else. They were notindulging in cards, or playing the piano, while little Tinay, theyoungest of the girls, became bored playing _chongka_ by herself,without being able to understand the interest awakened by assaults,conspiracies, and sacks of powder, when there were in the seven holesso many beautiful cowries that seemed to be winking at her in unisonand smiled with their tiny mouths half-opened, begging to be carriedup to the _home_. Even Isagani, who, when he came, always used toplay with her and allow himself to be beautifully cheated, did notcome at her call, for Isagani was gloomily and silently listening tosomething Chichoy the silversmith was relating. Momoy, the betrothedof Sensia, the eldest of the daughters--a pretty and vivacious girl,rather given to joking--had left the window where he was accustomedto spend his evenings in amorous discourse, and this action seemed tobe very annoying to the lory whose cage hung from the eaves there,the lory endeared to the house from its ability to greet everybodyin the morning with marvelous phrases of love. Capitana Loleng,the energetic and intelligent Capitana Loleng, had her account-bookopen before her, but she neither read nor wrote in it, nor was herattention fixed on the trays of loose pearls, nor on the diamonds--shehad completely forgotten herself and was all ears. Her husband himself,the great Capitan Toringoy,--a transformation of the name Domingo,--thehappiest man in the district, without other occupation than to dresswell, eat, loaf, and gossip, while his whole family worked and toiled,had not gone to join his coterie, but was listening between fear andemotion to the hair-raising news of the lank Chichoy.Nor was reason for all this lacking. Chichoy had gone to deliver somework for Don Timoteo Pelaez, a pair of earrings for the bride, at thevery time when they were tearing down the kiosk that on the previousnight had served as a dining-room for the foremost officials. HereChichoy turned pale and his hair stood on end."_Naku_!" he exclaimed, "sacks and sacks of powder, sacks of powderunder the floor, in the roof, under the table, under the chairs,everywhere! It's lucky none of the workmen were smoking.""Who put those sacks of powder there?" asked Capitana Loleng, who wasbrave and did not turn pale, as did the enamored Momoy. But Momoy hadattended the wedding, so his posthumous emotion can be appreciated:he had been near the kiosk."That's what no one can explain," replied Chichoy. "Who would have anyinterest in breaking up the fiesta? There couldn't have been more thanone, as the celebrated lawyer Senor Pasta who was there on a visitdeclared--either an enemy of Don Timoteo's or a rival of Juanito's."The Orenda girls turned instinctively toward Isagani, who smiledsilently."Hide yourself," Capitana Loleng advised him. "They may accuseyou. Hide!"Again Isagani smiled but said nothing."Don Timoteo," continued Chichoy, "did not know to whom to attributethe deed. He himself superintended the work, he and his friend Simoun,and nobody else. The house was thrown into an uproar, the lieutenantof the guard came, and after enjoining secrecy upon everybody, theysent me away. But--""But--but--" stammered the trembling Momoy."_Naku!_" ejaculated Sensia, gazing at her fiance and tremblingsympathetically to remember that he had been at the fiesta. "Thisyoung man--If the house had blown up--" She stared at her sweetheartpassionately and admired his courage."If it had blown up--""No one in the whole of Calle Anloague would have been left alive,"concluded Capitan Toringoy, feigning valor and indifference in thepresence of his family."I left in consternation," resumed Chichoy, "thinking about how, if amere spark, a cigarette had fallen, if a lamp had been overturned, atthe present moment we should have neither a General, nor an Archbishop,nor any one, not even a government clerk! All who were at the fiestalast night--annihilated!""_Virgen Santisima!_ This young man--""_'Susmariosep!_" exclaimed Capitana Loleng. "All our debtors werethere, _'Susmariosep!_ And we have a house near there! Who could ithave been?""Now you may know about it," added Chichoy in a whisper, "but youmust keep it a secret. This afternoon I met a friend, a clerk in anoffice, and in talking about the affair, he gave me the clue to themystery--he had it from some government employees. Who do you supposeput the sacks of powder there?"Many shrugged their shoulders, while Capitan Toringoy merely lookedaskance at Isagani."The friars?""Quiroga the Chinaman?""Some student?""Makaraig?"Capitan Toringoy coughed and glanced at Isagani, while Chichoy shookhis head and smiled."The jeweler Simoun.""Simoun!!"The profound silence of amazement followed these words. Simoun, theevil genius of the Captain-General, the rich trader to whose housethey had gone to buy unset gems, Simoun, who had received the Orendagirls with great courtesy and had paid them fine compliments! Forthe very reason that the story seemed absurd it was believed. "_Credoquia absurdum,_" said St. Augustine."But wasn't Simoun at the fiesta last night?" asked Sensia."Yes," said Momoy. "But now I remember! He left the house just as wewere sitting down to the dinner. He went to get his wedding-gift.""But wasn't he a friend of the General's? Wasn't he a partner ofDon Timoteo's?""Yes, he made himself a partner in order to strike the blow and killall the Spaniards.""Aha!" cried Sensia. "Now I understand!""What?""You didn't want to believe Aunt Tentay. Simoun is the devil and hehas bought up the souls of all the Spaniards. Aunt Tentay said so!"Capitana Loleng crossed herself and looked uneasily toward the jewels,fearing to see them turn into live coals, while Capitan Toringoy tookoff the ring which had come from Simoun."Simoun has disappeared without leaving any traces," addedChichoy. "The Civil Guard is searching for him.""Yes," observed Sensia, crossing herself, "searching for the devil."Now many things were explained: Simoun's fabulous wealth and thepeculiar smell in his house, the smell of sulphur. Binday, anotherof the daughters, a frank and lovely girl, remembered having seenblue flames in the jeweler's house one afternoon when she and hermother had gone there to buy jewels. Isagani listened attentively,but said nothing."So, last night--" ventured Momoy."Last night?" echoed Sensia, between curiosity and fear.Momoy hesitated, but the face Sensia put on banished his fear. "Lastnight, while we were eating, there was a disturbance, the light inthe General's dining-room went out. They say that some unknown personstole the lamp that was presented by Simoun.""A thief? One of the Black Hand?"Isagani arose to walk back and forth."Didn't they catch him?""He jumped into the river before anybody recognized him. Some say hewas a Spaniard, some a Chinaman, and others an Indian.""It's believed that with the lamp," added Chichoy, "he was going toset fire to the house, then the powder--"Momoy again shuddered but noticing that Sensia was watching him triedto control himself. "What a pity!" he exclaimed with an effort. "Howwickedly the thief acted. Everybody would have been killed."Sensia stared at him in fright, the women crossed themselves, whileCapitan Toringoy, who was afraid of politics, made a move to go away.Momoy turned to Isagani, who observed with an enigmatic smile: "It'salways wicked to take what doesn't belong to you. If that thief hadknown what it was all about and had been able to reflect, surely hewouldn't have done as he did."Then, after a pause, he added, "For nothing in the world would I wantto be in his place!"So they continued their comments and conjectures until an hour later,when Isagani bade the family farewell, to return forever to hisuncle's side.CHAPTER XXXVIIIFATALITY_Matanglawin_ was the terror of Luzon. His band had as lief appearin one province where it was least expected as make a descent uponanother that was preparing to resist it. It burned a sugar-mill inBatangas and destroyed the crops, on the following day it murdered theJustice of the Peace of Tiani, and on the next took possession of thetown of Cavite, carrying off the arms from the town hall. The centralprovinces, from Tayabas to Pangasinan, suffered from his depredations,and his bloody name extended from Albay in the south to Kagayan inthe north. The towns, disarmed through mistrust on the part of aweak government, fell easy prey into his hands--at his approach thefields were abandoned by the farmers, the herds were scattered, whilea trail of blood and fire marked his passage. _Matanglawin_ laughed atthe severe measures ordered by the government against the tulisanes,since from them only the people in the outlying villages suffered,being captured and maltreated if they resisted the band, and if theymade peace with it being flogged and deported by the government,provided they completed the journey and did not meet with a fatalaccident on the way. Thanks to these terrible alternatives many ofthe country folk decided to enlist under his command.As a result of this reign of terror, trade among the towns, alreadylanguishing, died out completely. The rich dared not travel, andthe poor feared to be arrested by the Civil Guard, which, beingunder obligation to pursue the tulisanes, often seized the firstperson encountered and subjected him to unspeakable tortures. In itsimpotence, the government put on a show of energy toward the personswhom it suspected, in order that by force of cruelty the people shouldnot realize its weakness--the fear that prompted such measures.A string of these hapless suspects, some six or seven, with theirarms tied behind them, bound together like a bunch of human meat,was one afternoon marching through the excessive heat along a roadthat skirted a mountain, escorted by ten or twelve guards armed withrifles. Their bayonets gleamed in the sun, the barrels of their riflesbecame hot, and even the sage-leaves in their helmets scarcely servedto temper the effect of the deadly May sun.Deprived of the use of their arms and pressed close against oneanother to save rope, the prisoners moved along almost uncovered andunshod, he being the best off who had a handkerchief twisted aroundhis head. Panting, suffering, covered with dust which perspirationconverted into mud, they felt their brains melting, they saw lightsdancing before them, red spots floating in the air. Exhaustion anddejection were pictured in their faces, desperation, wrath, somethingindescribable, the look of one who dies cursing, of a man who isweary of life, who hates himself, who blasphemes against God. Thestrongest lowered their heads to rub their faces against the duskybacks of those in front of them and thus wipe away the sweat thatwas blinding them. Many were limping, but if any one of them happenedto fall and thus delay the march he would hear a curse as a soldierran up brandishing a branch torn from a tree and forced him to riseby striking about in all directions. The string then started to run,dragging, rolling in the dust, the fallen one, who howled and beggedto be killed; but perchance he succeeded in getting on his feet andthen went along crying like a child and cursing the hour he was born.The human cluster halted at times while the guards drank, and thenthe prisoners continued on their way with parched mouths, darkenedbrains, and hearts full of curses. Thirst was for these wretches theleast of their troubles."Move on, you sons of ----!" cried a soldier, again refreshed,hurling the insult common among the lower classes of Filipinos.The branch whistled and fell on any shoulder whatsoever, the nearestone, or at times upon a face to leave a welt at first white, then red,and later dirty with the dust of the road."Move on, you cowards!" at times a voice yelled in Spanish, deepeningits tone."Cowards!" repeated the mountain echoes.Then the cowards quickened their pace under a sky of red-hot iron,over a burning road, lashed by the knotty branch which was worninto shreds on their livid skins. A Siberian winter would perhaps betenderer than the May sun of the Philippines.Yet, among the soldiers there was one who looked with disapprovingeyes upon so much wanton cruelty, as he marched along silentlywith his brows knit in disgust. At length, seeing that the guard,not satisfied with the branch, was kicking the prisoners that fell,he could no longer restrain himself but cried out impatiently, "Here,Mautang, let them alone!"Mautang turned toward him in surprise. "What's it to you, Carolino?" heasked."To me, nothing, but it hurts me," replied Carolino. "They're menlike ourselves.""It's plain that you're new to the business!" retorted Mautang witha compassionate smile. "How did you treat the prisoners in the war?""With more consideration, surely!" answered Carolino.Mautang remained silent for a moment and then, apparently havingdiscovered the reason, calmly rejoined, "Ah, it's because they areenemies and fight us, while these--these are our own countrymen."Then drawing nearer to Carolino he whispered, "How stupid youare! They're treated so in order that they may attempt to resist orto escape, and then--bang!"Carolino made no reply.One of the prisoners then begged that they let him stop for a moment."This is a dangerous place," answered the corporal, gazing uneasilytoward the mountain. "Move on!""Move on!" echoed Mautang and his lash whistled.The prisoner twisted himself around to stare at him with reproachfuleyes. "You are more cruel than the Spaniard himself," he said.Mautang replied with more blows, when suddenly a bullet whistled,followed by a loud report. Mautang dropped his rifle, uttered anoath, and clutching at his breast with both hands fell spinning intoa heap. The prisoner saw him writhing in the dust with blood spurtingfrom his mouth."Halt!" called the corporal, suddenly turning pale.The soldiers stopped and stared about them. A wisp of smoke rose froma thicket on the height above. Another bullet sang to its accompanyingreport and the corporal, wounded in the thigh, doubled over vomitingcurses. The column was attacked by men hidden among the rocks above.Sullen with rage the corporal motioned toward the string of prisonersand laconically ordered, "Fire!"The wretches fell upon their knees, filled with consternation. Asthey could not lift their hands, they begged for mercy by kissingthe dust or bowing their heads--one talked of his children, anotherof his mother who would be left unprotected, one promised money,another called upon God--but the muzzles were quickly lowered and ahideous volley silenced them all.Then began the sharpshooting against those who were behind the rocksabove, over which a light cloud of smoke began to hover. To judge fromthe scarcity of their shots, the invisible enemies could not havemore than three rifles. As they advanced firing, the guards soughtcover behind tree-trunks or crouched down as they attempted to scalethe height. Splintered rocks leaped up, broken twigs fell from trees,patches of earth were torn up, and the first guard who attempted theascent rolled back with a bullet through his shoulder.The hidden enemy had the advantage of position, but the valiantguards, who did not know how to flee, were on the point of retiring,for they had paused, unwilling to advance; that fight against theinvisible unnerved them. Smoke and rocks alone could be seen--not avoice was heard, not a shadow appeared; they seemed to be fightingwith the mountain."Shoot, Carolino! What are you aiming at?" called the corporal.At that instant a man appeared upon a rock, making signs with hisrifle."Shoot him!" ordered the corporal with a foul oath.Three guards obeyed the order, but the man continued standing there,calling out at the top of his voice something unintelligible.Carolino paused, thinking that he recognized something familiar aboutthat figure, which stood out plainly in the sunlight. But the corporalthreatened to tie him up if he did not fire, so Carolino took aim andthe report of his rifle was heard. The man on the rock spun aroundand disappeared with a cry that left Carolino horror-stricken.Then followed a rustling in the bushes, indicating that those withinwere scattering in all directions, so the soldiers boldly advanced,now that there was no more resistance. Another man appeared upon therock, waving a spear, and they fired at him. He sank down slowly,catching at the branch of a tree, but with another volley fell facedownwards on the rock.The guards climbed on nimbly, with bayonets fixed ready for ahand-to-hand fight. Carolino alone moved forward reluctantly, witha wandering, gloomy look, the cry of the man struck by his bulletstill ringing in his ears. The first to reach the spot found an oldman dying, stretched out on the rock. He plunged his bayonet intothe body, but the old man did not even wink, his eyes being fixedon Carolino with an indescribable gaze, while with his bony hand hepointed to something behind the rock.The soldiers turned to see Caroline frightfully pale, his mouthhanging open, with a look in which glimmered the last spark of reason,for Carolino, who was no other than Tano, Cabesang Tales' son, andwho had just returned from the Carolines, recognized in the dyingman his grandfather, Tandang Selo. No longer able to speak, the oldman's dying eyes uttered a whole poem of grief--and then a corpse,he still continued to point to something behind the rock.CHAPTER XXXIXCONCLUSIONIn his solitary retreat on the shore of the sea, whose mobile surfacewas visible through the open, windows, extending outward until itmingled with the horizon, Padre Florentino was relieving the monotonyby playing on his harmonium sad and melancholy tunes, to which thesonorous roar of the surf and the sighing of the treetops of theneighboring wood served as accompaniments. Notes long, full, mournfulas a prayer, yet still vigorous, escaped from the old instrument. PadreFlorentino, who was an accomplished musician, was improvising, and,as he was alone, gave free rein to the sadness in his heart.For the truth was that the old man was very sad. His good friend, DonTiburcio de Espadana, had just left him, fleeing from the persecutionof his wife. That morning he had received a note from the lieutenantof the Civil Guard, which ran thus:    MY DEAR CHAPLAIN,--I have just received from the commandant    a telegram that says, "Spaniard hidden house Padre Florentino    capture forward alive dead." As the telegram is quite explicit,    warn your friend not to be there when I come to arrest him    at eight tonight.    Affectionately,    PEREZ    Burn this note."T-that V-victorina!" Don Tiburcio had stammered. "S-she's c-capableof having me s-shot!"Padre Florentino was unable to reassure him. Vainly he pointedout to him that the word _cojera_ should have read _cogera_,[77] and that the hidden Spaniard could not be Don  Tiburcio,but the jeweler Simoun, who two days before had arrived, woundedand a fugitive, begging for shelter. But Don Tiburcio would not beconvinced--_cojera_ was his own lameness, his personal description,and it was an intrigue of Victorina's to get him back alive or dead,as Isagani had written from Manila. So the poor Ulysses had left thepriest's house to conceal himself in the hut of a woodcutter.No doubt was entertained by Padre Florentino that the Spaniard wantedwas the jeweler Simoun, who had arrived mysteriously, himself carryingthe jewel-chest, bleeding, morose, and exhausted. With the free andcordial Filipino hospitality, the priest had taken him in, withoutasking indiscreet questions, and as news of the events in Manila hadnot yet reached his ears he was unable to understand the situationclearly. The only conjecture that occurred to him was that the General,the jeweler's friend and protector, being gone, probably his enemies,the victims of wrong and abuse, were now rising and calling forvengeance, and that the acting Governor was pursuing him to make himdisgorge the wealth he had accumulated--hence his flight. But whencecame his wounds? Had he tried to commit suicide? Were they the resultof personal revenge? Or were they merely caused by an accident, asSimoun claimed? Had they been received in escaping from the forcethat was pursuing him?This last conjecture was the one that seemed to have the greatestappearance of probability, being further strengthened by the telegramreceived and Simoun's decided unwillingness from the start to betreated by the doctor from the capital. The jeweler submitted onlyto the ministrations of Don Tiburcio, and even to them with markeddistrust. In this situation Padre Florentino was asking himself whatline of conduct he should pursue when the Civil Guard came to arrestSimoun. His condition would not permit his removal, much less a longjourney--but the telegram said alive or dead.Padre Florentine ceased playing and approached the window to gazeout at the sea, whose desolate surface was without a ship, withouta sail--it gave him no suggestion. A solitary islet outlinedin the distance spoke only of solitude and made the space morelonely. Infinity is at times despairingly mute.The old man was trying to analyze the sad and ironical smile withwhich Simoun had received the news that he was to be arrested. What didthat smile mean? And that other smile, still sadder and more ironical,with which he received the news that they would not come before eightat night? What did all this mystery signify? Why did Simoun refuseto hide? There came into his mind the celebrated saying of St. JohnChrysostom when he was defending the eunuch Eutropius: "Never was abetter time than this to say--Vanity of vanities and all is vanity!"Yes, that Simoun, so rich, so powerful, so feared a week ago, andnow more unfortunate than Eutropius, was seeking refuge, not at thealtars of a church, but in the miserable house of a poor native priest,hidden in the forest, on the solitary seashore! Vanity of vanitiesand all is vanity! That man would within a few hours be a prisoner,dragged from the bed where he lay, without respect for his condition,without consideration for his wounds--dead or alive his enemiesdemanded him! How could he save him? Where could he find the movingaccents of the bishop of Constantinople? What weight would his weakwords have, the words of a native priest, whose own humiliation thissame Simoun had in his better days seemed to applaud and encourage?But Padre Florentine no longer recalled the indifferent reception thattwo months before the jeweler had accorded to him when he had triedto interest him in favor of Isagani, then a prisoner on account ofhis imprudent chivalry; he forgot the activity Simoun had displayed inurging Paulita's marriage, which had plunged Isagani into the fearfulmisanthropy that was worrying his uncle. He forgot all these thingsand thought only of the sick man's plight and his own obligations asa host, until his senses reeled. Where must he hide him to avoid hisfalling into the clutches of the authorities? But the person chieflyconcerned was not worrying, he was smiling.While he was pondering over these things, the old man was approached bya servant who said that the sick man wished to speak with him, so hewent into the next room, a clean and well-ventilated apartment with afloor of wide boards smoothed and polished, and simply furnished withbig, heavy armchairs of ancient design, without varnish or paint. Atone end there was a large kamagon bed with its four posts to supportthe canopy, and beside it a table covered with bottles, lint, andbandages. A praying-desk at the feet of a Christ and a scanty libraryled to the suspicion that it was the priest's own bedroom, given up tohis guest according to the Filipino custom of offering to the strangerthe best table, the best room, and the best bed in the house. Uponseeing the windows opened wide to admit freely the healthful sea-breezeand the echoes of its eternal lament, no one in the Philippines wouldhave said that a sick person was to be found there, since it is thecustom to close all the windows and stop up all the cracks just assoon as any one catches a cold or gets an insignificant headache.Padre Florentine looked toward the bed and was astonished tosee that the sick man's face had lost its tranquil and ironicalexpression. Hidden grief seemed to knit his brows, anxiety was depictedin his looks, his lips were curled in a smile of pain."Are you suffering, Senor Simoun?" asked the priest solicitously,going to his side."Some! But in a little while I shall cease to suffer," he repliedwith a shake of his head.Padre Florentine clasped his hands in fright, suspecting that heunderstood the terrible truth. "My God, what have you done? What haveyou taken?" He reached toward the bottles."It's useless now! There's no remedy at all!" answered Simoun with apained smile. "What did you expect me to do? Before the clock strikeseight--alive or dead--dead, yes, but alive, no!""My God, what have you done?""Be calm!" urged the sick man with a wave of his hand. "What's doneis done. I must not fall into anybody's hands--my secret wouldbe torn from me. Don't get excited, don't lose your head, it'suseless! Listen--the night is coming on and there's no time to belost. I must tell you my secret, and intrust to you my last request,I must lay my life open before you. At the supreme moment I want tolighten myself of a load, I want to clear up a doubt of mine. Youwho believe so firmly in God--I want you to tell me if there is a God!""But an antidote, Senor Simoun! I have ether, chloroform--"The priest began to search for a flask, until Simoun cried impatiently,"Useless, it's useless! Don't waste time! I'll go away with my secret!"The bewildered priest fell down at his desk and prayed at the feetof the Christ, hiding his face in his hands. Then he arose seriousand grave, as if he had received from his God all the force, allthe dignity, all the authority of the Judge of consciences. Movinga chair to the head of the bed he prepared to listen.At the first words Simoun murmured, when he told his real name,the old priest started back and gazed at him in terror, whereatthe sick man smiled bitterly. Taken by surprise, the priest was notmaster of himself, but he soon recovered, and covering his face witha handkerchief again bent over to listen.Simoun related his sorrowful story: how, thirteen years before, hehad returned from Europe filled with hopes and smiling illusions,having come back to marry a girl whom he loved, disposed to do goodand forgive all who had wronged him, just so they would let him livein peace. But it was not so. A mysterious hand involved him in theconfusion of an uprising planned by his enemies. Name, fortune, love,future, liberty, all were lost, and he escaped only through the heroismof a friend. Then he swore vengeance. With the wealth of his family,which had been buried in a wood, he had fled, had gone to foreignlands and engaged in trade. He took part in the war in Cuba, aidingfirst one side and then another, but always profiting. There he madethe acquaintance of the General, then a major, whose good-will he wonfirst by loans of money, and afterwards he made a friend of him bythe knowledge of criminal secrets. With his money he had been able tosecure the General's appointment and, once in the Philippines, he hadused him as a blind tool and incited him to all kinds of injustice,availing himself of his insatiable lust for gold.The confession was long and tedious, but during the whole of it theconfessor made no further sign of surprise and rarely interrupted thesick man. It was night when Padre Florentino, wiping the perspirationfrom his face, arose and began to meditate. Mysterious darknessflooded the room, so that the moonbeams entering through the windowfilled it with vague lights and vaporous reflections.Into the midst of the silence the priest's voice broke sad anddeliberate, but consoling: "God will forgive you, Senor--Simoun,"he said. "He knows that we are fallible, He has seen that you havesuffered, and in ordaining that the chastisement for your faultsshould come as death from the very ones you have instigated to crime,we can see His infinite mercy. He has frustrated your plans one byone, the best conceived, first by the death of Maria Clara, then bya lack of preparation, then in some mysterious way. Let us bow toHis will and render Him thanks!""According to you, then," feebly responded the sick man, "His willis that these islands--""Should continue in the condition in which they suffer?" finishedthe priest, seeing that the other hesitated. "I don't know, sir,I can't read the thought of the Inscrutable. I know that He has notabandoned those peoples who in their supreme moments have trusted inHim and made Him the Judge of their cause, I know that His arm hasnever failed when, justice long trampled upon and every recourse gone,the oppressed have taken up the sword to fight for home and wife andchildren, for their inalienable rights, which, as the German poet says,shine ever there above, unextinguished and inextinguishable, likethe eternal stars themselves. No, God is justice, He cannot abandonHis cause, the cause of liberty, without which no justice is possible.""Why then has He denied me His aid?" asked the sick man in a voicecharged with bitter complaint."Because you chose means that He could not sanction," was thesevere reply. "The glory of saving a country is not for him who hascontributed to its ruin. You have believed that what crime and iniquityhave defiled and deformed, another crime and another iniquity canpurify and redeem. Wrong! Hate never produces anything but monstersand crime criminals! Love alone realizes wonderful works, virtuealone can save! No, if our country has ever to be free, it will notbe through vice and crime, it will not be so by corrupting its sons,deceiving some and bribing others, no! Redemption presupposes virtue,virtue sacrifice, and sacrifice love!""Well, I accept your explanation," rejoined the sick man, aftera pause. "I have been mistaken, but, because I have been mistaken,will that God deny liberty to a people and yet save many who are muchworse criminals than I am? What is my mistake compared to the crimesof our rulers? Why has that God to give more heed to my iniquity thanto the cries of so many innocents? Why has He not stricken me downand then made the people triumph? Why does He let so many worthy andjust ones suffer and look complacently upon their tortures?""The just and the worthy must suffer in order that their ideas may beknown and extended! You must shake or shatter the vase to spread itsperfume, you must smite the rock to get the spark! There is somethingprovidential in the persecutions of tyrants, Senor Simoun!""I knew it," murmured the sick man, "and therefore I encouragedthe tyranny.""Yes, my friend, but more corrupt influences than anything elsewere spread. You fostered the social rottenness without sowing anidea. From this fermentation of vices loathing alone could spring,and if anything were born overnight it would be at best a mushroom,for mushrooms only can spring spontaneously from filth. True itis that the vices of the government are fatal to it, they causeits death, but they kill also the society in whose bosom they aredeveloped. An immoral government presupposes a demoralized people,a conscienceless administration, greedy and servile citizens in thesettled parts, outlaws and brigands in the mountains. Like master,like slave! Like government, like country!"A brief pause ensued, broken at length by the sick man's voice. "Then,what can be done?""Suffer and work!""Suffer--work!" echoed the sick man bitterly. "Ah, it's easy to saythat, when you are not suffering, when the work is rewarded. If yourGod demands such great sacrifices from man, man who can scarcelycount upon the present and doubts the future, if you had seen whatI have, the miserable, the wretched, suffering unspeakable torturesfor crimes they have not committed, murdered to cover up the faultsand incapacity of others, poor fathers of families torn from theirhomes to work to no purpose upon highways that are destroyed each dayand seem only to serve for sinking families into want. Ah, to suffer,to work, is the will of God! Convince them that their murder is theirsalvation, that their work is the prosperity of the home! To suffer,to work! What God is that?""A very just God, Senor Simoun," replied the priest. "A God whochastises our lack of faith, our vices, the little esteem in whichwe hold dignity and the civic virtues. We tolerate vice, we makeourselves its accomplices, at times we applaud it, and it is just,very just that we suffer the consequences, that our children sufferthem. It is the God of liberty, Senor Simoun, who obliges us tolove it, by making the yoke heavy for us--a God of mercy, of equity,who while He chastises us, betters us and only grants prosperity tohim who has merited it through his efforts. The school of sufferingtempers, the arena of combat strengthens the soul."I do not mean to say that our liberty will be secured at the sword'spoint, for the sword plays but little part in modern affairs, but thatwe must secure it by making ourselves worthy of it, by exalting theintelligence and the dignity of the individual, by loving justice,right, and greatness, even to the extent of dying for them,--and whena people reaches that height God will provide a weapon, the idolswill be shattered, the tyranny will crumble like a house of cardsand liberty will shine out like the first dawn."Our ills we owe to ourselves alone, so let us blame no one. If Spainshould see that we were less complaisant with tyranny and more disposedto struggle and suffer for our rights, Spain would be the first togrant us liberty, because when the fruit of the womb reaches maturitywoe unto the mother who would stifle it! So, while the Filipino peoplehas not sufficient energy to proclaim, with head erect and bosom bared,its rights to social life, and to guarantee it with its sacrifices,with its own blood; while we see our countrymen in private life ashamedwithin themselves, hear the voice of conscience roar in rebellion andprotest, yet in public life keep silence or even echo the words ofhim who abuses them in order to mock the abused; while we see themwrap themselves up in their egotism and with a forced smile praisethe most iniquitous actions, begging with their eyes a portion ofthe booty--why grant them liberty? With Spain or without Spain theywould always be the same, and perhaps worse! Why independence, if theslaves of today will be the tyrants of tomorrow? And that they willbe such is not to be doubted, for he who submits to tyranny loves it."Senor Simoun, when our people is unprepared, when it enters the fightthrough fraud and force, without a clear understanding of what it isdoing, the wisest attempts will fail, and better that they do fail,since why commit the wife to the husband if he does not sufficientlylove her, if he is not ready to die for her?"Padre Florentino felt the sick man catch and press his hand, so hebecame silent, hoping that the other might speak, but he merely felta stronger pressure of the hand, heard a sigh, and then profoundsilence reigned in the room. Only the sea, whose waves were rippledby the night breeze, as though awaking from the heat of the day,sent its hoarse roar, its eternal chant, as it rolled against thejagged rocks. The moon, now free from the sun's rivalry, peacefullycommanded the sky, and the trees of the forest bent down toward oneanother, telling their ancient legends in mysterious murmurs borneon the wings of the wind.The sick man said nothing, so Padre Florentino, deeply thoughtful,murmured: "Where are the youth who will consecrate their golden hours,their illusions, and their enthusiasm to the welfare of their nativeland? Where are the youth who will generously pour out their blood towash away so much shame, so much crime, so much abomination? Pure andspotless must the victim be that the sacrifice may be acceptable! Whereare you, youth, who will embody in yourselves the vigor of life thathas left our veins, the purity of ideas that has been contaminatedin our brains, the fire of enthusiasm that has been quenched in ourhearts? We await you, O youth! Come, for we await you!"Feeling his eyes moisten he withdrew his hand from that of the sickman, arose, and went to the window to gaze out upon the wide surfaceof the sea. He was drawn from his meditation by gentle raps at thedoor. It was the servant asking if he should bring a light.When the priest returned to the sick man and looked at him in thelight of the lamp, motionless, his eyes closed, the hand that hadpressed his lying open and extended along the edge of the bed,he thought for a moment that he was sleeping, but noticing that hewas not breathing touched him gently, and then realized that he wasdead. His body had already commenced to turn cold. The priest fellupon his knees and prayed.When he arose and contemplated the corpse, in whose features weredepicted the deepest grief, the tragedy of a whole wasted life whichhe was carrying over there beyond death, the old man shuddered andmurmured, "God have mercy on those who turned him from the straightpath!"While the servants summoned by him fell upon their knees and prayedfor the dead man, curious and bewildered as they gazed toward thebed, reciting requiem after requiem, Padre Florentino took from acabinet the celebrated steel chest that contained Simoun's fabulouswealth. He hesitated for a moment, then resolutely descended thestairs and made his way to the cliff where Isagani was accustomed tosit and gaze into the depths of the sea.Padre Florentino looked down at his feet. There below he saw the darkbillows of the Pacific beating into the hollows of the cliff, producingsonorous thunder, at the same time that, smitten by the moonbeams,the waves and foam glittered like sparks of fire, like handfuls ofdiamonds hurled into the air by some jinnee of the abyss. He gazedabout him. He was alone. The solitary coast was lost in the distanceamid the dim cloud that the moonbeams played through, until it mingledwith the horizon. The forest murmured unintelligible sounds.Then the old man, with an effort of his herculean arms, hurled thechest into space, throwing it toward the sea. It whirled over and overseveral times and descended rapidly in a slight curve, reflecting themoonlight on its polished surface. The old man saw the drops of waterfly and heard a loud splash as the abyss closed over and swallowed upthe treasure. He waited for a few moments to see if the depths wouldrestore anything, but the wave rolled on as mysteriously as before,without adding a fold to its rippling surface, as though into theimmensity of the sea a pebble only had been dropped."May Nature guard you in her deep abysses among the pearls and coralsof her eternal seas," then said the priest, solemnly extending hishands. "When for some holy and sublime purpose man may need you, Godwill in his wisdom draw you from the bosom of the waves. Meanwhile,there you will not work woe, you will not distort justice, you willnot foment avarice!"GLOSSARY_aba:_ A Tagalog exclamation of wonder, surprise, etc., often usedto introduce or emphasize a contradictory statement._alcalde:_ Governor of a province or district, with both executiveand judicial authority._Ayuntamiento:_ A city corporation or council, and by extensionthe building in which it has its offices; specifically, in Manila,the capitol._balete:_ The Philippine banyan, a tree sacred in Malay folk-lore._banka:_ A dugout canoe with bamboo supports or outriggers._batalan:_ The platform of split bamboo attached to a _nipa_ house._batikulin:_ A variety of easily-turned wood, used in carving._bibinka:_ A sweetmeat made of sugar or molasses and rice-flour,commonly sold in the small shops._buyera:_ A woman who prepares and sells the _buyo_._buyo:_ The masticatory prepared by wrapping a piece of areca-nutwith a little shell-lime in a betel-leaf--the _pan_ of British India._cabesang:_ Title of a _cabeza de barangay;_ given by courtesy tohis wife also._cabeza de barangay:_ Headman and tax-collector for a group of aboutfifty families, for whose "tribute" he was personally responsible._calesa:_ A two-wheeled chaise with folding top._calle:_ Street (Spanish)._camisa:_ 1.

Gathered in small bands withsuch arms as they could secure, they sustained themselves by highwayrobbery and the levying of black-mail from the country folk.NOTES[1] The Spanish designation for the Christianized Malay of thePhilippines was _indio_ (Indian), a term used rather contemptuously,the name _filipino_ being generally applied in a restricted sense tothe children of Spaniards born in the Islands.--Tr.[2] Now generally known as the Mariquina.--Tr.[3] This bridge, constructed in Lukban under the supervision ofa Franciscan friar, was jocularly referred to as the _Puente deCapricho,_ being apparently an ignorant blunder in the right direction,since it was declared in an official report made by Spanish engineersin 1852 to conform to no known principle of scientific construction,and yet proved to be strong and durable.--Tr.[4] Don Custodio's gesture indicates money.--Tr.[5] Duck eggs, that are allowed to advance well into the ducklingstage, then boiled and eaten. The senora is sneering at a customamong some of her own people.--Tr.[6] The Jesuit College in Manila, established in 1859.--Tr.[7] Natives of Spain; to distinguish them from the Filipinos, _i.e.,_descendants of Spaniards born in the Philippines. See Glossary:"Indian."--Tr.[8] It was a common saying among the old Filipinos that the Spaniards(white men) were fire (activity), while they themselves were water(passivity).--Tr.[9] The "liberal" demonstrations in Manila, and the mutiny in theCavite Arsenal, resulting in the garroting of the three nativepriests to whom this work was dedicated: the first of a series offatal mistakes, culminating in the execution of the author, that costSpain the loyalty of the Filipinos.--Tr.[10] Archbishop of Manila from 1767 to 1787.--Tr.[11] "Between this island (Talim) and Halahala point extends a straita mile wide and a league long, which the Indians call 'Kinabutasan,'a name that in their language means 'place that was cleft open';from which it is inferred that in other times the island was joinedto the mainland and was separated from it by some severe earthquake,thus leaving this strait: of this there is an old tradition amongthe Indians."--Fray Martinez de Zuniga's _Estadismo_ (1803).[12] The reference is to the novel _Noli Me Tangere_ (_The SocialCancer_), the author's first work, of which, the present is in a waya continuation.--Tr.[13] This legend is still current among the Tagalogs. It circulatesin various forms, the commonest being that the king was so confinedfor defying the lightning; and it takes no great stretch of theimagination to fancy in this idea a reference to the firearms usedby the Spanish conquerors. Quite recently (January 1909), when thenearly extinct volcano of Banahao shook itself and scattered a fewtons of mud over the surrounding landscape, the people thereaboutrecalled this old legend, saying that it was their King Bernardomaking another effort to get that right foot loose.--Tr.[14] The reference is to _Noli Me Tangere,_ in which Sinang appears.[15] The Dominican school of secondary instruction in Manila.--Tr.[16] "The studies of secondary instruction given in Santo Tomas,in the college of San Juan de Letran, and of San Jose, and in theprivate schools, had the defects inherent in the plan of instructionwhich the friars developed in the Philippines. It suited their plansthat scientific and literary knowledge should not become general norvery extensive, for which reason they took but little interest in thestudy of those subjects or in the quality of the instruction. Theireducational establishments were places of luxury for the children ofwealthy and well-to-do families rather than establishments in whichto perfect and develop the minds of the Filipino youth. It is truethey were careful to give them a religious education, tending to makethem respect the omnipotent power (_sic_) of the monastic corporations."The intellectual powers were made dormant by devoting a greaterpart of the time to the study of Latin, to which they attached anextraordinary importance, for the purpose of discouraging pupilsfrom studying the exact and experimental sciences and from gaininga knowledge of true literary studies."The philosophic system explained was naturally the scholastic one,with an exceedingly refined and subtile logic, and with deficientideas upon physics. By the study of Latin, and their philosophicsystems, they converted their pupils into automatic machines ratherthan into practical men prepared to battle with life."--_Census ofthe Philippine Islands (Washington, 1905), Volume III, pp. 601, 602._[17] The nature of this booklet, in Tagalog, is made clear in severalpassages. It was issued by the Franciscans, but proved too outspokenfor even Latin refinement, and was suppressed by the Order itself.--Tr.[18] The rectory or parish house.[19] Friends of the author, who suffered in Weyler's expedition,mentioned below.--Tr.[20] The Dominican corporation, at whose instigation Captain-GeneralValeriano Weyler sent a battery of artillery to Kalamba to destroythe property of tenants who were contesting in the courts thefriars' titles to land there. The author's family were the largestsufferers.--Tr.[21] A relative of the author, whose body was dragged from the tomb andthrown to the dogs, on the pretext that he had died without receivingfinal absolution.--Tr.[22] Under the Spanish regime the government paid no attention toeducation, the schools (!) being under the control of the religiousorders and the friar-curates of the towns.--Tr.[23] The cockpits are farmed out annually by the local governments,the terms "contract," and "contractor," having now been softened into"license" and "licensee."--Tr.[24] The "Municipal School for Girls" was founded by the municipalityof Manila in 1864.... The institution was in charge of the Sistersof Charity.--_Census of the Philippine Islands, Vol. III, p. 615_.[25] Now known as Plaza Espana.--Tr.[26] Patroness of the Dominican Order. She was formally and sumptuouslyrecrowned a queen of the skies in 1907.--Tr.[27] A burlesque on an association of students known as the _MiliciaAngelica_, organized by the Dominicans to strengthen their hold onthe people. The name used is significant, "carbineers" being thelocal revenue officers, notorious in their later days for graftand abuse.--Tr.[28] "Tinamaan ng lintik!"--a Tagalog exclamation of anger,disappointment, or dismay, regarded as a very strong expression,equivalent to profanity. Literally, "May the lightning strikeyou!"--Tr.[29] "To lie about the stars is a safe kind of lying."--Tr.[30] Throughout this chapter the professor uses the familiar _tu_in addressing the students, thus giving his remarks a contemptuoustone.--Tr.[31] The professor speaks these words in vulgar dialect.[32] To confuse the letters _p_ and _f_ in speaking Spanish was acommon error among uneducated Filipinos.--Tr.[33] _No cristianos_, not Christians, _i.e_., savages.--Tr.[34] The patron saint of Spain, St. James.--Tr.[35] Houses of bamboo and nipa, such as form the homes of the massesof the natives.--Tr.[36] "In this paragraph Rizal alludes to an incident that hadvery serious results. There was annually celebrated in Binondo acertain religious festival, principally at the expense of the Chinesemestizos. The latter finally petitioned that their gobernadorcillo begiven the presidency of it, and this was granted, thanks to the factthat the parish priest (the Dominican, Fray Jose Hevia Campomanes)held to the opinion that the presidency belonged to those who paidthe most. The Tagalogs protested, alleging their better right to it,as the genuine sons of the country, not to mention the historicalprecedent, but the friar, who was looking after his own interests,did not yield. General Terrero (Governor, 1885-1888), at the adviceof his liberal councilors, finally had the parish priest removed andfor the time being decided the affair in favor of the Tagalogs. Thematter reached the Colonial Office (_Ministerio de Ultramar_) andthe Minister was not even content merely to settle it in the way thefriars desired, but made amends to Padre Hevia by appointing him abishop."--_W. E. Retana, who was a journalist in Manila at the time,in a note to this chapter._Childish and ridiculous as this may appear now, it was far from beingso at the time, especially in view of the supreme contempt with whichthe pugnacious Tagalog looks down upon the meek and complaisant Chineseand the mortal antipathy that exists between the two races.--Tr.[37] It is regrettable that Quiroga's picturesque butchery of Spanishand Tagalog--the dialect of the Manila Chinese--cannot be reproducedhere. Only the thought can be given. There is the same difficultywith _r's, d's_, and _l's_ that the Chinese show in English.--Tr.[38] Up to the outbreak of the insurrection in 1896, the only genuinelySpanish troops in the islands were a few hundred artillerymen, therest being natives, with Spanish officers.--Tr.[39] Abaka is the fiber obtained from the leaves of the _Musa textilis_and is known commercially as Manila hemp. As it is exclusively aproduct of the Philippines, it may be taken here to symbolize thecountry.--Tr.[40] Yet Ben-Zayb was not very much mistaken. The three legs of thetable have grooves in them in which slide the mirrors hidden belowthe platform and covered by the squares of the carpet. By placingthe box upon the table a spring is pressed and the mirrors risegently. The cloth is then removed, with care to raise it instead ofletting it slide off, and then there is the ordinary table of thetalking heads. The table is connected with the bottom of the box. Theexhibition ended, the prestidigitator again covers the table, pressesanother spring, and the mirrors descend.--_Author's note._[41] The Malay method of kissing is quite different from theOccidental. The mouth is placed close to the object and a deep breathtaken, often without actually touching the object, being more of asniff than a kiss.--Tr.[42] Now Calle Tetuan, Santa Cruz. The other names are still inuse.--Tr.[43] The _Sociedad Economica de Amigos del Pais_ for the encouragementof agricultural and industrial development, was established by Bascode Vargas in 1780.--Tr.[44] Funds managed by the government for making loans and supportingcharitable enterprises.--Tr.[45] The names are fictitious burlesques.--Tr.[46] "Boiled Shrimp"--Tr.[47] "Uncle Frank."--Tr.[48] Messageries Maritimes, a French line of steamers in the Orientaltrade.--Tr.[49] Referring to the expeditions--_Mision Espanola Catolica_--to theCaroline and Pelew Islands from 1886 to 1895, headed by the CapuchinFathers, which brought misery and disaster upon the natives of thoseislands, unprofitable losses and sufferings to the Filipino soldiersengaged in them, discredit to Spain, and decorations of merit to anumber of Spanish officers.--Tr.[50] Over the possession of the Caroline and Pelew Islands. Theexpeditions referred to in the previous note were largely inspiredby German activity with regard to those islands, which had alwaysbeen claimed by Spain, who sold her claim to them to Germany afterthe loss of the Philippines.--Tr.[51] "Where the wind wrinkles the silent waves, that rapidly break,    of their own movement, with a gentle murmur on the shore."--Tr.[52] "Where rapid and winged engines will rush in flight."--Tr.[53] There is something almost uncanny about the general accuracy ofthe prophecy in these lines, the economic part of which is now sowell on the way to realization, although the writer of them woulddoubtless have been a very much surprised individual had he alsoforeseen how it would come about. But one of his own expressions was"fire and steel to the cancer," and it surely got them.On the very day that this passage was translated and this note written,the first commercial liner was tied up at the new docks, which havedestroyed the Malecon but raised Manila to the front rank of Orientalseaports, and the final revision is made at Baguio, Mountain Province,amid the "cooler temperatures on the slopes of the mountains." As forthe political portion, it is difficult even now to contemplate calmlythe blundering fatuity of that bigoted medieval brand of "patriotism"which led the decrepit Philippine government to play the AncientMariner and shoot the Albatross that brought this message.--Tr.[54] These establishments are still a notable feature of nativelife in Manila. Whether the author adopted a title already common orpopularized one of his own invention, the fact is that they are nowinvariably known by the name used here. The use of _macanista_ was dueto the presence in Manila of a large number of Chinese from Macao.--Tr.[55] Originally, Plaza San Gabriel, from the Dominican mission for theChinese established there; later, as it became a commercial center,Plaza Vivac; and now known as Plaza Cervantes, being the financialcenter of Manila.--Tr.[56] "The manager of this restaurant warns the public to leaveabsolutely nothing on any table or chair."--Tr.[57] "We do not believe in the verisimilitude of this dialogue,fabricated by the author in order to refute the arguments of thefriars, whose pride was so great that it would not permit anyIsagani to tell them these truths face to face. The _invention_ ofPadre Fernandez as a Dominican professor is a stroke of generosityon Rizal's part, in conceding that there could have existed _any_friar capable of talking frankly with an _Indian_."--_W. E. Retana,in note to this chapter in the edition published by him at Barcelonain 1908_. Retana ought to know of what he is writing, for he was inthe employ of the friars for several years and later in Spain wroteextensively for the journal supported by them to defend their positionin the Philippines. He has also been charged with having strongly urgedRizal's execution in 1896. Since 1898, however, he has doubled about,or, perhaps more aptly, performed a journalistic somersault--havingwritten a diffuse biography and other works dealing with Rizal. Heis strong in unassorted facts, but his comments, when not inane andwearisome, approach a maudlin wail over "spilt milk," so the aboveis given at its face value only.--Tr.[58] Quite suggestive of, and perhaps inspired by, the author's ownexperience.--Tr.[59] The Walled City, the original Manila, is still known to theSpaniards and older natives exclusively as such, the other districtsbeing referred to by their distinctive names.--Tr.[60] Nearly all the dialogue in this chapter is in the mongrelSpanish-Tagalog "market language," which cannot be reproduced inEnglish.--Tr.[61] Doubtless a reference to the author's first work, _Noli MeTangere_, which was tabooed by the authorities.--Tr.[62] Such inanities as these are still a feature of Manilajournalism.--Tr.[63] "Whether there would be a _talisain_ cock, armed with a sharpgaff, whether the blessed Peter's fighting-cock would be a _bulik_--"_Talisain_ and _bulik_ are distinguishing terms in the vernacular forfighting-cocks, _tari_ and _sasabungin_ the Tagalog terms for "gaff"and "game-cock," respectively.The Tagalog terminology of the cockpit and monkish Latin certainlymake a fearful and wonderful mixture--nor did the author have toresort to his imagination to get samples of it.--Tr.[64] This is Quiroga's pronunciation of _Christo_.--Tr.[65] The native priests Burgos, Gomez, and Zamora, charged withcomplicity in the uprising of 1872, and executed.--Tr.[66] This versicle, found in the booklets of prayer, is common on thescapularies, which, during the late insurrection, were easily convertedinto the _anting-anting_, or amulets, worn by the fanatics.--Tr.[67] This practise--secretly compelling suspects to sign a requestto be transferred to some other island--was by no means a figment ofthe author's imagination, but was extensively practised to anticipateany legal difficulties that might arise.--Tr.[68] "Hawk-Eye."--Tr.[69] Ultima Razon de Reyes: the last argument ofkings--force. (Expression attributed to Calderon de la Barca, thegreat Spanish dramatist.)--Tr.[70] Curiously enough, and by what must have been more than a merecoincidence, this route through Santa Mesa from San Juan del Monte wasthe one taken by an armed party in their attempt to enter the city atthe outbreak of the Katipunan rebellion on the morning of August 30,1896. (Foreman's _The Philippine Islands_, Chap. XXVI.)It was also on the bridge connecting these two places that the firstshot in the insurrection against American sovereignty was fired onthe night of February 4, 1899.--Tr.[71] Spanish etiquette requires a host to welcome his guest with theconventional phrase: "The house belongs to you."--Tr.[72] The handwriting on the wall at Belshazzar's feast, foretellingthe destruction of Babylon. Daniel, v, 25-28.--Tr.[73] A town in Ciudad Real province, Spain.--Tr.[74] The italicized words are in English in the original.--Tr.[75] A Spanish hero, whose chief exploit was the capture of Gibraltarfrom the Moors in 1308.--Tr.[76] Emilio Castelar (1832-1899), generally regarded as the greatestof Spanish orators.--Tr.[77] In the original the message reads: "Espanol escondido casa PadreFlorentino cojera remitira vivo muerto." Don Tiburcio understands_cojera_ as referring to himself; there is a play upon the Spanishwords _cojera_, lameness, and _cogera_, a form of the verb _coger_,to seize or capture--_j_ and _g_ in these two words having the samesound, that of the English _h_.--Tr.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Reign of Greed, by Jose Rizal*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE REIGN OF GREED ******** This file should be named 10676.txt or 10676.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/6/7/10676/Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the distributed proofreaders teamUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

[PRICE 2d.       *       *       *       *       *FALLS OF THE GENESEE.[Illustration: Falls of the Genesee.]The Genesee is one of the most picturesque rivers of North America.Its name is indeed characteristic: the word Genesee being formed fromthe Indian for _Pleasant Valley,_ which term is very descriptive ofthe river and its vicinity. Its falls have not the majestic extentof the Niagara; but their beauty compensates for the absence of suchgrandeur.The Genesee, the principal natural feature of its district, riseson the _Grand Plateau_ or table-land of Western Pennsylvania, runsthrough New York, and flows into Lake Ontario, at Port Genesee, sixmiles below Rochester. At the distance of six miles from its mouth arefalls of 96 feet, and one mile higher up, other falls of 75 feet.[1]Above these it is navigable for boats nearly 70 miles, where are othertwo falls, of 60 and 90 feet, one mile apart, in Nunda, south ofLeicester. At the head of the Genesee is a tract six miles square,embracing waters, some of which flow into the gulf of Mexico, othersinto Chesapeake Bay, and others into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Thistract is probably elevated 1,600 or 1,700 feet above the tide watersof the Atlantic Ocean.    [1] It may be as well here to quote the formation of Cataracts        and Cascades, from Maltebrun's valuable _System of Universal        Geography._ "It is only the sloping of the land which can at first        cause water to flow; but an impulse having been once communicated        to the mass, the pressure alone of the water will keep it in        motion, even if there were no declivity at all. Many great rivers,        in fact, flow with an almost interruptible declivity. Rivers which        descend from primitive mountains into secondary lands, often form        _cascades and cataracts_. Such are the cataracts of the Nile,        of the Ganges, and some other great rivers, which, according to        Desmarest, evidently mark the limits of the ancient land.        Cataracts are also formed by lakes: of this description are the        celebrated Falls of the Niagara; but the most picturesque falls        are those of rapid rivers, bordered by trees and precipitous        rocks. Sometimes we see a body of water, which, before it arrives        at the bottom, is broken and dissipated into showers, like the        Staubbach, (see _Mirror,_ vol. xiv. p. 385.); sometimes it forms        a watery arch, projected from a rampart of rock, under which the        traveller may pass dryshod, as the "falling spring" of Virginia;        in one place, in a granite district, we see the Trolhetta, and the        Rhine not far from its source, urge on their foaming billows        among the pointed rocks; in another, amidst lands of a calcareous        formation, we see the Czettina and the Kerka, rolling down        from terrace to terrace, and presenting sometimes a sheet, and        sometimes a wall, of water. Some magnificent cascades have been        formed, at least in part, by the hands of man: the cascades of        Velino, near Terni, have been attributed to Pope Clement VIII.;        other cataracts, like those of Tunguska, in Siberia, have        gradually lost their elevation by the wearing away of the rocks,        and have now only a rapid descent."--_Maltebrun_, vol. i.The Engraving includes the falls of the river, with the villageof Rochester, seven miles south of Lake Ontario. This place, forpopulation, extent, and trade, will soon rank among the Americancities: it was not settled until about the close of the last war;its progress was slow until the year 1820, from which period it hasrapidly improved. In 1830 it contained upwards of 12,000 inhabitants:the first census of the village was taken in December, 1815, when thenumber of inhabitants was three hundred and thirty-one. The aqueductwhich takes the Erie canal across the river forms a prominent objectof interest to all travellers. It is of hewn stone, containing elevenarches of 50 feet span: its length is 800 feet, but a considerablepart of each end is hidden from view by mills erected since itsconstruction.On the brink of the island which separates the main stream of theriver from that produced by the waste water from the mill-race,will be seen _a scaffold or platform_ from which an eccentric butcourageous adventurer, named _Sam Patch_, made a desperate leap intothe gulf beneath. Patch had obtained some celebrity in freaks of thisdescription, though his feats be not recorded, like the hot-brainedpatriotism of Marcus Curtius in olden history. At the fall of Niagara,Patch had before made two leaps in safety--one of 80 and the other of130 feet, in a vast gulf, foaming and tost aloft from the commotionproduced by a fall of nearly 200 feet. In November, 1829, Patchvisited Rochester to astonish the citizens by a leap from the falls.His first attempt was successful, and in the presence of thousands ofspectators he leaped from the scaffold to which we have directed theattention of the reader, a distance of 100 feet, into the abyss, insafety. He was advertised to repeat the feat in a few days, or, as heprophetically announced it his "last jump," meaning his last jump thatseason. The scaffold was duly erected, 25 feet in height, and Patch,an hour after the time was announced, made his appearance. A multitudehad collected to witness the feat; the day was unusually cold, and Samwas intoxicated. The river was low, and the falls near him on eitherside were bare. Sam threw himself off, and the waters (to quote thebathos of a New York newspaper) "received him in their cold embrace.The tide bubbled as the life left the body, and then the stillness ofdeath, indeed, sat upon the bosom of the waters." His body was foundpast the spring at the mouth of the river, seven miles below wherehe made his fatal leap. It had passed over two falls of 125 feetcombined, yet was not much injured. A black handkerchief taken fromhis neck while on the scaffold, and tied about the body, was stillthere. He is stated to have had perfect command of himself while inthe air; and, says the journalist already quoted, "had he not beengiven to habits of intoxication, he might have astonished the world,perhaps for years, with the greatest feats ever performed by man."The Genesee river waters one of the finest tracts of land in the stateof New York. Its alluvial flats are extensive, and very fertile. Theseare either natural prairies, or Indian clearings, (of which, however,the present Indians have no tradition,) and lying, to an extent ofmany thousand acres, between the villages of Genesee, Moscow, andMount Morris, which now crown the declivities of their surroundinguplands; and, contrasting their smooth verdure with the shaggy hillsthat bound the horizon, and their occasional clumps of spreadingtrees, with the tall and naked relics of the forest, nothing canbe more agreeable to the eye, long accustomed to the uninterruptedprospect of a level and wooded country.       *       *       *       *       *SONG FROM THE ALBUM OF A POET._By G.R. Carter._THE HOMEWARD VOYAGE.  Away o'er the dancing wave,    Like the wings of the white seamew;  How proudly the hearts of the youthful brave    Their dreams of bliss renew!  And as on the pathless deep,    The bark by the gale is driven,  How glorious it is with the stars to keep    A watch on the beautiful heaven.  The winds o'er the ocean bear    Rich fragrance from the flow'rs,  That bloom on the sward, and sparkle there    Like stars in their dark blue bow'rs.  The visions of those that sail    O'er the wave with its snow-white foam,  Are haunted with scenes of the beauteous vale    That encloses their peaceful home.  They have wander'd through groves of the west,    Illumed with the fire-flies' light;  But their native land kindles a charm in each breast,    Unwaken'd by regions more bright.  The haunts that were dear to the heart    As an exquisite dream of romance,  Strew thoughts, like sweet flow'rs, round its holiest part,    And their fancy-bound spirits entrance.  Then away with the fluttering sail!    And away with the bounding wave!  While the musical sounds of the ocean-gale    Are wafted around the brave!         *       *       *       *       *Ray wittily observes that an obscure and prolix author may notimproperly be compared to a Cuttle-fish, since he may be said to hidehimself under his own ink.         *       *       *       *       *LINESFROM THE GERMAN OF KOeRNER._Written on the morning of the Battle of Daenneberg._    Doubt-beladen, dim and hoary,      O'er us breaks the mighty day,    And the sunbeam, cold and gory,      Lights us on our fearful way.    In the womb of coming hours,      Destinies of empires lie,    Now the scale ascends, now lowers,      Now is thrown the noble die.  Brothers, the hour with warning is rife;  Faithful in death as you're faithful in life,    Be firm, and be bound by the holiest tie,    In the shadows of the night,      Lie behind us shame and scorn;    Lies the slave's exulting might,      Who the German oak has torn.    Speech disgrac'd in future story,      Shrines polluted (shall it be?)    To dishonour pledg'd our glory,      German brothers, set it free.  Brothers, your hands, let your vengeance be burning,  By your actions, the curses of heaven be turning,    On, on, set your country's Palladium free.    Hope, the brightest, is before us,      And the future's golden time,    Joys, which heaven will restore us,      Freedom's holiness sublime.    German bards and artists' powers,      Woman's truth, and fond caress,    Fame eternal shall be ours,      Beauty's smile our toils shall bless.  Yet 'tis a deed that the bravest might shake,  Life and our heart's blood are set on the stake;    Death alone points out the road to success.    God! united we will dare it;      Firm this heart shall meet its fate,    To the altar thus I bear it,      And my coming doom await.    Fatherland, for thee we perish,      At thy fell command 'tis done,    May our loved ones ever cherish      Freedom, which our blood has won.  Liberty, grow o'er each oak-shadow'd plain,  Grow o'er the tombs of thy warriors slain,    Fatherland, hear thou the oath we have sworn.    Brothers, towards your hearts' best treasures,      Cast one look, on earth the last,    Turn then from those once prized pleasures,      Wither'd by the hostile blast.    Though your eyes be dim with weeping,      Tears like these are not from fear,    Trust to God's own holy keeping,      With your last kiss, all that's dear.  All lips that pray for us, all hearts that we rend  With parting, O father, to thee we commend,    Protect them and shield them from wrongs and despair.--H.       *       *       *       *       *EQUANIMITY OF TEMPER.Goodness of temper may be defined, to use the happy imagery of Gray,"as the sunshine of the heart." It is a more valuable bosom-attendantunder the pressure of poverty and adversity, and when we areapproaching the confines of infirmity and old age, than when we arerevelling in the full tide of plenty, amid the exuberant strength andfreshness of youth. Lord Bacon, who has analyzed some of the humanaccompaniments so well, is silent as to the softening sway andpleasing influence of this choice attuner of the human mind. ButShaftesbury, the illustrious author of the _Characteristics_, was soenamoured of it, that he terms "gravity (its counterpart,) the essenceof imposture;" and so it is, for to what purpose does a man store hisbrain with knowledge, and the profitable burden of the sciences, if hegathers only superciliousness and pride from the hedge of learning?instead of the milder traits of general affection, and the openqualities of social feelings. I remember, when a youth, I wasextremely fond of attending the House of Commons, to hear the debates;and I shall never forget the repulsive loftiness which I thoughtmarked the physiognomy of Pitt; harsh and unbending, like a settledfrost, he seemed wrapped in the mantle of egotism and sublunaryconceit; and it was from the uninviting expression of this great man'scountenance, that I first drew my conceptions as to how a proud andunsociable man looked. With very different emotions I was wont tosurvey the mild but expressive features of his great opponent, Fox:there was a placidity mixed up with the graver lines of thought andreflection, that would have invited a child to take him by the hand;indeed, the witchcraft of Mr. Fox's temper was such, that it formed atriumphant source of gratulation in the circle of his friends, fromthe panegyric of the late Earl of Carlisle, during his boyish days atEton, to the prouder posthumous circles of fame with which the elegantauthor of _The Pleasures of Memory_, has entwined his sympatheticrecollections. The late Mr. Whitbread, although an unflinchingadvocate for the people's rights, and an incorruptible patriot inthe true sense of the word, was unpopular in his office as a countrymagistrate, owing to a tone of severity he generally used to thosearound him. The wife of that indefatigable toiler in the Christianfield, John Wesley, was so acid and acrimonious in her temper, thatthat mild advocate for spiritual affection, found it impossible tolive with her. Rousseau was tormented by such a host of ungovernablepassions, that he became a burden to himself and to every one aroundhim. Lord Byron suffered a badness of temper to corrode him in theflower of his days. Contrasted with this unpleasing part of theperspective, let us quote the names of a few wise and good men, whohave been proverbial for the goodness of their tempers; as Shakspeare,Francis I., and Henry IV. of France; "the great and good LordLyttleton," as he is called to the present day; John Howard,Goldsmith, Sir Samuel Romilly, Franklin, Thomson, the poet,Sheridan,[2] and Sir Walter Scott. The late Sir William Curtis wasknown to be one of the best tempered men of his day, which made him agreat favourite with the late king. I remember a little incident ofSir William's good-nature, which occurred about a year after he hadbeen Lord Mayor. In alighting from his carriage, a little out of theregular line, near the Mansion House, upon some day of festivity, hehappened inadvertently, with the skirts of his coat, to brush down afew apples from a poor woman's stall, on the side of the pavement. SirWilliam was in full dress, but instead of passing on with the hauteurwhich characterizes so many of his aldermanic brethren, he set himselfto the task of assisting the poor creature to collect her scatteredfruit; and on parting, observing some of her apples were a littlesoiled by the dirt, he drew his hand from his pocket and generouslygave her a shilling. This was too good an incident for John Bull tolose: a crowd assembled, hurraed, and cried out, "Well done, Billy,"at which the good-natured baronet looked back and laughed. How muchmore pleasing is it to tell of such demeanour than of the foolishpride of the late Sir John Eamer, who turned away one of histravellers merely because he had in one instance used his bootjack.    [2] May we not, however, say the friendless Sheridan?_The Author of "A Tradesman's Lays."_       *       *       *       *       *Probably our correspondent may recollect Sir William and the orange,at one of the contested City elections. A "greasy rogue" before thehustings, seeing the baronet candidate take an orange from his pocket,_put up_ for the fruit, with the cry "Give us that orange, Billy." SirWilliam threw him the fruit, which the fellow had no sooner suckeddry, than he began bawling with increased energy, "No Curtis," "NoBilly," etc. Such an ungrateful act would have soured even Seneca; butSir William merely gave a smile, with a good-natured shake of thehead. Sir William Curtis possessed a much greater share of shrewdnessand good sense than the vulgar ever gave him credit for. At theSessions' dinners, he would keep up the ball of conversation with thejudges and gentlemen of the bar, in a fuller vein than either of hisbrother aldermen. It is true that he had wealth and distinction,all which his fellow citizens at table did not enjoy; and thesepossessions, we know, are wonderful helps to confidence, if they donot lead the holder on to assurance.--Ed. M.       *       *       *       *       *THE SKETCH BOOK.       *       *       *       *       *EXTRACTS FROM THE ORIGINAL LETTERS OF AN OFFICER IN INDIA.[3]_THE SIGHT OF A TIGER._[4]Secunderabad, 1828.A short time since, a brother sub. in my regiment was riding out roundsome hills adjoining the cantonment, when a _cheetar_, small tiger(or panther,) pounced on his dog. Seeing his poor favourite in thecheetar's mouth, like a mouse in Minette's, he put spurs to his horse,rode after the beast, and so frightened him, that he dropped the dogand made off. Three of us, including myself, then agreed to sit upthat night, and watch for the tiger, feeling assured that his hauntwas not far from our cantonment. So we started late at night, armed_cap-a-pied_, and each as fierce in heart as ten tigers; arrivedat the appointed spot, and having selected a convenient place forconcealment, we picketed a sheep, brought with us purposely to enticethe cheetar from his lair. Singular to relate, this poor animal, as ifinstinctively aware of its critical situation, was as mute as ifit had been mouthless, and during two or three hours in which wetormented it, to make it utter a cry, our efforts were of no avail.Hour after hour slipped away, still no cheetar; and about threeo'clock in the morning, wearied with our fruitless vigil, we all beganto drop asleep. I believe I was wrapped in a most leaden slumber, anddreaming of anything but watching for, and hunting tigers, when I wasaroused by the most unnatural, unearthly, and infernal roaring everheard. This was our friend, and for his reception, starting upon ourfeet, we were all immediately ready; but the cunning creature whohad no idea of becoming our victim, made off, with the most hideoushowlings, to the shelter of a neighbouring eminence; when sufficientdaylight appeared, we followed the direction of his voice, and had thefelicity of seeing him perched on the summit of an immense high rock,just before us, placidly watching our movements. We were here, too farfrom him to venture a shot, but immediately began ascending, when thecreature seeing us approach, rose, opened his ugly red mouth in adesperate yawn, and stretched himself with the utmost _nonchalance_,being, it seems, little less weary than ourselves. We presented, butdid not fire, because at that very moment, setting up his tail, andhowling horribly, he disappeared behind the rock. Quick as thoughtwe followed him, but to our great disappointment and chagrin, he hadretreated into one of the numerous caverns formed in that ugly place,by huge masses of rock, piled one upon the other. Into some of thesedangerous places, however, we descended, sometimes creeping, sometimeswalking, in search of our foe; but not finding him, at length returnedto breakfast, which I thought the most agreeable and sensible part ofthe affair. Some wit passed amongst us respecting the propriety ofchanging the name _cheetar_, into _cheat-us_; but were, on the whole,not pleased by the failure of our expedition; and I have only favouredyou with this _romantic_ incident in the life of a sub. as a specimenof the sort of amusement we meet with in quarters.

Under the hillare swamps and paddy-fields, which abound in snipe and other game.Now, is not this a Zoological Garden on the grandest scale?H.C.B.       *       *       *       *       *OLD POETS.       *       *       *       *       *BALLAD OF AGINCOURT.(_From "England's Heroical Epistles[5]._")  Faire stood the wind for France,  When we, our sayles advance,  Nor now to proue our chance    Longer will tarry;  But putting to the mayne,  At Kaux, the mouth of Sene,  With all his martiall trayne,    Landed King Harry.  And taking many a fort,  Furnished in warlike sort,  Marcheth towards Agincourt,    In happy houre.

And turning to his men,  Quoth our brave Henry, then,  "Though they to one be ten,    Be not amazed,  Yet have we well begunne,  Battells so bravely wonne,  Have ever to the sonne,    By fame beene raysed."

They now to fight are gone,  Armour on armour shone,  Drumme now to drumme did grone,    To hear was wonder,  That with cryes they make,  The very earth did shake,    Thunder to thunder.  Well it thine age became  O noble Erpingham,  Which didst the signall ayme,    To our hid forces;  When from a meadow by,  Like a storme suddenly,  The English archery    Struck the French horses.

None from his fellow starts,  But playing manly parts,  And like true English hearts,    Stuck close together.  When downe their bowes they threw,  And forth their bilbowes drew,  And on the French they flew,    Not one was tardie;  Armes were from shoulders sent,  Scalpes to the teeth were rent,  Down the French pesants went,    Our men were hardie.  This while oure noble king,  His broad sword brandishing,  Downe the French host did ding,    As to o'erwhelme it.

We could now put to sea,in a few mouths, with a dozen ships of the line; the most spacious,efficient, best, and most beautiful constructions that ever traversedthe ocean. This is not merely an American conceit, but an admittedfact in Europe, where our models are studiously copied. In the UnitedStates, a maximum and uniform calibre of cannon has been latelydetermined on and adopted. Instead of the variety of length, form,and calibre still used in other navies, and almost equal to the GreatMichael with her "bassils, mynards, hagters, culverings, flings,falcons, double dogs, and pestilent serpenters," our ships offer flushand uniform decks, sheers free from hills, hollows, and excrescences,and complete, unbroken batteries of thirty-two or forty-two pounders.Thus has been realized an important desideratum--the greatest possiblepower to do execution coupled with the greatest simplification of themeans.    [6] Philadelphia, Carey and Lea, 1832.But, while we have thus improved upon the hitherto practised means ofnaval warfare, we are threatened with a total change. This is by theintroduction of bombs, discharged horizontally, instead of shot fromcommon cannon. So certain are those who have turned their attention tothis subject that the change must take place, that, in France, theyare already speculating on the means of excluding these destructivemissiles from a ship's sides, by casing them in a cuirass of iron. Norare these ideas the mere offspring of idle speculation. Experimentshave been tried on hulks, by bombs projected horizontally, withterrible effect. If the projectile lodged in a mast, in exploding itoverturned it, with all its yards and rigging; if in the side, theports were opened into each other; or, when near the water, an immensechasm was opened, causing the vessel to sink immediately. If it shouldnot explode until it fell spent upon deck, besides doing the injuryof an ordinary ball, it would then burst, scattering smoke, fire, anddeath, on every side. When this comes to pass, it would seem thatthe naval profession would cease to be very desirable. Nevertheless,experience has, in all ages, shown that, the more destructive are theengines used in war, and the more it is improved and systematized, theless is the loss of life. Salamis and Lepanto can either of themalone count many times the added victims of the Nile, Trafalgar, andNavarino.One effect of the predicted change in naval war, it is said, will bethe substitution of small vessels for the larger ones now in use. Thethree decker presents many times the surface of the schooner,while her superior number of cannon does not confer a commensurateadvantage; for ten bombs, projected into the side of a ship, would bealmost as efficacious to her destruction as a hundred. As forming partof a system of defence for our coast, the bomb-cannon, mounted onsteamers, which can take their position at will, would be terriblyformidable. With them--to say nothing of torpedoes and submarinenavigation--we need never more be blockaded and annoyed as formerly.Hence peaceful nations will be most gainers by this change of system;but it is not enough that we should be capable of raising a blockade:we are a commercial people: our merchant ships visit every sea, andour men-of-war must follow and protect them there._Newspapers_.--No country has so many newspapers as the United States.The following table, arranged for the American Almanac of 1830, iscorrected from the Traveller, and contains a statement of the numberof newspapers published in the colonies at the commencement of therevolution; and also the number of newspapers and other periodicalworks, in the United States, in 1810 and 1828.

Thus thestate of New York is mentioned in the table as having 161 newspapers;but a late publication states that there are 193, exclusive ofreligious journals. New York has 1,913,508 inhabitants. There areabout 50 daily newspapers in the United States, two-thirds of whichare considered to give a fair profit. The North American colonies, inthe year 1720, had only seven newspapers: in 1810, the United Stateshad 359; in 1826, they had 640; in 1830, 1,000, with a populationof 13,000,000; so that they have more newspapers than the whole 190millions of Europe.In drawing a comparison between the newspapers of the three freestcountries, France, England, and the United States, we find, as we havejust said, those of the last country to be the most numerous, whilesome of the French papers have the largest subscription; and the wholeestablishment of a first-rate London paper is the most complete. Itsactivity is immense. When Canning sent British troops to Portugal, in1826, we know that some papers sent reporters with the army. The zealof the New York papers also deserves to be mentioned, which sendout their news-boats, even fifty miles to sea, to board approachingvessels, and obtain the news that they bring. The papers of the largeAtlantic cities are also remarkable for their detailed accounts ofarrivals, and the particulars of shipping news, interesting to thecommercial world, in which they are much more minute than the English.From the immense number of different papers in the United States, itresults that the number of subscribers to each is limited, 2,000 beingconsidered a respectable list. One paper, therefore, is not able tounite the talent of many able men, as is the case in France. Theremen of the first rank in literature or politics occasionally, or atregular periods, contribute articles. In the United States, few papershave more than one editor, who generally writes upon almost allsubjects himself. This circumstance necessarily makes the papers lessspirited and able than some of the foreign journals, but is attendedwith this advantage, that no particular set of men is enabled toexercise a predominant influence by means of these periodicals. Theirabundance neutralizes their effects. Declamation and sophistry aremade comparatively harmless by running in a thousand conflictingcurrents._Paper-making_.--The manufacture of paper has of late rapidlyincreased in the United States. According to an estimate in 1829, thewhole quantity made in this country amounted to about five to sevenmillions a year, and employed from ten to eleven thousand persons.Rags are not imported from Italy and Germany to the same amount asformerly, because people here save them more carefully; and the valueof the rags, junk, etc., saved annually in the United States, isbelieved to amount to two millions of dollars. Machines for makingpaper of any length are much employed in the United States. Thequality of American paper has also improved; but, as paper becomesmuch better by keeping, it is difficult to have it of the best qualityin this country, the interest of capital being too high. The paperused here for printing compares very disadvantageously with that ofEngland. Much wrapping paper is now made of straw, and paper fortracing through is prepared in Germany from the poplar tree. A letterof Mr. Brand, formerly a civil officer in Upper Provence, in France(which contains many pine forests), dated Feb. 12, 1830, has beenpublished in the French papers, containing an account of hissuccessful experiments to make coarse paper of the pine tree. Theexperiments of others have led to the same results. Any of ourreaders, interested in this subject, can find Mr. Brand's letter inthe _Courrier Francais_ of Nov. 27, 1830, a French paper publishedin New York. In salt-works near Hull, Massachusetts, in which thesea-water is made to flow slowly over sheds of pine, in order toevaporate, the writer found large quantities of a white substance--thefibres of the pine wood dissolved and carried off by the brine--whichseemed to require nothing but glue to convert it into paper.       *       *       *       *       *THE NATURALIST       *       *       *       *       *THE CUTTLE-FISHIs one of the most curious creatures of "the watery kingdom." It ispopularly termed a fish, though it is, in fact, a worm, belonging tothe order termed _Mollusca, (Molluscus_, soft,) from the body being ofa pulpy substance and having no skeleton. It differs in many respectsfrom other animals of its class, particularly with regard to itsinternal structure, the perfect formation of the viscera, eyes, andeven organs of hearing. Moreover, "it has three hearts, two of whichare placed at the root of the two branchiae (or gills); they receivethe blood from the body, and propel it into the branchiae. Thereturning veins open into the middle heart, from which the aortaproceeds."[7] Of Cuttle-fish there are several species. Thatrepresented in the annexed Cut is the common or officinal Cuttle-fish,(_Sepia officinalis_, Lin). It consists of a soft, pulpy, body, withprocesses or arms, which are furnished with small holes or suckers,by means of which the animal fixes itself in the manner ofcupping-glasses. These holes increase with the age of the animal; andin some species amount to upwards of one thousand. The arms are oftentorn or nipped off by shell or other fishes, but the animal has thepower of speedily reproducing the limbs. By means of the suckers theCuttle-fish usually affects its locomotion. "It swims at freedom inthe bosom of the sea, moving by sudden and irregular jerks, the bodybeing nearly in a perpendicular position, and the head directeddownwards and backwards. Some species have a fleshy, muscular finon each side, by aid of which they accomplish these apparentlyinconvenient motions; but, at least, an equal number of them arefinless, and yet can swim with perhaps little less agility. Lamarck,indeed, denies this, and says that these can only trail themselvesalong the bottom by means of the suckers. This is probably theirusual mode of proceeding; that it is not their only one, we have thepositive affirmation of other observers."[8] Serviceable as these armsundoubtedly are to the Cuttle-fish, Blumenbach thinks it questionablewhether they can be considered as organs of touch, in the more limitedsense to which he has confined that term.[9]THE CUTTLE-FISH.[Illustration: The Cuttle-fish.]The jaws of the Cuttle-fish, it should be observed, are fixed in thebody because there is no head to which they can be articulated. Theyare of horny substance, and resemble the bill of a parrot. They are inthe centre of the under part of the body, surrounded by the arms. Bymeans of these parts, the shell-fish which are taken for food, arecompletely triturated.    [7] Cuvier.    [8] Nat. Hist. Molluscous Animals, Mag. Nat. Hist. vol. iii.        p. 527.    [9] Manual Comp. Anat. p. 263.We now come to the most peculiar parts of the structure of theCuttle-fish, viz. the _ear and eye_, inasmuch as it is the only animalof its class, in which any thing has hitherto been discovered, atall like an organ of hearing, or that has been shown to possess trueeyes.[10] The ears consist of two oval cavities, in the cartilaginousring, to which the large arms of the animal are affixed. In each ofthese is a small bag, containing a bony substance, and receiving thetermination of the nerves, like those of the vestibulum (or cavityin the bone of the ear) in fishes. The nature of the eyes cannot bedisputed. "They resemble, on the whole, those of red-blooded animals,particularly fishes; they are at least incomparably more like themthan the eyes of any known insects; yet they are distinguished byseveral extraordinary peculiarities. The front of the eye-ball iscovered with a loose membrane instead of a cornea; the iris iscomposed of a firm substance; and a process projects from the uppermargin of the pupil, which gives that membrane a semilunar form."[11]The exterior coat or ball is remarkably strong, so as to seem almostcalcareous, and is, when taken out, of a brilliant pearl colour; itis worn in some parts of Italy, and in the Grecian islands by way ofartificial pearl in necklaces.    [10] In all other worms the eyes are entirely wanting, or their         existence is very doubtful. Whether the black points at the         extremities of what Swammerdam calls the horns of the common         snail, are organs which really possess the power of vision,         is still problematical.    [11] Blumenbach, Man. Comp. Anat. p. 305.Next we may notice the curious provision by which the Cuttle-fish isenabled to elude the pursuit of its enemies in the "vasty deep." Thisconsists of a black, inky fluid, (erroneously supposed to be thebile,) which is contained in a bag beneath the body. The fluid itselfis thick, but miscible with water to such a degree, that a very smallquantity will colour a vast bulk of water.[12] Thus, the comparativelysmall Cuttle-fish may darken the element about the acute eye of thewhale. What omniscience is displayed in this single provision, as wellas in the faculty possessed by the Cuttle-fish of reproducing itsmutilated arms! All Nature beams with such beneficence, and aboundswith such instances of divine love for every creature, however humble:in observing these provisions, how often are we reminded of thebenefits conferred by the same omniscience upon our own species. It isthus, by the investigation of natural history, that we are led tothe contemplation of the sublimest subjects; thus that man with Godhimself holds converse.BONE, OR PLATE.[Illustration: Bone, or Plate.]The "bone" of the Cuttle-fish now claims attention. This is acomplicated calcareous plate, lodged in a peculiar cavity of the back,which it materially strengthens. This plate has long been known inthe shop of the apothecary under the name of Cuttle-fish bone: anobservant reader may have noticed scores of these plates in glasseslabelled _Os Sepiae_. Reduced to powder, they were formerly used as anabsorbent, but they are now chiefly sought after for the purpose ofpolishing the softer metals. It is however improper to call this platebone, since, in composition, "it is exactly similar to _shell_, andconsists of various membranes, hardened by carbonate of lime, (theprincipal material of shell,) without the smallest mixture ofphosphate of lime,[13] or the chief material of bone."    [12] According to Cuvier, the Indian ink, from China, is made of         this fluid, as was the ink of the Romans. It has been supposed,         and not without a considerable degree of probability, that the         celebrated plain, but wholesome dish, the black broth of Sparta,         was no other than a kind of Cuttle-fish soup, in which the black         liquor of the animal was always added as an ingredient; being,         when fresh, of very agreeable taste.--_Shaw's Zoology_.    [13] Mr. Hatchett, in Philos. Trans.EGGS.[Illustration: Eggs.]Lastly, are the _ovaria_, or egg-bags of the Cuttle-fish, which arepopularly called _sea-grapes_. The female fish deposits her eggsin numerous clusters, on the stalks of fuci, on corals, about theprojecting sides of rocks, or on any other convenient substances.These eggs, which are of the size of small filberts, are of a blackcolour.The most remarkable species of Cuttle-fish inhabits the British seas;and, although seldom taken, its bone or plate is cast ashore ondifferent parts of the coast from the south of England to the ZetlandIsles. We have picked up scores of these plates and bunches of theegg-bags or grapes, after rough weather on the beach between Worthingand Rottingdean; but we never found a single fish.The Cuttle-fish was esteemed a delicacy by the ancients, and themoderns equally prize it. Captain Cook speaks highly of a soup he madefrom it; and the fish is eaten at the present day by the Italians, andby the Greeks, during Lent. We take the most edible species to be the_octopodia_, or eight-armed, found particularly large in the EastIndies and the Gulf of Mexico. The common species here figured, whenfull-grown, measures about two feet in length, is of a pale blueishbrown colour, with the skin marked by numerous dark purple specks.The Cuttle-fish is described by some naturalists, as naked orshell-less. It is often found attached to the shell of the PaperNautilus, which it is said to use as a sail. It is, however, verydoubtful whether the Cuttle-fish has a shell of its own. There is acontroversy upon the subject. Aristotle, and our contemporary, Home,maintain it to be parasitical: Cuvier and Ferrusac, non-parasitical;but the curious reader will find the _pro_ and _con._--the majorityand minority--in the _Magazine of Natural History_, vol. iii. p. 535.       *       *       *       *       *NOTES OF A READER.       *       *       *       *       *SERVANTS IN INDIA.[Captain Skinner, in his _Excursions in India_, makes the followingsensible observations on the tyranny over servants in India:]There are throughout the mountains many of the sacred shrubs of theHindoos, which give great delight, as my servants fall in with them.They pick the leaves; and running with them to me, cry, "See, sir,see, our holy plants are here!" and congratulate each other on havingfound some indication of a better land than they are generallyinclined to consider the country of the Pariahs. The happiness thesesimple remembrances shed over the whole party is so enlivening, thatevery distress and fatigue seems to be forgotten. When we behold aservant approaching with a sprig of the _Dona_ in his hand, we hail itas the olive-branch, that denotes peace and good-will for the rest ofthe day, if, as must sometimes be the case, they have been in any wayinterrupted.Even these little incidents speak so warmly in favour of the Hindoodisposition, that, in spite of much that may be uncongenial to anEuropean in their character, they cannot fail to inspire him withesteem, if not affection. I wish that many of my countrymen wouldlearn to believe that the natives are endowed with feelings, andsurely they may gather such an inference from many a similar traitto the one I have related. Hardness of heart can never be alliedto artless simplicity: that mind must possess a higher degree ofsensibility and refinement, that can unlock its long-confinedrecollections by so light a spring as a wild flower.I have often witnessed, with wonder and sorrow, an English gentlemanstoop to the basest tyranny over his servants, without even the poorexcuse of anger, and frequently from no other reason than because hecould not understand their language. The question, from the answerbeing unintelligible, is instantly followed by a blow. Such scenes arebecoming more rare, and indeed are seldom acted but by the youngermembers of society; they are too frequent notwithstanding: and shouldany thing that has fallen from me here, induce the cruelly-disposed toreflect a little upon the impropriety and mischief of their conduct,when about to raise the hand against a native, and save one stripeto the passive people who are so much at the mercy of their masters'tempers, I shall indeed be proud.[Again, speaking of the condition of servants, Captain Skinnerremarks--]It is impossible to view some members of the despised class withoutsorrow and pity, particularly those who are attached, in the lowestoffices, to the establishments of the Europeans. They are the mostmelancholy race of beings, always alone, and apparently unhappy: theyare scouted from the presence even of their fellow-servants. None butthe mind of a poet could imagine such outcasts venturing to raisetheir thoughts to the beauty of a Brahmin's daughter; and a touchingtale in such creative fancy, no doubt, it would make, for, from theiroutward appearances, I do not perceive why they should not be endowedwith minds as sensitive at least as those of the castes above them.There are among them some very stout and handsome men; and it isridiculous to see sometimes all their strength devoted to the chargeof a sickly puppy;--to take care of dogs being their principaloccupation!Our attention has been drawn to the above passage in Captain Skinner'swork, by its ready illustration of the views and conclusions of thelate Dr. Knox, in his invaluable _Spirit of Despotism_, Section 2,"Oriental manners, and the ideas imbibed in youth, both in the Eastand West Indies, favourable to the spirit of despotism." How forciblyapplicable, on the present occasion, is the following extract:--"fromthe intercourse of England with the East and West Indies, it is to befeared that something of a more servile spirit has been derived thanwas known among those who established the free constitutions ofEurope, and than would have been adopted, or patiently borne, in agesof virtuous simplicity. A very numerous part of our countrymen spendtheir most susceptible age in those countries, where despotic mannersremarkably prevail. They are themselves, when invested with office,treated by the natives with an idolatrous degree of reverence, whichteaches them to expect a similar submission to their will, on theirreturn to their own country. They have been accustomed to look up topersonages greatly their superiors in rank and riches, with awe; andto look down on their inferiors in _property_ with supreme contempt,as slaves of their will and ministers of their luxury. Equal laws andequal liberty at home appear to them saucy claims of the poor and thevulgar, which tend to divest riches of one of the greatest charms,over-bearing dominion. We do, indeed, import gorgeous silks andluscious sweets from the Indies, but we import, at the same time, thespirit of despotism, which adds deformity to the purple robe, andbitterness to the honied beverage." "That _Oriental_ manners areunfavourable to liberty, is, I believe, universally conceded. Thenatives of the East Indies entertain not the idea of independence.They treat the Europeans, who go among them to acquire their riches,with a respect similar to the abject submission which they pay totheir native despots. Young men, who in England scarcely possessedthe rank of the gentry, are waited upon in India, with more attentiveservility than is paid or required in many courts of Europe. Kings ofEngland seldom assume the state enjoyed by an East India governor, oreven by subordinate officers. Enriched at an early age, the adventurerreturns to England. His property admits him to the higher circlesof fashionable life. He aims at rivalling or excelling all theold nobility in the splendour of his mansions, the finery of hiscarriages, the number of his liveried train, the profusion of histables, in every unmanly indulgence which an empty vanity can covet,and a full purse procure. Such a man, when he looks from the window ofhis superb mansion, and sees the people pass, cannot endure the idea,that they are of as much consequence as himself in the eye of the law;and that he dares not insult or oppress the unfortunate being whorakes his kennel or sweeps his chimney."       *       *       *       *       *FALL OF ROBESPIERRE.It is well known, that during the revolutionary troubles of France,not only all the churches were closed, but the Catholic and Protestantworship entirely forbidden; and, after the constitution of 1795, itwas at the hazard of one's life that either the mass was heard, orany religious duty performed. It is evident that Robespierre, whounquestionably had a design which is now generally understood, wasdesirous, on the day of the fete of the Supreme Being, to bring backpublic opinion to the worship of the Deity. Eight months before,we had seen the Bishop of Paris, accompanied by his clergy, appearvoluntarily at the bar of the Convention, to abjure the Christianfaith and the Catholic religion. But it is not as generally known,that at that period Robespierre was not omnipotent, and could notcarry his desires into effect. Numerous factions then disputed withhim the supreme authority. It was not till the end of 1793, and thebeginning of 1794, that his power was so completely established thathe could venture to act up to his intentions.Robespierre was then desirous to establish the worship of the SupremeBeing, and the belief of the immortality of the soul. He felt thatirreligion is the soul of anarchy, and it was not anarchy butdespotism which he desired; and yet the very day after thatmagnificent fete in honour of the Supreme Being, a man of the highestcelebrity in science, and as distinguished for virtue and probity asphilosophic genius, Lavoisier, was led out to the scaffold. On the dayfollowing that, Madame Elizabeth, that Princess whom the executionerscould not guillotine, till they had turned aside their eyes from thesight of her angelic visage, stained the same axe with her blood!--Anda month after, Robespierre, who wished to restore order for his ownpurposes--who wished to still the bloody waves which for years hadinundated the state, felt that all his efforts would be in vain ifthe masses who supported his power were not restrained and directed,because without order nothing but ravages and destruction can prevail.To ensure the government of the masses, it was indispensable thatmorality, religion, and belief should be established--and, to affectthe multitude, that religion should be clothed in external forms. "Myfriend," said Voltaire, to the atheist Damilaville, "after you havesupped on well-dressed partridges, drunk your sparkling champaigne,and slept on cushions of down in the arms of your mistress, I haveno fear of you, though you do not believe in God.---But if you areperishing of hunger, and I meet you in the corner of a wood, I wouldrather dispense with your company." But when Robespierre wished tobring back to something like discipline the crew of the vessel whichwas fast driving on the breakers, he found the thing was not so easyas he imagined. To destroy is easy--to rebuild is the difficulty. Hewas omnipotent to do evil; but the day that he gave the first signof a disposition to return to order, the hands which he himselfhad stained with blood, marked his forehead with the fatal sign ofdestruction.--_Memoirs of the Duchess of Abrantes._       *       *       *       *       *SOUNDS DURING THE NIGHT.The great audibility of sounds during the night is a phenomenon ofconsiderable interest, and one which had been observed even by theancients. In crowded cities or in their vicinity, the effect wasgenerally ascribed to the rest of animated beings, while in localitieswhere such an explanation was inapplicable, it was supposed to arisefrom a favourable direction of the prevailing wind. Baron Humboldtwas particularly struck with this phenomenon when he first heard therushing of the great cataracts of the Orinoco in the plain whichsurrounds the mission of the Apures. These sounds he regarded asthree times louder during the night than during the day. Some authorsascribed this fact to the cessation of the humming of insects, thesinging of birds, and the action of the wind on the leaves of thetrees, but M. Humboldt justly maintains that this cannot be the causeof it on the Orinoco, where the buzz of insects is much louder in thenight than in the day, and where the breeze never rises till aftersunset. Hence he was led to ascribe the phenomenon to the perfecttransparency and uniform density of the air, which can exist only atnight after the heat of the ground has been uniformly diffused throughthe atmosphere. When the rays of the sun have been beating on theground during the day, currents of hot air of different temperatures,and consequently of different densities, are constantly ascending fromthe ground and mixing with the cold air above. The air thus ceasesto be a homogeneous medium, and every person must have observed theeffects of it upon objects seen through it which are very indistinctlyvisible, and have a tremulous motion, as if they were "dancing inthe air." The very same effect is perceived when we look at objectsthrough spirits and water that are not perfectly mixed, or when weview distant objects over a red hot poker or over a flame. In allthese cases the light suffers refraction in passing from a medium ofone density into a medium of a different density, and the refractedrays are constantly changing their direction as the different currentsrise in succession. Analogous effects are produced when sound passesthrough a mixed medium, whether it consists of two different mediumsor of one medium where portions of it have different densities. Assound moves with different velocities through media of differentdensities, the wave which produces the sound will be partly reflectedin passing from one medium to the other, and the direction of thetransmitted wave changed; and hence in passing through such mediadifferent portions of the wave will reach the ear at different times,and thus destroy the sharpness and distinctness of the sound. Thismay be proved by many striking facts. If we put a bell in a receivercontaining a mixture of hydrogen gas and atmospheric air, the sound ofthe bell can scarcely be heard. During a shower of rain or of snow,noises are greatly deadened, and when sound is transmitted along aniron wire or an iron pipe of sufficient length, we actually hear twosounds, one transmitted more rapidly through the solid, and the othermore slowly through the air. The same property is well illustrated byan elegant and easily repeated experiment of Chladni's. When sparklingchampagne is poured into a tall glass till it is half full, the glassloses its power of ringing by a stroke upon its edge, and emits onlya disagreeable and a puffy sound. This effect will continue while thewine is filled with bubbles of air, or as long as the effervescencelasts; but when the effervescence begins to subside, the sound becomesclearer and clearer, and the glass rings as usual when the air-bubbleshave vanished. If we reproduce the effervescence by stirring thechampagne with a piece of bread the glass will again cease to ring.The same experiment will succeed with other effervescing fluids.--_SirDavid Brewster_.       *       *       *       *       *No man is so insignificant as to be sure his example can do no hurt.--_Lord Clarendon._       *       *       *       *       *THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.       *       *       *       *       *PADDY FOOSHANE'S FRICASSEE.Paddy Fooshane kept a shebeen house at Barleymount Cross, in which hesold whisky--from which his Majesty did not derive any large portionof his revenues--ale, and provisions. One evening a number of friends,returning from a funeral---all neighbours too--stopt at his house,"because they were in grief," to drink a drop. There was Andy Agar, astout, rattling fellow, the natural son of a gentleman residing nearthere; Jack Shea, who was afterwards transported for running away withBiddy Lawlor; Tim Cournane, who, by reason of being on his keeping,was privileged to carry a gun; Owen Connor, a march-of-intellectman, who wished to enlighten proctors by making them swallow theirprocesses; and a number of other "good boys." The night began to "raincats and dogs," and there was no stirring out; so the cards werecalled for, a roaring fire was made down, and the whisky and ale beganto flow. After due observation, and several experiments, a space largeenough for the big table, and free from the drop down, was discovered.Here six persons, including Andy, Jack, Tim--with his gun between hislegs--and Owen, sat to play for a pig's head, of which the livingowner, in the parlour below, testified, by frequent grunts, hisdispleasure at this unceremonious disposal of his property.Card-playing is very thirsty, and the boys were anxious to keep outthe wet; so that long before the pig's head was decided, a messengerhad been dispatched several times to Killarney, a distance of fourEnglish miles, for a pint of whisky each time. The ale also wentmerrily round, until most of the men were quite stupid, their facesswoln, and their eyes red and heavy. The contest at length wasdecided; but a quarrel about the skill of the respective partiessucceeded, and threatened broken heads at one time. At last Jack Sheaswore they must have something to eat;----him but he was starved withdrink, and he must get some rashers somewhere or other. Every onedeclared the same; and Paddy was ordered to cook some _griskins_forthwith. Paddy was completely nonplussed:--all the provisions weregone, and yet his guests were not to be trifled with. He made ahundred excuses--"'Twas late--'twas dry now--and there was nothing inthe house; sure they ate and drank enough." But all in vain. The ouldsinner was threatened with instant death if he delayed. So Paddycalled a council of war in the parlour, consisting of his wife andhimself."Agrah, Jillen, agrah, what will we do with these? Is there any meatin the tub? Where is the tongue? If it was yours, Jillen, we'd givethem enough of it; but I mane the cow's." (aside.)"Sure the proctors got the tongue ere yesterday, and you know therean't a bit in the tub. Oh the murtherin villains! and I'll engage'twill be no good for us, after all my white bread and the whisky.That it may pison 'em!""Amen! Jillen; but don't curse them. After all, where's the meat? I'msure that Andy will kill me if we don't make it out any how;--and hehasn't a penny to pay for it. You could drive the mail coach, Jillen,through his breeches pocket without jolting over a ha'penny. Coming,coming; d'ye hear 'em?""Oh, they'll murther us. Sure if we had any of the tripe I sentyesterday to the gauger.""Eh! What's that you say? I declare to God here's Andy getting up.We must do something. _Thonom an dhiaoul_, I have it. Jillen run andbring me the leather breeches; run woman, alive! Where's the block andthe hatchet? Go up and tell 'em you're putting down the pot."Jillen pacified the uproar in the kitchen by loud promises, andreturned to Paddy. The use of the leather breeches passed hercomprehension; but Paddy actually took up the leather breeches, toreaway the lining with great care, chopped the leather with the hatcheton the block, and put it into the pot as tripes. Considering thesituation in which Andy and his friends were, and the appetite of theIrish peasantry for meat in any shape--"a bone" being their _summumbonum_--the risk was very little. If discovered, however, Paddy'ssafety was much worse than doubtful, as no people in the world have agreater horror of any unusual food. One of the most deadly modes ofrevenge they can employ is to give an enemy dog's or cat's flesh; andthere have been instances where the persons who have eaten it, onbeing informed of the fact, have gone mad. But Paddy's habit ofpractical jokes, from which nothing could wean him, and his anger attheir conduct, along with the fear he was in did not allow him tohesitate a moment. Jillen remonstrated in vain. "Hould your tongue,you foolish woman. They're all as blind as the pig there. They'llnever find it out. Bad luck to 'em too, my leather breeches! that Igave a pound note and a hog for in Cork. See how nothing else wouldsatisfy 'em!" The meat at length was ready. Paddy drowned it inbutter, threw out the potatoes on the table, and served it up smokinghot with the greatest gravity."By ----," says Jack Shea, "that's fine stuff! How a man would dig atrench after that.""I'll take a priest's oath," answered Tim Cohill, the most irritableof men, but whose temper was something softened by the rich steam;--"Yet, Tim, what's a priest's oath? I never heard that.""Why, sure, every one knows you didn't ever hear of anything of good.""I say you lie, Tim, you rascal."Tim was on his legs in a few moments, and a general battle was aboutto begin; but the appetite was too strong, and the quarrel wassettled; Tim having been appeased by being allowed to explain apriest's oath. According to him, a priest's oath was this:--He wassurrounded by books, which were gradually piled up until they reachedhis lips. He then kissed the uppermost, and swore by all to thebottom. As soon as the admiration excited by his explanation, in thosewho were capable of hearing Tim, had ceased, all fell to work; andcertainly, if the tripes had been of ordinary texture, drunk as wasthe party, they would soon have disappeared. After gnawing at them forsome time, "Well," says Owen Connor, "that I mightn't!--but these arethe quarest tripes I ever eat. It must be she was very ould.""By ----," says Andy, taking a piece from his mouth to which he hadbeen paying his addresses for the last half hour, "I'd as soon beeating leather. She was a bull, man; I can't find the soft end at allof it.""And that's true for you, Andy," said the man of the gun; "and 'tisthe greatest shame they hadn't a bull-bait to make him tinder. Paddy,was it from Jack Clifford's bull you got 'em? They'd do for wadding,they're so tough.""I'll tell you, Tim, where I got them--'twas out of Lord Shannon'sgreat cow at Cork, the great fat cow that the Lord Mayor bought forthe Lord Lieutenant--_Asda churp naur hagushch_."[14]    [14] May it never come out of his body!"Amen, I pray God! Paddy. Out of Lord Shandon's cow? near the steeple,I suppose; the great cow that couldn't walk with tallow. By ----,these are fine tripes. They'll make a man very strong. Andy, give metwo or three _libbhers_ more of 'em.""Well, see that! out of Lord Shandon's cow: I wonder what they gaveher, Paddy. That I mightn't!--but these would eat a pit of potatoes.Any how, they're good for the teeth. Paddy, what's the reason theysend all the good mate from Cork to the Blacks?"But before Paddy could answer this question, Andy, who had beenendeavouring to help Tim, uttered a loud "_Thonom an dhiaoul!_ what'sthis? Isn't this flannel?" The fact was, he had found a piece ofthe lining, which Paddy, in his hurry, had not removed; and all wasconfusion. Every eye was turned to Paddy; but with wonderful quicknesshe said "'Tis the book tripe, _agragal_, don't you see?"--and actuallypersuaded them to it."Well, any how," says Tim, "it had the taste of wool.""May this choke me," says Jack Shea, "if I didn't think that 'twas apiece of a leather breeches when I saw Andy _chawing_ it."This was a shot between wind and water to Paddy. His self-possessionwas nearly altogether lost, and he could do no more than turn it offby a faint laugh. But it jarred most unpleasantly on Andy's nerves.After looking at Paddy for some time with a very ominous look, hesaid, "_Yirroo Pandhrig_ of the tricks, if I thought you were going onwith any work here, my soul and my guts to the devil if I would notcut you into garters. By the vestment I'd make a _furhurmeen_ of you.""Is it I, Andy? That the hands may fall off me!"But Tim Cohill made a most seasonable diversion. "Andy, when you die,you'll be the death of one fool, any how. What do you know that wasn'tever in Cork itself about tripes. I never ate such mate in my life;and 'twould be good for every poor man in the County of Kerry if hehad a tub of it."Tim's tone of authority, and the character he had got for learning,silenced every doubt, and all laid siege to the tripes again. Butafter some time, Andy was observed gazing with the most astonishedcuriosity into the plate before him. His eyes were rivetted onsomething; at last he touched it with his knife, arid exclaimed,"_Kirhappa, dar dhia!_"--[A button by G--.]"What's that you say?" burst from all! and every one rose in the bestmanner he could, to learn the meaning of the button."Oh, the villain of the world!" roared Andy, "I'm pisoned! Where's thepike? For God's sake Jack, run for the priest, or I'm a dead man withthe breeches. Where is he?--yeer bloods won't ye catch him, and Ipisoned?"The fact was, Andy had met one of the knee-buttons sewed into a pieceof the tripe, and it was impossible for him to fail discovering thecheat. The rage, however, was not confined to Andy. As soon as it wasunderstood what had been done, there was an universal rush for Paddyand Jillen; but Paddy was much too cunning to be caught, after thenarrow escape he had of it before. The moment after the discovery ofthe lining, that he could do so without suspicion, he stole from thetable, left the house, and hid himself. Jillen did the same; andnothing remained for the eaters, to vent their rage, but breakingevery thing in the cabin; which was done in the utmost fury. Andy,however, continued watching for Paddy with a gun, a whole month after.He might be seen prowling along the ditches near the shebeen-house,waiting for a shot at him. Not that he would have scrupled to enterit, were he likely to find Paddy there; but the latter was completelyon the _shuchraun_, and never visited his cabin except by stealth. Itwas in one of those visits that Andy hoped to catch him.--_Tait's Edinburgh Magazine_.       *       *       *       *       *CONVERSATIONS WITH LORD BYRON._By the Countess of Blessington_.One of our first rides with Lord Byron was to Nervi, a village onthe sea-coast, most romantically situated, and each turn of the roadpresenting various and beautiful prospects. They were all familiar tohim, and he failed not to point them out, but in very sober terms,never allowing any thing like enthusiasm in his expressions, thoughmany of the views might have excited it.His appearance on horseback was not advantageous, and he seemedaware of it, for he made many excuses for his dress and equestrianappointments. His horse was literally covered with various trappings,in the way of cavesons, martingales, and Heaven knows how many other(to me) unknown inventions. The saddle was _a la Hussarde_ withholsters, in which he always carried pistols. His dress consisted ofa nankeen jacket and trousers, which appeared to have shrunk fromwashing; the jacket embroidered in the same colour, and with threerows of buttons; the waist very short, the back very narrow, and thesleeves set in as they used to be ten or fifteen years before; a blackstock, very narrow; a dark-blue velvet cap with a shade, and a veryrich gold band and large gold tassel at the crown; nankeen gaiters,and a pair of blue spectacles, completed his costume, which was anything but becoming. This was his general dress of a morning forriding, but I have seen it changed for a green tartan plaid jacket. Hedid not ride well, which surprised us, as, from the frequent allusionsto horsemanship in his works, we expected to find him almost a Nimrod,It was evident that he had _pretensions_ on this point, though hecertainly was what I should call a timid rider. When his horse made afalse step, which was not unfrequent, he seemed discomposed; and whenwe came to any bad part of the road, he immediately checked his courseand walked his horse very slowly, though there really was nothing tomake even a lady nervous. Finding that I could perfectly manage (orwhat he called _bully_) a very highly-dressed horse that I daily rode,he became extremely anxious to buy it; asked me a thousand questionsas to how I had acquired such a perfect command of it, &c. &c. andentreated, as the greatest favour, that I would resign it to him as acharger to take to Greece, declaring he never would part with it, &c.As I was by no means a bold rider, we were rather amused at observingLord Byron's opinion of my courage; and as he seemed so anxious forthe horse, I agreed to let him have it when he was to embark. Fromthis time he paid particular attention to the movements of poorMameluke (the name of the horse), and said he should now feelconfidence in action with so steady a charger._April_--. Lord Byron dined with us today. During dinner he was asusual gay, spoke in terms of the warmest commendation of Sir WalterScott, not only as an author, but as a man, and dwelt with apparentdelight on his novels, declaring that he had read and re-read themover and over again, and always with increased pleasure. He saidthat he quite equalled, nay, in his opinion, surpassed Cervantes. Intalking of Sir Walter's private character, goodness of heart, &c.,Lord Byron became more animated than I had ever seen him; his colourchanged from its general pallid tint to a more lively hue, and hiseyes became humid: never had he appeared to such advantage, and itmight easily be seen that every expression he uttered proceeded fromhis heart. Poor Byron!--for poor he is even with all his genius, rank,and wealth--had he lived more with men like Scott, whose openness ofcharacter and steady principle had convinced him that they were inearnest in _their goodness_, and not _making believe_, (as he alwayssuspects good people to be,) his life might be different and happier!Byron is so acute an observer that nothing escapes him; all the shadesof selfishness and vanity are exposed to his searching glance, and themisfortune is, (and a serious one it is to him,) that when he findsthese, and alas! they are to be found on every side, they disgustand prevent his giving credit to the many good qualities that oftenaccompany them. He declares he can sooner pardon crimes, because theyproceed from the passions, than these minor vices, that spring fromegotism and self-conceit. We had a long argument this evening on thesubject, which ended, like most arguments, by leaving both of the sameopinion as when it commenced. I endeavoured to prove that crimes werenot only injurious to the perpetrators, but often ruinous to theinnocent, and productive of misery to friends and relations, whereasselfishness and vanity carried with them their own punishment, thefirst depriving the person of all sympathy, and the second exposinghim to ridicule which to the vain is a heavy punishment, but thattheir effects were not destructive to society as are crimes.He laughed when I told him that having heard him so often declaimagainst vanity, and detect it so often in his friends, I began tosuspect he knew the malady by having had it himself, and that I hadobserved through life, that those persons who had the most vanity werethe most severe against that failing in their friends. He wished toimpress upon me that he was not vain, and gave various proofs toestablish this; but I produced against him his boasts of swimming, hisevident desire of being considered more _un homme de societe_ than apoet, and other little examples, when he laughingly pleaded guilty,and promised to be more merciful towards his friends.Byron attempted to be gay, but the effort was not successful, and hewished us good night with a trepidation of manner that marked hisfeelings. And this is the man that I have heard considered unfeeling!How often are our best qualities turned against us, and made theinstruments for wounding us in the most vulnerable part, until,ashamed of betraying our susceptibility, we affect an insensibilitywe are far from possessing, and, while we deceive others, nourish insecret the feelings that prey _only_ on our own hearts!--_New Monthly Magazine._       *       *       *       *       *THE GATHERER._Canary Birds._--In Germany and the Tyrol, from whence the rest ofEurope is principally supplied with Canary birds, the apparatus forbreeding Canaries is both large and expensive.

At the close of the distribution, each personrepaired to the allotment with the figure corresponding to the oneupon his apple, and took possession of it for the ensuing year. Fouracres were reserved to pay the expenses of an entertainment at thehouse of the overseer of the Dolemoors, where the evening was spent infestivity.--Ibid._Anna Maria, Countess of Shrewsbury._--At Avington Park, in Hampshire,resided the notorious and infamous Anna-Maria, Countess of Shrewsbury,who held the horse of the Duke of Buckingham while he fought andkilled her husband.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:     http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want todownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regularsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and justdownload by the etext year. For example:     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, arefiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer partof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which isidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of singledigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  Forexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234or filename 24689 would be found at:     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689An alternative method of locating eBooks:     http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALLThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Postmaster's Daughter , by Louis TracyThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and withalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

AN OFFICIAL HOUSEBREAKER   XVIII. THE TRUTH AT LASTCHAPTER ITHE FACE AT THE WINDOWJohn Menzies Grant, having breakfasted, filled his pipe, lit it, andstrolled out bare-headed into the garden. The month was June, thatglorious rose-month which gladdened England before war-clouds darkenedthe summer sky. As the hour was nine o'clock, it is highly probable thatmany thousands of men were then strolling out into many thousands ofgardens in precisely similar conditions; but, given youth, good health,leisure, and a fair amount of money, it is even more probable that fewamong the smaller number thus roundly favored by fortune looked soperplexed as Grant.Moreover, his actions were eloquent as words. A spacious French windowhad been cut bodily out of the wall of an old-fashioned room, and was nowthrown wide to admit the flower-scented breeze. Between this window andthe right-hand angle of the room was a smaller window, square-paned, highabove the ground level, and deeply recessed--in fact just the sort ofwindow which one might expect to find in a farm-house built two centuriesago, when light and air were rigorously excluded from interiors. The twowindows told the history of The Hollies at a glance. The little one hadserved the needs of a "best" room for several generations of Sussexyeomen. Then had come some iconoclast who hewed a big rectangle throughthe solid stone-work, converted the oak-panelled apartment into a mostcomfortable dining-room, built a new wing with a gable, changed afarm-yard into a flower-bordered lawn, and generally played havoc withGeorgian utility while carrying out a determined scheme of landscapegardening.Happily, the wrecker was content to let well enough alone after enlargingthe house, laying turf, and planting shrubs and flowers. He found TheHollies a ramshackle place, and left it even more so, but with a new noteof artistry and several unexpectedly charming vistas. Thus, the bigdouble window opened straight into an irregular garden which mergedinsensibly into a sloping lawn bounded by a river-pool. The bank on theother side of the stream rose sharply and was well wooded. Above thecrest showed the thatched roofs or red tiles of Steynholme, which was avillage in the time of William the Conqueror, and has remained a villageever since. Frame this picture in flowering shrubs, evergreens, a fewchoice firs, a copper beech, and some sturdy oaks shadowing the lawn, andthe prospect on a June morning might well have led out into the open anyyoung man with a pipe.But John Menzies Grant seemed to have no eye for a scene that would havedelighted a painter. He turned to the light, scrutinized so closely astrip of turf which ran close to the wall that he might have beensearching for a lost diamond, and then peered through the lowermostleft-hand pane of the small window into the room he had just quitted.The result of this peeping was remarkable in more ways than one.A stout, elderly, red-faced woman, who had entered the room soon aftershe heard Grant's chair being moved, caught sight of the intent face. Shescreamed loudly, and dropped a cup and saucer with a clatter on to aJapanese tray.Grant hurried back to the French window. In his haste he did not notice along shoot of a Dorothy Perkins rose which trailed across his path, andit struck him smartly on the cheek."I'm afraid I startled you, Mrs. Bates," he said, smiling so pleasantlythat no woman or child could fail to put trust in him."You did that, sir," agreed Mrs. Bates, collapsing into the chair Granthad just vacated.Like most red-faced people, Mrs. Bates turned a bluish purple whenalarmed, and her aspect was so distressing now that Grant's smile wasbanished by a look of real concern."I'm very sorry," he said contritely. "I had no notion you were in theroom. Shall I call Minnie?"Minnie, it may be explained, was Mrs. Bates's daughter and assistant,the two, plus a whiskered Bates, gardener and groom, forming the domesticestablishment presided over by Grant."Nun-no, sir," stuttered the housekeeper. "It's stupid of me. But I'm notso young as I was, an' me heart jumps at little things."Grant saw that she was recovering, though slowly. He thought it best notto make too much of the incident; but asked solicitously if he might giveher some brandy.Mrs. Bates remarked that she was "not so bad as that," rose valiantly,and went on with her work. Her employer, who had gone into the gardenagain, saw out of the tail of his eye that she vanished with a half-ladentray. In a couple of minutes the daughter appeared, and finished theslight task of clearing the table; meanwhile, Grant kept away from thesmall window. Being a young man who cultivated the habit of observation,he noticed that Minnie, too, cast scared glances at the window. When thegirl had finally quitted the room, he laughed in a puzzled way."Am I dreaming, or are there visions about?" he murmured.Urged, seemingly, by a sort of curiosity, he surveyed the room a secondtime through the same pane of glass. Being tall, he had to stoopslightly. Within, on the opposite side of the ledge, he saw the tinybrass candlestick with its inch of candle which he had used over-nightwhile searching for a volume of Scott in the book-case lining theneighboring wall. Somehow, this simplest of domestic objects brought athrill of recollection."Oh, dash it all!" he growled good-humoredly, "I'm getting nervy. I mustchuck this bad habit of working late, and use the blessed hours ofdaylight."Yet, as he sauntered down the lawn toward the stream, he knew well thathe would do nothing of the sort. He loved that time of peace betweenten at night and one in the morning. His thoughts ran vagrom then.Fantasies took shape under his pen which, in the cold light of morning,looked unreal and nebulous, though he had the good sense to restraincriticism within strict limits, and corrected style rather than matter.He was a writer, an essayist with no slight leaven of the poet, and hadlearnt early that the everyday world held naught in common with thebrooding of the soul.But he was no long-haired dreamer of impossible things. Erect andsquare-shouldered, he had passed through Sandhurst into the army, aprofession abandoned because of its humdrum nature, when an unexpectedly"fat" legacy rendered him independent. He looked exactly what he was, ahealthy, clean-minded young Englishman, with a physique that led tooccasional bouts of fox-hunting and Alpine climbing, and a taste inliterature that brought about the consumption of midnight oil. Thislatter is not a mere trope. Steynholme is far removed from such modern"conveniences" as gas and electricity.At present he had no more definite object in life than to watch the troutrising in the pool. He held the fishing rights over half a mile of anoted river, but, by force of the law of hospitality, as it were, thestretch of water bordering the lawn was a finny sanctuary. Once, hehalted, and looked fixedly at a dormer window in a cottage just visibleabove the trees on the opposite slope. Such a highly presentable youngman might well expect to find a dainty feminine form appearing just inthat place, and eke return the greeting of a waved hand. But the windowremained blank--windows refused to yield any information thatmorning--and he passed on.The lawn dipped gently to the water's edge, until the close-clipped turfgave way to pebbles and sand. In that spot the river widened anddeepened until its current was hardly perceptible in fine weather. Whenthe sun was in the west the trees and roofs of Steynholme were soclearly reflected in the mirror of the pool that a photograph of thescene needed close scrutiny ere one could determine whether or not itwas being held upside down. But the sun shone directly on the water now,so the shelving bottom was visible, and Grant's quick eye was drawn to arope trailing into the depths, and fastened to an iron staple drivenfirmly into the shingle.He was so surprised that he spoke aloud."What in the world is that?" he almost gasped; a premonition of evil wasso strong in him that he actually gazed in stupefaction at a blob ofwater and a quick-spreading ring where a fat trout rose lazily inmidstream.Somehow, too, he resisted the first impulse of the active side of histemperament, and did not instantly tug at the rope.Instead, he shouted:--"Hi, Bates!"An answering hail came from behind a screen of laurels on the right ofthe house. There lay the stables, and Bates would surely be grooming thecob which supplied a connecting link between The Hollies and the railwayfor the neighboring market-town.Bates came, a sturdy block of a man who might have been hewn out of aSussex oak. His face, hands, and arms were the color of oak, and he movedwith a stiffness that suggested wooden joints.Evidently, he expected an order for the dogcart, and stood stock stillwhen he reached the lawn. But Grant, who had gathered his wits, summonedhim with crooked forefinger, and Bates jerked slowly on."What hev' ye done to yer face, sir?" he inquired.Grant was surprised. He expected no such question."So far as I know, I've not been making any great alteration init," he said."But it's all covered wi' blood," came the disturbing statement.A handkerchief soon gave evidence that Bates was not exaggerating.Miss--or is it Madam?--Dorothy Perkins can scratch as well as look sweet,and a thorn had opened a small vein in Grant's cheek which bled to asurprising extent."Oh, it is nothing," he said. "I remember now--a rose shoot caught me asI went back into the dining-room a moment ago. I shouted for you to comeand see _this_."Soon the two were examining the rope and the staple."Now who put _that_ there?" said Bates, not asking a question but ratherstating a thesis."It was not here yesterday," commented his master, accepting all thatBates's words implied."No, sir, that it wasn't. I was a-cuttin' the lawn till nigh bed-time,an' it wasn't there then."Grant was himself again. He stooped and grabbed the rope."Suppose we solve the mystery," he said."No need to dirty your hands, sir," put in Bates. "Let I haul 'un in."In a few seconds the oaken tint in his face grew many shades lighter."Good Gawd!" he wheezed. At the end of the rope was the body of a woman.There are few more distressing objects than a drowned corpse. Onthat bright June morning a dreadful apparition lost little of itsgrim repulsiveness because the body was that of a young andgood-looking woman.If one searched England it would be difficult to find two men ofdiffering temperaments less likely to yield to the stress of even themost trying circumstance than Grant and Bates, yet, during some agonizedmoments the one, of tried courage and fine mettle, was equally horrifiedand shaken as the other, a gnarled and hard-grained rustic. It was hefrom whom speech might least be expected who first found his tongue.Bates, who had stooped, straightened himself slowly."By gum!" he said, "this be a bad business, Mr. Grant. Who is she? She'snone of our Steynholme lasses."Still Grant uttered no word. He just looked in horror at the poor huskof a woman who in life had undoubtedly been beautiful. She was well butquietly dressed, and her clothing showed no signs of violence. Theall-night soaking in the river revealed some pitiful little femininesecrets, such as a touch of make-up on lips and cheeks, and the darkroots of abundant hair which had been treated chemically to lighten itscolor. The eyes were closed, and for that Grant was conscious of a deepthankfulness. Had those sightless eyes stared at him he felt he wouldhave cried aloud in terror. The firm, well-molded lips were open, asthough uttering a last protest against an untimely fate. Of course, bothmen were convinced that murder had been done. Not only were arms andbody bound in a manner that was impossible of accomplishment by the deadwoman herself, but an ugly wound on the smooth forehead seemed toindicate that she had been stunned or killed outright before being flunginto the river.And then, the rope and the staple suggested an outlandish, maniacaldisposal of the victim. Here was no effort at concealment, but rather amaking sure, in most brutal and callous fashion, that early discoverymust be unavoidable.The bucolic mind works in well-scored grooves. Receiving no assistancefrom his master, Bates pulled the body a little farther up on the stripof gravel so that it lay clear of the water."I mum fetch t' polis," he said.The phrase, with its vivid significance, seemed to galvanize Grant into aspecies of comprehension."Yes," he agreed, speaking slowly, as though striving to measure theeffect of each word. "Yes, go for the police, Bates. This foul crime mustbe inquired into, no matter who suffers. Go now. But first bring a rugfrom the stable. You understand? Your wife, or Minnie, must not be toldtill later. They must not see. Mrs. Bates is not so well to-day.""Not so well! Her ate a rare good breakfast for a sick 'un!"Bates was recovering from the shock, and prepared once more to take aninterest in the minor features of existence. Among these he countedability to eat as a sure sign of continued well-being in man or beast.Grant, too, was slowly regaining poise."I hardly know what I am saying," he muttered. "At any rate, bring a rug.I'll mount guard till you return with the policeman. There can be nodoubt, I suppose, that this poor creature is dead.""Dead as a stone," said Bates with conviction. "Why, her's bin in therehours," and he nodded toward the water. "Besides, if I knows anythink ofa crack on t'head, her wur outed before she went into t'river.... But whoi' t'world can she be?""If you don't fetch that rug I'll go for it myself," said Grant,whereupon Bates made off.He was soon back again with a carriage rug, which Grant helped him tospread over the dripping body. Then he hastened to the village, taking apath that avoided the house.The lawn and river bank of The Hollies could only be overlooked from thesteep wooded cliff opposite, and none but an adventurous boy would everthink of climbing down that almost impassable rampart of rock,brushwood, and tree-roots. At any rate, when left alone with the ghastlyevidence of a tragedy, Grant troubled only to satisfy himself that no onewas watching from the house. Assured on that point, he lifted a corner ofthe rug, and, apparently, forced himself to scrutinize the dead woman'sface. He seemed to search therein for some reassuring token, but foundnone, because he shook his head, dropped the rug, and walked a few pacesdejectedly.Then, hardly knowing what he was about, he relighted his pipe, but hadhardly put it in his mouth before he knocked out the tobacco.Clearly, he was thinking hard, mapping out some line of conduct, andthe outlook must have been dark indeed, judging by his somber andundecided aspect.More than once he looked up at the attic window of the cottage which haddrawn his eyes before tragedy had come so swiftly to his very feet. But,if he hoped to see anyone, he was disappointed, though, in the event, itproved that his real fear was lest the person he half expected to seeshould look out.He was not disturbed in that way, however. Fish rose in the river; birdssang in the trees; a water-wagtail skipped nimbly from rock to rock inthe shallows; honey-laden bees hummed past to the many hives in thepostmaster's garden. These were the normal sights and sounds of a Junemorning--that which was abnormal and almost grotesque in its horror layhidden beneath the carriage rug.To and fro he walked in that trying vigil, carrying the empty pipe in onehand while, with the other, he dabbed the handkerchief at the cut on hisface. He was aware of some singular change in the quality of the sunlightpouring down on lawn and river and trees. Five minutes earlier it hadspread over the landscape a golden bloom of the tint of champagne; now itwas sharp and cold, a clear, penetrating radiance in which colors werevivid and shadows black. He was in no mood to analyze emotions, or hemight have understood that the fierce throbbing of his heart hadliterally thinned the blood in his veins and thus affected even hissight. He only knew that in this crystal atmosphere the major issues oflife presented themselves with a new and crude force. At any rate, hemade up his mind that the course suggested by truth and honor was theonly one to follow, and that, in itself, was something gained.By the time Bates returned, accompanied by the village policeman, and twoother men carrying a stretcher, Grant was calmer, more self-contained,than he had been since that hapless body was dragged from the depths. Hewas not irresponsive, therefore, to the aura of official importance whichenveloped the policeman; he sensed a certain uneasiness in Bates; he evennoted that the stretcher was part of the stock in trade of Hobbs, thelocal butcher, and ordinarily bore the carcase of a well-fed pig.These details were helpful. Naturally, Bates had explained his errand,and the law, in the person of the policeman, was prepared for alleventualities."This is a bad business, Mr. Grant," began the policeman, producing anote-book, and moistening the tip of a lead pencil with his tongue. Beinga Sussex man, he used the same phrase as Bates. In fact, Grant wasgreeted by it a score of times that day."Yes," agreed Grant. "I had better tell you that I have recognized thepoor lady. Her name is Adelaide Melhuish. Her residence is in theRegent's Park district of London."Robinson, the policeman, permitted himself to look surprised. He was, infact, rather annoyed. Bates's story had prepared him for a first-ratedetective mystery. It was irritating to have one of its leading featurescleared up so promptly."Oh," he said, drawing a line under the last entry in the note-book,and writing the date and hour in heavy characters beneath. "Marriedor single?""Married, but separated from her husband when last I had news of her.""And when was that, sir?""Nearly three years ago.""And you have not seen her since?""No.""You didn't see her last night?"Grant positively started, but he looked at the policeman squarely."It is strange you should ask me that," he said. "Last night, whilesearching for a book, I saw a face at the window. It was that window,"and four pairs of eyes followed his pointing finger. "The face, I nowbelieve, was that of the dead woman. At the moment, as it vanishedinstantly, I persuaded myself that I was the victim of some trick of theimagination. Still, I opened the other window, looked out and listened,but heard or saw nothing or no one. As I say, I fancied I had imaginedthat which was not. Now I know I was wrong.""About what o'clock would this be, Mr. Grant?""Shortly before eleven. I came in at a quarter past ten, and began towork. After writing steadily for a little more than half an hour, Iwanted to consult a book, and lighted a candle which I keep for thatpurpose. I found the book, and was about to blow out the candle when Isaw the face."Robinson wrote in his note-book:--"Called to The Hollies to investigate case of supposed murder. Body ofwoman found in river. Mr. Grant, occupying The Hollies, says that woman'sname is Adelaide Melhuish"--at this point he paused to ascertain thespelling--"and he saw her face at a window of the house at 10.45 P.M.,last night.""Well, sir, and what next?" he went on."It seems to me that the next thing is to have the unfortunate ladyremoved to some more suitable place than the river bank," said Grant,rather impatiently. "My story can wait, and so can Bates's. He knows allthat I know, and has probably told you already how we came to discoverthe body. You can see for yourself that she must have been murdered. Itis an extraordinary, I may even say a phenomenal crime, which certainlycannot be investigated here and now. I advise you to have the body takento the village mortuary, or such other place as serves local needs inthat respect, and summon a doctor. Then, if you and an inspector willcall here, I'll give you all the information I possess, which is verylittle, I may add."Robinson began solemnly to jot down a summary of Grant's words, andthereby stirred the owner of The Hollies to a fury which was repressedwith difficulty. Realizing, however, the absolute folly of expressing anyresentment, Grant turned, and, without meaning it, looked again in thedirection of the cottage on the crest of the opposite bank. This time agirl was leaning out of the dormer window. She had shaded her eyes with ahand, because the sun was streaming into her face, but when she saw thatGrant was looking her way she waved a handkerchief.He fluttered his own blood-stained handkerchief in brief acknowledgment,and wheeled about, only to find P. C. Robinson watching him furtively,having suspended his note-taking for the purpose.CHAPTER IIP.C. ROBINSON "TAKES A LINE""It will help me a lot, sir," he said, "if you tell me now what you knowabout this matter. If, as seems more than likely, murder has been done, Idon't want to lose a minute in starting my inquiries. In a case of thissort I find it best to take a line, and stick to it."His tone was respectful but firm. Evidently, P.C. Robinson was not one tobe trifled with. Moreover, for a sleuth whose maximum achievementhitherto had been the successful prosecution of a poultry thief, it wassignificant that the unconscious irony of "a case of this sort" shouldhave been lost on him."Do you really insist on conducting your investigation while the body islying here?" demanded Grant, deliberately turning his back on the girl inthe distant cottage."Not that, sir--not altogether--but I must really ask you to clear up oneor two points now.""For goodness' sake, what are they?""Well, sir, in the first place, how did you come to find the body?""I walked out into the garden after finishing breakfast a fewminutes ago, and noticed the rope attached to the staple, just asyou see it now.""Did you walk straight here?""No. Not exactly. I was--er--curious about the face I saw, or thought Isaw, last night, and looked into the room through the same window. Bydoing so I scared Mrs. Bates, who was clearing the table, and shescreamed--""Her would, too," put in Bates. "Her'd take 'ee for Owd Ben's ghost.""You shut up, Bates," said the policeman. "Don't interrupt Mr. Grant."Grant was conscious of an undercurrent of suspicion in theconstable's manner. He was wroth with the man, but recognized that hehad to deal with narrow-minded self-importance, so contrived again tocurb his temper."I am not acquainted with old Ben or his ghost," he said quietly. "I canonly tell you that I went inside to reassure Mrs. Bates, and thenstrolled slowly to this very spot. Naturally, I could not miss the ropeand the stable. To my mind, it was not intended that I or anyone elseshould miss them. I regarded them as so peculiar that I shouted forBates. He came at once, and drew the body out of the water.""And you recognized the dead woman as the one you saw last night?""Yes.""At about ten minutes to eleven?""Yes.""Is it likely, sir, that any other person saw her in these grounds abit earlier?""What do you mean?""Well, sir, I can't put it much plainer. Could anybody else have seen herhere, say about 10.15?"Grant met the policeman's inquiring glance squarely before he answered."It is possible, of course," he said, "but most unlikely.""Were you alone here at that hour?"Again Grant sought and held that inquisitive gaze, held it until Robinsonaffected to consult his notes. There was a moment of tense silence. Thenthe reply came with an icy stubbornness that was not to be denied."I decline absolutely to be cross-examined about my movements. If you areunable or unwilling to order the removal of the body, I'll telegraph tothe chief of police at Knolesworth, and ask him to act. Further, I shallrequest Dr. Foxton to examine the poor lady's injuries. It strikes me asa monstrous proceeding that you should attempt to record my evidence atthis moment, and I refuse to become a party to it.""Now, then, Robinson, stop yer Sherlock Holmes work, an' help me to liftthis poor woman on to the stretcher," said Bates gruffly.The policeman's red face grew a shade deeper with annoyance, but he hadthe sense to avoid a scene. He was not popular in the village, and waswell aware that the two rustics pressed into service as stretcher-bearerswould joyfully retail the fact that he had been "set down a peg or two byMr. Grant.""I'll do all that's necessary in that way, sir," he said stiffly. "Isuppose you have no objection to my askin' if you noticed any strangefootprints on the ground hereabouts?""That was the first thing I looked for, both here and outside thewindow--the latter, of course, for another reason. I found none. Thesestones would show no signs. The ground is so dry that even the five mennow present leave no traces, but I remember seeing in the bed of thestream certain marks which, unfortunately, were obliterated when Bateshauled the body ashore. They were valueless, however--shapelessindentations in the mud and sand.""Were they wide apart or close together, sir?""Quite irregular. No one could judge by the length of the stride whetherthey were made by the feet of a man or a woman, if that is what you havein mind ... but, really--"Grant's impatient motion was not to be misunderstood. Robinson stooped,removed the rug, and unfastened the rope, after noting carefully how itwas tied, a point which he called on the others to observe as well. Thenhe and the villagers went away with their sad burden, the rug beingrequisitioned once more to hide that wan face from the vivid sunshine.Bates had a trick of grasping a handful of his short whiskers whenpuzzled; he did so now; it seemed to be an unconscious effort to pull hisjaws apart in order to emit speech."I've a sort of idee, sir," he said slowly, "that Robinson saw DorisMartin on the lawn with 'ee last night."Grant turned on his henchman in a sudden heat of anger."Miss Martin's name must be kept out of this matter," he growled.But Sussex is not easily browbeaten when it thinks itself in the right."All very well a-sayin' that, sir, but a-doin' of it is a bird of anothercolor," argued Bates firmly."How did you know that Miss Martin was here?""Bless your heart, sir, how comes it that us Steynholme folk knoweverythink about other folk's business? Sometimes we know more'n theyknows themselves. You've not walked a yard wi' Doris that the women'stittle-tattle hasn't made it into a mile."No man, even the wisest, likes to be told an unpalatable truth. For a fewseconds, Grant was seriously annoyed with this village Solon, and nearlyblurted out an angry command that he should hold his tongue. Luckily,since Bates was only trying to be helpful, he was content to saysarcastically:"Of course, if you are so well posted in my movements last night, you canassure the coroner and the Police that I did not strangle some strangewoman, tie a rope around her, and throw her in the river.""Me an' my missis couldn't help seein' you an' Doris a-lookin' at thestars through a spyglass when us were goin' to bed," persisted Bates. "Weheerd your voices quite plain. Once 'ee fixed the glass low down, an'said, 'That's serious. It's late to-night.' An' I tell 'ee straight, sir,I said to the missis:--'It will be serious, an' all, if Doris's fathercatches her gallivantin' in our garden wi' Mr. Grant nigh on teno'clock.' Soon after that 'ee took Doris as far as the bridge. The windowwas open, an' I heerd your footsteps on the road. You kem' in, closed thewindow, an' drew a chair up to the table. After that, I fell asleep."Perturbed and anxious though he was, Grant could hardly fail to see thatBates meant well by him. The mental effort needed for such a long speechsaid as much. The allusion to Sirius, amusing at any other time, was nowmost valuable, because an astronomical almanac would give the hour atwhich that brilliant star became visible. Other considerations yielded atonce, however, to the fear lest Robinson and his note-book were alreadybusy at the post office. Without another word, he hurried away by theside-path through the evergreens, leaving Bates staring after him, and,with more whisker-pulling, examining the rope and staple, which, by thepoliceman's order, were not to be disturbed.Grant reached the highroad just as Robinson and the men with thestretcher were crossing a stone bridge spanning the river about a hundredyards below The Hollies. A slight, youthful, and eminently attractivefemale figure, walking swiftly in the opposite direction, came in sightat the same time, and Grant almost groaned aloud when the newcomer stoodstock still and looked at the mournful procession. He, be it remembered,was somewhat of an idealist and a poet; it grieved his spirit that thosetwo women, the quick and the dead, should meet on the bridge. He took itas a portent, almost a menace, he knew not of what. He might haveforeseen that unhappy eventuality, and prevented it, but his brainrefused to work clearly that morning. A terrible and bizarre crime hadbemused his faculties. He seemed to be in a state of waking nightmare.He was stung into impetuous action by seeing the policeman halt andexchange some words with the girl. He began to run, with the quitedefinite if equally mad intent of punching Robinson into reasonablebehavior. He was saved from an act of unmitigated folly by the girlherself. She caught sight of him, apparently broke off her talk with thepoliceman abruptly, and, in her turn, took to her heels.Thus, on that strip of sun-baked road, with its easy gradient to thecrown of the bridge, there was the curious spectacle offered by two menjogging along with a corpse on a stretcher, a young man and a youngwoman running towards each other, and a discomfited representative ofthe law, looking now one way and now the other, and evidently undecidedwhether to go on or return. Ultimately, it would seem, Robinson wentwith the stretcher-bearers, because Grant and the girl saw no more ofhim for the time.Grant had received several shocks since rising from the breakfast-table,but it was left for Doris Martin, the postmaster's daughter, toadminister not the least surprising one.Though almost breathless, and wide-eyed with horror, her opening wordswere very much to the point."How awful!" she cried. "Why should any-one in Steynholme want to kill agreat actress like Adelaide Melhuish?"Now, the name of the dead woman was literally the last thing Grantexpected to hear from this girl's lips, and the astounding factmomentarily banished all other worries."You knew her?" he gasped."No, not exactly. But I couldn't avoid recognizing her when she asked forher letters, and sent a telegram.""But--""Oh, Robinson told me she was dead. I see now what is puzzling you.""It is not quite that. I mean, why didn't you tell me she was inSteynholme? Has she been staying here any length of time?"The girl's pretty face crimsoned, and then grew pale."I--had no idea--she was--a friend of yours, Mr. Grant," she stammered."She used to be a friend, but I have not set eyes on her during the pastthree years--until last night.""Last night!""After you had gone home. I was doing some work, and, having occasion toconsult a book, lighted a candle, and put it in the small window near thebookcase. Then I fancied I saw a woman's face, _her_ face, peering in,and was so obsessed by the notion that I went outside, but everything wasso still that I persuaded myself I was mistaken.""Oh, is that what it was?"Grant threw out his hands in a gesture that was eloquent of some feelingdistinctly akin to despair."You don't usually speak in enigmas, Doris," he said. "What in the worlddo you mean by saying:--'Oh, is that what it was?'"The girl--she was only nineteen, and never before had aught of tragicmystery entered her sheltered life--seemed to recover herself-possession with a quickness and decision that were admirable."There is no enigma," she said calmly. "My room overlooks your lawn.Before retiring for the night I went to the window, just to have anotherpeep at Sirius and its changing lights, so I could not help seeing youfling open the French windows, stand a little while on the step, and goin again.""Ah, you saw that? Then I have one witness who will help to dispel thatstupid policeman's notion that I killed Miss Melhuish, and hid her bodyin the river at the foot of the lawn, hid it with such care that thefirst passerby must find it."Every human being has three distinct personalities. Firstly, there is theman or woman as he or she really is; secondly, there is the much superiorindividual as assessed personally; thirdly, and perhaps the mostimportant in the general scheme of things, there is the sameindividuality as viewed by others. For an instant, the somewhat idealizedfigure which John Menzies Grant offered to a pretty and intelligent butinexperienced girl was in danger of losing its impressiveness. But, sinceGrant was not only a good fellow but a gentleman, his next thoughtrestored him to the pedestal from which, all unknowing, he had nearlybeen dethroned."That is a nice thing to say," he cried, with a short laugh of sheervexation. "Here am I regarding you as a first-rate witness in my behalf,whereas my chief worry is to keep you out of this ugly businessaltogether. Forgive me, Doris! Never before have I been so bothered.Honestly, I imagined I hadn't an enemy in the world, yet someone hastried deliberately to saddle me with suspicion in this affair. Not that Iwould give real heed to that consideration if it were not for the unhappyprobability that, strive as I may, your name will crop up in connectionwith it. What sort of fellow is this police constable? Do you think hewould keep his mouth shut if I paid him well?"Grant was certainly far from being in his normal state of mind, or hewould have caught the tender gleam which lighted the girl's eyes when sheunderstood that his concern was for her, not for himself. As it was,several things had escaped him during that brief talk on the sunlit road.On her part, Doris Martin was now in full control of her emotions, andshe undoubtedly took a saner view of a difficult situation."Robinson is a vain man," she said thoughtfully. "He will not let go thechance of notoriety given him by the murder of a well-known actress. Wasshe really murdered? Robinson said so when I met him on the bridge.""I'm afraid he is justified in that belief, at any rate.""Well, Mr. Grant, what have we to conceal? I was in your garden at arather late hour, I admit, but one cannot watch the stars by day, and abig telescope with its tripod is not easily carried about. Of course,father will be vexed, because, as it happens, I did not tell him I wascoming out. But that cannot be helped. As it happens, I can fix the timeyou opened your window almost to a minute, because the church clock hadchimed the quarter just before you appeared."Grant, however, was not to be soothed by this matter-of-fact reasoning."I am vexed at the mere notion of your name, and possibly your portrait,appearing in the newspapers," he protested. "Miss Melhuish was acelebrated actress. The press will make a rare commotion about her death.Look at the obvious questions that will be raised. What was she doinghere? Why was she found in the river bordering the grounds of my house?Don't you see? I had to decide pretty quickly whether or not I wouldadmit any previous knowledge of her. I suppose I acted rightly?""Why hide anything, Mr. Grant? Surely it is always best to tellthe truth!"He looked into those candid blue eyes, and drew from their limpid depthsan element of strength and fortitude."By Jove, Doris, small wonder if a jaded man of the world, such as I waswhen I came to Steynholme, found new faith and inspiration in friendshipwith you," he said gratefully. "But I am wool-gathering all the time thismorning, it would seem. Won't you come into the house? If we have todiscuss a tragedy we may as well sit down to it.""No," she said, with the promptitude of one who had anticipated theinvitation. "I must hurry home. There are accounts to be made up. AndRobinson and others will be telegraphing to Knoleworth and London. I mustattend to all that, because dad gets flustered if several messages arehanded in at the same time.""Come and have tea, then, about four o'clock. The ravens will havefled by then.""The ravens?""The police, you dear child, and the reporters, and thephotographers--the flock of weird fowl which gathers from all points ofthe compass when the press gets hold of what is called 'a first-ratestory,' By midday I shall be in the thick of it. But, thank goodness,they will know nothing to draw them your way until the inquest takesplace, and not even then if _I_ can manage it.""Don't mind me, Mr. Grant. You must not keep anything back on my account.I'll try and come at four. But I may be very busy in the office. By theway, you ought to know. Miss Melhuish came here on Sunday evening. Shearrived by the train from London. I--happened to notice her as she passedin the Hare and Hounds 'bus. She took a room there, at the inn, I mean,and came to the post office twice yesterday. When I heard her name Irecognized her at once from her photographs. And--one more thing--Iguessed there was something wrong when I saw you, and Robinson, andBates, and the other men standing near a body lying close to the river.That is why I came out. Now I really must go. Good-by!"She hastened away. Grant stood in the road and looked after her.Apparently she was conscious that he had not stirred, because, when shereached the bridge, she turned and waved a hand to him. She wasexceedingly graceful in all her movements. She wore a simple white linenblouse and short white skirt that morning, with brown shoes and stockingswhich harmonized with the deeper tints of her Titian red hair. As shepaused on the bridge for a second or two, silhouetted against the sky,she suggested to Grant's troubled mind the Spirit of Summer.Returning to the house by way of the main gate, which gave on to thehighway, he bethought him of Mrs. Bates and Minnie. They must beenlightened, and warned as to the certain influx of visitors. He resolvednow to tackle a displeasing task boldly. Realizing that the worstpossible policy lay in denying himself to the representatives of thepress, who would simply ascertain the facts from other sources, andunconsciously adopt a critical vein with regard to himself, he determinedto go to the other extreme, and receive all comers.Of course, there would be reservations in his story. That is what everyman decides who faces a legal inquiry as a novice. It is a decision toooften regretted in the light of after events.Meanwhile, P. C. Robinson was hard at work. In his own phrase, he "took aline," and the trend of his thoughts was clearly demonstrated when asuperintendent motored over from Knoleworth in response to a telegram. Hetold how the body had been found, and then went into details gathered inthe interim."Miss Melhuish hadn't been in the village five minutes," he said, "beforeshe asked Mr. Tomlin, landlord of the Hare and Hounds, where The Hollieswas, and how long Mr. Grant had lived in the village. She went for a walkin the direction of his house almost at once. Tomlin watched her untilshe crossed the bridge. That was on Sunday evening."Superintendent Fowler allowed his placid features to show a flicker ofsurprise. In that rural district an actual, downright murder was almostunknown. Even a case of manslaughter, arising out of a drunken quarrelbetween laborers at fair-time, did not occur once in five years."Oh, she came here on Sunday, did she?" he asked."Yes, sir. Yesterday, too, she spoke of Mr. Grant to Hobbs, the butcher,and Siddle, the chemist."The two were closeted in the sitting-room of Robinson's cottage, whichwas situated on the main road near the bridge. It faced the short, steephill overhanging the river. A triangular strip of turf formed the villagegreen, and the houses of Steynholme clustered around this and a side roadclimbing the hill. From door and windows nearly every shop and residencein the village proper could be seen. In front of the Hare and Hounds hadgathered a group of men, and it was easy to guess the topic they werediscussing. The superintendent, who did not know any of them, had nodifficulty in identifying Hobbs, who looked a butcher and was dressedlike one, or Tomlin, who was either born an innkeeper or had been coachedin the part by a stage expert. A thin, sharp-looking person, pallid andblack-haired, wearing a morning coat and striped trousers, must surely beSiddle, while a fourth, the youngest there, and of rather sporting guise,was apparently a farmer of a horse-breeding turn."Who is that fellow in the leggings?" inquired the superintendentirrelevantly. He was looking through the window, and Robinson consideredthat the question showed a lack of interest in his statement, though hedared not hint at such a thing."He's a Mr. Elkin, sir," he said. "As I was saying--""How does Mr. Elkin make a living?" broke in the other."He breeds hacks and polo ponies," said Robinson, rather shortly."Ah, I thought so. Well, go on with your story."Robinson was irritated, and justly so. His superior had put him off his"line." He took it up again sharply, leaving out of court for the momentthe various rills of evidence which, in his opinion, united into aswift-moving stream."The fact is, sir," he blurted out, "there is an uncommonly strong caseagainst Mr. John Menzies Grant.""Phew!" whistled the superintendent."I think you'll agree with me, sir, when you hear what I've gatheredabout him one way and another."Robinson was sure of his audience now. Quite unconsciously, he hadapplied the chief canon of realism in art. He had conveyed his effect byone striking note. The rest of the picture was quite subsidiary to thebold splurge of color evoked by actually naming the man he suspected ofmurdering Adelaide Melhuish.CHAPTER IIITHE GATHERING CLOUDSThus, it befell that Grant was not worried by officialdom until longafter his housekeeper and her daughter had recovered from the shock oflearning that they were, in a sense, connected at first hand with aghastly and sensational crime.Like Bates and their employer, neither Mrs. Bates nor Minnie had heard orseen anything overnight which suggested that a woman was being foullydone to death in the grounds attached to the house. As it happened,Minnie's bedroom, as well as that occupied by her parents, overlooked thelawn and river. Grant's room lay in a gable which commanded, theentrance. He had chosen it purposely because it faced the rising sun. Theother members of the household, therefore, though in bed, had quite asgood an opportunity as he, working in the dining-room beneath, of havingtheir attention drawn to sounds disturbing the peace of the night in aquiet and secluded spot. Moreover, none of them was asleep. Minnie Bates,in particular, said that the "grandfather's clock" in the hall strucktwelve before she "could close an eye."At last, just as Grant was rising from an almost untasted luncheon, Mrs.Bates, with a voice of scare, announced "the polis," and P.C. Robinsonintroduced Superintendent Fowler. This time Grant did not resentquestions. He expected them, and had made up his mind to give full anddetailed answers. Of course, the finding of the body was again describedminutely. The superintendent, a man of experience, one whose manner wasnot fox-like and irritating like his subordinate's, paid close attentionto the face at the window."There seems to be little room for doubt that Miss Melhuish did enteryour grounds about a quarter to eleven last night," he said thoughtfully."You recognized her at once, you say?""I imagined so. Until this horrible thing became known I had persuadedmyself that the vision was a piece of sheer hallucination.""Let us assume that the lady actually came here, and looked in.Evidently, her face was sufficiently familiar that you should knowinstantly who this unusual visitor was. I understand, though, that youhad not the least notion she was staying in Steynholme?""Not the least.""How long ago is it since you last saw her?""Nearly three years.""You were very well acquainted with her, then, or you could not haveglanced up from your table, seen someone staring at you through awindow, and said to yourself, as one may express it:--'That is AdelaideMelhuish'.""We were so well acquainted that I asked the lady to be my wife.""Ah," said the superintendent.His placid, unemotional features, however, gave no clew to hisopinions. Not so P. C. Robinson, who tried to look like a judge,whereas he really resembled a bull-terrier who has literally, notfiguratively, smelt a rat.Despite his earlier good resolutions, Grant was horribly impatient ofthis inquisition. He admitted that the superintendent was carryingthrough an unpleasant duty as inoffensively as possible, but the attitudeof the village policeman was irritating in the extreme. Nothing wouldhave tended so effectively to relieve his surcharged feelings as tosupply P. C. Robinson then and there with ample material for establishinga charge of assault and battery."That is not a remarkable fact, if regarded apart from to-day'stragedy," he said, and there was more than a hint of soul-weariness inhis voice. "Miss Melhuish was a very talented and attractive woman. Ifirst met her as the outcome of a suggestion that one of my books shouldbe dramatized, a character in the novel being deemed eminently suitablefor her special role on the stage. The idea came to nothing. She wasappearing in a successful play at the time, and was rehearsing itssuccessor. Meanwhile, I--fell in love with her, I suppose, and shecertainly encouraged me in the belief that she might accept me. I dideventually propose marriage. Then she told me she was married already.It was a painful disillusionment--at the time. I only saw her, to speakto, once again.""Did she reveal her husband's name?""Yes--a Mr. Ingerman."The superintendent looked grave. That was a professional trick of his. Hehad never before in his life heard of Mr. Ingerman, but encouraged thenotion that this gentleman was thoroughly, and not quite favorably, knownto him. Sometimes it happened that a witness, interpreting this sapientlook by the light of his or her personal and intimate knowledge, wouldblurt out certain facts, good or bad as the case might be, concerning theperson under discussion.But Grant remained obstinately silent as to the qualities of thisdoubtful Ingerman, so Mr. Fowler scribbled the name in a note-book, andwas particular as to whether it ended in one "n" or two.Still, he carried other shots in his locker. In fact, Mr. Fowler, had hetaken in youth to nicer legal subtleties than handcuffs and summonses,would have become a shrewd lawyer."We'll leave Mr. Ingerman for the moment," he said, implying, of course,that on returning to him there might be revelations. "I gather that youand Miss Melhuish did not agree, shall I put it? as to the precisebearing of the marriage tie on your love affair?""I'm afraid I don't quite follow your meaning," and Grant's tonestiffened ominously, but his questioner was by no means abashed."I have no great acquaintance with the stage or its ways, but I havealways understood that divorce proceedings among theatrical folk were,shall we say? more popular than, in the ordinary walks of life," saidMr. Fowler.Grant's resentment vanished. The superintendent's calm method, hisinterpolated apologies, as it were, for applying the probe, werebeginning to interest him."Your second effort is more successful, superintendent," he said dryly."Miss Melhuish did urge me to obtain her freedom. It was, she thought,only a matter of money with Mr. Ingerman, and she would be given materialfor a divorce.""Ah," murmured Fowler again, as though the discreditable implicationfitted in exactly with the life history of a noted scoundrel in a written_dossier_ then lying in his office. "You objected, may I suggest, to thatsomewhat doubtful means of settling a difficulty?""Something of the kind."Assuredly, Grant did not feel disposed to lay bare his secret feelingsbefore this persuasive superintendent and an absurdly conceited villageconstable. Love, to him, was an ideal, a blend of mortal passion andimmortal fire. But the flame kindled on that secret altar had scorchedand seared his soul in a wholly unforeseen way. The discovery thatAdelaide Melhuish was another man's wife had stunned him. It was notuntil the fire of sacrifice had died into parched ashes that its earlierbanality became clear. He realized then that he had given his love to aphantom. By one of nature's miracles a vain and selfish creature wasgifted in the artistic portrayal of the finer emotions. He had worshipedthe actress, the mimic, not the woman herself. At any rate, that was howhe read the repellent notion that he should bargain with any man for thesale of a wife."You might be a trifle more explicit, Mr. Grant," said thesuperintendent, almost reproachfully."In what direction? Surely a three-years-old love affair can have littlepractical bearing on Miss Melhuish's death?""What, then, may I ask, could bear on it more forcibly? The ladyadmittedly visits you, late at night, and is found dead in a riverbordering the grounds of your house next morning, all the conditionspointing directly to murder. Moreover--it is no secret, as the truth mustcome out at the inquest--she had passed a good deal of her time while inSteynholme, unknown to you, in making inquiries concerning you, yourhabits, your surroundings, your friends. Surely, Mr. Grant, you must seethat the history of your relations with this lady, though, if I may usethe phrase, perfectly innocent, may possibly supply that which is atpresent lacking--a clew, shall I term it, to the motive which inspiredthe man, or woman, who killed her?"P.C. Robinson was all an eye and an ear for this verbal fencing-match.It was not that he admired his superior's skill, because such finessewas wholly beyond him, but his suspicious brain was storing up Grant'sadmissions "to be used in evidence" against him subsequently. His ownbrief record of the conversation would have been:--"The prisoner, afterbeing duly cautioned, said he kept company with the deceased aboutthree years ago, but quarreled with her on hearing that she was amarried woman."The superintendent seldom indulged in so long a speech, but he wasdetermined to force his adversary's guard, and sought to win hisconfidence by describing the probable course to be pursued by thecoroner's inquest. But Grant, like the dead actress, had two sides to hisnature. He was both an idealist and a stubborn fighter, and ideality hadbeen shattered for many a day by that grewsome object hauled in thatmorning from the depths of the river."I am willing to help in any shape or form, but can only repeat thatMiss Melhuish and I parted as described. I should add that I have never,to my knowledge, met her husband.""He may be dead.""Possibly. You may know more about him than I.""Even then, we have not traveled far as yet."Fowler was puzzled, and did not hesitate to show it. He believed, notwithout reasonable cause, that this young man was concealing some elementin the situation which might prove helpful in the quest for the murderer.He resolved to strike off along a new track."I am informed," he went on, speaking with a deliberateness meant tobe impressive, "that you did entertain another lady as a visitorlast night."Grant allowed his glance to dwell on Robinson for an instant. Hitherto hehad ignored the man. Now he surveyed him as if he were a viper."It will be a peculiarly offensive thing if the personality of a helplessand unoffending girl is brought into this inquiry," he cried. "'Broughtin' is too mild--I ought to say 'dragged in.' As it happens, astronomy isone of my hobbies. Last evening, as the outcome of a chat on the subject,Doris Martin, daughter of the local postmaster, came here to view Siriusthrough an astronomical telescope. There is the instrument," and hepointed through P.C. Robinson to a telescope on a tripod in a corner ofthe room. The gesture was eloquent. The burly policeman might have been asheet of glass. "As you see, it is a solid article, not easily liftedabout. It weighs nearly a hundred-weight.""Why is it so heavy?"The superintendent had a knack of putting seemingly irrelevant questions.Robinson had been disconcerted by it earlier in the day, but Grant seemedto treat the interruption as a sensible one."For observation purposes an astronomical telescope is not of much useunless the movement of the earth is counteracted," he said. "Usually, thedome of an observatory swings on a specially contrived axis, but that isa very expensive structure, so my telescope is governed by a clockworkattachment and moves on its own axis."Mr. Fowler nodded. He was really a very well informed man for a countrypolice-officer; he understood clearly."Miss Martin came here about a quarter to ten," continued Grant, "andleft within three-quarters of an hour. She did not enter the house. Shewas watching Sirius while I explained the methods whereby the distance ofany star from the earth is computed and its chemical analysisdetermined--""Most instructive, I'm sure," put in the superintendent.He smiled genially, so genially that Grant dismissed the notion that theother might, in vulgar parlance, be pulling his leg."Well, that is the be-all and end-all of Miss Martin's presence. It wouldbe cruel, and unfair, if a girl of her age were forced into a distastefulprominence in connection with a crime with which she is no more relatedthan with Sirius itself."The older man shook his head in regretful dissent."That is just where you and I differ," he said. "That very point leads usback to your past friendship with the dead woman.""Why?""Surely you see, Mr. Grant, that Miss Melhuish might be, probably was,watching your star-gazing, especially as your pupil chanced to be, shallI say, a remarkably attractive young lady ... No, no," for Grant's angerwas unmistakable--"It does no good to blaze out in protest. An unhappycombination of circumstances must be faced candidly. Here are you and apretty girl together in a garden at a rather late hour, and a woman whomyou once wanted to marry spying on you, in all likelihood. I've met a fewcoroner's juries in my time, and not one of them but would deem thecoincidence strange, to put it mildly.""What in Heaven's name are you driving at?""You must not impute motives, sir. I am seeking them, notsupplying them.""But what am I to say?""Perhaps you will now tell me just how Miss Melhuish and you parted."The fencers were coming to close quarters. Even P. C. Robinson had toadmit that his "boss" had cornered the suspect rather cleverly.Grant realized that there was no room for squeamishness in this affair.If he did not speak out now, his motives might be woefully misunderstood."We parted in wrath and tears," he said sadly. "Miss Melhuish could not,or did not, appreciate my scruples. She professed to be in love with me.She even went so far as to threaten suicide. I--hardly believed in hersincerity, but thought it advisable to temporize, and asked for a fewdays' delay before we came to a final decision. We met again, as I havesaid, and discussed matters in calmer mood. Ultimately, she professedagreement with my point of view, and we parted, ostensibly to remain goodfriends, but really to separate for ever.""Thank you. That's better. What _was_ your point of view, Mr. Grant?""Surely I have made it clear. I could not regard my wife as purchasable.The proposed compact was, I believe, illegal. But that consideration didnot sway me. I had been dreaming, and thought I was roaming in anenchanted garden. I awoke, and found myself in a morass."The superintendent nodded again. Singularly enough, Grant's somewhathigh-flown simile appeared to satisfy his craving for light."Do you mind telling me--is there another woman?" he demanded, with oneof those rapid transitions of topic in which he excelled."No," said Grant."You see what I am aiming at. Let us suppose that Miss Melhuish never, inher own mind, abandoned the hope that some day the tangle wouldstraighten itself. Women are constituted that way. If her husband is nowdead, and she became free, she might wish to renew the old ties, but,being proud, would want to ascertain first whether or not any other womanhad come into your life.""I follow perfectly," said Grant, with some bitterness. "She would beconsumed with jealousy because my companion in the garden last nighthappened to be a charming girl of nineteen.""It is possible.""So she went off and got someone to kill her, and tie her body with arope, and arrange a dramatic setting whereby it would be patent to themeanest intelligence that I was the criminal?"Mr. Fowler smiled, and looked fixedly at P.C. Robinson."No, no," he said, quite good-humoredly. "That would be carrying realismto extremes. Still, I am convinced, Mr. Grant, that this mystery is boundup in some way with your romance of three years ago. At present, I admit,I am working in the dark."He rose. Apparently, the interview was at an end. But, while pocketinghis note-book, he said suddenly:--"The inquest will open at three o'clock tomorrow. You will be present, ofcourse, Mr. Grant?""I suppose it is necessary.""Oh, yes. You found the body, you know. Besides, you may be the onlyperson who can give evidence of identity. In fact, you and the doctorwill be the only witnesses called.""Dr. Foxton?""Yes.""Has he made a post-mortem?""He is doing so now. You see, there is clear indication that thisunfortunate lady was struck a heavy blow, perhaps killed, before she wasput in the river.""Good Heavens! Somehow, I was so stunned that I never thought of lookingfor signs of any injury of that sort."Grant's horror-stricken air was so spontaneous that it probably justifiedthe severe test of that unexpected disclosure. He was so unnerved by itthat the two policemen had gone before he could frame another question.Once they were in the open road, and well away from The Hollies,Robinson ventured to open his mouth."He's a clever one is Mr. Grant," he said meaningly. "You handled him abit of all right, sir, but he didn't tell you everything he knew, not bylong chalks."The superintendent walked a few yards in silence. Even when he spoke, hisgaze was introspective, and seemed to ignore his companion."I'm inclined to agree with you, Robinson," he said, speaking veryslowly. "We have a big case in our hands, a very big case. We must treadwarily. You, in particular, mixing with the village folk, should listento all but say nothing. Don't depend on your memory. Write down what youhear and see. People's actual words, and the exact time of an occurrence,often have an extraordinarily illuminating effect when weighedsubsequently. But don't let Mr. Grant think you suspect him. There is nooccasion for that--yet."Mr. Fowler could be either blunt or cryptic in speech at will. In onemood he was the straightforward, outspoken official; in another thepotential lawyer. P.C. Robinson, though unable to describe his chief'serratic qualities, was unpleasantly aware of them. He was not quitesure, for instance, whether the superintendent was encouraging orwarning him, but, being a dogged person, resolved to "take his ownline," and stick to it.Grant passed a distressful day. Work was not to be thought of, andreading was frankly impossible. His mind dwelt constantly on the tragedywhich had come so swiftly and completely into his ordered life. He couldnot wholly discard the nebulous theory suggested by SuperintendentFowler, but the more he surveyed it the less reasonable it seemed. Theone outstanding fact in a chaos of doubt was that someone haddeliberately done Adelaide Melhuish to death. The murderer had beenactuated by a motive. What was that motive? Surely, in a place likeSteynholme no man could come and go without being seen, and the murderermust be a stranger to the district, because it was ridiculous to imaginethat he was one of the residents.Yet that was exactly what a dunderheaded policeman believed. P.C.Robinson had revealed himself by many a covert glance and prick-earedmovement. Grant squirmed uneasily at the crass conceit, as there was nodenying that circumstances tended towards a certain doubt, if no more, inregard to his own association with the crime.The admission called for a fierce struggle with his pride, but he forcedhimself to think the problem out in all its bearings, and the folly ofadopting the legendary policy of the chased ostrich became manifest.What, then, should he do? He thought, at first, of invoking the aid of abarrister friend, who could watch the inquest in his behalf.Nevertheless, he shrank from that step, which, to his super-sensitivenature, implied the need of legal protection, and he fiercely resentedthe mere notion of such a thing. But something must be done. Once themurderer was laid by the heels his own troubles would vanish, and thestorm raised by the unhappy fate of Adelaide Melhuish would subside intoa sad memory.He was wrestling with indecision when a newspaper reporter called. Grantreceived the journalist promptly, and told him all the salient facts,suppressing only the one-time prospect of a marriage between himself andthe famous actress.The reporter went with him to the river, and scrutinized the marks, nowrapidly becoming obliterated, of the body having been drawn ashore."The rope and iron staple, I understand, were taken from the premises ofa man who lets boats for hire on the dam quarter of a mile away," hesaid casually.Grant was astounded at his own failure to make any inquiry whatsoeverconcerning this vital matter. He laughed grimly."You can imagine the state of my mind," he said, "when I assure youthat, until this moment, it never occurred to me even to ask where thesearticles came from or what had become of them.""I can sympathize with you," said the journalist. "A brutal murder seemshorribly out of place in this environment. It is a mysterious businessaltogether. I wonder if Scotland Yard will take it up."Grant surprised him by clapping him on the back."By Jove, my friend, the very thing! Of course, such an investigationrequires bigger brains than our local police are endowed with. ScotlandYard _must_ take it up. I'll wire there at once. If necessary, I'll payall expenses."The newspaper man had his doubts. The "Yard," he said, acted in theprovinces only if appealed to by the authorities directly concerned. ButGrant was not to be stayed by a trifle like that. He hurried to the postoffice, hoping that Doris Martin might walk back with him.The girl and her father were busy behind the counter when he entered. Henoticed that Doris was rather pale. She was about to attend to him, butMr. Martin intervened. It struck Grant that the postmaster was purposelypreventing his daughter from speaking to him.For some inexplicable reason, he felt miserably tongue-tied, and wascontent to write a message to the Chief Commissioner of Police, London,asking that a skilled detective should be sent forthwith to Steynholme.Mr. Martin read it gravely, stated the cost, and procured the requisitestamps. In the event, Grant quitted the place without exchanging a wordwith Doris, while her father, usually a chatty man, said not a syllablebeyond what was barely needed.As he passed down the hill and by the side of the Green he was aware ofbeing covertly watched by many eyes. He saw P.C. Robinson peering frombehind a curtained window. Siddle, the chemist, came to the shop door,and looked after him. Hobbs, the butcher, ceased sharpening a knife andgazed out. Tomlin, landlord of the Hare and Hounds Inn, surveyed him fromthe "snug."These things were not gracious. Indeed, they were positively maddening.He went home, gave an emphatic order that no one, except Miss Martin, ifshe called, was to be admitted and savagely buried himself in a treatiseon earth-tides.But that day of events had not finished for him yet. He had, perforce,eaten a good meal, and was thinking of going to the post office in orderto clear up an undoubted misapprehension in Mr. Martin's mind, whenMinnie Bates came with a card."If you please, sir," said the girl, "this gentleman is very pressing.He says he's sure you'll give him an interview when you see his name."So Grant looked, and read:--MR. ISIDOR G. INGERMAN_Prince's Chambers, London, W._CHAPTER IVA CABALGrant stared again at the card. A tiny silver bell seemed to tinkle asort of warning in a recess of his brain. The name was not engraved incopper-plate, but printed in heavy type. Somehow, it looked ominous. Hisfirst impression was to bid Minnie send the man away. He distrusted anyfirst impression. It was the excuse of mediocrity, a sign of weakness.Moreover, why shouldn't he meet Isidor G. Ingerman?"Show him in," he said, almost gruffly, thus silencing shy intuition, asit were. He threw the card on the table.Mr. Ingerman entered. He did not offer any conventional greeting, butnodded, or bowed. Grant could not be sure which form of salutation wasintended, because the visitor promptly sat down, uninvited.Minnie hesitated at the door. Her master's callers were usually cheerfulBohemians, who chatted at sight. Then she caught Grant's eye, and wentout, banging the door in sheer nervousness.Still Mr. Ingerman did not speak. If this was a pose on his part, heerred. Grant had passed through a trying day, but he owned the musclesand nerves of an Alpine climber, and had often stared calmly down a wallof rock and ice which he had just conquered, when the least slip wouldhave meant being dashed to pieces two thousand feet below.There was some advantage, too, in this species of stage wait. It enabledhim to take the measure of Adelaide Melhuish's husband, if, indeed, thevisitor was really the man he professed to be.At first sight, Isidor G. Ingerman was not a prepossessing person.Indeed, it would be safe to assume that if, by some trick of fortune, heand not Grant were the tenant of The Hollies, P.C. Robinson would havehaled him to the village lock-up that very morning. It was not that hewas villainous-looking, but rather that he looked capable of villainy. Hewas a tall, slender, rather stooping man, with a decidedly well-molded,if hawk-like, face. His aspect might be described as saturnine. Possibly,when he smiled, this morose expression would vanish, and then he mighteven win a favorable opinion. He had brilliant black eyes, close set, andan abundant crop of black hair, turning gray, which, in itself, lent anair of distinction. His lips were thin, his chin slightly prominent. Hewas well dressed, and managed a hat, stick, and gloves with ease.Altogether, he reminded Grant of a certain notable actor who isinvariably cast for the role of a gentlemanly scoundrel, but who, inprivate life, is a most excellent fellow and good citizen. Oddly enough,Grant recognized in him, too, the type of man who would certainly haveappealed to Adelaide Melhuish in her earlier and impressionable years.Meanwhile, the visitor, finding that the clear-eyed young man seated inan easy chair (from which he had not risen) could seemingly regard himwith blank indifference during the next hour, thought fit to saysomething."Is my name familiar to you, Mr. Grant?" he inquired.The voice was astonishingly soft and pleasant, and the accent agreeablyrefined. Evidently, there were surprising points about Mr. Ingerman. Longafterwards, Grant learned, by chance, that the man had been an actorbefore branching off into that mysterious cosmopolitan profession knownas "a financier.""No," said Grant. "I have heard it very few times. Once, about threeyears ago, and today, when I mentioned it to the police."The other man's sallow cheeks grew a shade more sallow. Grant supposedthat this slight change of color indicated annoyance. Of course, theassociation of ideas in that curt answer was intolerably rude. But Granthad been tried beyond endurance that day. He was in a mood to be brusquewith an archbishop."We can disregard your confidences, or explanations, to thepolice," said Ingerman smoothly. "Three years ago, I suppose, mywife spoke of me?""If you mean Miss Adelaide Melhuish--yes.""I do mean her. To be exact, I mean the lady who was murdered outsidethis house last night."Grant realized instantly that Isidor G. Ingerman was a foeman worthy ofeven a novelist's skill in repartee. Thus far, he, Grant, had been merelyuncivil, using a bludgeon for wit, whereas the visitor was making playwith a finely-tempered rapier."Now that you have established your identity, Mr. Ingerman, perhaps youwill tell me why you are here," he said."I have come to Steynholme to inquire into my wife's death.""A most laudable purpose. I was given to understand, however, that at onetime you took little interest in her living. I have not seen Mrs.Ingerman for three years--until last night, that is--so there is achance, of course, that husband and wife may have adjusted theirdifferences. Is that so?""Until last night!" repeated Ingerman, almost in a startled tone. "Youadmit that?"Grant turned and pointed."I saw, or fancied I saw, her face at that window," he said. "Shelooked in on me about ten minutes to eleven. I was hard at work, butthe vision, as it seemed then, was so weird and unexpected, that I wentstraight out and searched for her. Perhaps 'searched' is not quite theright word. To be exact, I opened the French window, stood there, andlistened. Then I persuaded myself that I was imagining a vain thing,and came in.""What was she doing here?""I don't know.""She arrived in Steynholme on Sunday evening, I am told.""I heard that, too.""You imply that you did not meet her?""No need to imply anything, Mr. Ingerman. I did not meet her. Beyondthe fanciful notion that I had seen her ghost last night, the first Iknew of her presence in the village was when I recognized her dead bodythis morning.""Strange as it may sound, I am inclined to believe you."Grant said nothing. He wanted to get up and pitch Ingerman into the road."But who else will take that charitable view?" purred the other, inthat suave voice which so ill accorded with his thin lips and slightlyhooked nose."I really don't care," was the weary answer."Not at the moment, perhaps. You have had a trying day, no doubt. Myvisit at its close cannot be helpful. But--""I am feeling rather tired mentally," interrupted Grant, "so you willoblige me by not raising too many points at once. Why should you imaginethat conversation with you in particular should add to my supposeddistress?""Doesn't it?""No.""Why, then, may I ask, do you so obviously resent my questions? Who hasso much right to put them as I?"Grant found that he must bestir himself. Thus far, the honors lay withthis rather sinister-looking yet quiet-mannered visitor."I am sorry if anything I have said lends color to that belief," heanswered. "Candidly, I began by assuming that you forfeited any legalright years ago to interfere in behalf of Miss Melhuish, living or dead.Let us, at least, be candid with each other. Miss Melhuish herself toldme that you and she had separated by mutual consent.""Allow me to emulate your candor. The actual fact is that you weaned mywife's affections from me.""That is a downright lie," said Grant coolly.Ingerman's peculiar temperament permitted him to treat this graveinsult far more lightly than Grant's harmless, if irritating, referenceto the police."Let us see just what 'a lie' signifies," he said, almost judicially. "Ifa lady deserts her husband, and there is good reason to suspect that sheis, in popular phrase, 'carrying on' with another man, how can thehusband be lying if he charges that man with being the cause of thedomestic upheaval?""In this instance a hypothetical case is not called for. Three years ago,Mr. Ingerman, you had parted from your wife. Your name was nevermentioned. Apparently, none in my circle had even heard of you. MissMelhuish had won repute as a celebrated actress. I met her, in a sense,professionally. We became friends. I fancied I was in love with her. Iproposed marriage. Then, and not until then, did the ghost of Mr."--Grantbent forward, and consulted the card--"Mr. Isidor G. Ingerman intrude.""So marriage was out of the question?""If you expect an answer--yes."Ingerman rested the handle of his stick against his lips."That isn't how the situation was represented to me at the time," he saidthoughtfully.Grant was still sore with the recollection of the way in which thesuperintendent of police had forced him to confess the pitiful schemewhereby a woman in love had sought to gain her ends. He refused to sullyher memory a second time that day, even to gain the upper hand in thistroublesome controversy."I neither know nor care what representations may have been made to you,"he retorted. "I merely tell you the literal truth.""Possibly. Possibly. It was not I who used the word 'lie,' remember. Butif you are ungracious enough to refuse to withdraw the offensive phrase,let it pass. We are not in France. This deadly business will be foughtout in the law courts. I am here to-night of my own initiative. I thoughtit only fair and reasonable that you and I should meet before we arebrought face to face at a coroner's inquest, and, it may be, in an AssizeCourt.... No, no, Mr. Grant. Pray do not put the worst construction on mywords. _Someone_ murdered my wife. If the police show intelligence andreasonable skill, _someone_ will be tried for the crime. You and I willcertainly be witnesses. That is what I meant to convey. The doubt in mymind was this--whether to be actively hostile or passively friendly tothe man who, next to me, was interested in the poor woman now lying deadin a wretched stable of this village."The almost diabolical cleverness of this long speech, delivered withoutheat and with singularly adroit stress on various passages, was revealedby its effect on Grant. He was at once infuriated and puzzled. Ingermanwas playing him as a fisherman humors a well-hooked salmon. The simileactually occurred to him, and he resolved to precipitate matters bycoming straightway to the landing-net."Is your friendship purchasable?" he inquired, making the rush withoutfurther preamble."My wife was, I was led to believe," came the calm retort.Grant threw scruples to the wind now. Adelaide Mulhuish was beingdefamed, not by him, but by her husband."We are at cross purposes," he said, weighing each word. "Your wife, whoknew your character fairly well, I am convinced, thought that you wereopen to receive a cash consideration for your connivance in a divorce.""She had told me plainly that she would never live with me again. I wastoo fair-minded a man to place obstacles in the way when she wished toregain her freedom.""So it was true, then. What was the price? One thousand--two? I am not amillionaire.""Nor am I. As a mere matter of pounds, shillings, and pence, it was aserious matter for me when my wife's earnings ceased to come into thecommon stock.""My first, if rather vague, estimate of you was the correct one. You area good bit of a scoundrel, and, if I guess rightly, a would-beblackmailer.""You are talking at random, Mr. Grant. The levying of blackmail connotesthat the person bled desires that some discreditable, or dangerous, factshould be concealed.""Such is not my position.""I--I wonder.""I can relieve you of any oppressive doubt. I informed the police somefew hours ago that you have appeared already in a similar role.""Oh, you did, did you?" snarled Ingerman, suddenly abandoning his pose,and gazing at Grant with a curiously snakelike glint in his black eyes."Yes. It interested them, I fancied."Grant was sure of his man now, and rather relieved that the battle ofwits was turning in his favor."So you have begun already to scheme your defense?""Hadn't you better go?" was the contemptuous retort."You refuse to answer any further questions?""I refuse to buy your proffered friendship--whatever that may mean.""Have I offered to sell it?""I gathered as much."Ingerman rose. He was still master of himself, though his lanky body wastaut with rage. He spoke calmly and with remarkable restraint."Go through what I have said, and discover, if you can, the slightesthint of any suggested condonation of your offenses, whether avowed ormerely suspected. I shall prove beyond dispute that you came between meand my wife. Don't hug the delusion that your three years' limit willsave you. It will not. I wish you well of your attempt to prove that Iwas a consenting party to divorce proceedings. I came here to look youover. I have done so, and have arrived at a very definite opinion. I,also, have been interviewed by the police, and any unfavorable views theymay have formed concerning me as the outcome of your ex parte statementsare more than counteracted by the ugly facts of a ghastly murder. Youwere here shortly before eleven o'clock last night. My wife was here,too, and alive. This morning she was found dead, by you. At eleveno'clock last night I was playing bridge with three city men in my flat.When the news of the murder reached me to-day my first thought, after theshock of it had passed, was:--'That fellow, Grant, may be innocentlyinvolved in a terrible crime, and I may figure as the chief witnessagainst him.' I am not speaking idly, as you will learn to your cost.Yet, when I come on an errand of mercy, you have the impudence to chargeme with blackmail. You are in for a great awakening. Be sure of that!"And Isidor G. Ingerman walked out, leaving Grant uncomfortably aware thathe had not seen the last of an implacable and bitter enemy.It was something new and very disturbing for a writer to find himself inthe predicament of a man with an absolutely clear conscience yetperilously near the meshes of the criminal law. He had often analyzedsuch a situation in his books, but fiction diverged so radically fromhard fact that the sensation was profoundly disconcerting, to say theleast. He did not go to the post office. He was not equal to any moreverbal fire-works that evening. So he lit a pipe, and reviewed Ingerman'swell-rounded periods very carefully, even taking the precaution to jotdown exact, phrases. He analyzed them, and saw that they were capable oftwo readings. Of course, it could not be otherwise. The plausible rascalmust have conned them over until this essential was secured. Grant evenwent so far as to give them a grudging professional tribute. They held acanker of doubt, too, which it was difficult to dissect. Their veiledthreats were perplexing. While their effect, as apart from literalsignificance, was fresh in his mind, he made a few notes of differentinterpretations.He went to bed rather early, but could not sleep until the small hours.Probably his rest, such as it was, would have been even more disturbedhad he been able to accompany Ingerman to the Hare and Hounds Inn.A small but select company had gathered in the bar parlor. The two hoursbetween eight and ten were the most important of the day to the landlord,Mr. Tomlin. It was then that he imparted and received the tit-bits oflocal gossip garnered earlier, the process involving a good deal of playwith shining beer-handles and attractively labeled bottles.But this was a special occasion. Never before had there been aSteynholme murder before the symposium. Hitherto, such a grewsome topicwas supplied, for the most part, by faraway London. To-night theeeriness and dramatic intensity of a notable crime lay at the very doorsof the village.So Tomlin was more portentous than usual; Hobbs, the butcher, moreassertive, Elkin, the "sporty" breeder of polo ponies, more inclined to"lay odds" on any conceivable subject, and Siddle, the chemist, areserved man at the best, even less disposed to voice a definite opinion.Elkin was about twenty-five years of age, Siddle looked younger than hisprobable thirty-five years, while the others were on the stout andprosperous line of fifty.They were discussing the murder, of course, when Ingerman entered, andordered a whiskey and soda. Instantly there was dead silence. Looks andfurtive winks were exchanged. There had been talk of a detective beingemployed. Perhaps this was he. Mr. Tomlin knew the stranger's name, as hehad taken a room, but that was the extent of the available information."A fine evenin', sir," said Tomlin, drawing a cork noisily. "Looks asthough we were in for a spell o' settled weather.""Yes," agreed Ingerman, summing up the conclave at a glance. "Somehow,such a lovely night ill accords with the cause of my visit toSteynholme.""In-deed, sir?""Well, you and these other gentlemen may judge for yourselves. It willbe no secret tomorrow. I am the husband of the lady who was found in theriver outside Mr. Grant's residence this morning."Sensation, as the descriptive reporters put it. Mr. Tomlin was dumbly butunanimously elected chairman of the meeting, and was vaguely aware of hisresponsibilities. He drew himself a fresh glass of bitter."You don't tell me, sir!" he gasped. "Well, the idee! The pore lady'sletters were addressed to Miss Adelaide Melhuish. Perhaps you don't know,sir, that she stayed here!""Oh, yes. I was told that by the local police-constable. Have I, by anychance, been given her room?""No, sir. Not likely. It's locked, and the police have the key till theinquest is done with.""As for the name," explained Ingerman, in his suave voice, "that was amere stage pseudonym, an adopted name. My wife was a famous actress, andthere is a sort of tacit agreement that a lady in the theatricalprofession shall be known to the public as 'Miss' rather than 'Mrs.'""Well, there!" wheezed Tomlin. "Who'd ever ha' thought it?"The landlord was not quite rising to the occasion. He was, in fact,stunned by these repeated shocks. So Hobbs took charge."It's a sad errand you're on, sir," he said. "Death comes to all of us,man an' beast alike, but it's a terrible thing when a lady like Miss--Mrs. ----""Ingerman is my name, but my wife will certainly be alluded to by thepress as Miss Melhuish.""When a lady like Miss Melhuish is knocked on the 'ead like a--"Mr. Hobbs hesitated again. He also felt that the situation was ratherbeyond him."But my wife was flung into the river and drowned," said Ingerman sadly."No, sir. She was killed fust. It was a brutal business, so I'm told.""Do you mean that she was struck, her skull battered?" came the demand,in an awed and soul-thrilling whisper."Yes, sir. An' the wust thing is, none of us can guess who couldha' done it.""Lay yer five quid to one, Hobbs, that the police cop the scoundrel aforethis day fortnight," cried Elkin noisily.Then Mr. Siddle put in a mild word."Gentlemen," he said, "let me remind you that we four will probably bejurors at the inquest."That was a sobering thought. Elkin subsided, and Hobbs looked criticallyat the remains of a gill of beer.Ingerman took stock of the chemist. He might easily induce the others tobelieve that Grant was the real criminal, but the quiet man in the blackmorning-coat and striped cloth trousers was of finer metal. He knewinstantly that if he could persuade this one "probable juror" of Grant'sguilt, the remainder would follow his lead like a flock of sheep.But there was no need to hurry. Next day's inquest would be a mereformality. The real struggle would begin a week or a fortnight later."You have said a very wise thing, sir," he murmured appreciatively. "Evenmy feelings must be kept under better control. But this is no ordinarymurder. Before it is cleared up there will be astounding revelations.Mark the word--astounding."Hobbs, whose heavy cheeks were of a brick-red tint, almost startled theconclave by a sudden outburst which gave him an apoplectic appearance."You're too kind'earted, Siddle," he cried. "Wot's the use of talkin'rubbish. We all know where the body was found. We all know that DorisMartin an' Mr. Grant were a'sweet-'eartin' in the garden--""Look here, Hobbs, just keep Doris Martin's name out of it!" shoutedElkin, smiting the table with his fist till the glasses danced."Gentlemen!" protested Siddle gently."It's all dashed fine, but I'm not--" blustered Elkin. He yielded toIngerman's outstretched hand."I seem to have brought discord into a friendly gathering," came themournful comment. "Such was far from being my intent. Landlord, the roundis on me, with cigars. Now, let us talk of anything but this horror. If Iforget myself again, pull me up short, and fine me another round."Siddle half rose, but thought better of it. Evidently, he meant to usehis influence to stop foolish chatter.CHAPTER VTHE SEEDS OP MISCHIEFIngerman was a shrewder judge of human nature than the village chemist.As well try to stem the flowing tide as stop tongues from wagging whensuch a theme offered.Tomlin created a momentary diversion by clattering in the bar. After thisprofessional interlude, Ingerman ignored his own compact."I'm sure you local residents will be interested, at least, in hearingsomething of my wife's career," he said. "There never was a more lovableand gracious woman, and no couple could be more united than she and Itill some three years ago. Then came a break. She was independent of me,of course. She was a celebrity, I a mere nobody, best known, if at all,as 'Miss Melhuish's husband.' Nevertheless, we were devoted to each otheruntil, to her and my lasting misfortune, a certain author wrote a bookwhich, when dramatized, contained a part for which my wife's stagepresence and talents seemed to be peculiarly suited."Siddle stirred uneasily, but the others were still as partridges instubble. Ingerman did not intend to alarm the shy bird of thecovey, however."I name no names," he said solemnly. "Nor am I telling you anything thatwill not be thoroughly exposed before the coroner and elsewhere. Fromthat unhappy period dated our estrangement. My wife fell under a fatalinfluence which lasted, practically unchecked, until the day, if not thevery hour, of her death. Do I blame her? No--a thousand times no! You seeme, a plain man, considerably her senior. _I_ had not the gift of writingimpassioned love passages in which she could display her artistic genius.When I came home from the City, tired after the day's work, _she_ wasjust beginning hers. You know what London fashionable life is--thetheater, a supper, a dance, some great lady's 'reception,' and the restof it. Ah, me! The stage, and literature, and the arts generally are notfor poor fellows moiling in a City office. You gentlemen, I take it, areall happily married--""I'm not," said Elkin, "but I'll lay you long odds I will be soon."For some reason, this remark produced a certain uneasiness among hisfriends. Tomlin stared at the ash of one of the cigars "stood" by thistalkative Londoner; Hobbs, whose glass had reached a low level again,examined the dregs almost fiercely; and Siddle seemed to be about to saysomething, but, with his usual restraint, kept silent. Then Ingerman madea very shrewd guess, and wondered who Doris Martin was, and what Hobbs'scryptic allusion had meant."Good luck to you, sir," he said, "but--take no offense--don't marry anactress. There's an old adage, 'Birds of a feather flock together.' Iwould go farther, and interpolate the word 'should.' If Adelaide Melhuishhad never met me, but had married the man who could write her plays, thistragedy in real life would never have been.""D--n him," muttered Elkin fiercely. "He's done for now, anyhow. He'llturn no more girls' heads for a bit.""An' five minutes since you yapped at me like a vicious fox-terrier for'intin' much the same thing," chortled Hobbs.Siddle stood up."You ain't goin', Mr. Siddle?" went on the butcher. "It's 'ardly 'arfpast nine.""I have some accounts to get out. It's near the half year, you know," andSiddle vanished unobtrusively.Hobbs shook his head, and gazed at Elkin as though the latter was arefractory bullock."Siddle's a fair-minded chap," he said. "He can't stand 'earin' any of us'angin' a man without a fair trial."Ingerman had marked the chemist for more subtle treatment when anopportunity arose, or could be made. At present, he was not sorry such arestraining influence was removed. The next half hour should prove agolden one if well utilized. He was right. Before the inn was cleared,what between Elkin's savage comments and the other men's thinly-veiledallusions, he knew all that Steynholme could tell with regard to Grantand Doris Martin.Grant's first thought next morning was of the girl who had been thrust soprominently into his life by the death of another woman. That was,perhaps, the strangest outcome of the tragedy. Doris was easily theprettiest and most intelligent girl in the village, a rare combination initself, even among young ladies of much higher social position than apostmaster's daughter. But her father was a self-educated man, whose lifehad been given to books, whose only hobby was the culture and study ofbees. He had often refused promotion, solely because his duties atSteynholme were light, and permitted of many free hours. In his onlychild he found a quick pupil and a sympathetic helper. Of her own accordshe took to poetry and music. In effect, had Doris Martin attended thebest of boarding-schools and training colleges, she would have received asmattering of French and a fair knowledge of the piano or violin,whereas, after more humble tuition, it might fairly be said of her thatfew girls of her age had read so many books and assimilated theircontents so thoroughly. From her mother she inherited her good looks anda small yearly income, just sufficient to maintain a better wardrobethan her father's salary would permit.Grant, newly settled in Steynholme, found the postmaster and his daughterintellectually on a par with himself, and this claim could certainly notbe made on behalf of the local "society" element. The three becameexcellent friends. Naturally, the young people spent a good deal of timetogether. But there had been no love-making--not a hint or whisper of it!And now, by cruel chance, their names were linked by scandal in its mostmenacing form, since there was no gainsaying the fact that Doris'sstar-gazing on that fatal Monday night was indissolubly bound up with thedeath of Adelaide Melhuish.For the first time, then, the notion peeped up in Grant's mind that thewhirligig of existence might see Doris his wife. But the conceitresembled the Gorgon's teeth, which, when sown in the ground, sprangforth as armed men. The very accident which revealed a not unpleasingpossibility had established a grave obstacle in the way of its ultimaterealization. Already there was a cloud between him and the Martins,father and daughter. To what a tempest might not that cloud develop whenthe questionings and innuendoes of the inquest established an aura ofsuspicion and intrigue around a perfectly innocent meeting in the gardenof The Hollies!Grant ate his breakfast in wrath. In wrath, too, he glanced through themorning newspapers, and saw his own name figuring large in the "story" ofthe "alleged" murder. The reporters had missed nothing. They had even gothold of the "peculiar coincidence" of his (Grant's) glimpse of a face atthe window. His play was recalled, and Adelaide Melhuish's success in thetitle-role. Then Mr. Isidor G. Ingerman was introduced. He was describedas "a man fairly well known in the City." That was all. The press couldsay nothing as yet of marital disagreements, nor was any hint concerningDoris Martin allowed to appear. But these journalistic fire-works wereonly held in reserve. "Dramatic and sensational developments" werepromised, and police activity in "an unexpected direction" fore-shadowed.All of which, of course, was mere journalistic paraphrasing ofcircumstances already known to the writers, and none the less galling toGrant on that account.And there was no answer from the Commissioner of Police at Scotland Yard.True, the overnight telegram might have reached the Department afteroffice hours. Grant, like most members of the general public, held thevague belief that Government officials do very little work. Still, onemight reasonably expect better things from the institution which wassupposed to safeguard law-abiding citizens.Calm analysis of Ingerman's nebulous threats had revealed a hostileforce not to be despised. Possibly, the man was already in league withthat narrow-minded village constable, so every passing hour made moreurgent the need of a trained intelligence being brought to bear on themystery of Adelaide Melhuish's killing. Grant racked his brains todiscover who could possibly have a motive for committing the crime.Naturally, his thoughts flew to Ingerman. Surely that sinister-lookingperson should be forced to give an account of himself instead of, as wasprobable, being allowed to instill further nonsense into the suspiciousmind of P.C. Robinson.There were two morning deliveries of London letters in Steynholme, one ateight and another at half past ten. Grant waited until the postman hadleft a publisher's circular (the only letter for The Hollies by thesecond mail). Then, in a fever of impatience, he jammed on a hat and wentout. He would wait no longer. He would telegraph Scotland Yard again,and, incidentally, demand an audience at the post office.No sooner had he entered the highroad than he saw P.C. Robinson on guard.That important person was standing on the bridge, apparently taking theair. He was nibbling the chin-strap of his helmet; both thumbs werelocked in his belt. From that strategic position three roads came underobservation.It was a fine morning, and Grant's sense of humor was not proof againstthis open espionage. He smiled, and determined to take a rise out of"Sherlock," as Bates had christened the policeman.The bridge lay a hundred yards to the left. The road was straight untilit curved around the house and its shrubberies, so the view was blockedon that side. Grant filled and lighted a pipe with a deliberateness meantto be provoking, glancing several times doubtfully at P.C. Robinson, who,of course, was grandly unaware of his presence. Then he strolled off tothe right, and, when hidden, took to his heels for a hundred yardssprint. Turning into a winding bridle-path tucked between hedges of thornand hazels, he walked to a point where it crossed a patch of furze. At alittle distance a hand-bridge spanned the river, and gave access to theeastern end of the village by a steep climb of the wooded cliff. Thepath, in fact, was a short cut to that part of Steynholme.He sat on a hump of rock, and waited. It was a boyish trick, but verysuccessful. Within three minutes, at the utmost, P.C. Robinson hurriedpast, using a stalking, stealthy stride which was distinctly ludicrous.The eyes of the two men met, but Grant alone was prepared."Hello, Robinson!" he cried cheerfully. "What's the rush? Surely ourrural peace has not been disturbed again?"Robinson knew he had been "sold," but rose to the occasion."Excuse me, Mr. Grant," he puffed. "Can't wait now. Have an appointment.I'll see you later."Honor demanded that he should not relax that swift pace. Unhappily, thepath up the cliff was visible throughout from Grant's rock, so, onreaching the summit, Robinson was a-boil in more ways than one.Moreover, peeping through the first screen of trees that offered, hehad the mortification of seeing the man who had befooled him go backthe way he came.Purple-faced with heat and anger, the policeman forgot his surroundings,and glowered at Grant with real fury. So he heard no one approachingalong the main road until he was hailed a second time with, "Hello,Robinson!"He turned sharply. This was Mr. Elkin."Good morning!" he said. "Have you seen the superintendent?""What? Mr. Fowler? No. Is _he_ here so early?""I must have missed him.""Well, you'll hardly find him on Bush Walk," which was the name of thepath."You never can tell," came the dark answer.At any rate, the policeman elected to abandon his self-imposed vigil, andthe two walked together into the village."My! You look as though you'd run a mile," commented Elkin."This murder has kept me busy," growled the other, frankly moppinghis forehead."Ay, that's so. And it isn't done with yet, by a long way. Pity youweren't in the Hare and Hounds last night. You'd have heard something.There's a chap staying there, name of Ingerman--""I've met him. The dead woman's husband.""Oh, perhaps you've got his yarn already?""It all depends what he said to you.""Well, he hinted things. Unless I'm greatly mistaken, you'll soon bemaking an arrest.""I believe I could put my hand on the murderer this very minute," saidRobinson vindictively.Elkin laughed, somewhat half-heartedly."Lay you fifty to one against the time," he said. "I'm the only one nearenough for that limit, you know."The policeman realized that he had allowed annoyance to shake his wits.He looked at Elkin rather sharply, and noticed that the horse-breederseemed to be nervous and ill."I didn't quite mean that I could grab my man this minute," he said,"but, if I can guess him, it amounts to nearly the same thing. What haveyou been doing to yourself, Mr. Elkin? You look peeky to-day.""Too much whiskey and tobacco. I'll call at Siddle's for a 'pick-me-up.'Am I wanted for the jury?""Yes. I left a notice at your place last evening.""I didn't get it.""Been away?""No. Fact is, I went home late, and didn't bother about letters thismorning. What time is the inquest?""Three o'clock, in the club-room of the Hare and Hounds.""Will that fellow, Grant, be there?""Rather. Dr. Foxton warned him yesterday.""Good! What about Doris Martin? Will she be a witness?""Not to-day."They were entering the village, and could see down the long, wide slopeof the hill. Grant had just come into sight at its foot.Both men scowled at the distant figure, but neither passed any comment.They parted, the policeman walking straight on, Elkin bearing to theleft. The chemist's shop stood exactly opposite the post office, soElkin, arriving first, was aware of his unconscious rival's destination.He had not answered Mr. Siddle's greeting, but gazed moodily through abarricade of specifics piled in the window. Then he swore."What's wrong now?" inquired the chemist quietly."That Grant. Got a nerve, hasn't he?""I can't say, unless you explain.""He's just gone into the post office.""Why shouldn't he? He wants stamps, may be; plenty of 'em, Ishould imagine.""Oh, you're a fish, Siddle. You aren't crazy about a girl, like I am. Thesooner Grant's in jail the better I'll be pleased.""If you take my advice, which you won't, I know, you will not utter thatsort of remark publicly.""Can't help it. Bet you a fiver I'm engaged to Doris Martin within aweek."Mr. Siddle took thought."Why so quickly?" he asked, after a pause."I'll catch her on the hop, of course. If she's engaged to me it'll helpher a lot when this case comes into court.""I cannot believe that Doris would accept any man for such a reason.""I'm not 'any man.' She knows I'm after her. Will you take my bet,even money?""No. I don't bet.""Well, you needn't put a damper on me. In fact, you can't. Have you thatlast prescription of Dr. Foxton's handy? My liver wants a tonic."The chemist thumbed a dog-eared volume, read an entry carefully, andretired to a dispensing counter in the rear of the shop."Shall I send it?" came his voice."No. I'll wait. Give me a dose now, if you don't mind."For some reason, Fred Elkin was not himself that day. He was moody, andfretful as a sick colt. But he had diagnosed his ailment and its causeaccurately; a discreet doctor was probably aware of his failings, and hadconsidered them in the "mixture."The post office was not busy when Grant entered. A young man, a stranger,was seated at the telegraphist's desk, tapping a new instrument. The G.P. O., forewarned, had lent an expert to deal with press messages.Mr. Martin, sorting some documents, came forward when he saw Grant. Hiskindly, somewhat pre-occupied face was long as a fiddle."Good morning, Mr. Martin," said Grant."Good morning. What can I do for you?" was the stiff reply. Grant was inno mind to be rebuffed, however."I must have a word with you in private," he said."I'm sorry--but my time is quite full.""I'm sorry, too, but the matter is urgent."The click of the sounder became less businesslike. There was an elementin the tone of each voice that drew the London telegraphist's attention.Martin, usually the mildest-mannered man in Sussex, was obviously ill atease. But he simply could not hold out against Grant's compelling gaze."Come into the back room," he said nervously. "Call me if I'm needed," headded, nodding to his assistant.Grant did not hesitate an instant when the postmaster reached the "backparlor" through another door. The open window, draped in clematis, gavea delightful glimpse of The Hollies. A window-box of mignonette filledthe air with its delicate perfume. Grant hoped that Doris would be there,but the only signs of her recent presence were a hat and an open book onthe table."Now, Mr. Martin," he said gravely, "you and I should have a serioustalk. It is idle to deny that gossip is spreading broadcast certainmalicious and absurd rumors which closely concern Doris and myself. To methese things are of slight consequence. To a girl of your daughter's agethey are poisonous. If you, her father, know the whole truth, you canregulate your actions so as to defeat the scandalmongers. That is why Iam here to-day. That is why I came here yesterday, but your attitude tookme aback, and I was idiot enough to go without a word of explanation. Iwas too shaken then to see my clear course, and follow it regardless ofpersonal feelings. This morning I am master of myself, and I insist thatyou listen now while I tell you exactly what occurred on Monday night.""Surely--these matters--are--for the authorities," stammered theolder man."What? Your daughter's good name?"Mr. Martin reddened. His agitation was pitiful."That is hardly in question, sir," he said brokenly."I am speaking of the tongue of slander. Heaven help and direct me! Iwould suffer death rather than see Doris subjected to the leers andinnuendoes of every lout in the village."Grant's earnestness could hardly fail to impress his friend. But Martinhad either made up his mind or been warned not to discuss the murder, andadhered loyally to that line of conduct. He retreated toward the doorleading to the post office proper."It is too late to interfere now," he said."What on earth do you mean?" demanded Grant, yielding to a gust of anger."The whole--of the circumstances--are being inquired into by the police,"came the hesitating answer."Has that prying scoundrel, Robinson, dared to cross-examine Doris?""He came here, of course, but Scotland Yard has taken up the inquiry.""A detective--here?""Yes. He is with Doris in the garden at this moment."Grant knew the topography of the house. Without asking permission, hetore through yet a third door leading to a kitchen and scullery, nearlyupsetting a tiny maid who had her ear or eye to the key-hole, and racedinto the garden in which the postmaster kept his bees.Doris, standing with her hands behind her back, was looking at TheHollies, and deep in conversation with an alert and natty little man whowas evidently absorbed in what she was saying.Grant, in a whirl of fury, was only conscious that Doris's companion wasslight, almost diminutive, of frame, very erect, and dressed in awell-fitting blue serge suit, neat brown boots and straw hat, when thetwo heard his footsteps.Doris was flustered. Her Romney face held a look of scare."Oh, here is Mr. Grant!" she said, striving vainly to speak withcomposure.The little man pierced Grant with an extraordinarily penetrating glancefrom very bright and deeply-recessed black eyes."Ah, Mr. Grant, is it!" he chirped pleasantly. "Good morning! So _you're_the villain of the piece, are you?"CHAPTER VISCOTLAND YARD TAKES A HANDIt was a singular greeting, to say the least, and the person who utteredit was quite as remarkable as his queer method of expressing himselfseemed to indicate.Grant, though in a fume of hot anger, had the good sense to choke backthe first impetuous reprimand trembling on his lips. In fact, wrathquickly subsided into blank incredulity. He saw before him, not theconventional detective who might be described as a superior Robinson--noteven the sinewy, sharp-eyed, and well-spoken type of man whom he had onceheard giving evidence in a famous jewel-robbery case--but rather one whomhe would have expected to meet in the bar of a certain well-knownrestaurant in Maiden Lane, a corner of old London where literally all theworld's a stage, and all the men and women merely players.During his theatrical experiences he had come across scores of such men,dapper little fellows, wizened of face yet curiously youthful in manner;but they, each and all, were labeled "low comedian." Certainly, a rareintelligence gleamed from this man's eyes, but that is an attribute notoften lacking in humorists who command high salaries because of theirfacility in laughter-making. This man, too, had the wide, thin-lipped,mobile mouth of the actor. His ivory-white, wrinkled forehead and cheeks,the bluish tint on jaws and chin, his voice, his perky air, the very tiltof his straw hat, were eloquent of the footlights. Even his openingwords, bizarre and cheerfully impertinent, smacked of "comic relief.""I figure prominently in this particular 'piece,'" snapped Grant. "May Iask your name, sir?""A wise precaution with suspicious characters," rejoined the other,smiling. Grant was suddenly reminded of a Japanese grinning at a joke,but he bent over a card which the stranger had whisked out of a waistcoatpocket. He read:MR. CHARLES F. FUENEAUX,_Criminal Investigation Department_,NEW SCOTLAND YARD, S.W.He could not control himself. He gazed at Mr. Charles F. Furneaux with asurprise that was not altogether flattering."Did the Commissioner of Police send _you_ in response to mytelegram?" he said."That is what lawyers call a leading question," came the prompt retort."And I hate lawyers. They darken understanding, and set honest men atloggerheads.""But it happens to be very much to the point at this moment.""Well, Mr. Grant, if you really press for an answer, it is 'Yes' and'No.' The Commissioner received a certain telegram, but he may have actedon other grounds. Even Commissioners can be creatures of impulse, orexpediency, just as the situation demands."You are here, at any rate.""That is what legal jargon terms an admitted fact.""Then you had better begin by assuming that I am no villain.""It is assumed. It couldn't well be otherwise after the excellentcharacter you have been given by this young lady.""She, at least, will speak well of me, I do believe," said Grant, with astrange bitterness, for his heart was sore because of the seemingdefection of his friend, the postmaster. "What I actually had in mind wasthe stupidity of the local policeman, who is convinced that I am both acriminal and a fool.""The two are often synonymous," said Furneaux dryly. "But I acquitted youon both counts, Mr. Grant, on hearing, and even seeing, how you spentMonday evening."Grant, who had cooled down considerably, found a hint of badinage inthis comment."You have evidently been told that Miss Martin and I were star-gazing inthe garden of my house," he said. "It happens to be true.""Oh, yes. There was a very fine cluster of small stars in Canis Major,south of Sirius, that night.""You know something about the constellations, then?" was theastonished query."Enough for the purposes of Scotland Yard," smirked Furneaux, who hadchecked P.C. Robinson's one-sided story by referring to Whitaker'sAlmanack. "It may relieve your mind if I tell you that I have never seena real live astronomer in the dock. Venus and Mars are often in trouble,but their devoted observers seldom, if ever."Grant warmed to this strange species of detective, though, if pressed foran instant decision, he would vastly have preferred that one of moreorthodox style had been intrusted with an inquiry so vital to his ownhappiness and good repute. Eager, however, to pour forth his worries intoany official ear, he brought back the talk to a definite channel."Will you come to my place?" he asked. "I have much to say. Let me assureyou now, in Miss Martin's presence, that she is no more concerned in thisghastly business than any other young lady in the village.""But she is interested. And _you_ are. And I am. Why not discuss mattershere, for the present, I mean? We have a glorious view of your house andgrounds. We can see without being seen. None can overhear. I advise bothof you to go thoroughly into this matter here and now."Furneaux spoke emphatically. Even Doris put in a timid plea."Perhaps that would be the best thing to do," she said. "Mr. Furneaux hasbeen most sympathetic. I am sure he understands things already in a waythat is quite wonderful to me."The very sound of her voice was comforting. Grant might have argued withthe detective, but could not resist Doris. Without further demur he wentthrough the whole story, giving precise details of events on the Mondaynight. Then the recital widened out into a history of his relations withAdelaide Melhuish. He omitted nothing. Doris gasped when she heardSuperintendent Fowler's version of the view a coroner's jury might takeof her presence in the garden of The Hollies at a late hour. But Grantdid not spare her. He reasoned that she ought to be prepared for anordeal which could not be avoided. He was governed by the astute beliefthat his very outspokenness in this respect would weaken the inferenceswhich the police might otherwise draw from it.Furneaux uttered never a word. He was a first-rate listener, though hisbehavior was most undetective-like, since he hardly looked at Grant orthe girl, but seemed to devote his attention almost exclusively to thescenic panorama in front.However, when Grant came to the somewhat strenuous passage-at-arms ofthe previous night between Ingerman and himself, the little man brokein at once."Isidor G. Ingerman?" he cried. "Is he a tall, lanky, cadaverous,rather crooked person, with black hair turning gray, and an absurdlymelodious voice?""You have described him without an unnecessary word," said Grant.Furneaux clicked his tongue in a peculiar fashion."Go on!" he said. "It's a regular romance--quite in your line, Mr. Grant,of course, but none the less enthralling because, as you so happilyphrased Miss Martin's lesson in astronomy, it happens to be true."Grant was scrupulously fair to Ingerman. He admitted the "financier's"adroitness of speech, and made clear the fact that if the visit had thelevying of blackmail for its object such a possible outcome was onlyhinted at vaguely. Being a novelist, one whose temperament sought forsunshine rather than gloom in life, he wound up in lighter vein. The rusewhich tricked P.C. Robinson into a breathless scamper of nearly a mile ona hot day in June was described with gusto. Doris, who knew the villageconstable well, laughed outright, while Furneaux cackled shrilly. Nonewho might be watching the little group in that delightful garden, withits scent of old-world flowers and drone of bees, could have guessed thata grewsome tragedy formed their major theme.The girl was the first to realize that even harmless merriment was in illaccord with the presence of death, for the body of Adelaide Melhuish laywithin forty yards of the place where they stood."May I leave you now?" she inquired. "Father may be wanting help inthe office.""I shan't detain you more than a few seconds," said Furneaux briskly. "OnMonday evening you two young people parted at half past ten. How do youfix the time?"Doris answered without hesitation:"The large window of Mr. Grant's study was open, and we both heard aclock in the hall chime the half-hour. I said, 'Goodness me, is that halfpast ten?' and started for home at once. Mr. Grant came with me as far asthe bridge. When I reached my room, in exactly five minutes after leavingThe Hollies, I stood at the open window--that window"--and she pointed toa dormer casement above the sitting-room--"and looked out. It was aparticularly fine night, mild, but not very clear, as a slight mist oftenrises from the river after a hot day in summer. I may have been thereabout ten minutes, no longer, when I saw the study window of The Holliesthrown open, and Mr. Grant's figure was silhouetted by the lamp behindhim. He seemed to be listening for something, so I, who must have heardany unusual sound, listened too. There was nothing. I could hear theripple of the river beneath the bridge, so everything was very still.After a minute, or two, perhaps--no longer--Mr. Grant went in, and closedthe window. Then I went to bed.""Did Mr. Grant draw any blind or curtains?""There are muslin curtains attached to each side of the window. Onecannot see into the room from a distance."Furneaux measured an imaginary line drawn from Doris's bedroom to theedge of the cliff, and prolonged it."Nor can you see the river or foot of the lawn from your room," hecommented."No. In winter I can just make out the edge of the lawn. When the treesare in leaf, all the lower part is hidden.""You had actually retired to rest about eleven, I suppose?""Yes.""So if Mr. Grant came out again you would not know?" Doris blushedfuriously, but her reply was unfaltering."I would have known during the next half-hour, at least," she said. "Aninclined mirror hangs in my room. I use it sometimes for adjusting a hat.The square of light from Mr. Grant's room is reflected in it, and anysudden increase in the illumination caused by opening the window orpulling the curtains aside would certainly have caught my eye.""You have an unshakable witness in Miss Martin," said Furneaux, stabbinga finger at Grant. "Now, I'll hurry off. You and I, Mr. Grant, meet atPhilippi, otherwise known as the crowner's quest."Any benevolent intent he may have had in leaving these young peopletogether was, however, frustrated by Doris, whose composure seemed tohave fled since her statement about the mirror. She resolutelyaccompanied the detective, and Grant had to follow. All three passed intothe post office, Doris using the private door. Mr. Martin looked up fromhis desk when they appeared, and requested his daughter to check a bundleof postal orders. The pretext was painfully obvious, but Grant was not sowishful now to clear up matters with Doris's father, as the girl herselfmight be trusted to pass on an accurate account of the affair frombeginning to end.He was about to reach the street quick on Furneaux's heels when thelittle man turned suddenly."By the way, don't you want a shilling's worth of stamps?" he said.Grant smiled comprehension, and went back to the counter, where Dorisherself served him. She did not try to avoid his glance, but rather metit with a baffling serenity oddly at variance with her momentary loss ofself-possession in the garden.When he entered the street the detective had vanished.He walked down the hill at a rapid pace, disregarding the eyes peepingat him through open doorways, over narrow window-curtains, and covertlystaring when people passed in the roadway. The sensitive side of histemperament shrank from this thinly-veiled hostility. He was by way ofbeing popular in Steynholme, yet not a soul spoke to him. Before hereached the bridge, the other side of him, the man of action, of coolresource in an emergency, rose in rebellion against the league of sillyclodhoppers. Back he strode to the post office and dashed off atelegram. It ran:"Walter Hart, Savage Club, Adelphi, London. Come here and help tolay a ghost."He signed it in full, name and address. Doris was gone, but her fatherreceived it, and read the text in a bewildered way."I find myself deserted by my Steynholme friends so I am trying to importone stanch one," said Grant, almost vindictively.Martin murmured the cost, and Grant stormed out again. This time, passingthe Hare and Hounds, he looked at door and windows. He caught a facescowling at him over a brown wire blind bearing the words "Wines andSpirits" on it in letters of dull gold. It was a commonplace type offace, small-featured, ginger-moustached, and crowned by a billy-cock hatset at a rakish angle. Its most marked characteristic was the positivehatred which glowed in the sharp, pale-blue eyes. Grant wondered who thishighly censorious young man might be. At any rate, he meant to ascertainwhether or not the critic was susceptible of satire at his own expense.He walked up to the window, elevated his eyebrows at the frowning personwithin, pretended to read the words on the screen, looked again at theman inside, and shook his head gravely in the manner of one who hasaccurately determined cause and effect.Fred Elkin was quick-witted enough to appreciate Grant's unspokencomment. He was also unmannerly enough to put out his tongue. Then Grantlaughed, and turned on his heel.Mr. Siddle, quietly observant of recent comings and goings, was standingat the door of the shop, and missed no item of this dumb show. He raisedboth hands in silent condemnation of Elkin's childishness, whereupon thehorse-dealer jerked a thumb toward Grant's retreating figure, and wentthrough a rapid pantomime of the hanging process. His crony disapprovedagain, and went in. Now, both those men were on the jury panel, so, toall appearance, Grant would be judged by at least one deadly enemy, whoseanimosity might or might not be fairly balanced by the chemist'simpartial mind.The tenant of The Hollies actually dreaded the loneliness of hisdwelling now, though it was that very quality which had drawn him toSteynholme a year earlier. Work or reading was equally out of thequestion that day. He sought the industrious Bates, who was trenchingcelery in the kitchen garden."Have 'ee made out owt about un, sir?" inquired that hardy individual,pausing to spit on the handle of his spade."No," said Grant. "The thing is a greater mystery than ever.""I'm thinkin' her mun ha' bin killed by a loony," announced Bates."Something of the kind, no doubt. But why are the little less dangerousloonies of Steynholme united in the belief that I am the guilty one?""Ax me another," growled Bates."Who is spreading this rumor? Robinson?""'E dussen't, sir. 'E looks fierce, but 'e'll 'old 'is tongue. T'superwill see to that.""Someone is talking. That is quite certain.""There's a chap in the 'Are an' 'Ounds--kem 'ere last night.""Ingerman?""Ay, sir, that's the name. 'E's makin' a song of it, I hear.""Anybody else?""Fred Elkin is gassin' about. Do 'ee know un? Breeds 'osses at MountFarm, a mile that-a-way," and Bates pointed to the west.Grant hazarded a guess, and described the face of condemnation seen atthe inn. Bates nodded."That's un," he said. Then he drove the spade into the rich loam. "Theydo say," he added, apparently as an after-thought, "as Fred Elkin ismighty sweet on Doris, but her'll 'ave nowt to do wi' un."Grant whistled softly. This explanation threw light on a dark place."The plot thickens," he said. "Mr. Elkin becomes more interesting than helooks. Are there other disappointed swains in the offing?""What's that, sir?""Has Miss Martin any other suitors?""Lots of 'em 'ud be after her like wasps round a plum-tree if she'd give'em 'alf a chance. But _you_ put a stopper on 'em."Bates was blunt of speech, though a philosopher withal."Elkin is my only serious rival, then?" laughed Grant, passing off as ajoke a thrust which was shrewder than the gardener knew."'E 'as plenty of brass, but I reckon nowt on 'im," was thecontemptuous answer."Well, he is not a likely person to kill a woman he had never beforeseen. Miss Martin will marry whom she chooses, no doubt. The presentproblem is to find out who murdered Miss Melhuish. Now, had _I_ been thevictim you would be thinking hard, Bates.""I tell 'ee, sir, it wur a loony."Nor was Bates to be moved from that opinion. He held to it, through thickand thin, for many days.Grant wandered into the front garden. His eyes rose involuntarily to thedistant post office, and he noticed at once that the dormer window wasclosed. Yet Doris shared his own love of fresh air, and that window hadalways been open till that very hour. Somehow, this simple thing seemedto shut him out of her life. He walked to the river, and gazed at thespot where the body was drawn ashore. In the absence of rain the waterran clear as gin, and the marks made by the feet of Adelaide Melhuish'smurderer were still perceptible. If only those misshapen blotches couldreveal their secret! If only some Heaven-sent ray of intuition wouldenable him to put the police on the track of the criminal! Theoretically,a novelist and essayist should be a first-rate detective, yet, broughtface to face with an actual felony, here was one who perforce remainedblind and dumb.Yet he was not blameworthy for failing to solve a mystery which wasrapidly establishing a record for bewildering elements. Wherein he diderr most lamentably was in his reading of a woman's heart.No answering telegram came from his friend in London. The day woreslowly till it was time to attend the inquest. He found a crowd gatheredin front of the Hare and Hounds. Superintendent Fowler was there, andquite a number of policemen, whose presence was explained when a buzz ofexcitement heralded Grant's arrival. He decided not to stand this sort ofpersecution a moment longer.Before the superintendent could interfere, he leaped on to a set of stonemounting-steps which stood opposite the door. Instantly, seeing that hewas about to speak, the angry murmuring of the mob was hushed. He lookedinto a hundred stolid faces, and stretched out his right hand."I cannot help feeling," he said, in slow, incisive accents which carriedfar, "that a set of peculiar circumstances has led you Steynholme folk tosuspect me of being responsible, in some way, for the death of the ladywhose body was found in the river near my house. Now, I want to tell youthat I am not only an innocent but a much-maligned man. The law of theland will establish both facts in due season. But I want to warn some ofyou, too, I shall not trouble to issue writs for libel. If any blackguardamong you dares to insult me openly, I shall smash his face."He knew when to stop. Superintendent Fowler's nudge was not calledfor, as the orator simply met the scrutiny of all those eyes withoutanother word.Curiously enough, the sense of justice is inherent in every haphazardgathering of the public. Grant's soldierly bearing, his calm defiance ofhostile opinion, the outspoken threat which he so plainly meant, woninstant favor. Someone shouted, "Hear, hear!" and the crowd applauded.From that moment he had little to complain of in the attitude of thecommunity as a whole. There were subtle and dangerous enemies to befought and conquered, but Steynholme looked on, keen to learn of any newsensation, of course, but placidly content that the final verdict shouldbe left in the hands of the authorities.CHAPTER VII"ALARUMS AND EXCURSIONS"The inquest was surprisingly tame after the stirring events which hadled up to it. Indeed, save for two incidents, the proceedings werealmost dull.The coroner, a Knoleworth solicitor named Belcher, prided himself onconducting this _cause celebre_ with as little ostentation as he wouldhave displayed over an ordinary inquiry. Messrs. Siddle, Elkin, Tomlinand Hobbs, with eight other local tradesmen and farmers, formed thejurors, and the chemist was promptly elected foreman; no witnesses wereordered out of court; the formalities of "swearing in" the jury and"viewing" the body were carried through rapidly. Almost before Grant hadtime to assimilate these details Superintendent Fowler, who marshalledthe evidence, called his name. The coroner's officer tendered him awell-thumbed Bible, while the coroner himself administered the oath.Grant eyed the somewhat soiled volume, and opened it before putting it tohis lips. The action probably did not please the jury. Elkin nudgedTomlin, and sniggered at the rest of his colleagues, as much as to say:"What did I tell you? The cheek of him!"Elkin, by the way, looked ill. When his interest flagged for an instanthis haggard aspect became more noticeable.Ingerman was there, of course. Furneaux sat beside Mr. Fowler. Astranger, whom Grant did not recognize, proved to be the County ChiefConstable. There was a strong muster of police, and the representativesof the press completely monopolized the scanty accommodation for thepublic. To Grant's relief, Doris Martin was not in attendance.He told the simple facts of the finding of Adelaide Melhuish's corpse. Aharmless question by the coroner evoked the first "scene" which set thereporters' pencils busy."Did you recognize the body!" inquired Mr. Belcher."I did.""Then you can give the jury her name?"Before Grant could answer, Ingerman sprang up, his sallow face lividwith passion."I protest, sir, against this man being permitted to identify mywife," he said.He was either deeply moved, or proved himself an excellent actor. Hisflute-like voice vibrated with an intense emotion. Thus might Mark Antonyhave spoken when vowing that Brutus was an honorable man."Who are you?" demanded the coroner sharply."Isidor George Ingerman, husband of the deceased lady," came theclear-toned reply."Well, sit down, sir, and do not interrupt the court again," saidthe coroner."I demand, sir, that you note my protest.""Sit down! Were you any other person I would have you removed. As it is,I am prepared to regard your feelings to the extent of explaining thatthe witness is not identifying the body but relating a fact within hisown knowledge."Ingerman bowed, and resumed his seat.For some reason, Grant stared blankly at Furneaux. The latter did notmeet his glance, but put a finger on those thin lips. It might, or mightnot, be a warning to repress any retort he had in mind. At any rate,obeying a nod from the coroner, he merely said:"She was a well-known actress, Miss Adelaide Melhuish."Mr. Belcher's pen hesitated a little. Then it scratched on. Undoubtedly,he was himself exercising the restraint he meant to impose on others."You are quite sure?" he said, after a pause."Quite.""Thank you, Mr. Grant. Wait here until you sign your deposition. Ofcourse, you are aware that this inquiry will stand adjourned, and thewhole matter will be gone into fully at a later date.""So I have been informed, sir."Ingerman was the next witness. _He_, like a good democrat, kissed thecover of the Bible. The coroner began by giving him some advice."This is a purely formal inquiry, to permit of a death certificate beingissued. You will oblige me, therefore, by answering my questions withoutintroducing any extraneous subject."Ingerman adhered to these instructions. Having already shot acarefully-prepared bolt, he meant avoiding any further conflict withthe authorities. His evidence was brief and to the point. The deceasedwas his wife. They were married at a London registrar's office on agiven date, six years ago. His wife acted under her maiden name. Therewas no family.The court was well lighted by four long windows in the eastern wall,which each witness faced, so Grant was free to study his avowed enemy atleisure. He thought he made out a crafty underlook in Ingerman which hehad failed to detect the previous night. That slow, smooth voice seemedto weigh each syllable. Such a man would never blurt out an unconsideredadmission. He was a foe to be reckoned with. The subtle malignancy ofthat well-timed outburst was proof positive in that respect.The jury, apparently, attached much weight to his words. On some facesthere was an expectancy which merged into marked disappointment when hisevidence came to an end. The foreman alone displayed the judicialattitude warranted by the oath he had taken. Somehow, Grant had faith inMr. Siddle. The man looked intellectual. When spoken to in his shop hismanner was invariably reserved. But that was his general repute inSteynholme--a quiet, uninterfering person, who had come to the village ayoung man, yet had never really entered into its life. For instance, heneither held nor would accept any public office. At first, peoplewondered how he contrived to eke out a living, but this puzzle was solvedby his admitted possession of a small annuity.Dr. Foxton, general practitioner, who held undisputed sway in thedistrict, told how he had conducted an autopsy on the body of thedeceased. He found a deep, incised wound on the back of the skull, awound which would have caused death in any event. The instrument usedmust have been a heavy and blunt one. Miss Melhuish was dead or dyingwhen thrown into the river. The body was well nourished, and the vitalorgans sound. Undoubtedly she had been murdered.Bates followed, and evoked a snigger by the outspokenness of bluntSussex."I hauled 'um in," he said, "an' knew it wur a dead 'un by the feel ofthe rope."The coroner was not curious. He merely wished to put on record the timeand manner in which Mr. Grant summoned assistance.Then P. C. Robinson entered the box, and contrived to bring about thesecond "incident."He told how, "from information received," he went to The Hollies, andfound Mr. Grant standing near the river with a dead body at his feet."One side of Mr. Grant's face was covered with blood," he went on.If the policeman was minded to create a sensation, he certainlysucceeded. A slight hum ran through the court, and then all presentseemed to restrain their breathing lest a word of the evidence should belost. The mention of "blood" in a murder case was a more adroit dodgethan Robinson himself guessed, perhaps. Few of his hearers troubled toreflect that a smudge of fresh gore on Grant's cheek could hardly haveany bearing on the death of a woman whose body had admittedly lain allnight in the river. It sufficed that Robinson had introduced a touch ofthe right color into the inquiry. Even the coroner was worried."Well!" he said testily."I took down his statement, sir," said the witness, well knowing that hehad wiped off Grant's morning score in the matter of Bush Walk."Never mind his statement. That must await the adjourned hearing. Whatdid you do with the body?""Took it to the stable of the Hare and Hounds, sir.""Where it was viewed recently by the jury?""Yes, sir.""It is the body identified by Mr. Ingerman as that of his wife?""Yes, sir.""That will do.... Superintendent Fowler, will this day week at teno'clock suit you?""Yes, sir," said the superintendent."Then the inquest stands adjourned until that day and hour. Gentlemen ofthe jury, you must be here punctually.""Can't we ask any questions?" cried Elkin, in an injured tone."No. You cannot," snapped the coroner emphatically.After a few formalities, which included the reading and signing of thedepositions, the courthouse emptied. The whole thing was over in half anhour. Grant, determined to have a word with the representative ofScotland Yard, went openly to Furneaux, and asked him to come to TheHollies and join him in a cup of tea."No," was the curt answer. "I'm busy. I'll see you later."It was difficult to reconcile the detective's present stand-off mannerwith his earlier camaradie, to say nothing of the seemingly friendly hintconveyed by the signal to pass no comment on Ingerman's interruption.Rather sick at heart, Grant went out into the sunshine. He wassnap-shotted a dozen times by press photographers. One man, backingimpudently in front of him in order to secure a sharp focus, tripped overthe raised edge of a cartway into a yard, and sat down violently.The onlookers laughed, but Grant helped the photographer to rise."If you want a really good picture of the Steynholme murderer, come to myplace, and I'll give you one," he said.The pressman was grateful, because Grant's action had tended to mitigatehis discomfiture."No one but a fool thinks of you as a murderer, Mr. Grant," he said."What I really want is a portrait of 'the celebrated' author in whosegrounds the body was found.""Come along, then, and I'll pose for you."The photographer was surprised, but joyfully accepted the gifts the godsgave. He could not guess that his host was pining for humancompanionship. He could not fathom Grant's disappointment, on reachingThe Hollies, at finding no telegram from a trusted friend, Walter Hart.And he was equally unconscious of the immense service he rendered bycompelling his host to talk and act naturally. He enlightened Grant, too,in the matter of inquests."Next week there will be a gathering of lawyers," he said. "The policewill be represented, probably by the Treasury, if the case is thoughtsufficiently important. That chap, Ingerman, too, will employ asolicitor, I expect, judging from his attitude to-day. In fact, any onewhose interests are affected ought to secure legal assistance. One neverknows how these inquiries twist and turn.""Thank you," said Grant, smiling at the journalist's tact. "I'll ordertea to be got ready while you're taking your pictures. By the way, whatsort of detective is Mr. Charles F. Furneaux?""A pocket marvel," was the enthusiastic answer. "Haven't you heard of himbefore? Well, you wouldn't, unless you followed famous casesprofessionally. He seldom appears in the courts--generally manages towriggle out of giving direct evidence. But I've never known him to fail.He either hangs his man or drives him to suicide. If I committed a crime,and was told that Furneaux was after me, I'd own up and save trouble,because I wouldn't have the ghost of a chance of winning clear.""He strikes one as too flippant for a detective.""Yes. Lots of people have thought that, and they're either disappearingin quicklime beneath some corridor of a prison, or doing time atPortland. I wonder if Winter also is coming down on this job.""Who is 'Winter'?""The Chief Inspector at the 'Yard.' A big, cheerful-looking fellow--fromhis appearance might be a gentleman-farmer and J. P., with a taste forhorses and greyhounds. He and Furneaux are called the Big 'Un and theLittle 'Un, and each is most unlike the average detective. But Heavenhelp any wrong-doer they set out to trail! They'll get him, as sure asGod made little apples.""Then the sooner Mr. Winter visits Steynholme the better I shall bepleased. This tragedy is becoming a perfect nightmare. You heard thatfat-headed policeman speak of my face being covered with blood. He did itpurposely. I made a fool of him this morning, so he paid me out, theliteral truth being that a branch of that Dorothy Perkins rose therecaught my cheek as I entered this room on Tuesday morning--before Idiscovered the body--and broke the skin. I suppose the cut is visiblestill? I saw it to-day while shaving.""Yes," said the other, chortling over the "copy" his colleagues weremissing. "The mark is there right enough. Queer how inanimate objectslike a rose-tree can make mischief. I remember a case in which a chestnutin a man's pocket sent him to penal servitude. There was absolutely noevidence against him, except a possible motive, until that chestnut wasfound and proved to be one of a particular species, grown only in acertain locality.""How fortunate that the Dorothy Perkins is popular!" laughed Grant. "Willyour paper publish photographs of the principals in this affair?""I expect so. I've a fine collection--the jury, all in a row--and you,making that speech to the mob.""Oh! Will that appear?""By Jove, yes, sir. It was wired off before the inquest opened."Grant reddened slightly. His own impetuous action had blurted out to thewhole world that which Steynholme was only thinking. No wonder Furneauxhad warned him to go slow. Perhaps the little man was annoyed because ofhis challenge to the village crowd? Well, be it so. He meant, and wouldlive up to, every word of it!The afternoon dragged after the pressman's departure. What Grant reallyhungered for was a heart-to-heart talk between Doris Martin and himself.But, short of a foolish attempt to carry the post office by storm, he sawno means of realizing his desire. He must, perforce, await the lesstroubled hours of the morrow or next day. Doris would surely give herfather an exact account of the conversation between Grant, Furneaux, andherself that morning, and that greatly perplexed man could hardly fail tosee how unjust was the tittle-tattle of the village.So, avoiding Mrs. Bates, whose fell intent it was to ask him what hewanted for dinner, he struck off along the road to Knoleworth, walkedeight miles in two hours, and reached The Hollies about seven o'clock,rather inclined for a meal and much more contented with life.Minnie announced that a gentleman "who brought a bag" had been awaitinghim since half-past five, and was now asleep on the lawn! A glance at theaforesaid bag, still reposing in the entrance hall, sent Grant quicklyinto the garden. A long, broad-shouldered person was stretched on awicker chair, and evidently enjoying a nap. A huge meerschaum pipe andtobacco pouch lay on the grass. The newcomer's face was covered by abroad-brimmed, decidedly weather-beaten slouch hat, which, legend had it,was purchased originally in South America in the early nineties, and hadwon fame as the only one of its kind ever worn in the Strand."Hullo! Wally! Glad to see you!" shouted Grant joyously.The sleeper stirred."No, not another drop!" he muttered. "You fellows must have heads oftriple brass and stomachs of leather!""Get up, you rascal, or I'll spill you out of the chair!" said Grant.A lazy hand removed the hat, and a pair of peculiarly big and bright eyesgazed up into his."Oh, it's you, is it?" drawled a quiet voice. "Why the blazes did yousend for me? And, having sent, why wake me out of the best sleep I'vehad for a week?""But why didn't you let me know you were coming? I would have metthe train.""I did. Here's the telegram. That pink-cheeked maid of yours nearly had afit when I opened it to show her that I was expected.""You wired from Victoria, I suppose?""Would you have preferred Charing Cross, or the Temple? Isn't Victoriarespectable?"Grant laughed as they shook hands. Hart was the most casual adventurer inexistence. His specialty was revolutions. Wherever the flag of rebellionwas raised against a government, thither went Walter Hart post-haste bytrain, steamer, or on horseback. He had been sentenced to death fivetimes, and decorated by successful Jack Cades twice as often."I'm a sort of outlaw. That's why I sought your help," explained Grant."I know all about you, Jack," said Hart slowly, picking up the pipe andfilling it from the pouch. The meerschaum was carved to represent thehead of a grinning negro, and was now ebon black from use."I felt like a pint of Sussex ale after a hot journey in the train, sohied me to the village inn, where several obliging gentlemen told me yourreal name. Two of them, Ingerman and Elkin, apparently make a hobby ofenlightening strangers as to your right place in society.""I must interview Elkin.""Not worth while, my boy. Ingerman is the crafty one. I thought I mightbe doing you more harm than good, or I would have given him a thick earthis afternoon ... Oh, by the way, what time is it?""Seven o'clock.""A little fellow named Furneaux is coming here to dinner at seven-thirty.Said he would drop in by the back door, and mutter 'Hush! I'm Hawkshaw,the detective.' He resembles a cock-sparrow, so I asked him why he didn'tfly in through an attic window. He took my point at once, and remarkedthat he wanted none of my lip, or he would ask me officially what becameof Don Ramon de Santander's big pink pearl. It's a queer yarn. There wasa bust-up in Guatemala--""Look here, Wally," broke in Grant anxiously. "Are you serious? DidFurneaux really say he was coming here?""He did, and more--he expressed a partiality for a chicken roasted on aspit. You have a spit in your kitchen, he says, and a pair of chickens inyour larder.""How did you contrive to meet him?""You're a poor guesser, Jack. _He_ met _me_. 'That you, Mr. Hart?' hesaid. 'Mr. Grant's house is the first on the right across the bridge.Tell him'--and the rest of it.""Have you warned Mrs. Bates?""Mrs. Bates being?""My housekeeper.""No, sir. If she's anything like your housemaid, I'm glad I didn't, orI should have been chucked into the road. I had the deuce of a job toreach the lawn. Had I ordered dinner I might now have been in thevillage lockup."Grant hurried away, and placated Mrs. Bates after a stormyinterlude. Precisely at 7.30 p. m. Minnie came and said that "Mr.Hawkshaw" had arrived."Bring him out here," said Grant. "Fetch some sherry and glasses, andgive us five minutes' notice before dinner is served.""Please, sir," tittered Minnie, "the gentleman prefers to stay indoors.He said his complexion won't stand the glare.""Very well," smiled Grant, rising. "Put the sherry and bitters on thesideboard.""Say," murmured Hart, "is this chap really a detective?""Yes. He stands high at Scotland Yard.""Never more than five feet four, I'll swear. But I wouldn't have missedthis for a pension. I have a revolver in my hip pocket, of course. Onewould feel lonely without it, even in England. But I hope you can stage afew knives and daggers, and a red light. I can cut masks out of a stripof black velvet. That girl will have a piece stowed away somewhere."The two entered the dining-room study, where the table was now laid fordinner. Furneaux was seated on the edge of a chair in the darkestcorner. His eyes gleamed at them strangely."Can you trust Bates?" he said to Grant.It was a wholly unexpected question, and Grant answered sharply:"Of course, I can.""Tell him to make sure that no one trespasses on your lawn between nowand ten o'clock. Close that window, draw the blind and curtains, andblock that small window, the one through which you saw the ghost.""Ye gods!" cackled Hart ecstatically."Why all these precautions?" demanded Grant, rather amused now."I'm supposed to be on the very verge of arresting you, and it wouldweaken the faith of my allies if I were seen drinking your wines andeating your chicken.""By the way, how did you know I had chickens in store, and a spit onwhich to roast them?""I looked you over at five-thirty this morning, having traveled fromLondon by the mail train. I must lecture you on your inefficientwindow-catches, Mr. Grant. Several self-respecting burglars of myacquaintance would give your house the go-by as being too easy. And, oneother matter. I suggest that any man who mentions the Steynholme murderagain before the coffee arrives shall be fined a sovereign for eachoffense, such fine, or fines, to form a fund for the relief of hishearers. _Cre nom d'un pipe_! Three intelligent men can surely discussmore interesting topics while they eat!"CHAPTER VIIIAN INTERRUPTED SYMPOSIUM"Have a cigarette," said Grant to Furneaux, when the blinds were drawn, alamp lighted, and the sherry dispensed."Thank you."The self-invited guest took one. He sniffed it, broke the paper wrapping,and crumbled some of the tobacco between finger and thumb."Ah, those Greeks!" he said sadly. "They simply can't go straight. Thisbrand of Turk used to be made of a tobacco grown on a slope aboveSalonica. A strip of sun-baked soil built up a reputation which is nowbeing bartered for filthy lucre by the use of Egyptian 'fillings.'""You're a connoisseur, Mr. Hawknose--try these," said Hart, profferinga case, from which the detective drew a cigarette, throwing the otherone aside."Why 'Hawknose'?" he inquired."A blend. First syllable of Hawkshaw and second of Furneaux--the latterAnglicized, of course.""And vulgarized.""You prefer Furshaw, perhaps?""Either effort is feeble for a man who can write about South America,and be lucid. Do you smoke this stuff, may I ask?" While talking, he hadsmelt and destroyed the second cigarette."If it's a fair question, what the devil do _you_ smoke?" cried Hart."Nothing. I'm a non-smoker. My profession demands a clear intellect, nota brain atrophied by nicotine.""Piffle! Carlyle and Bismarck were smokers.""Who reads Carlyle now-a-days? And what modern German pays heed toBismarck's dogmas? Look at that pipe of yours. It was once a pure ivorywhite. Now it is black--soiled by tobacco juice. Your lungs are slowlyemulating it, and your wits will cloud in time. Read Tolstoi, Mr. Hart.He will teach you how nicotine deadens the conscience.""At last I know why I smoke like a Thames tug," laughed Hart, "but I'mblest if I can understand why _you_ make such a study of the vile weed.""Most criminals are addicted to the habit. I classify them by their brandof tobacco. For instance, a clever forger would never descend to thicktwist, while a swell mobsman would turn with horror from a woodbine."Minnie entered, and nodded, whereupon Grant led the others upstairs towash. From the bathroom he looked out over a darkening landscape. Doris'sdormer window was open. She was leaning on the sill, but he could nottell whether or not her eyes were turned his way. Her attitude waspensive, disconsolate, curiously forlorn for a girl normallyhigh-spirited. He was on the point of signaling to her when he rememberedFurneaux's presence. There was something impish, almost diabolicallyclever, in that little man's characteristics which induced wariness.The dinner was a marvel, considering the short notice given to the cook.Luckily, Mrs. Bates, a loyal soul, had resolved to tempt her employer'sappetite that evening. Village gossip had it that the police were aboutto arrest him, and she was determined he should enjoy at least one goodmeal before being haled to prison. Hence, the materials were present.The rest was a matter of quantities, and Sussex seldom stints itself inthat respect.The chatter round the table was light and amusing. The three were wellmatched conversationally. Furneaux evidently held the opinion onceexpressed by a notable Walrus--that the time had comeTo talk of many things:Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--Of cabbages--and kings.He was in excellent form, and the others played up to him. Hart's slowdrawl was ever trenchant and witty, and Grant forgot his woes incongenial company. As for the mercurial detective himself, it might besaid of him as of the school-master of Auburn:And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew,That one small head could carry all he knew.It was he who dropped them with a bounce from the realm of fancy to theunpleasing region of ugly fact. No sooner had Minnie cleared the table,and brought in the coffee, than he whisked around on Grant as thoughhitherto he had been only awaiting an opportunity of scarifying him."Now," he said, propping an elbow on the table, and supporting his chinon a clenched fist, "the embargo is off the Steynholme affair. _You_didn't kill Adelaide Melhuish, Mr. Grant. Who did?""I wish I could tell you," was the emphatic answer."Do you suspect anybody? You needn't fear the libel law in confiding yoursecret thought to me, and I assume that Mr. Hart is trustworthy--wherehis friends are concerned?""Why that unkind differentiating clause, my pocket Vidocq?" put in Hart."Because two Kings and a baker's dozen of Presidents have, at varioustimes, sent most unflattering reports to this country about you.""I must have annoyed 'em most damnably.""You had. I congratulate you, but Heaven only knows where I may convoyyou some day on an extradition warrant....Proceed, Mr. Grant.""I assure you, on my honor, that the only reasonable suggestion I canmake is that put forward by my gardener to-day," said Grant. "He thinksthat the murder must have been committed by a lunatic. I can offer noother hypothesis.""Your gardener may be right. But what lunatic, barring yourself and thehorse-coper, Elkin, is in love with Doris Martin?"Like Elkin the previous night, Grant struck the table till thingsrattled."Keep her name out of it," he cried fiercely. "You are a man of theworld, not a suspicious idiot of the Robinson type. You heard to-day thefull and true explanation of her presence here on Monday night. It was asheer accident. Why harp on Doris Martin rather than any member of theBates family?""Who, may I ask, is Doris Martin?" put in Hart."The Steynholme postmaster's daughter," said Furneaux. "A remarkablypretty and intelligent girl. If her father was a peer she would be thebelle of a London season. As it is, her good looks seem to have put amaggot in more than one nut in this village."Hart waved the negro's head in the air."The lunatic theory for mine," he declared. "If one woman's lovely facecould bring a thousand ships to Ilion, why should not another's drive mento madness in Steynholme?""Well phrased, sir," cackled Furneaux delightedly. "I'll wangle that inon a respected colleague of mine, who is a whale at deducing aproposition from given premises, but cannot induce a general fact fromparticular instances to save his life ... Now, stifle your romanticfrenzy, Mr. Grant, and listen to me. If you were minded to instruct me inthe art of writing good English, I would sit at your feet an attentivedisciple. When I, Furneaux, of the 'Yard,' lay down a first principle inthe investigation of crime, I expect deference on your part. I tell youunhesitatingly that if Doris Martin didn't exist, Adelaide Melhuish wouldbe alive now. That, as a thesis, is nearly as certain a thing as that thesun will rise to-morrow. I go farther, and hazard the guess, not thefixed belief, though my guesses are usually borne out by events, that ifDoris Martin had not been in this garden at half past ten on Mondaynight, Adelaide Melhuish would not have been killed some twenty minuteslater. It is useless for you to fume and rage in vain effort to disproveeither of these presumptive facts. You are simply beating the air. Thismystery centers in and around the postmaster's daughter. Come, now, youare a reasonable person. Admit the cold, hard truth, and then give playto your fancy.""Sir," said Hart, brandishing his pipe again, "I suggest that you and I,here and now, form a mutual admiration society.""It is a cruel and bitter thing that an innocent girl should be draggedinto association with a foul crime," said Grant stubbornly. "I am notdisputing the force of your acumen, Mr. Furneaux. My only desire is toshield the good name of a very charming young lady.""What's done can't be undone," countered the detective, well knowing thatGrant confessed himself beaten."But what is all the bother about? You heard from Miss Martin's own lipsabsolutely the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Put her in thewitness-box, and what more can she tell you?""I am not worrying about her appearance in the witness-box," saidFurneaux dryly. "Long before that stage is reached I shall be hunting astar burglar, or, perhaps, looking into the Foreign Office _dossier_ ofour worthy friend here, as to-day's papers hint at trouble in Venezuela.No, sir. The county police will get all the credit. P.C. Robinson will beswanking about then, telling the yokels what _he_ did. I, with Olympicnod, say, 'There's your man!' and the handcuffs' brigade do the rest. Sofar as I can foresee, Miss Martin's name may be spared any undueprominence in this inquiry. I go even farther, and promise that anythingI can do in that way shall be done.""That is very kind and considerate of you," said Grant gratefully."Don't halloo till you're out of the wood." said Furneaux, sitting backsuddenly and nursing his left knee with clasped hands. "I can't controlother people's actions, you know. What I insist on to-night is that youshall envisage this affair in its proper light. We have a long way totravel before counsel rises with his smug 'May it please you, me lud,and gentlemen of the jury.' But, having persuaded you to agree that,willy nilly, Miss Doris is the hub of our little universe for the hour,I now swear you and this fire-eater in as assistants. There must be nomore speeches, no punching of heads, very little love-making, and thatby order--""Has the postmaster's daughter a delectable sister, O Liliputian cop?"demanded Hart."No. Two of 'em would have caused a riot long since. Mr. Grant will doall, and more than all, necessary in that direction."Grant leaned forward. He spoke very earnestly."I want you to believe me when I tell you," he said, "that I never gaveserious thought to the notion of marrying Miss Martin until such apossibility was suggested last night by that swab, Ingerman.""Ah, Ingerman! You kept a record of what he said, I gather?""Yes, here it is."Grant rose, and went to a writing-desk with nests of drawers which stoodagainst the wall on the left of the door. He never used it for itsprimary purpose. When the table was laid for meals, Minnie or her motherhad orders to remove all papers and books to the top of the desk. Thehouse contained no other living-room of size. The hall was spacious; asmoking den next the dining-room had degenerated into a receptacle ofguns, fishing-rods, golf-clubs, Alpenstocks, skis and other such sportingaccessories. The remainder of the ground-floor accommodation was given upto the Bateses.Unlocking a drawer, Grant produced a notebook, which he handed toFurneaux. The detective laid it on the table. He was sitting withhis back to the large window. Hart faced him. Grant's chair wasbetween the two."By the way, as you're on your feet, Mr. Grant," said Furneaux, "youmight just show me exactly where you were standing when you saw the faceat the window.""For the love of Mike, what's this?" gurgled Hart. "'The face at thewindow'; 'the postmaster's daughter.' How many more catchy cross-headswill you bring into the story?""Poor Adelaide Melhuish undoubtedly came here on Monday night and lookedin at me while I was at work," said Grant sadly. "You know the history ofmy calf love three years ago, Wally.""Shall I ever forget it? You bored me stiff about it. Then, when thecrash came, you walked me off my legs in the Upper Engadine. Ugh! Thatnight on the Forno glacier. It gives me a chill to think of it now.Furneaux, pass the port. Your name is wrongly spelt. It should befourneau, not Furneaux. A little oven. Hot stuff. Got me?""My _dear_ Hart, you flatter me," retorted the detective instantly."How long am I to pose here?" snapped Grant."Sorry," said Furneaux. "These interruptions are banal. Is that whereyou were?""Yes. I had my hand outstretched for a book. It's dark in thiscorner. When I want to find a book I light a candle, which is alwaysplaced on the ledge of the window for the purpose. The blind was notdrawn that night. It seldom is. I had the book in my hand, and hadfound the required passage when I chanced to look at the window andsaw _her_ face.""Do you mind reconstructing the scene. This lamp was on the table,I suppose?""Yes.""Well, pull up the blind, light your candle, and find the book. Act thewhole incident, in fact."Grant obeyed. He held the candlestick until he had picked out theparticular volume; then he placed it in the recess of the window, andsearched through the pages of the book.Furneaux bent forward so as to watch the rehearsal and catch the effectof the light externally. The hour was not so late as when AdelaideMelhuish, or her ghost, gazed in through one of those narrow panes, butthe night was dark enough to lend the necessary _vraisemblance_. Hart,deeply interested, looked on with rapt, eager eyes. For a full minutethe tableau remained thus. Then, with a rapidity born of many a close'scape in wild lands, Hart drew a revolver from a hip pocket, and firedat the window.He alone was in a position to see through all parts of it. Grant wasstill thumbing a small brown volume in the manner of one who knew that acertain passage would be found therein but was ignorant of its exactplace in the text. Furneaux, intent on his every movement, had only aside-long view of the window, which, it will be remembered, formed a tinyrectangle in a thick wall.The revolver was a heavy-caliber weapon, and the explosion blew out thelamp. The flame of the candle flickered, owing either to the passage ofthe bullet or the disturbance of the air. But it burnt steadily againwithin the fifth part of a second, and they all saw a starred hole in thecenter pane of glass of the second tier from the bottom."What fool's game are you playing?" shrilled Furneaux, neverthelessactive as a wildcat in his spring to the French window, there to snatchat the blind and turn the knob which controlled a lever bolt."Laying another ghost--one with whiskers," said Hart coolly. "I got him,too, I think.""You must be mad, mad!" shrieked the detective, tearing open the window,and vanishing."For Heaven's sake, Wally, no more shooting!" cried Grant, runningafter Furneaux.Minnie and her mother appeared at the dining-room door. Finding the placein semi-obscurity, and reeking with gunpowder, they screamed loudly."You Steynholme folk are all on the jump," said Hart. "Cheer up, fairdames! Thunder relieves the atmosphere, you know, and one live cartridgeis often more effective than an ocean of talk.""Bub-bub-but who's shot, sir?" gasped Minnie."A ghost, a most scoundrelly apparition, with fearsome eyes, offensivewhiskers, and a hat which is a base copy of mine.""Owd Ben!" sighed Mrs. Bates, collapsing straightway in a faint.Luckily, Minnie caught her mother and broke her fall, because thehousekeeper was large and solid, and might have been seriously injuredotherwise. Hart was distressed by this development, but, being eminentlya ready person in an emergency, he rose to the occasion by extracting theempty case from the revolver, and holding it to the poor woman'snostrils, while supporting her with an arm and a knee."This is far more effective than burnt brown paper, Minnie," he said."Now, don't get excited, but mix some brandy and water, and we'll haveyour mother telling us who Owd Ben is, or was, before Hawk-eye comes backto disturb us. Judging by the noises I hear, he's busy outside.""That's father!" shrieked Minnie hysterically."Good Lord! Has your father--"For an instant, Hart was nearly alarmed, but Grant's voice cameauthoritatively:"It's all right, Bates. Let go, I tell you!""Phew!" said Hart. "I was on the point of confusing your respected dadwith Owd Ben ... That's it, ma! Sniff hard! As a cook you're worth yourweight in gold, which is some cook."Meanwhile, Furneaux, seeing that no dead body was stretched on the stripof grass beneath the window, dashed into the shrubbery to the right, andwas clutched in a mighty embrace by an older but much more powerful manin Bates, who had hurried from the front of the house on hearing thepistol-shot. Most fortunately, the gardener, deeming his vigil a needlessone, had not armed himself with a stick, or the consequences might havebeen grave. As it was, no one except Hart had been vouchsafed sight orsound of the latest specter, which, however, had left a very convincingsouvenir of its visit in the shape of a soft felt hat with two bulletholes through the crown.Furneaux, quivering with silent wrath, soon abandoned the search whenthis _piece de conviction_ was found at the root of the Dorothy Perkinsrose-tree. Seeing the lamp relighted, he peremptorily bade Grant andBates come in with him. He closed the window, adjusted the blind again,and poured generous measures of port wine into two glasses. Handing oneto Bates, he took the other himself."Friend," he said, "some men have fame thrust upon them, but you haveachieved it. To-night you pierced the heel of Achilles. Here's to you!""I dunno wot 'ee's saying mister, but 'good health'," said Bates,swigging the wine with gusto."Now, for your master's sake, not a word to a soul about this hubbub.""Right you are, sir! But that there pryin' Robinson wur on t' bridge fiveminutes since. And, by gum, here he is!"A determined knock and ring came at the front door. Minnie, helped byHart, had just escorted Mrs. Bates to the kitchen."Let _me_ go!" said Furneaux, darting out into the hall. He opened thedoor, and thrust his face into the police-constable's, startling thelatter considerably. Before Robinson could utter a syllable, thedetective hissed a question."Did anyone cross the bridge after that shot was fired?""Nun--No, sir," stuttered the other."You saw no one running along the road?""Saw nothing, sir.""Very well. Glad to find you're on the job. Don't let on you met me here.Good-night!"Mighty is Scotland Yard with the provincial police. Robinson was back onhis self-imposed beat before he well realized that he knew neither whynor by whom nor by what sort of weapon the commotion had been created.But he was quite sure the noise came from the garden front of Mr.Grant's house."That little hop-o'-me-thumb thinks he's smart, dam smart," he communedangrily, "but I've taken a line of me own, an' I'll stick to it, thoughthe Yard sends down twenty men!"He heard footsteps coming down a paved footpath which ran like a whiteriband through the cobble-beaded width of the high-street, and withdrewswiftly to the shelter of a disused tannery adjoining the village end ofthe bridge. A cloaked female figure sped past. Though the night wasrather dark for June, he had no difficulty in recognizing Doris Martin'sgraceful movements. No other girl in Steynholme walked like her. She wasslim enough to dispense with tight corsets, and tall enough to wearlow-heeled shoes, nor did she need to pinch her toes in order to gain thesemblance of small feet.After her went Robinson, keyed to exultation by this outcome of hiswatchfulness. She was going to The Hollies, of course. The road led toKnoleworth, and no young woman of her age in the village would dream oftaking a lonely walk in the country at ten o'clock at night.For a man of his height and somewhat ponderous build, the policemanfollowed with real stealth. Thus, when she turned in at the gate, he wasthere by the time she had reached the front door. He heard her pull thebell. Curiously enough, to his thinking, Furneaux again appeared."Is Mr. Grant at home?" he heard Doris say."Yes. Will you come in?" replied the detective."Is he--is all well here?""Quite, I assure you. But _do_ come in. I'll escort you home. I'm goingto the inn in five minutes."Doris, after hesitating a little, entered.Robinson crept on tiptoe over a stretch of gravel, and took to theshrubbery. It was high time, he thought, that the local constabularylearnt what was going on in that abode of mystery.CHAPTER IXHE WHOM THE CAP FITS--Several minutes had elapsed between the two unexpected visits. Duringthose minutes a somewhat acrimonious discussion broke out in thedining-room. Bates went to reassure his wife, and Hart sauntered backfrom the kitchen. He was received by Furneaux and Grant more in sorrowthan in anger, a pose on their part which he blandly disregarded. Hehelped himself to the remains of the decanter of port."The next point of vital interest in the narrative is to establish, bysuch evidence as is available, who Owd Ben is, or was," he said. "Ipresume, since he had attained local celebrity as a ghost, he has passedover, as the spiritists say.""Sit down!" cried Furneaux savagely.Hart sat down, and began filling that portentous pipe."You fellows merely ran into each other outside, I take it," he said,apparently by way of a chatty remark. "The crack of the pistol-shot andthe supposed resurrection of Owd Ben threw Mrs. Bates temporarily off herbalance, so I helped in reviving her. Between such a cook and such aghost, who would hesitate?"When Furneaux was really irritated, he swore in French._"Nom d'un bon petit homme gris!"_ he almost squealed, "why did you whipout that infernal revolver? You spoiled everything, everything! Have youno sense in that picturesque head of yours? Your skull is big enough tohold brains, not soap-bubbles.""Did your French father marry a Jap?" inquired Hart, with suddeninterest."And now you're insulting my mother," yelped the detective."Not I. You know nothing about the finest race of little women in theworld, or you would not even imagine such rubbish.""But why, why, didn't you tell me that you saw someone outside?""You wouldn't have believed me. The goblin was disappearing. I had toshoot quick.""Why shoot at all?""Sir, there are certain manifestations I object to on principle. Whatself-respecting ghost ever wore whiskers?""This was no ghost. You shot the man's hat off.""Then what the blazes are you growling at? Had I, in blood-curdlingwhisper, told you that once again there was a face at the window, youwould have scoffed at me. The ill-looking scamp caught my eye after hisfirst glance at Grant. He was mizzling when I fired. You would have satthere and argued about hypnosis, with our worthy author's skilledsupport. And there would have been no hat! I do an admirable bit of trickshooting, yet I am only reviled for my dexterity. Really, CharlesFrancois!""Ah! You remember, at last," and the detective smiled sourly."_Parfaitement_! as they say in Paris, where you and I met once, though'twas in a crowd. But _I_ didn't steal the blessed pearl. I believe itwas that blatant patriot, Domengo Suarez.""You've got _some_ brains, then. Why not use them? Don't you see what afix we three would have found ourselves in had you shot the man?""But, consider, Carlo mio! A spook with whiskers! What court would findme guilty? Let me produce the authentic record of Owd Ben, and I have nodoubt but that the Lord Chief Justice himself would have potted hisrepresentative. He'd be bound to confess it."Furneaux was cooling down."You've shaken my confidence," he said. "Unless I have your promise thatyou will never do such a thing again while in my company, I shall ban youfrom this inquiry with bell, book, and candle.""Very well. It's a bargain. Now let us ponder Exhibit A."He stretched a long arm over the table, and took the hat."Put it on!" commanded the detective.Hart did so, and scowled frightfully. Furneaux bent forward and squinted."Notice the line of those bullet-holes," he said to Grant."Any man wearing that hat must have had his scalp ploughed up," saidGrant instantly."Well, we know that nothing of the kind happened. Why?""It was perched on top of a wig," drawled Hart.Furneaux was slightly disappointed--there was no denying it. Being a vainlittle person, he liked to show off in a minor matter such as this."Yes," he admitted, "and what's the corollary?""That the wearer is probably a clean-shaven person with thin hair, adaring scoundrel who is well posted in the leading characteristicsof Owd Ben. Charles le Petit, time is now ripe for details of thathairy goblin.""Where did you dig him up from, anyhow?" said the detective testily."Mrs. Bates recognized him from my vivid description.""Her husband can tell us the story," put in Grant. "I'll fetch him."He had not moved ere the front door bell rang a second time."Here is Owd Ben himself, I expect," said Hart."If it's that Robinson--" growled Furneaux vexedly, hastening toforestall Minnie.But it was Doris Martin, and very pretty she looked as she entered theroom, her high color being the joint outcome of a rapid walk and a verynatural embarrassment at finding the frankly admiring eyes of a strangerfixed on her."I don't quite know why I'm here," she said, with a nervous laugh,addressing Grant directly. "You will think I am always gazing in thedirection of The Hollies, but my room commands this house so fully that Icannot help seeing or hearing anything unusual. A few minutes ago I heardwhat I thought was a muffled gunshot. I looked out, and saw your windowthrown open, though the light was dim, and only a candle was showing inthe smaller window. I was alarmed, so came to inquire what had happened.You'll pardon me, I'm sure.""Say you don't, Jack, I implore you, and let me apologize for you,"pleaded Hart."Doris, this is my good friend, Wally Hart," smiled Grant. "Won't you sitdown? We have an exciting story for you.""Father will be horribly anxious if he knows I have gone out."Nevertheless, there was sufficient spice of Mother Eve in Doris that sheshould take the proffered chair."Sorry to interrupt," broke in Furneaux. "Did you meet P.C. Robinson!""No.""You came by way of the bridge?""There is no other way, unless one makes a detour by Bush Walk."The detective whirled round on Grant."What room is over this one?""Minnie's.""She's in the kitchen, with her mother. See that she doesn't comeupstairs while I'm absent. You three keep on talking.""Thanks," said Hart.Doris, more self-possessed now, read the meaning of the quip promptly."Mr. Grant has often spoken of you," she said. "You talk, andwe'll listen.""Not so, divinity," came the retort. "I may be a parrot, but I don't wantmy neck wrung when you've gone.""Don't encourage him, Doris," said Grant, "or you'll be here tillmidnight.""If that's the best you can do, you had better leave the recital to me,"laughed Hart.Meanwhile, Furneaux had stolen noiselessly to the bedroom overhead. Thecasement window was open--he had noted that fact while in the garden. Hepeeped out, and was just in time to see Robinson emulating a Sioux Indianon the war-path. The policeman removed his helmet, and was about to peercautiously through the small window. The detective's blood ran cold. Whatif Hart discovered yet another ghost?"Robinson--go home!" he said, in sepulchral tones.The constable positively jumped. He gaped on all sides in real terror.He, too, had heard hair-raising tales of Owd Ben."Go home!" hissed Furneaux, leaning out.Then the other looked up."Oh, it's you, sir!" he gasped, sighing with relief."Man, you've had the closest shave of your life! There's a fellow belowthere who shoots at sight.""But I'm on duty, sir.""You'll be in Kingdom Come if you gaze in at that window. Be off!""I--""Robinson, you and I will quarrel if you don't do as I bid you. And thatwould be a pity, because I want to inform Mr. Fowler that he has aparticularly smart man in Steynholme.""Very well, sir, if _you're_ satisfied, I _must_ be."And away went the eavesdropper, crushed, still tingling with that fear ofthe supernatural latent in every heart, but far from convinced.Furneaux tripped downstairs. The routing of Robinson had put him into areal good humor. He found the three in the dining-room gazingspell-bound at the felt hat."Now, young lady, you're coming with me," he said, grinning amiably. "TheSussex constabulary is quelled for the hour.""But, Mr. Furneaux, I recognize that hat!" said Doris, and it was notablethat even Hart remained silent.The detective looked at her strangely, but put no question."I am almost sure it belongs to our local Amateur Dramatic Society," wenton the girl. "It was worn by Mr. Elkin last November. He played aburlesque of Svengali. I was Trilby, and caught a horrid cold fromwalking about without shoes or stockings.""Don't tell me any more," was Furneaux's surprising comment. "I'll do therest. But let me remark, Miss Martin, that I experienced greatdifficulty, not so long ago, in persuading friend Grant that you were theonly important witness this case has provided thus far. Playing in aburlesque, were you? We've been similarly engaged to-night. The farcemust stop now. It makes way for grim tragedy. Not one word of to-night'sevents to anyone, please.... Are you ready?"Doris stood up. Hart thrust the negro's head at the detective."Fouche," he said, "do you honestly mean slinging your hook withoutmaking any inquiry as to Owd Ben?""Oh, the ghost!" said Doris eagerly. "The Bateses would think of him, ofcourse. An old farmer named Ben Robson used to live in this house aboutthe time of Napoleon. He was suspected by the authorities to be an agentof the smugglers, and the story goes that his own daughter quarreled withhim and betrayed him. He narrowly escaped hanging, owing to his age, Ibelieve, and was sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. At last he wasreleased, being then a very old man, and he came straight here andstrangled his daughter. It is quite a terrible story. He was found deadby her side. Then people remembered that she had spoken of someonescaring her by looking in through that small window some nightspreviously. Naturally, a ghost was soon manufactured. I really wonder whythe man who rebuilt and renamed the place in the middle of last centurydidn't have the window removed altogether.""Glad I began the work of demolition tonight," said Hart, and, for once,his tone was serious."Why did you never tell me that scrap of history, Doris?" inquired Grant."You liked the place so much that father and I agreed not to mar yourenthusiasm by recalling an unpleasant legend," she said frankly. "Notthat what I've related isn't true. The record appears in a SussexMiscellany of those years.... Oh, my goodness, can it be eleven o'clock!"The hall clock had no doubt on the point. Furneaux pocketed the writtennotes regarding Ingerman, and grabbed the hat off the table. Grant, forsome reason, was aware that the detective repressed an obvious referenceto the last occasion on which the girl had heard that same clockannounce the hour.Furneaux would allow no other escort. He and Doris made off immediately.When they were gone, Hart stared fixedly at an empty decanter."My dim recollection of your port, Jack, is that it was a wine of manyvirtues and few vices," he mused aloud.Grant took the hint, and went to a cellar. Returning, he found his cronyporing over the book which, singularly enough, figured prominently oneach occasion when the specter-producing window was markedly inevidence. Hart glanced up at his host, and nodded cheerfully at adust-laden bottle."What is there in 'The Talisman' which needed so much research?" heasked."Some lines by Sir David Lindsay, quoted by Scott," was the answer."Are these they?" And Hart read:One thing is certain in our Northern land;Allow that birth, or valor, wealth, or wit,Give each precedence to their possessor,Envy, that follows on such eminence,As comes the lyme-hound on the roebuck's trace,Shall pull them down each one."Yes," said Grant."Love isn't mentioned. The fair Doris will be true. You're in luck, myboy. But somebody is out for your blood, and here is clear warning. Geewhizz! If I remain in Steynholme a week I shall become an occultist. Whatis a lyme-hound?""'Lyme,' or 'leam,' is the old-time word for 'leash.'""Good!" said Hart. "That will appeal to Furneaux. Have him in to dinnerevery day, Jack. He's a tonic!"Furneaux, for some reason known only to himself, did not accompany Doristo the post office. Once they were across the bridge, and the broadvillage street, more green than roadway, was seen to be empty, he tappedher on the shoulder and said pleasantly:"Run away home now, little girl. Sleep well, and don't worry. The tanglewill right itself in time.""Poor Mr. Grant is suffering," she ventured to murmur."And a good thing, too. It will steady him. Hurry, please. I'll wait heretill you are behind a locked door.""No one in Steynholme will hurt me," she said."You never can tell. I'm not taking any chances to-night, however."So Doris sped swiftly up the hill. Arrived at her house, she waved a handto the detective, who flourished his straw hat in response. A fine Junenight in England is never really dark, so the two could not only see eachother but, when Doris disappeared, Furneaux, turning sharply on his heel,was able to make out the sudden straightening of a pucker in the blind ofa ground-floor room in P.C. Robinson's abode.The detective walked straight there, and tapped lightly on the window.Robinson, after an affected delay, came to the door."Who's there?" he demanded."As if you didn't know," laughed Furneaux.Robinson turned a key, and looked out."Oh, it's you, sir?" he cried."You'll get tired of saying that before I quit Steynholme," said thedetective. "May I come in? No, don't show a light here. Let's chat in theback kitchen.""I was just going to have a bite of supper, sir," began Robinsonapologetically. "It's laid in the kitchen. On'y bread and cheese an' aglass of beer. Will you join me?""With pleasure, if I hadn't stuffed myself at Grant's place. Nice fellow,Grant. Pity you and he don't seem to get on together. Of course, wepolicemen cannot allow friendship to interfere with duty, but, betweenyou and me, Robinson--strictly in confidence--Grant had no more to dowith the actual murder of Miss Melhuish than either of us two."Robinson had turned up a lamp, and hospitably installed Furneaux in hisown easy-chair."The 'actual murder,' you said, sir?" he repeated."Yes. It was his presence at The Hollies which brought an infatuatedwoman there, and thus directly led to her death. That is all. Grant istelling the truth. I assure you, Robinson, I never allow myself to breakbread with a man whom I may have to convict. So, I'll change my mind, andtake a snack of your bread and cheese."The village constable, by no means a fool, grinned at the impliedtribute. What he did not appreciate so readily was the fact that hissomewhat massive form was being twiddled round the detective'slittle finger."Right you are, sir," he cried cheerily. "But, if Mr. Grant didn't killMiss Melhuish, who did!""In all probability, the man who wore that hat," chirped Furneaux, takinga nondescript bundle from a coat pocket, and throwing it on the table.Robinson started. This June night was full of weird surprises. Heset down a jug of beer with a bang--his intent being to fill twoglasses already in position, from which circumstance even the leastobservant visitor might deduce a Mrs. Robinson, _en neglige_,hastily flown upstairs.He examined the hat as though it were a new form of bomb."By gum!" he muttered. "Are these bullet-holes?""They are.""An' is this what someone fired at?""Yes.""But how in thunder--"He checked himself in time. He did not want to admit that he had beenwatching the only recognized road to Grant's house all the evening."Quite so!" chortled Furneaux, with admirable misunderstanding. "You'requick on the trigger, Robinson--almost as quick as that friend of Grant'swho arrived by the 5.30 from London. You perceive at once that noordinary head could have worn that hat without having its hair combed bythe same bullet. It was stuck on to a thick wig. Now, tell me the man, orwoman, in Steynholme, who wears a wig and a hat like that, and you and Iwill guess who killed Miss Melhuish."Robinson suspected that, as he himself would have put it, his leg wasbeing pulled rather violently. Furneaux read his face like a printedpage. Chewing, much against his will, a mouthful of bread and cheese, hemumbled in solemn, broken tones:"Think--Robinson. Don't--answer--offhand. Has--anybody--ever worn--suchthings--in a play?"Then the policeman was convinced, galvanized by memory, as it were."By gum!" he cried again. "Fred Elkin--in a charity performancelast winter."Furneaux choked with excitement."A horsey-looking chap, on to-day's jury," he gurgled."That's him!""The scoundrel!""No wonder he looked ill.""No wonder, indeed. How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds makes illdeeds done!""But, sir--"Robinson was flabbergasted. He could only murmur "Fred Elkin!" in adazed way."Have a drink," said Furneaux sympathetically. "I'll wet my whistle,too. Only half a glass, please. Now, we mustn't jump to conclusions.This Elkin looks a villain, but may not be one. That is to say, hisvillainy may be confined to dealings in nags. But you see, Robinson,what a queer turn this affair is taking. We must get rid of preconceivednotions. Superintendent Fowler and you and I will go into this matterthoroughly to-morrow. Meanwhile, breathe not a syllable to a livingsoul. If I were you, I'd let Mr. Grant understand that we regard him asrather outside the scope of our inquiry. This beer is very good for acountry village. You know a good thing when you see it, I expect. Pity Idon't smoke, or I'd join you in a pipe. I must get a move on, now, orthat fat landlord will be locking me out. Good night! Yes. I'll takethe hat. _Good_ night!"While walking up the hill Furneaux fanned himself with the straw hat."One small bit of my brain is evidently a hereditary bequest from agood-natured ass!" he communed. "Here am I, Furneaux, plagued beyondendurance by a first-class murder case, and I must go and busy myselfwith the love affair of a postmaster's daughter and a feather-headednovelist!"When Tomlin admitted him to the Hare and Hounds, he buttonholed thelandlord, who, at that hour, was usually somewhat obfuscated."Sir," said the detective gravely, "I am told that you Steynholme folkindulge occasionally in such frivolities as amateur theatricals?""Once in a way, sir. Once in a way. Afore I lock up the bar, will you--""Not to-night. I've mixed port and beer already, and I'm only a littlefellow. Now you, Mr. Tomlin, can mix anything, I fancy?""I've tried a few combinations in me time, sir.""But, about these theatrical performances--is there any scenery,costumes, 'props' as actors call them?""Yes, sir. They're stored in the loft over the club-room--the room wherethe inquest wur held.""What, _here_?"Furneaux's shrill cry scared Mr. Tomlin."Y-yes, sir," he stuttered."Is that my candle?" said the detective tragically. "I'm tired, deadbeat. To-night, Mr. Tomlin, you are privileged to see the temporary wreckof a noble mind. God wot, 'tis a harrowing spectacle."Furneaux skipped nimbly upstairs. Tomlin proceeded to lock up."It's good for trade," he mumbled, "but I'll be glad when these 'ereLunnon gents clears out. They worry me, they do. Fair gemme a turn, 'edid. A tec', indeed! He's nothin' but a play-hactor hisself!"CHAPTER XTHE CASE AGAINST GRANTNext morning, after a long conference with Superintendent Fowler, fromwhich, to his great chagrin, P. C. Robinson was excluded, Furneaux wentto the post office, dispatched an apparently meaningless telegram to acode address, and exchanged a few orthodox remarks with Doris and herfather about the continued fine weather. While he was yet at the counter,Ingerman crossed the road and entered the chemist's shop."Let me see," said the detective musingly, "by committing a slighttrespass on your left-hand neighbor's garden, can I reach the yardof the inn?""What the eye doesn't see the heart doesn't grieve over," smiled Doris."Mrs. Jefferson went to Knoleworth early to-day, and took her maid. Byshopping at the stores there, they save their fares, and have a day outeach week.""May I go that way, then?" he said. "Suppose you send that goggle-eyedskivvy of yours on an errand."This was done, and Furneaux made the desired transit.Now, Tomlin, to whom the comings and goings of all and sundry formed thestaple of the day's gossip, had seen the detective go out, but could"take his sollum davy" that the queer little man had not returned. He,too, had watched Ingerman going to Siddle's. Ten minutes later Elkin camedown the hill, and headed for the same rendezvous. Five minutes more, andHobbs, the butcher, joined the others. Tomlin was seething withcuriosity, but there were some casual customers in the "snug," so hecould not abandon his post.Soon, however, Ingerman led Elkin and Hobbs to the inn. Evidently, the"financier" had been making some small purchases. He was in high spirits.Ordering appetizers before the mid-day meal, he announced that he wasreturning to London that afternoon, but would be in Steynholme again forthe adjourned inquest."No matter how my business suffers, I mean to see this affair through,"he vowed. "You gentlemen can pretty well guess my private convictions.You were good enough to give me your friendship, so I spoke as openlyas one dares when no charge has actually been laid against anyparticular person.""Ay," said Elkin, with whom sunshine seemed to disagree, because helooked miserably ill. "We know what you mean, Mr. Ingerman. If the policewere half sharp they'd have nabbed their man before this ... Did you putany water in this gin, Tomlin?""Water?" wheezed Tomlin indignantly. _"Water?"_"Well, no offense. I can't taste anything. I believe I could swallow dopeand not feel it on my tongue.""You do look bad, an' no mistake, Fred," agreed Hobbs. "Are you vettin'yerself? Don't. Every man to his trade, sez I. Give Dr. Foxton a call.""I'm taking his medicine regular. Perhaps I need a change.""'Ave a week-end in Lunnon," said Hobbs, with a broad wink."Change of medicine, I mean. I'm not leaving Steynholme till things makea move. My next trip to London will be my honeymoon.""You look like a honeymooner, I don't think," guffawed Hobbs."You wouldn't laugh if I told _you_ what you really look like," criedElkin angrily. "Bet you a level fiver I'm married this year. Now, put upor shut up!"Furneaux peeped in, through a door, always open, which led to the stairs."Can I have my account, Mr. Tomlin?" he said. "I'm going to town by thenext train.""You don't mean to say, Mr. Furneaux, that you are abandoning the case sosoon?" broke in Ingerman."Did I say that?" inquired the detective meekly."No. One can't help drawing inferences occasionally.""Great mistake. Look at our worthy landlord. He's been drawing inferencesas well as corks, and he's beat to the world."Tomlin was, indeed, gazing at his smaller guest open-mouthed."S'elp me!" he gurgled. "I could ha' sworn--""Bad habit," and Furneaux crooked a waggish forefinger at him. "Even thewisest among us may err. Last night, for instance, I blundered. I reallyfancied I had a clew to the Steynholme murderer. And where do you thinkit ended? In the loft of your club-room, Mr. Tomlin. In a box of oldclothes at that. Silly, isn't it?""Wot! Them amatoor play-hactin' things?""Exactly."Elkin grunted, though intending to laugh."Not so sharp for a London 'tec, I must say," he cried. "Why, those propshave been there since before Christmas.""Yes. I know now," was the downcast reply. "Twelve hours ago I thoughtdifferently. Didn't I, Mr. Tomlin?"Tomlin tried hard to look knowing."Oh, is that wot you wur drivin' at?" he said. "Dang me, mister, I couldsoon ha' put you right 'ad you tole me.""Well, well. Can't be helped. I may do better in London. What do _you_say, Mr. Ingerman? The City is the real mint of money and crime. Whoknows but that a stroll through Cornhill may have some bearing on theSteynholme mystery?""May be you'd get a bit nearer if you took a stroll along the KnoleworthRoad, and not so very far, either," guffawed Elkin."Who knows?" repeated Furneaux sadly. "Good-day, gentlemen. Some of thismerry party will meet again, of course, if not here, at the Assizes.Don't forget my bill. Mr. Tomlin. By the way, one egg at breakfast hadseen vicissitudes. It shouldn't be rated too highly.""I'm traveling by your train," cried Ingerman."So I understood," said Furneaux over his shoulder.There was silence for a moment after he had gone. Ingerman lookedthoughtful, even puzzled. He was casting back in his mind to discoverjust how and when the detective "understood" that his departure wasimminent, since he himself had only arrived at a decision after leavingthe chemist's."That chap is no good," announced Elkin. "I'll back old Robinson againsthim any day.""Sh-s-sh! He may 'ear you," muttered the landlord."Don't care if he does. Cornhill! What the blazes has Cornhill to dowith the murder at The Hollies?"Ingerman appreciated the value of that concluding phrase. Elkin had usedit once before in Siddle's shop, and was quietly reproved by the chemistfor his outspokenness.Ingerman, however, did not inform the company that his office lay in analley off Cornhill. He elected to rub in Elkin's words."Mr. Siddle seemed to object to The Hollies being mentioned as the sceneof the crime," he said. "I wonder why?""Because he's an old molly-coddle," snapped the horse-dealer. "Thinkseveryone is like himself, a regular slow-coach."Tomlin closed the door into the passage, closed it for the first time inliving memory, whereat Furneaux, on the landing above, grinnedsardonically, and ran downstairs."Wot's this about them amatoor clo'es?" he inquired portentously. "Oo 'asthe key of that box?""_I_ have," said Elkin. "I locked it after the last performance, and,unless you've been up to any monkey tricks, Tomlin, the duds arethere yet.""You're bitin' me 'ead off all the mornin', Fred," protested theaggrieved landlord. "Fust, the gin was wrong, an' now I'm supposed to'ave rummidged yur box. Wot for?"Furneaux popped in."My bill ready?" he squeaked."No, sir. The train--""Leaves at two, but I'm driving to Knoleworth with SuperintendentFowler."The door closed behind him. Tomlin shook his head."Box! Jack-in-the-box, I reckon," he said darkly, turning to adog-eared ledger.Neither at Knoleworth nor Victoria did Ingerman catch sight of thedetective, though he was anxious either to make the journey in thecompany of the representative of Scotland Yard or arrange an earlyappointment with him. True, he was not inclined to place thestrange-mannered little man on the same high plane as that suggested bycertain London journalists to whom he had spoken. But he wanted to winthe confidence of "the Yard" in connection with this case, and the beliefthat he was being avoided was nettling. He found consolation, of a sort,in the illustrated papers. One especially contained two pages of localpictures. "Mr. Grant addressing the crowd," with full text, was veryeffective, while there were admirable studies of The Hollies and the"scene of the tragedy." His own portrait was not flattering. The sun hadetched his Mephistophelian features rather sharply, whereas Grant lookeda very fine fellow.Ingerman would have been more than surprised were he privileged tooverhear a conversation which began and ended before he reached his flatin North Kensington.Furneaux, who had jumped into the fore part of the train at Knoleworth,and was out in a jiffy at Victoria, handed his bag to a stationdetective, and turned into Vauxhall Bridge Road, one of the quietest ofLondon's main thoroughfares. There he met a big man, dressed in tweeds,whose manifest concern at the moment seemed to center in a rather badwrapping of a very good cigar."Ah! How goes it, Charles?" cried the big man heartily, affecting to beaware of Furneaux's presence when the latter had walked nearly a hundredyards down a comparatively deserted street."What's wrong with the toofa?" inquired Furneaux testily."My own carelessness. Stupid things, bands on cigars.... Well, what'sthe rush?""There's a train to Steynholme at five o'clock. I want you to take hold.I must have help. Like your cigar, this case has come unstuck."Mr. James Leander Winter, Chief Inspector under the CriminalInvestigation Department, whistled softly."Tut, tut!" he said. "One can never trust the newspapers. Reading thismorning's particulars, it looked dead easy.""Tell me how it struck you. Sometimes the uninformed brain is vouchsafeda gleam of unconscious genius."Winter appeared to be devoting his mind to circumventing the vagaries ofa fragile tobacco-leaf. He was a man of powerful build, over forty, heavybut active, deep-chested, round-headed, with bulging blue eyes whichradiated kindliness and strength of character. The press photographerdescribed him accurately to Grant. The average Londoner would have takenhim for a county gentleman on a visit to the Agricultural Show atIslington, with a morning at Tattersall's as a variant. Yet, Sam Weller'sextensive and peculiar knowledge of London compared with his as afreshman's with a don's of a university. It would be hard to assess, incoin of the realm, the value of the political and social secrets stowedaway in that big head."First, I must put a question or two," he said, smiling at a baby whichcooed at him from the shaded depths of a passing perambulator. "Is thereanother woman?""Yes, the postmaster's daughter, Doris Martin.""Shy, pretty little bird, of course?""Everything that is good and beautiful.""Is Grant a Lothario?""Excellent chap. Quarter of an hour before the murder he was giving Dorisa lesson in astronomy in the garden of The Hollies.""Never heard it called _that_ before.""This time the statement happens to be strictly accurate.""Honest Injun?""I'm sure of it. If anything, the death of Adelaide Melhuish cleared thescales off their eyes. Those two have never kissed or squeezed--yet.They'll be starting quite soon now.""How old is Doris?""Nineteen.""But a really good-looking girl of nineteen must have had admirers beforeGrant went to the village.""She had, and has. Having educated herself out of the rut, however, sheleft many runners at the post. One is persistent--a youngish horse-copernamed Elkin. Adelaide Melhuish probably saw her with Grant. Neither Dorisnor Grant knew that Adelaide Melhuish, as such, was in Steynholme. Thatis to say, the girl had seen Miss Melhuish in the post office, andrecognized her as a famous actress, but that is all. And now I shan'ttell you any more, or you'll know all that I know, which is too much."The cigar was behaving itself at last, having burnt down to the fracture,so Winter's thoughts could be given exclusively to the less importantmatter of the Steynholme affair."To begin with," he said instantly. "Ingerman can establish acast-iron alibi.""So I imagined. But he's a bad lot. I throw in that item gratuitously."The oddly-assorted pair walked in silence until Vauxhall Bridge was insight. Winter pulled out a watch."What time did you say my train left Victoria?" he inquired."Plenty of time yet to make your guess and listen to further details,"scoffed Furneaux."Frankly, I give it up. But, if I must share in the hunt, I tell you nowthat, metaphorically speaking, I shall cling to the postmaster's daughtertill torn away by sheer force of evidence."Furneaux dug his colleague in the ribs."That's the effect of constant association with me, James," he cackledgleefully. "Ten years ago you would have pounced on Elkin. You've hit it!I'm a prood mon the day. The pupil is equaling the master.""You little rat, I had hanged my first murderer before you knew themeaning of _habeas corpus_! Let's turn now, and get to business."Few Treasury barristers, leading for the Crown, could have marshaled thefacts with such lucidity and fairness as Furneaux during that saunter toVictoria Station."Nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in malice," said Othello toLodovico, and these Scotland Yard men, charged with so great aresponsibility, never forgot the great-hearted Moor's advice.When Winter took his seat in the train at five o'clock he could havedrawn a plan of Steynholme, which he had never seen, and marked thereonthe exact position of each house mentioned in this record. Moreover, hewas acquainted with the chief characters by sight, as it were. And,finally, he and Furneaux had arranged a plan of campaign.Furneaux refreshed a jaded intellect by an evening at the opera. Nextmorning, at eleven o'clock, he was inquiring for Mr. Ingerman at anoffice in a certain alley off Cornhill.A smart youth interposed a printed formula between the visitor and a doormarked "Private." Furneaux wrote his name, and put "Steynholme" in thespace reserved for "business." He was admitted at once. Mr. Ingerman,apparently, was immersed in a pile of letters, but he swept them allaside, and greeted the caller affably."Glad to see you, Mr. Furneaux," he said. "I missed you on the trainyesterday. Did you--""Nice quiet place you've got here, Mr. Ingerman," interrupted thedetective."Yes. But, as I was about to--""Artistically furnished, too," went on Furneaux dreamily. "Oak,self-toned carpets and rugs, restful decorations. Those etchings, also,show taste in the selection. 'The Embankment--by Night.' Fitting sequelto 'The City--by Day.' I'm a child in such matters, but, 'pon my honor,if tempted to pour out my hard-earned savings into the lap of a Citymagnate, I would disgorge here more readily than in some saloon-bar offinance, where the new mahogany glistens, and the typewriters click likemachine-guns."Ingerman was nettled. He glanced at his correspondence."You have a somewhat far-fetched notion of my position," he said, with astaccato quality in his velvet voice. "I am not a magnate, and I toilhere to make, not to lose, money for my clients.""A noble ideal. Forgive me if my rhapsody took the wrong line.""And I'm sure you will forgive me if I now put the question which leadsto the probable cause of your visit. Did you travel by the two o'clocktrain yesterday?""Yes. I avoided you purposely.""May I ask, why?""My mind was weary. I wanted my wits about me when I tackled you."Ingerman smiled, and leaned back, resting both elbows on the arms of thechair, and bringing the tips of his fingers together."Proceed," he said."You prefer that I should drag out a statement piecemeal rather thanreceive it _en bloc_?""Put it that way, if you like.""I shall even enjoy it. To clear the ground, are you the Isidor G.Ingerman who exploited the A1 Mine in Abyssinia?"Ingerman's finger-tips whitened under a sudden pressure, but his voiceremained calm."An unfortunate episode," he said."And the Aegean Transport Company, Limited?""Into which I was inveigled by Greeks. But why this history of ruinedenterprises?""It's a sort of schooling. I have noticed that the smartest counselinvariably begin with a few fireworks in order to induce the proper frameof mind in a witness.""Does that mean that you want me to blurt out bitter and prejudicedaccusations against Mr. Grant?""I want to hear what you have to say about the death of your wife. Youforced the cross-examining role on me. I'm doing my best."Ingerman kept silent during many seconds. When he spoke, his culturedvoice was suave as ever."Perhaps it was my fault, Mr. Furneaux," he said. "You gave me a stronghint. I should have taken it, and we might have started an interestingchat on pleasanter lines. So, with apologies for my insistence about thetrain, I make a fresh start. I believe firmly that Grant was directlyconcerned in the murder. And I shall justify my belief. Within the pastfortnight a _rapprochement_ between my wife and myself became possible.It was spoken of, even reduced to the written word. I have her letters.Mine should be found among her belongings. May I take it that they _have_been found?""Yes," said Furneaux."Ah. So far, so good. My poor wife reached the parting of the ways. Shesaw that her life was becoming an empty husk. I think the theater waspalling on her. But I see now that she still cherished the dream ofwinning the man she loved--not me, her husband, but that handsomedilettante, Grant. I take it, therefore, that she went to Steynholme todetermine whether or not the glamour of the past was really dead.Unfortunately, she witnessed certain idyllic passages between herone-time lover and a charming village girl. Imagine the effect of thisdiscovery on one of the artistic temperament. 'Hell hath no fury like awoman scorned,' and my unhappy wife would lash herself into an emotionalfrenzy. She would tear a passion to rags. Her very training on the stagewould come to her aid in scathing words--perhaps threats. If Grantremained cold to her appeal the village beauty should be made to suffer.Then _he_ would flame into storm. And so the upas-tree of tragedy spreadits poisonous shade until reason fled, and some demon whispered, 'Kill!'I find no flaw in my theory. It explains the inexplicable. Now, how doesit strike you, Mr. Furneaux?""As piffle.""Is that so? I have the advantage, of course, in knowing my wife'speculiarities. And I have made some study of Grant. He admits alreadythat he is under suspicion. Why, if he is innocent? Mind you, I paylittle heed to the crude disposal of the body. Horace, I think, has atruism that art lies in concealing art. My wife's presence in Steynholmewas no secret. She would have been missed from the inn. Search would bemade. The murder must be revealed sooner or later, and the murdererhimself was aware that by no twisting or turning could his name escapeassociation with that of his victim. Why not face the music at once? hewould argue. The very simplicity of the means adopted to fasten a kind ofresponsibility on him might prove his best safeguard. Even now I doubtwhether any jury will find him guilty on the evidence as it stands, butmy duty to my unhappy wife demands that I shall strengthen the arm ofjustice by every legitimate means in my power.""Is that your case, Mr. Ingerman?""At present, yes.""It assumes that the police adopt your view.""Not necessarily. The police must do their work without fear or favor.But Grant can be committed for trial on a coroner's warrant.""Grant is certainly in an awkward place.""Only a little while ago you dismissed my theory of the crime as airypersiflage.""That was before you quoted Horace. I have a great respect for Horace.His ode to the New Year is a gem.""Would you care to see my wife's recent letters?""If you please.""They are at my flat, I'll send you copies. The originals are always atyour disposal for comparison, of course. Now may I, without offense, aska question?""Yes.""Is it wise that the emissary of Scotland Yard should leave Steynholme?""But didn't I tell you that I might obtain light in the neighborhood ofCornhill?""True. I could have given you the facts in Steynholme.""I'm a greater believer in what the theater people call 'atmosphere.'Some of your facts, Mr. Ingerman, remind me of an expert's report in amining prospectus. When tested by cyanide of potassium the gold in theore often changes into iron pyrites. But don't hug the delusion that Ishall neglect Steynholme. The murderer is there, not in London, and,unless my intellect is failing, he will be tried for his life at the nextLewes Assizes. Meanwhile, may I give you a bit of advice?""By all means.""Employ a sound lawyer, one who will avoid needless mud-slinging. Goodday! Send those letters to the Yard by to-night's post if practicable.""It shall be done."When the door closed on Furneaux, Ingerman smiled."I've given that little Frenchman furiously to think," he murmured.But the "little Frenchman" was smiling, too. He had elaborated the schemealready discussed with Winter. It was much to his liking, thoughunorthodox, rather crack-brained, more than risky, and altogether opposedto the instructions of the Police Manual. Each of these drawbacks was acommendation to Furneaux. In fact, the Steynholme mystery had taken quitea favorable turn during that talk with Ingerman.CHAPTER XIP. C. ROBINSON TAKES ANOTHER LINEAbout the time Furneaux was whisked past The Hollies in SuperintendentFowler's dogcart, Grant and Hart were finishing luncheon, and planning along walk to the sea. Grant would dearly have liked to secure Doris'scompany, but good taste forbade that he should even invite her to sharethe ramble. Thus, the death of a woman with whom he had not exchanged aword during three years had already set up a barrier between Doris andhimself. Though impalpable, it was effective. It could neither be climbednor avoided. Quiet little Steynholme had suddenly become a rigid censorof morals and etiquette. Until this evil thing was annihilated by slowprocess of law, Doris and he might meet only by chance and never remainlong together.When the two were ready to start, Hart elected to dispense with his SouthAmerican sombrero."I am sensitive to ridicule," he professed. "The village urchins willchristen me 'Owd Ben,' and the old gentleman's character was such that Iwould feel hurt. So, for to-day, I'll join the no hat brigade.""I wonder if we'll meet Furneaux," said Grant, selecting awalking-stick. "It's odd that we should have seen nothing of himthis morning.""It would be still more odd if we had, remembering the precautions hetook not to be observed coming here last night.""Well, that's so. I forgot to ask the reason. There was one, I suppose.""Of the best. That little man is a live wire of intelligence. He's wastedon Scotland Yard. He ought to be a dramatist or an ambassador.""Quaint alternatives, those.""Not at all. Each profession demands brains, and is at its best incoining cute phrases. I've met scores of both tribes, and they're like aspeas in a pod."A bell rang."That's the front door," said Grant. "It's Furneaux himself, I hope."But the visitor was P.C. Robinson, who actually smiled and saluted."Glad I've caught you before you went out, sir," he said. "Mr. Furneauxasked me to tell you he had to hurry back to London. I was also tomention that he had got the whiskers.""What whiskers? Whose whiskers?""That's all he said, sir--he'd got the whiskers.""Why, Owd Ben's whiskers, of course. How dense you are, Jack!" put inHart.Now, this was the first Robinson had heard of whiskers in connectionwith the crime. He remembered Elkin's make-up as Svengali, of course, andcould have kicked himself for not associating earlier a set of sablewhiskers with the black wig and the bullet-torn hat.But, Owd Ben! What figure did that redoubtable ghost cut in the mystery?"There are certain _lacunae_ in your otherwise vigorous and thrillingstory, constable," went on Hart."Very likely, sir," agreed Robinson, much to the surprise of hishearers. He had not the slightest notion what a _lacuna_, or itsplural, signified. He was only adopting Furneaux's advice, and tryingto be civil."Ah, you see that, do you?" said Hart. "Well, fill 'em in. When, where,and how did the midget sleuth obtain the specter's hairy adornments?"The policeman, whose wits were thoroughly on the alert, realized that hehad scored a point, though he knew not how."He did not tell me, sir," he answered. "It's a rum business, that's whatit is, no matter what way you look at it."Grant, agreeably aware of the village constable's change of front,accepted the olive branch readily."We're just going for a walk," he said. "If you have ten minutes tospare, Mrs. Bates will find you some luncheon, I have no doubt.""Well, sir, meals are a trifle irregular during a busy time like this,"admitted Robinson, feeling that his luck was in, because tongues wouldsurely be loosened in the kitchen to an official guest introduced by themaster of the establishment. He was right. No member of the Bates familydreamed of reticence, now that the household was restored to favor with"the force." Before Robinson departed, he was full of information andgood food.What more natural, then, an hour later, than that he should contrive tomeet Elkin as the horse-dealer was taking home a lively two-year-old ponyhe had been "lungeing" on a strip of common opposite his house?Each was eager to question the other, but Elkin opened fire."Anything fresh?" he cried. "You have a fair course now, Robinson. Thatlittle London 'tec has bunked home.""Has he?" In the language of the ring, Robinson thought fit to spar foran opening."Oh, none of your kiddin'," said Elkin, stroking the nervous colt's neck."You know he has. You don't miss much that's going on. Bet you half athick 'un you'd have put someone in clink before this if the murder atThe Hollies had been left in your hands.""That's as may be, Mr. Elkin. But this affair seems to have gripped youfor fair. You look thoroughly run down. Sleepin' badly?""Rotten! Hardly got a wink last night.""You shouldn't be out so late. Why, on'y a week ago you were in bedregular at 10.15.""That inquest broke up the day yesterday, so I was delayed atKnoleworth.""What time did you reach home?""Dashed if I know. After twelve before I was in bed. By the way, what'sthis about things missing from a box owned by the Amateur DramaticSociety? That silly josser of a detective--What's his name?""Furneaux," said Robinson, who was clever enough not to appear toosecretive, and was thanking his stars that Elkin had introduced the verytopic he wanted to discuss."Ay, Furneaux. I remember now. He worried old Tomlin last night aboutthat box, which is kept in the loft over the club-room. So Tomlin and I,and Hobbs, just to satisfy ourselves, went up there as soon as Furneauxleft to-day. And, what do you think? The box was unlocked, though Ilocked it myself, and have the key; and a hat and wig and whiskers Iwore when we played a skit on 'Trilby' were missing. If that isn't aclew, what is?""A clew!" repeated the bewildered Robinson."Yes. I'm telling you, though I kept dark before the other fellows.Didn't you say Grant's cheek was bleeding on Tuesday morning?""I did.""Well, the whiskers were held on by wires that slip over the ears. Onewire was sharp as a needle. I know, because it stuck into a finger morethan once. Why shouldn't it scratch a man's cheek, and the cut open againnext morning?""By jing, you've got your knife into Mr. Grant, an' no mistake,"commented Robinson."You yourself gave him a nasty jab at the inquest," sneered Elkin."I was just tellin' the facts.""So am I. I think you ought to know about that hat and the other things.I would recognize them anywhere. Furneaux had something up his sleeve,too, or he wouldn't have pumped Tomlin... Woa, boy! So long, Robinson! Imust put this youngster into his stall.""I'll wait, Mr. Elkin," said Robinson solemnly. "I want to have a wordwith you."The policeman was glad of the respite. He needed time to collect histhoughts. The story of the dinner-party and its excitement disposedcompletely of Elkin's malicious theory with regard to Grant, but, sincethe horse-dealer was minded to be communicative, it would be well toencourage him."Come in, and have a drink," said Elkin, when the colt had been stabled."No, thanks--not when I'm on duty."Elkin raised his eyebrows sarcastically. He could not possibly guess thatRobinson was adopting Furneaux's pose of never accepting hospitalityfrom a man whom he might have to arrest."Well, blaze away. I'm ready."The younger man leaned against a gate. He looked ill and physically worn."Your business has kept you out late of a night recently, you say, Mr.Elkin," began the other, speaking as casually as he could contrive. "Now,it might help a lot if you can call to mind anyone you met on the roadsat ten or eleven o'clock. For instance, last night--"Elkin laughed in a queer, croaking way."Last night my mare brought me home. I was decidedly sprung, Robinson.Glad you didn't spot me, or there might have been trouble. What betweenthe inquest, an' no food, an' more than a few drinks at Knoleworth, I'dhave passed Owd Ben himself without seeing him, though I believe I didsquint in at The Hollies as I went by.""What time would that be?""Oh, soon after eleven.""Sure.""I can't be certain to ten minutes or so. The pubs hadn't closed when Ileft Knoleworth. What the devil does it matter, anyhow?"It mattered a great deal. Robinson could testify that Elkin did not crossSteynholme bridge "soon after eleven.""Nothing much," was the answer. "You see, I'm anxious to find out whomight be stirring at that hour, an' you know everybody for miles around.I'd like to fix your journey by the clock, if I could.""Dash it all, man, I was full to the eyes. There! You have it straight.""Were you out on Monday night?""The night of the murder?""Yes.""I left the Hare and Hounds at ten, and came straight home.""Who was there with you?""The usual crowd--Hobbs, and Siddle, and Bob Smith, and a commercialtraveler. Siddle went at half past nine, but he generally does.""You met no one on the road?""No."The monosyllable seemed to lack Elkin's usual confidence. It soundedas if he had been making up his mind what to say, yet faltered at thelast moment.Robinson ruminated darkly. As a matter of fact, long after eleven o'clockon that fateful night, he himself had seen Elkin walking homeward. He waswell aware that the licensing hours were not strictly observed by theHare and Hounds when "commercial gentlemen" were in residence. Closingtime was ten o'clock, but the "commercials," being cheery souls, becamenominal hosts on such occasions, and their guests were in no hurry todepart. Robinson saw that he had probably jumped to a conclusion, anacrobatic feat of reasoning which Furneaux had specifically warned himagainst. At any rate, he resolved now to leave well enough alone."Well, we don't seem to get any forrarder," he said. "You ought to takemore care of your health, Mr. Elkin. You're a changed man these days.""I'll be all right when this murder is off our chests, Robinson. Youwon't have a tiddley? Right-o! So long!"Robinson walked slowly toward Steynholme. At a turn in the road he haltednear the footpath which led down the wooded cliff and across the river toBush Walk. He surveyed the locality with a reflective frown. Then, therebeing no one about, he made some notes of the chat with Elkin. The man'scandor and his misstatements were equally puzzling. None knew better thanthe policeman that the vital discrepancy of fully an hour and a half onthe Monday night would be difficult to clear up. Tomlin, of course, wouldhave no recollection of events after ten o'clock, but the commercialtraveler, who could be traced, might be induced to tell the truth ifassured that the police needed the information solely for purposes inconnection with their inquiry into the murder. That man must be found.His testimony should have an immense significance.That evening, shortly before seven o'clock, a stalwart,prosperous-looking gentleman in tweeds "descended" from the Londonexpress at Knoleworth. The local train for Steynholme stood in a bay onthe opposite platform, and this passenger in particular was making for itwhen he nearly collided with another man, younger, thinner, bespectacled,who hailed him with delight."You, too? Good egg!" was the cry.The gentleman thus addressed did not seem to relish this geniality."Where the deuce are you off to?" he demanded."To Steynholme--same as you, of course.""Look here, Peters, a word in your ear. If you know me during the nextfew days, you'll never know me again. I suppose you'll be staying at thelocal inn--there's only one of any repute in the place?""That's so. I've got you. May I take it that you will reciprocate whenthe time comes?""Have I ever failed you?""No. We meet as strangers."Peters bustled off. He had the reputation of being the smartest "writerup" in London of mystery cases. The Steynholme affair had interested bothhim and a shrewd news-editor.The pair arrived at the Hare and Hounds within a few minutes of eachother. The big man registered as "Mr. W. Franklin, Argentina." Petersordered a chop, and went off at once to interview the local policeman.Mr. Franklin took more pains over the prospective meal."Have you a nice chicken?" he inquired.Yes, Mr. Tomlin had a veritable spring chicken in the larder atthat moment."And do you think your cook could provide a _tourne-dos_?""A what-a, sir?" wheezed Tomlin.The visitor explained. He liked variety, he said. Half the chicken mightbe deviled for breakfast. The two dishes, with plain boiled potatoes andFrench beans, would suit him admirably. He was sorry he dared not tryTomlin's excellent claret, but a dominating doctor had put him on thewater-cart. In effect, Mr. Franklin impressed the landlord as a man oftaste and ample means.Peters had gobbled his chop before Franklin entered the dining-room, butthey met later in the snug, where Elkin was being chaffed by Hobbs anenthis carryin's on in Knoleworth the previous night.Siddle came in, but the chatter was not so free as when the habitues hadthe place to themselves.Now, Peters had marked the gathering as one that suited his purposeexactly, so he gave the conversation the right twist."I suppose you local gentlemen have been greatly disturbed by thissensational murder?" he said.Hobbs took refuge in a glass of beer. Siddle gazed contemplatively athis neat boots. Tomlin meant to say something; Elkin, eying the stranger,and summing him up as a detective, answered brusquely:"The murder is bad enough, but the fat-headed police are worse. Threedays gone, and nothing done!""What murder are you discussing, may I ask?" put in Franklin.Peters turned on him with astonishment in every line of a peculiarlymobile face."Do you mean to say, sir, that you haven't heard of the Steynholmemurder?" he gasped."I seldom, if ever, read such things in the newspapers, and, as I landedin England only a week ago from France, my ignorance, though abyssmal, ispardonable. Moreover, I can say truly that I am far more interested inpedigree horses than in vulgar criminals."Peters explained fluently. This was no ordinary crime. A beautiful andpopular actress had been done to death in a brutal way, and the countrywas already deeply stirred by the story.Elkin waited impatiently till the journalist drew breath. Then he brokein."Pedigree horses you mentioned, sir," he said, his rancor against Grantbeing momentarily conquered by the pertinent allusion to his ownbusiness. "What sort? Racing, coaching, roadsters, or hacks?""All sorts. The Argentine, where I have connections, offers an ever-opendoor to good horseflesh.""Are you having a look round?""Yes. There are several decent studs within driving distance ofSteynholme. Isn't that so, landlord?""Lots, sir," said Tomlin. "An' the very man you're talkin' to has somestuff not to be sneezed at.""Is that so?" Mr. Franklin gazed at Elkin in a very friendly manner. "MayI ask your name, sir?"Elkin produced a card. Every hoof in his stables appreciated invalue forthwith, but he was far too knowing that he should appear torush matters."Call any day you like, sir," he said. "Glad to see you. But give menotice. I generally have an appetizer here of a morning about eleven.""An' you want it, too, Fred," said Hobbs. "Dash me, you're as thin as aherrin'. Stop whiskey an' drink beer, like me.""And you might also follow that gentleman's example," interposed Siddlequietly, nodding towards Mr. Franklin."What's that?" snapped Elkin."Don't worry about murders.""That's a nice thing to say. Why should _I_ worry about the d---dmix-up?"The chemist made no reply, but Hobbs stepped into the breach valiantly."Keep yer 'air on, Fred," he vociferated. "Siddle means no 'arm. But wotelse are yer a-doing of, mornin', noon, an' night?"Elkin laughed, with his queer croak."If you stay here a day or two, you'll soon get to know what they'redriving at, sir," he said to Franklin. "The fact is that this chap,Grant, who found the body, and in whose garden the murder was committed,has been making eyes at the girl I'm as good as engaged to. That wouldmake anybody wild--now, wouldn't it?""Possibly," smiled Franklin. "Of course there is always the lady's pointof view. The sex is proverbially fickle, you know. 'Woman, thy vows aretraced in sand,' Lord Byron has it.""Ay, an' some men's, too," guffawed Hobbs. "Wot about Peggy Smith, Fred?"Elkin blew a mouthful of cigarette smoke at the butcher."What about that tough old bull you bought at Knoleworth on Monday?"he retorted.Hobbs's face grew purple. Mr. Franklin beckoned to Tomlin."Ask these gentlemen what they'll have," he said gently. The landlordmade a clatter of glasses, and the threatened storm passed."You've aroused my curiosity," remarked Franklin to Peters, but takingthe company at large into the conversation. "This does certainly strikeone as a remarkable case. Is there no suspicion yet as to the actualmurderer?""None whatever," said Peters."That's what you may call the police opinion," broke in Elkin. "WeSteynholme folk have a pretty clear notion, I can assure you.""The matter is still _sub judice_, and may remain so a long time," saidSiddle. "It is simply stupid to attach a kind of responsibility to theman who happens to occupy the house associated with the crime. I have nopatience with that sort of reasoning."Hobbs, who did not want to quarrel with Elkin, suddenly championed him."That's all very well," he rumbled. "But the hevidence you an' me 'eard,Siddle, an' the hevidence we know we're goin' to 'ear, is a lot strongerthan that.""I'm sure you'll pardon me, friends," said Siddle, rising with anapologetic smile, "but I happen to be foreman of the coroner's jury, andI feel that this matter is not for me, at any rate, to discuss publicly."Out he went, not even heeding Tomlin's appeal to drink the ginger-ale hehad just ordered."Just like 'im," sighed Hobbs. "Good-'earted fellow! Would find hexcusesfor a black rat."Elkin talked more freely now that the chemist's disapproving eye was offhim. Ultimately, Mr. Franklin elected to smoke a cigar in the open air,and strolled forth. He sauntered down the hill, stood on the bridge, andadmired the soft blue tones of the landscape in the half light of asummer evening. Shortly before closing time, Robinson appeared, it beingpart of his routine duty to see that no noisy revelers disturbed thepeace of the village. He noticed the stranger at once, and elected towalk past him.Thus, he received yet another shock when Mr. Franklin addressedhim by name."Good evening, Robinson," said the pleasant, clear-toned voice. "I'vebeen expecting you to turn up. Kindly go back home, and leave the dooropen. I want to slip in quietly. I am Chief Inspector Winter, ofScotland Yard.""You don't say so, sir!" stammered Robinson."But I do say it, and will prove it to you, of course. I'll be with youin a minute or two. There's someone coming. You and I must not be seentogether."Robinson made off, and Winter lounged along the Knoleworth road. He metBates, going to the post with letters.Naturally, Bates looked him over. Returning from the post office, he kepta sharp eye for the unknown loiterer, but saw him not. He even walkedquickly to the bend of the road, but the other man had vanished.Grant and Hart were talking of anything but the murder when Bates thrusthis head in. He was grasping his goatee beard, sure sign of some weighton his mind."Beg pardon," he said, "but I thought you'd like to know. The place isjust swarmin' with 'em.""Bees?" inquired Hart.Bates stared fixedly at the speaker for a second or two."No, sir, 'tecs," he said. "There's a big 'un now--just the opposite tothe little 'un, Hawkshaw. I 'ope I 'aven't to tackle this customer,though. He'd gimme a doin', by the looks of 'im."Bates had disappeared before Grant remembered that the press photographerhad mentioned the Big 'Un and the Little 'Un of the Yard."Now, I wonder," he said.His wonder could hardly have equaled Winter's had he heard the gardener'swords. The guess was a distinct score for blunt Sussex, though it wasfounded solely on the assumption that all comers now, unless Bates waspersonally acquainted with them, were limbs of the law.CHAPTER XIIWHEREIN WINTER GETS TO WORKWinter had identified Bates at the first glance. The letters in the man'shand, too, showed his errand, so, while the gardener was climbing thehill, the detective slipped into Robinson's cottage.He found the policeman awaiting him in the dark, because a voice said:"Beg pardon, sir, but the other gentleman from the 'Yard' asked me totake him into the kitchen. A light in the front room might attractattention, he thought.""Just what Mr. Furneaux would suggest, and I agree with him," saidWinter, quite alive to the canny discretion behind those words, "theother gentleman."Robinson led the way. Supper was laid on the table. Poor Mrs. Robinsonhad again beaten a hasty retreat."Now, Robinson," said the Chief Inspector affably, "before we come tobusiness I'll prove my bona fides. Here is my official card, and I'll runquickly through events until 1.30 p.m. to-day. I met Mr. Furneaux atVictoria, and he posted me fully up to that hour."So the policeman listened to a clear summary of the Steynholme case asit was known to the authorities."I did not warn either Mr. Fowler or you of my visit because a telegramcould hardly be explicit enough," concluded Winter. "At the inn I am Mr.Franklin, an Argentine importer of blood stock in the horse line. Atthis moment the only other man beside yourself in Steynholme who isaware of my official position is Mr. Peters, and he is pledged tosecrecy. To-morrow or any other day until further notice, you and I meetas strangers in public. By the way, Mr. Furneaux asked me to tell youthat he found the wig and the false beard in the river early thismorning. The wearer had apparently flung them off while crossing thefoot-bridge leading from Bush Walk, having forgotten that they would notsink readily. Perhaps he didn't care. At any rate, Mr. Hart's bulletseems to have laid Owd Ben's ghost. Now, what of this fellow, Elkin? Heworries me.""Can I offer you a glass of beer, sir?""With pleasure. May I smoke while you eat? You see, I differ from Mr.Furneaux in both size and habits."Robinson poured out the beer. He was preternaturally grave. The somewhatincriminating statements he had wormed out of the horse-dealer thatafternoon lay heavy upon him. But he told his story succinctly enough.Winter nodded to emphasize each point, and congratulated him at the end."You arranged that very well," he said. "I gather, though, that Elkinspoke rather openly.""Just as I've put it, sir. He tripped a bit over the time on Mondaynight. But it's only fair to say that he might have had Tomlin'slicense in mind.""That issue will be settled to-morrow. I'll find out the commercialtraveler's name, and send a telegram from Knoleworth before noon.... Whois Peggy Smith?"Robinson set down an empty glass with a stare of surprise."Bob Smith's daughter, sir," he answered."No doubt. But, proceed.""Well, sir, she's just a village girl. Her father is a blacksmith. Hisforge is along to the right, not far. She'll be twenty, or thereabouts.""Frivolous?""Not more than the rest of 'em, sir.""Have you seen her flirting with Elkin?"Robinson took thought."Now that I come to think of it, she might be given a bit that way. Herfather shoes Elkin's nags, so there's a lot of comin' an' goin' betweenthe two places. But folks would always look on it as natural enough. Yes,I've seen 'em together more than once.""In that case, he can hardly grumble if the postmaster's daughter has aneye for another young man.""Miss Martin!" snorted Robinson. "She wouldn't look the side of the roadhe was on. Fred Elkin isn't her sort.""But he said to-night in the Hare and Hounds that he and Miss Martin werepractically engaged.""Stuff an' nonsense! Sorry, sir, but I admire Doris Martin. I like to seea girl like her liftin' herself out of the common gang. She's thesmartest young lady in the village, an' not an atom of a snob. No, no.She isn't for Fred Elkin. Before this murder cropped up everybody wouldhave it that Mr. Grant would marry her.""How does the murder intervene?"Robinson shifted uneasily in his chair. He knew only too well that hehimself had driven a wedge between the two."Steynholme's a funny spot, sir," he contrived to explain. "Since it cameout that Doris an' Mr. Grant were in the garden at The Hollies at halfpast ten on Monday night, without Mr. Martin knowin' where his daughterwas, there's been talk. Both the postmaster an' the girl herself are upto it. You can see it in their faces. They don't like it, an' who canblame 'em!""Who, indeed? But this Elkin--surely he had some ground for a definiteboast, made openly, among people acquainted with all the parties?""There's more than Elkin would marry Doris if she lifted a finger, sir.""Can you name them?""Well, Tomlin wants a wife."Winter laughed joyously."Next?" he cried."They say that Mr. Siddle is a widower.""The chemist? Foreman of the jury?""Yes, sir.""From appearances, he is a likelier candidate than either Elkin orTomlin. Anybody else?""I shouldn't be far wrong if I gave you the name of most among the youngunmarried men in the parish.""Dear me! I must have a peep at this charmer. But I want those names,Robinson."Winter produced a note-book, so he was evidently taking the matterseriously. The policeman, however, was flustered. His thoughts ran onElkin, whereas this masterful person from London insisted on discussingDoris Martin."My difficulty is, sir, that she has never kep' company with any of'em," he said."Never mind. Give me the name of every man who, no matter what hisposition or prospects, might be irritated, if no more, if he knew thatMiss Martin and Mr. Grant were presumably spooning in a garden at arather late hour."It was a totally new line of inquiry for Robinson, but he bent his witsto it, and evolved a list which, if published, would certainly beregarded with incredulous envy by every other girl in the village thanthe postmaster's daughter; as for Doris herself, she would be mightilysurprised when she saw it, but whether annoyed or secretly gratified nonebut a pretty girl of nineteen can tell.Winter departed soon afterwards. Before going to the inn he had a look atthe forge. A young woman, standing at the open door of the adjoiningcottage, favored him with a frank stare. There was no light in thedwelling. When he returned, after walking a little way down the road, thedoor was closed.Next morning, Bates heard of Peters as the detective and of Mr. Franklinas a "millionaire" from South America. Moreover, he scrutinized both inthe flesh, and saw Robinson salute Peters but pass the financialpotentate with indifference.Alas, that a reputation, once built, should be destroyed!"I was mistook, sir," he reported to Grant later. "There's another 'tecabout, but 'e ain't the chap I met last night. They say this other blokeis rollin' in money, an' buyin' hosses right an' left.""Then he'll soon be rolling in the mud, and have no money," put in Hart."Who is he?" inquired Grant carelessly."A Mr. Franklin, from South America, sir."Grant and Hart exchanged glances. Curiously enough, Hart remained silenttill Bates had gone."I must look this joker up, Jack," he said then. "To me the mere mentionof South America is like Mother Gary's chickens to a sailor, a harbingerof storm."But Hart consumed Tomlin's best brew to no purpose--in so far as seeingMr. Franklin was concerned, since the latter was in Knoleworth, buying afamous racing stud. Being in the village, however, this fisher introubled waters was not inclined to return without a bag of some sort.He walked straight into the post office. Doris and her father were there,the telegraphist being out."Good day, everybody," he cried cheerfully. "Grant wants to know, Mr.Martin, if you and Miss Doris will come and dine with him, us, thisevening at 7.30?"The postmaster gazed helplessly at this free-and-easy stranger. Dorislaughed, and blushed a little."This is Mr. Hart, a friend of Mr. Grant's, dad," she explained. "I'mafraid we cannot accept the invitation. We are so busy.""The worst of excuses," said Hart."But there is a London correspondent here who hands in a long telegramat that hour.""What's his name?""Mr. Peters.""Great Scott! Jimmie Peters here? I'll soon put a stopper on him. He'llcome, too--jumping. See if he doesn't. Is it a bargain? Short telegramat six. Dinner for five at 7.30. Come, now, Mr. Martin. It's up to you. Ican see 'Yes' in Doris's eye. Over the port--most delectable, I assureyou--I'll give full details of the peculiar case of a man inWorcestershire whose crop of gooseberries increased fourfold afterstarting an apiary. And what does it matter if you do lose a queen or twoin June? The drones will attend to that trifle.... It's a fixture, eh?Where's Peters? In the Pull and Push? I'll rout him out."The whirlwind subsided, but quickly materialized again."Peters nearly fell on his knees and wept with joy," announced Hart. "Hebelieves he was given a bull steak for luncheon. He pledges himself tohave only five hundred words on the wire at five o'clock."Meanwhile, father and daughter had decided that there was no valid reasonwhy they should not dine with Mr. Grant. Martin already regretted hisaloofness on the day of the inquest, though, truth to tell, Hart's expertknowledge of bee-culture was the determining factor. On her part, Doriswas delighted. Her world had gone awry that week, and this smallfestivity might right it.Not one word of the improvised dinner-party did Hart confide to Grant. Heinformed the only indispensable person, Mrs. Bates, and left it at that.Grant, a restless being these days, took him for another long walk. Itchanced that their road home led down the high-street. The hour was aquarter past seven, and Peters hailed them.Hart introduced the journalist, saying casually:"Jimmie is coming to dinner, Jack.""Delighted," said Grant, of course.Peters looked slightly surprised, but passed no comment. Then Doris andher father appeared. They joined the others, shook hands, and, to Grant'ssecret perplexity, the whole party moved off down the hill in company.When the Martins turned with the rest to cross the bridge, Grant began tosuspect his friend."Wally," he managed to whisper, "what game have you been playing?""Aren't you satisfied?" murmured Hart. "Sdeath, as they used to say inthe Surrey Theater, you're as bad as Furshaw!"There were others far more perturbed by that odd conjunction of dinersthan the puzzled host, who merely expected Mrs. Bates to belabor him witha rolling pin. Mr. Siddle, for instance, had just closed his shop whenthe five met. That is to say, the dark blue blind was drawn, but thedoor was ajar. He came to the threshold, and watched the party until thebridge was neared, when one of them, looking back, might have seen him,so he stepped discreetly inside. Being a non-interfering, self-containedman, he seemed to be rather irresolute. But that condition passedquickly. Leaning over the counter, he secured a hat and a pair offield-glasses, and went out. He, too, knew of Mrs. Jefferson's weaknessfor shopping in Knoleworth, and that good lady had gone there again. Hertrain was due in ten minutes. A wicket gate led to a narrow passagecommunicating with the back door of her residence. He entered boldly,reached the garden, and hurried to the angle on the edge of the cliffnext to the Martins' strip of ground.Yes, a spacious dinner-table was laid at The Hollies. Doris, Mr. Martin,and Peters soon strolled out on to the lawn. The pedestrians hadobviously gone upstairs to wash after their tramp.Mr. Siddle rather forgot himself. He stared so long and earnestly throughthe field-glasses that he ran full tilt into Mrs. Jefferson and maidbefore regaining the high-street. But the chemist was a ready man. Helifted his hat with an inquiring smile."Didn't you say you wanted some anti-arthritic salts early in theweek?" he asked."Yes," said Mrs. Jefferson, "but I got some to-day in Knoleworth,thank you.""Well, I was just making up an indent, and might as well include yourspecific if you really needed it."Which was kind and thoughtful of Mr. Siddle, but not quite true, thoughit fully explained his presence at Mrs. Jefferson's gate.Mr. Franklin, escorting a fragrant Havana up the hill (he had traveled bythe same train) saw the meeting, and, being aware of Mrs. Jefferson'sfrugal habits, since Furneaux had omitted no item of his movements inSteynholme, remembered it later during the nightly gathering in the inn.Elkin greeted Mr. Franklin respectfully when the great man joinedthe circle."Did you see anything worth while at Knoleworth, sir?" he said."No. I was unlucky. All the principals were at a race meeting.""By gum! That's right. It's Gatwick today. Dash! I might have saved youa journey.""Oh, it doesn't matter. In my business there is no call for hurry."Elkin looked around."Where's our friend, the 'tec?" he said."I think you're wrong about 'im, meanin' Mr. Peters," said Tomlin. "'E's'ere for a noospaper, not for the Yard.""That's his blarney," smirked Elkin. "A detective doesn't go abouttelling everybody what he is.""Whatever his profession may be," put in Siddle's quiet voice, "I happento know that he is dining with Mr. Grant. So are Mr. Martin and Doris. Bymere chance I called at Mrs. Jefferson's. I went to the back door, and,finding it closed, looked into the garden. From there I couldn't helpseeing the assembly on the lawn of The Hollies.""Dining at Grant's?" shouted Elkin in a fury. "Well, I'm--""'Ush, Fred!" expostulated Tomlin with a shocked glance at Mr. Franklin."Wot's wrong wi' a bit of grub, ony ways? A very nice-spoken young gentkem 'ere twiced, an' axed for Mr. Peters the second time. He's a friendo' Mr. Grant's, I reckon.""What's wrong?" stormed the horse-dealer. "Why, everything's wrong! Thebounder ought to be in jail instead of giving dinner-parties. ImagineDoris eating in that house!""Ay! Sweetbreads an' saddle o' lamb," interjected Hobbs with the air ofone imparting a secret.Elkin was pallid with wrath. He glared at Hobbs."What I had in my mind was the impudence of the blighter," he saidshrilly. "That poor woman's body leaves here to-morrow for some cemeteryin London, and Grant invites folk to a small dinner to-night!"A sort of awe fell on the company. None of the others had as yet put thetwo events in juxtaposition, and they had an ugly sound. Even Mr. Siddlestifled a protest. Elkin had scored a hit, a palpable hit, and no onecould gainsay him. He felt that, for once, the general opinion was withhim, and drove the point home."Hobson--the local joiner and undertaker"--he explained for Mr.Franklin's benefit--"came this morning to borrow a couple of horses forthe job. It's to be done in style--'no expense spared' was Mr. Ingerman'sorder--and the poor thing is in her coffin now while Grant--"He stopped. Mr. Siddle coughed."You've said enough, Elkin," murmured the chemist. "This excitement isharmful. You really ought to be in bed for the next forty-eight hours,dieting yourself carefully, and taking Dr. Foxton's mixture regularly. Hehas changed it, I noticed.""Bed! Me! Not likely. I'm going to kick up a row. What are the policedoing? A set of blooming old women, that's what they are. But I'll stir'em up, if I have to write to the Home Secretary.""Gentlemen," said Mr. Franklin, smiling genially, "I cannot help taking acertain interest in this affair. May I, then, as a complete stranger toall concerned, tell you how this minor episode strikes me. Mr. Grant, Iunderstand, denies having seen or spoken to Miss Melhuish during the pastthree years. None of the others now in his house had met her at all.Really, if a man may not give a dinnerparty in these conditions,dining-out would become a lost art."Elkin was obviously seeking for some retort which, though forcible, wouldnot offend a possible patron. But Siddle answered far more deftly thanmight be looked for from the horse-dealer."Your contention, sir, is just what the man of the world would hold," hesaid, "but, in this village, where we live on neighborly terms, such anincident would be impossible in almost any other house than The Hollies."Mr. Franklin nodded. He was convinced. Tomlin, Hobbs, and a local draperbore out the chemist's reasonable theory. Next morning Steynholme wasagain united in condemning Grant, while the postmaster and his daughterwere not wholly exempted from criticism.The dinner itself was an altogether harmless and cheery meal. By commonconsent not one word was said about the murder. Hart was amusing on thequestion of bees--almost flippant, Mr. Martin deemed him. Peters had awide store of strange experiences to draw on, while Grant, if rathersilent in deference to two such brilliant talkers, found muchsatisfaction in regarding Doris as a hostess.The next day being Saturday, or market day, the village was busy. Ateleven o'clock there was a somewhat unnecessary display of noddingplumes and long-tailed black horses at the removal of the coffin to therailway station. For some reason, the funeral arrangements had not beenbruited about until Elkin made that envenomed attack on Grant in the Hareand Hounds the previous night. Ingerman had sent a gorgeous wreath, theonly one forthcoming locally. This fact, of course, invited comment,though no whisperer in the crowd troubled to add that the interment wasonly announced in that day's newspapers.Peters, meeting Mr. Franklin on the stairs of the inn, put a note intohis hand. It read:"Why don't you have a chat with Grant? The public mind is being inflamedagainst him. It's hardly fair."Mr. Franklin, meeting Peters in the passage, winked at him, and thejournalist tortured his brains to turn out some readable stuff whichshould grip the million on Sunday yet not to be damaging to the man whosehospitality he enjoyed over night.In a word, the passing of Adelaide Melhuish was exploited thoroughly asan indictment of her one-time lover, and the only two in Steynholme notaware of the fact were Grant, himself, and Wally Hart.By a singular coincidence, not ridiculously beyond the ken of a verger,when Doris went to church on Sunday morning, she found herself besideMr. Franklin.At the close of the service the same big man whom she had noticed as aneighbor in the pew overtook her at the post office door. He lifted hishat. A passer-by heard him say distinctly:"Pardon me for troubling you, but can you tell me at what time the mailcloses for London?""At four-thirty," said Doris.No other person overheard Mr. Franklin's next words:"I am now going to drop a letter in the box. It's for you. Get it atonce. It is of the utmost importance."Doris was startled, as well she might be. But--she went straight for theletter. It was marked: "Private and Urgent," and ran:DEAR MISS MARTIN. I am here _vice_ Mr. Furneaux, who is engaged on otherphases of the same inquiry. My business is absolutely unknown. I figureat the inn as "Mr. W. Franklin, Argentina." Indeed, Mr. Furneaux left thevillage because he realized the difficulties facing him in that respect.Now, I trust you, and I hope you will justify my faith. You knowSuperintendent Fowler. I want you to meet me and him this afternoon attwo o'clock at the crossroads beyond the mill. A closed car will be inwaiting, and we can have half an hour's talk without anyone in Steynholmebeing the wiser. Remember that this village, like the night, has athousand eyes. Naturally, I would not trouble you in this way if thecause was not vital to the ends of justice. Whether or not you decide tokeep this appointment, I have every confidence that you will respect mywish that _no one_, other than yourself, shall be informed of myidentity. But I believe you will be wise, and come.I am,Yours faithfully,J.L. WINTER,Chief Inspector, C.I.D., Scotland Yard, S.W.A card was inclosed, as a sort of credential. But, somehow, it was notneeded. Doris had seen "Mr. Franklin" more than once, and she had heardhim singing the hymns in church. He looked worthy of credence. Hiswritten words had the same honest ring. She resolved to go.Her father, sad to relate, had found three dead queens in the hives. Hewas busy, but spared a moment to tell her that Mr. Siddle was coming totea at four o'clock. Doris was rather in a whirl, and seemed to beunnecessarily astonished."Mr. Siddle! Why?" she gasped."Why not!" said her father. "It's not the first time. You can entertainhim. I'll look after the letters.""I must get some cakes. We have none.""Well, that's simple. I wonder if that fellow Hart really understandsapiaculture? You might invite him, too."With that letter in her pocket Doris had suddenly grown wary. Hart andSiddle would not mix, and her woman's intuition warned her that Siddlehad chosen the tea-hour purposely in order to have an uninterruptedconversation with her. She disliked Mr. Siddle, in a negative way, butthe very nearness of the detective was stimulating. Let Mr. Siddle come,then, and come alone!"No, dad," she laughed. "Mr. Hart's knowledge will be availableto-morrow. In his presence, poor Mr. Siddle would be dumb."CHAPTER XIIICONCERNING THEODOEE SIDDLEWinter, being a cheerful cynic, had not erred when he appealed to thatlove of mystery which, especially if it is spiced with a hint of harmlessintrigue, is innate in every feminine heart. Indeed, he was so assured ofthe success of his somewhat dramatic move that as he walked to arendezvous arranged with Superintendent Fowler on the Knoleworth road hereviewed carefully certain arguments meant to secure Doris's assistance.Passing The Hollies, he smiled at the notion that Furneaux wouldundoubtedly have brought Grant to the conclave. It was just the sort ofdifficult situation in which his colleague would have reveled. But theChief Inspector was more solid, more circumspect, even, singularlyenough, more sensitive to the probable comments of a crusty judge ifcounsel for the defense contrived to elicit the facts."Anything fresh?" inquired the superintendent, when a smart car drew up,and Winter entered.Mr. Fowler was in plain clothes, and the blinds were half drawn. No onecould possibly recognize either of the occupants unless the car washalted, and the inquisitor literally thrust his head inside. The motorwas a private one, borrowed for the occasion."Yes, a little," said Winter, as the chauffeur put the engine in gear."Your man, Robinson, has been drawing Elkin, or Elkin drew him--I am notquite sure which, but think it matterless either way."He sketched Robinson's activities briefly, but in sufficient outline."A new figure has come on the screen--Siddle, the chemist," he addedthoughtfully."Siddle!" Mr. Fowler was surprised. "Why, he is supposed to be a model ofthe law-abiding citizen.""I don't say he has lost his character in that respect," said Winter."Still, he puzzles me. Elkin is a loud-mouthed fool. The verbal bricks hehurls at Grant are generally half baked, and crumble into dust. Hitherto,Siddle has tried to repress him, with a transparent honesty that ratherworried me. On Friday night, however, Siddle attacked Grant with poisonedarrows. He did more damage in two minutes than Elkin could achieve in asmany months.""How?""He showed very clearly that Grant was guilty of gross bad taste ininviting Mr. Martin and his daughter to dinner that evening. I'm inclinedto agree with him, if the story has been told fairly. But that is besidethe main issue. Siddle aroused the sleeping dogs of the village, and thepack is in full cry again. Grant seems to have been popular here; he hadalmost recovered from the blow of Miss Melhuish's death by thestraightforward speech he made before the inquest. But Siddle threw himback into the mud by a few skillful words. What is Siddle's record? Is hea local man?""I think not. Robinson can tell us.""Robinson says he 'believes' Siddle is a widower. That doesn't argue longand close knowledge.""We must look into it. Robinson has been stationed here four years.Siddle is not old, but he has been in business in Steynholme more yearsthan that. But--you'll pardon me, I'm sure, Mr. Winter--may I take itthat you are really interested in the chemist's history?"The superintendent was perplexed, or he would not have adopted hisprofessional method of semi-apologetic questions with a man fromthe C.I.D."I hardly know what I'm interested in," laughed Winter. "Grant didn'tkill the lady. I shall be slow to credit Elkin with being the scoundrelhe looks. Siddle, and Tomlin, if you please, are regarded as starters inthe Doris Martin Matrimonial Stakes, and I don't think Tomlin could evermurder anything but the King's English. It is Siddle's _volte face_ thatbothers me.""Um!" murmured Mr. Fowler. He was not an uneducated man, but _volteface_, correctly pronounced, was unfamiliar in his ears."The change was so marked," went on the detective. "I gather that Siddleis a stickler for charity and fair dealing. He didn't abandon the role,of course. It was the sheer ingenuity of his method that caught myattention. So I simply catalogue him for research.""Has Miss Martin promised to meet us?" inquired the other, feeling thathe was on the track of _volte face_."No. But there she is!" cried Winter. "She has just heard the car.Tell your chauffeur to slow up. The road is empty otherwise. By theway, you help her in. She might be a bit shy of me, and I don't want asecond's delay."Winter's judgment was not at fault. Doris _was_ feeling a trifleuncertain, seeing that she was about to encounter a complete stranger.Moreover, she had come a good half mile from the shop whence the cakesfor tea were to be procured at the back door, and as a favor. Her eyeswere fixed on the slowing car with a timid anxiety that betrayed nosmall degree of doubt as to the outcome of this Sunday afternoonescapade. She was pale and nervous. At that moment Doris wished herselfsafe at home again."One word," broke in the superintendent hurriedly. "Why are you so surethat Grant is innocent, Mr. Winter?""I'm sure of nothing with regard to this case. But I have great faith inFurneaux's flair for the true scent. It has never failed yet."Mr. Fowler wished his companion would not use such uncommon words.However, he got out, and took off his hat with a courteous sweep. Dorishad to look twice at him. Hitherto, she had always seen him in uniform.Winter smiled at the unmistakable expression of relief in her face. Shewas almost self-possessed as she took the seat by his side."Good day, Mr. Winter," she said."Mr. Franklin, please. Better become used to my pseudonym.... Plenty ofroom for your feet, Mr. Fowler? That's it. Now we're comfy. The chauffeurwill bring us back here in half an hour, Miss Martin. Will that suit yourconvenience?""Oh, yes. I am free till nearly four o'clock. We have a guest totea then.""I have a well-developed bump of curiosity these days. Who is it,may I ask?""Mr. Siddle, the local chemist.""Indeed. An old friend, I suppose?""We have known him seven years, ever since he came to Steynholme.""Ah. He is not a native of the place?""No. He bought Mr. Benson's business. He's a Londoner, I believe.""Is there--a Mrs. Siddle?""No. I--er--that is to say, gossip has it that he was married, but hiswife died.""He doesn't speak of her? Is that it? One would have thought that in ahouse where he is well known--""We don't really know him well. No one does, I think.""You've invited him to tea, at any rate," laughed Winter."No," said Doris. "He invited himself. At least, so I gathered from dad.""Ah, well. He feels lonely, no doubt, and wishes to chat about recentstrange events in Steynholme. And that brings me to the reason why Isought this chat under such peculiar conditions. You realize my handicap,Miss Martin? If I were seen talking to you, or even entering your houseas apart from the post office, people would begin to wonder. You followthat, don't you?"Yes, Doris did follow it. What she did not follow was the veiledadmiration in Superintendent Fowler's glance at the detective. Those fewinconsequential questions had shed a flood of light on Siddle's past andpresent, yet the informant was blissfully unaware of their real purport.And the way was opened so deftly. The purchase of a chemist's businesswould almost certainly be negotiated through a local lawyer. Let him befound, and Siddle's pre-Steynholme days could be "looked into," as thepolice phrase has it. The superintendent had the rare merit of beingcandid with himself. He had no previous experience of Scotland Yard menor methods, and was inclined to be skeptical about Furneaux. But Winter'sprompt use of a chance opening, and the restraint which cut off theinvestigation before the girl could suspect any ulterior motive,displayed a technique which the Sussex Constabulary had few opportunitiesof acquiring."Now, Miss Martin," began Winter, "if ever you have the misfortune tofall ill--touch wood, please--and call in a doctor, you'll tell him thefacts, eh?""Why consult him at all, if I don't?" she smiled."Exactly. To-day I'm somewhat in the position of a Harley-streetspecialist, summoned to assist an eminent local practitioner in Dr.Fowler. That's a sort of gentle preliminary, leading up to thedisagreeable duty of putting some questions of a personal nature. Whatyou may answer will not go beyond ourselves. I promise you that. You willnot be quoted, or requested to prove your statements. Such a thing wouldbe absurd. If I were really a doctor, and you needed my advice, you mighteasily describe your symptoms all wrong. It would be my business tolisten, and deduce the truth, and I would never dream of rating you forhaving misled me. You see my point?""Yes, but Mr. Win--Mr. Franklin, I know nothing whatever aboutthe murder.""I'm sure you don't. It was a wicked trick of Fate that took you to Mr.Grant's garden last Monday night.""It was really an astronomical almanac," retorted Doris, who now felt agrowing confidence in this nice-spoken official. "Sirius is a starremarkable for its beautiful changing lights, and on Monday evening wasat its best. I think I ought to explain," and she blushed delightfully,"that the village gossip about Mr. Grant and me is entirely mistaken. Weare not--well, I had better use plain English--we are not lovers. Myfather and I are just on close, friendly terms with Mr. Grant. I--myposition hardly warrants even that relationship with an author of somedistinction. But please set aside any notion of us as likely to becomeengaged. For one thing, it is preposterous. For another, I shall notleave my father."Poor Doris! She little guessed how accurately this skilled student ofhuman nature read the hidden thought behind that vehement protest. Eventhe note of vague rebellion against social disabilities was pathetic yetilluminating. Of course, he took her quite seriously."Let us keep to the hard road of fact," he said. "What you really mean isthat Mr. Grant has never made love to you. But I must be candid, younglady. There is no earthly reason why he shouldn't, though I could nameoffhand half a dozen why he should.... Well, well, I must not paycompliments. My friend, Mr. Furneaux, can manage that with much greaterfacility, being half a Frenchman. And now I'm going to say an unpleasantthing. I ask your forgiveness in advance. Both Mr. Furneaux and I agreein the opinion that your imaginary love affair is indissolubly bound upwith the mystery of Miss Melhuish's death. In a word, I have brought youhere today to discuss your prospective marriage, and nothing else. Thatastonishes you, eh? Well, it's the truth, as I shall proceed to makeclear. There's a Mr. Fred Elkin, for instance--"Doris uttered a little laugh of dismay. Winter's emphatic words hadastounded her, but the horse-dealer's name acted as comic relief."I can't bear the man," she protested."I have no doubt. But you ought to know that he is loudly proclaiming hisdetermination to marry you before the year is out."The girl's face reddened again, and her eyes sparkled."I wouldn't marry him if he were a peer of the realm," she saidindignantly."Quite so. But he is an avowed suitor. Now don't be vexed. Has he neverdeclared his intentions to _you_?""He would never dare. I sing and act a little, at village concerts anddramatic performances, and he has annoyed me at times by an officiouspretense that he was deputed by my father to see me home. I came herequite a little girl, so people learnt to use my Christian name. I don'tobject to it at all. But I simply hate hearing it on Mr. Elkin's lips.""Exit Fred!" said Winter solemnly. "Next!"Doris, after a period of calm, was now profoundly uncomfortable. Thiskind of prying was the last thing she had expected. She had come preparedto defend Grant, but, beyond one exceedingly personal reference, thedetective had studiously shut him out of the conversation."What am I to say?" she cried. "Do you want a list of all the young menwho make sheep's eyes at me?""No. I can get that from the Census Bureau. Come, now, Miss Martin. _You_know. Has any man in the village led you to suspect, shall we put it?that sometime or other, he might ask you to become his wife?"Lo, and behold! Doris's pretty eyes filled with tears. SuperintendentFowler was so pleased at hearing Scotland Yard introducing aparenthetical query into its sentences that he, sitting opposite, wastaken aback when Winter said in a fatherly way:"I've been rather clumsy, I'm afraid. But it cannot be helped. I must goblundering on. I'm groping in the dark, you know, but it's a thousandpities I shall have to tread on _your_ toes.""It isn't that," sobbed Doris. "I hate to put my thoughts into words.That's all. There _is_ a man whom I'm--afraid of.""Siddle?"She turned on Winter a face of sudden awe."How can you possibly guess?" she said wonderingly, and sheerbewilderment dried her tears."My business is nine-tenths guesswork. At any rate, we are on firm groundnow. If you could please yourself, I suppose, Mr. Siddle would not cometo tea to-day!""He certainly would not," declared the girl emphatically."You believe he is coming for a purpose?""Yes.""Elkin--I must drag him in again for an instant--pretends that thecommotion aroused in the village by this murder would incline youfavorably to a proposal of marriage. Mr. Siddle may have discovered somevirtue in the theory.""Did Mr. Elkin really hint that I needed _him_ as a shield?"Doris was genuinely angry now. She little imagined that Winter wasplaying on her emotions with a master hand."Don't waste any wrath on Elkin," he soothed her. "The fellow isn't worthit. But his crude idea might be developed more subtly by an abler man.""I think it odd that Mr. Siddle should choose to-day, of all days, for avisit," she admitted.Winter relapsed into silence for a while. The car was running through acharming countryside, and a glimpse of the sea was obtainable from thecrest of each hill. Mr. Fowler was too circumspect to break in on thethread of his coadjutor's thoughts. The inquiry had taken a curious turn,and was momentarily beyond his grasp."It's singular, but it's true," said the detective musingly when next hespoke, "that I am now going to ask you to act differently than was in mymind when I sought this interview. I should vastly like to be presentwhen Siddle bares his heart to you this afternoon."I can invite you to tea."Alas! that won't serve our ends. But, if you feel you have a purpose, youwill be nerved to deal with him. Bring him out into that secluded gardenof yours--""The first thing he will suggest," and Doris's voice waxedunconsciously bitter. "He knows that dad will be busy with the mailsfor an hour after tea.""Good!""I think it bad, most disagreeable.""You won't find the position so awkward if you are playing a part. Andthat is what I want--a bit of clever acting. Lean on those railings, andmake Siddle believe that your heart is on Mr. Grant's lawn. You know thekind of thing I mean. Dreamy eyes, listless manner, inattention, withsmiling apologies. You will annoy Siddle, and a cautious man in a temperbecomes less cautious. Force him to avow his real thoughts. You willlearn something, trust me.""About what?"There were no tears in Doris's eyes. They were wide open in wonderment."About his attitude to this tragedy. Do this, and you will be giving Mr.Grant the greatest possible help. He needs it. Next Wednesday, at theadjourned inquest, he will be put on the rack. Ingerman will fee counselto be vindictive, merciless. Such men are to be hired. Their reputationis built up on the slaughter of reputations. I want to understand Siddlebefore Wednesday. By the way, what's his other name?""Theodore.""Theodore Siddle. Unusual. Well, your half hour is nearly up. Will you dowhat I ask?""I'll try. May I put one question?""Yes.""You said you had something altogether different in view before we met.What was it?""I'll tell you--let me see--I'll tell you on Thursday.""Why not now?""Because it is the hardest thing in the world for a woman to besingle-minded, in the limited sense of concentration, I mean. Focus yourwits on Siddle to-day. I don't suggest any plan. I leave that to your ownintelligence. Vex him, and let him talk.""Vex him!""Yes. What man won't get mad if he notices that his best girl is thinkingabout a rival."This time Doris did not blush. She was troubled and serious, veryserious."I'll do what I can," she promised. "When shall I see you again?""Soon. There's no hurry. All this is preparatory for Wednesday.""Am I to tell my father nothing?""Please yourself. Not at present. I recommend you."The car had stopped. It sped on when Doris alighted. She would be homewith her cakes at three o'clock, and Mr. Martin would never have noticedher absence."A fine bit of work, if I may say so," exclaimed Fowler appreciatively."But I am jiggered if I can imagine what you're driving at."Winter was cutting the end off a big cigar. He finished the operation tohis liking before answering earnestly:"We stand or fall by the result of that girl's efforts. Furneauxthinks so, and I agree with him absolutely. After five days, where arewe, Mr. Fowler? In the dark, plus a brigand's hat and hair. But there'sa queer belief in some parts of England that a phosphorescent gleamshows at night over a deep pool in which a dead body lies. That's justhow I feel about Siddle. The man's an enigma. What sort of place isSteynholme for a chemist of his capacities? Dr. Foxton has the highestregard for him professionally, and I'm told he doctors people for milesaround. Yet he lives the life of a recluse. An old woman comes by dayto prepare his meals, and tidy the house and shop. His sole relaxationis an hour of an evening in the village inn, his visits there beinguninterrupted since the murder. He was there on the night of themurder, too. For the rest, he is alone, shut off from the world.Without knowing it, he's going to fall into deep waters to-day, andhe'll emit sparks, or I'm a Chinaman.... I'll leave you here. Good-by!See you on Tuesday, after lunch."The superintendent drove on alone. He pondered the Steynholme affair inall its bearings, but mostly did he weigh up Winter and Furneaux. Atlast, he sighed."London ways, and London books, and London detectives!" he muttered."We're not up to date in Sussex. Now, if I could please myself, I'd behot-foot after Elkin. I see what Winter has in his mind, but surely Elkinfills the bill, and Siddle doesn't.... What was that word--volt what!"Doris was lucky. She met Mr. Siddle as she emerged from the back passageto the cake-shop. Resolving instantly that if an unpleasant thing had tobe done it should at least be done well, she smiled brightly."See what you have driven me to--breaking the Sabbath," she cried,holding up the bag of cakes."Tea and bread-and-butter with you would be a feast for the gods,"said Siddle."Now you're adapting Omar Khayyam.""Who's he?""A Persian poet of long ago.""I never read poetry. But, if your tastes lie that way, I'll accomplishsome more adaptation.""Oh, no, please. Cakes for you, Mr. Siddle; poets for giddy youngthings like me."There was a sting in the words. Doris preened herself on having carriedout the detective's instructions to the letter thus far.Arrived in the house she found her father still in the garden, examiningsome larvae under a microscope. He looked severe rather than studious.He might have been an omnipotent being who had detected a malefactor ina criminal act. Was Steynholme and its secret felon being regarded inthat way by the providence which, for some inscrutable purpose,permitted, yet would infallibly punish, a dreadful murder? She was agirl of devout mind, and the notion was appalling in its directapplication to current events.In the meantime the chemist, evidently taking a Sunday afternoonconstitutional, came on Winter, who was leaning on a wall of the bridgeand looking down stream--Grant's house being on the left.He would have passed, in his wonted unobtrusive way, but the detectivehailed him with a cheery "Good day, Mr. Siddle. Are you a fisherman?""No, Mr. Franklin, I'm not," he answered."Well, now, I'm surprised. You are just the sort of man whom I shouldexpect to find attached to a rod and line--even watching a float.""I tried once when I was younger, but I could neither impale a worm norextract a hook. My gorge rose against either practice. I am a vegetarian,for the same reason. If it were not for this disturbing tragedy you wouldhave heard Hobbs, the butcher, rallying me about my rabbit-meat, as hecalls my food.""Well, well!" laughed Winter. "Your ideas and mine clash in somerespects. I look on a well-grilled steak as a gift from Heaven, and afterit, or before it--I don't care which--let me have three hours whipping agood trout stream. With the right cast of flies I could show a fine bagfrom this very stretch of water.""Why not ask Mr. Grant's permission? It would be interesting to learnwhether he will allow others to try their luck."Mr. Siddle strolled on. Winter bent over, keen to discern the gray-backedfish which must be lurking in those clear depths and rippling shallows.CHAPTER XIVON BOTH SIDES OF THE BIVEEThe sun, transmuted into Greenwich time, exercised an extraordinaryinfluence on the seemingly humdrum life of Steynholme that day. A fewminutes after three o'clock--just too late to observe either Winter orSiddle--P.C. Robinson strolled forth from his cottage. He glanced up thealmost deserted high-street, in which every rounded cobble and whiteflagstone radiated heat. A high-class automobile had dashed past twice inforty minutes, but the pace was on the borderland of doubt, so theguardian of the public weal had contented himself with recording itsnumber on the return journey.But his thoughts were far a-field from joyriders, stray cattle, hawkerswithout licenses, and other similar small fry which come into theconstabulary net. It would be a feather in his cap if he could onlystrike the trail of the veritable Steynholme murderer. The entrancingnotion possessed him morning, noon, and night. Mrs. Robinson declaredthat it even dominated his dreams. Robinson was sharp. He knew quite wellthat the brains of the London detectives held some elusive quality whichhe personally lacked. They seemed to peer into the heart of a thing sowisely and thoroughly. He did not share Superintendent Fowler's somewhatderogatory estimate of Furneaux, with whom he was much better acquaintedthan was his superior officer, while Chief Inspector Winter's reputestood so high that it might not be questioned. Still, to the best of hisbelief, the case had beaten both these doughty representatives ofScotland Yard; there was yet a chance for the humble police-constable; soRobinson squared his shoulders, seamed his brows, and marchedmajestically down the Knoleworth road.He had an eye for The Hollies, of course, though neither he nor anybodyelse could discern more than the bare edge of the lawn from bridge orroad, owing to the dense screen of evergreen trees and shrubs planted bythe tenant who remodeled the property.But the spot where the body of Adelaide Melhuish was drawn ashore wasvisible, and the sight of it started a dim thesis in the policeman's mindwhich took definite shape during less than an hour's stroll. Thus, atfour o'clock exactly, he was pulling the bell at The Hollies. Almostsimultaneously, Mr. Siddle knocked modestly on the private door of thepost office, to reach which one had to pass down a narrow yard."Mr. Grant at home?" inquired Robinson, when Minnie appeared.Yes, the master was on the lawn with Mr. Hart. The policeman found thetwo there, seated in chairs with awnings. They had been discussing, ofall things in the world, the futurist craze in painting. Hart held by it,but Grant carried bigger guns in real knowledge of the artist'slimitations as well as his privileges.Hart was the first to notice the newcomer's presence, and greetedhim joyously."Come along, Robinson, and manacle this reprobate," he shouted. "He'snothing but a narrow-minded pre-Rafaelite. A period in prison will dustthe cobwebs out of his attic.""Hello, Robinson!" said, Grant. "Anything stirring?""Not much, sir. I just popped in to ask if you remembered exactly how thebody was roped?""Indeed, I do not. Some incidents of that horrible half hour have goneinto a sad jumble. I recollect you calling attention to the matter, butwhat your point was I really cannot say now. Perhaps it may come back ifyou explain.""Well, we don't seem to be making a great deal of progress, sir, and Iwas wondering whether you two gentlemen might help. I don't want itmentioned. I'm taking a line of me own."Grant repressed a smile. He recalled well enough the first "line" thepoliceman took, and the mischief it had caused. Being an even-mindedperson, however, he admitted that his own behavior had not been abovesuspicion on the day the crime was discovered. In allotting blame, asbetween Robinson and himself, the proportion was six of one and half adozen of the other."Propound, justiciary," said Hart. "You've started well, anyhow. Theconnection between a line and a rope should be obvious even to ajudge.... As a pipe-opener, have a drink!"Robinson had removed his helmet, and was flourishing a red handkerchief,not without cause, the day being really very hot."Not for a few minutes, thank you, sir," said the policeman. "May I askBates for a sack and a cord?"He went to the kitchen. Hart was "tickled to death," he vowed."We are about to witness the reconstruction of the crime, a procedurewhich the French delight in, and the intellect of France is a hundredyears ahead of our effete civilization," he chortled.Grant was not so pleased. The memory of a distressing vision wasbeginning to blur, and this ponderous policeman must come and revive it.Yet, even he grew interested when Robinson illustrated a nebulous idea byknotting a clothesline around a sack stuffed with straw, having broughtBates to bear him out in the matter of accuracy."There you are, gentlemen!" he said, puffing after the slight exertion."That's the way of it. How does it strike you?""It's what a sailor calls two half hitches," commented Hart instantly."A very serviceable knot, which will resist to the full strength ofthe rope.""We have no sailors in Steynholme, sir," said the policeman."Oh, it's used regularly by tradesmen," put in Grant. "A draper, orgrocer--any man accustomed to tying parcels securely, in fact--willfashion that knot nine times out of ten.""How about a--a farmer, sir?" That was as near as Robinson dared to go to"horse-dealer.""I think a farmer would be more likely to adopt a timber hitch, which ismade in several ways. Here are samples." And Grant busied himself withrope and sack.Robinson watched closely."Yes," he nodded. "I've seen those knots in a farmyard.... Well, it'ssomething--not much--but a trifle better than nothing.... All right,Bates. You can take 'em away.""Have you shown that knot to Mr. Furneaux?" inquired Grant."No, sir. I've kept that up me sleeve, as the sayin' is.""But why?"Robinson shuffled uneasily on his feet."These Scotland Yard men will hardly listen to a uniformed constable,sir," he said. "I'll tell 'em all about it at the inquest on Wednesday.""In effect, John P. Robinson he sez they didn't know everythin' down inJudee," quoted Hart."You've got my name pat," grinned the policeman, whose Christian nameswere "John Price.""My name is Walter, not Patrick," retorted Hart. Robinson continued tosmile, though he failed to grasp the joke until late that evening."Did you make up that verse straight off, sir," he asked."No. It's a borrowed plume, plucked from an American quill pen."Hart gave "plume" a French sound, and Robinson was puzzled to know whyGrant bade his friend stop profaning a peaceful Sunday afternoon."You'll have a glass of beer now?" went on the host."I don't mind if I do, sir, though it's tea-time, and I make it a rule onSundays to have tea with the missis. A policeman's hours are broken up,and his wife hardly ever knows when to have a meal ready."Minnie was summoned. It took her a couple of minutes to draw the beerfrom a cool cellar. So it chanced that when Doris led Mr. Siddle to theedge of the cliff about twenty-five minutes past four, the first thingthey saw was the local police-constable on the lawn of The Holliesputting down a gill of "best Sussex" at a draught."Well!" cried the chemist icily, "I wonder what Superintendent Fowlerwould say to that if he knew it?""What is there particularly wrong about Robinson drinking a glass ofbeer?" demanded Doris, more alive to the insinuation in Siddle's wordsthan was quite permissible under the role imposed on her by Winter.She waved her hand to the party on the lawn. Grant, whose eyes everroved in that direction, had seen her white muslin dress the momentshe appeared."Who the deuce is that with Miss Martin?" he said, returning her signal."Siddle, the chemist," announced Robinson, not too well pleased himselfat being "spotted" so openly. "Well, gentlemen, I'll be off," and hevanished by the side path through the laurels."Siddle!" repeated Grant vexedly. "So it is. And she dislikes the man,for some reason.""Let's go and rescue the fair maid," prompted Hart."No, no. If Doris wanted me she would let me know.""How? At the top of her voice?""You're far too curious, Wally.""Semaphore, of course," drawled Hart. "When are you going to marry thegirl, Jack!""As soon as this infernal business has blown over.""You haven't asked her, I gather?""No.""Tell me when you do, and I'll hie me to London town, though in torridJune. You're unbearable in love.""The lash of your wit cuts deeply sometimes," said Grant quietly."Dash it all, old chap, I was talking at random. Very well. I'll dopenance in sackcloth and ashes by remaining here, and applauding yourpoetic efforts. I'll even help. I'm a dab at sonnets."Meanwhile, Mr. Siddle had regained his poise."I meant nothing offensive to the donor of the beer," he said, tuning hisvoice to an apologetic note. "But I take it Robinson is conductingcertain inquiries, and I imagine that his superiors demand a degree ofcircumspection in such conditions. That is all.""Surely you do not rank with the stupid crowd in its suspicions of Mr.Grant?" said the girl."I'm pleased to think you refuse to class me with the gossip-mongers ofSteynholme, Doris," was the guarded answer.There had been no reference to the murder during tea, which was servedas soon as the chemist came in. The visitor had tabled a copy of acurrent medical journal containing an article on the therapeuticqualities of honey, so the talk was lifted at once into an atmosphere farremoved from crime. Doris was grateful for his tact. When her father wentto the office she brought Mr. Siddle into the garden solely in pursuanceof her promise to the detective, though convinced that there would be nooutcome save a few labored compliments to herself. And now, by accident,as it were, the death of Adelaide Melhuish thrust itself into theirconversation. Perhaps it was her fault."No," she said candidly. "No one who has known you for seven years, Mr.Siddle, could possibly accuse you of spreading scandal.""Seven years! Is it so long since I came to Steynholme? Sometimes, itappears an age, but more often I fancy the calendar must be in error.Why, it seems only the other day that I saw you in a short frock,bowling a hoop.""A tom-boy occupation," laughed Doris. "But dad encouraged that andskipping, as the best possible means of exercise.""He was right. Look how straight and svelte you are! Few, if any, amongour community can have watched your progress to womanhood as closely asI. You see, living opposite, as I do, I kept track of you moreintimately than your other neighbors."Siddle was trimming his sails cleverly. The concluding sentence robbedhis earlier comments of their sentimental import."If we live long enough we may even see each other in the sere and yellowleaf," said Doris flippantly."I would ask no greater happiness," came the quiet reply, and Doris couldhave bitten her tongue for according him that unguarded opening. Suddenlyavailing herself of the advice which the detective, like Hamlet, hadgiven to the players, she gazed musingly at the fair panorama of TheHollies and its gardens, with the two young men seated on the lawn. Bythis time Minnie was staging tea, and the picture looked idyllic enough.Doris saw, out of the tail of her eye, that her companion was watchingher furtively, though apparently absorbed in the scene. He moistened histhin lips with his tongue."As a study in contrasts, that would be hard to beat," he said, after along pause."Contrasts!" she echoed."Well, yes. Even an uncontentious man like myself can hardly fail tocompare Sunday afternoon with Tuesday morning.""Why not Monday night?" she flashed."Monday night, in part, remains a mystery yet to be unveiled. I blotMonday night from my mind. I have no alternative, being on the jurywhich has to arrive at a just verdict. Now, if Fred Elkin were here, hewould foam at the mouth.""Happily, Fred Elkin is _not_ here.""Ah, I am glad, glad, to hear you say that. You don't like him?""I detest him.""He makes out, to put it mildly, that you are great friends.""You will oblige me by contradicting the statement. Or--no. One treatsthat sort of man with contempt.""I agree with you most heartily. I'm sorry I ever mentioned him."Yet Doris was well aware that the chemist had dragged in Elkin by thescruff of the neck, probably for the sake of getting him disposed ofthoroughly and for all time. Rather on the tiptoe of expectation, sheawaited the next move. It was slow in coming, so again she lookedwistfully at the distant tea-drinkers. She found slight difficulty incarrying out this portion of the stage directions. Truth to tell, shewould gleefully have gone and joined them.Siddle was not altogether at ease. The conversation was too spasmodic tosuit his purpose. Though slow of speech he was nimble of brain, and,knowing Doris so well, he had anticipated a livelier duel of wits. In alllikelihood, he cursed the tea-party on the lawn. He had not foreseen thisdrawback. But, being a masterful man, he tackled the situation boldly."I seized the opportunity of a friendly chat with you to-day, Doris," hewent on, leaning over the fence to inhale the scent of a briar rose. "Thestory runs through the village that you and your father dined at TheHollies on Friday evening. Is that true?"Now, Doris had it on reliable authority that Siddle himself had been therunner who spread that story, and the knowledge steeled her heartagainst him."Yes," she said composedly."It was kind and neighborly of you to accept the invitation, but amistake."She turned and faced him. His expression was baffling. She thought shesaw in his sallow, clean-cut features the shadow of a confident smile."You mean that this horrid murder should make some difference in thefriendship between ourselves and Mr. Grant?" she cried."Yes. To you, though to no one else would I speak so plainly, I have nohesitation in saying that Mr. Grant is far, very far, from being clearof responsibility in that matter. Three days from now you willunderstand what I mean. Evidence will be forthcoming which will put himin a most unenviable light. I am not alleging, or even hinting, that hemay be deemed guilty of actual crime. That is for the law to determine.But I do tell you emphatically that his present heedless attitude willgive place to anxiety and dejection. It cannot be otherwise. A somewhatsordid history will be revealed, and his pretense that relations betweenhim and the dead woman ceased three years ago will vanish into thin air.Believe me, Doris, I am actuated by no motive in this matter other thana desire to further your welfare. I cannot bear even to think of yourname being associated, in ever so small degree, with that of a man whomust be hounded out of his own social circle, if no worse fate is instore for him.""Good gracious!" cried Doris, genuinely amazed. "How do you come to knowall this?""I listen to the words of those qualified to speak with knowledge andauthority. I have mixed in varied company this past week, wholly on youraccount. Don't be led away by the mere formalities of the opening day ofthe inquest. The coroner deliberately shut off all real evidence exceptas to the cause of death. On Wednesday the situation will change, and youcannot fail to be shocked by what you hear, because you will be there.""I am given to understand that, even if I am called, my testimony will beof no importance.""Such may be the police view. Mr. Ingerman will press for a verydifferent estimate.""Has he told you that?""Yes.""So, although foreman of the jury, you have not declined to hobnob witha man who is avowedly Mr. Grant's enemy?""I would hobnob with worse people if, by so doing, I might serve you."Grant, "fed up," as he put it to Hart, with watching the _tete a tete_between Doris and the chemist, sprang to his feet and went through apantomime easy enough to follow save for one or two signs. Doris heldboth hands aloft. Well knowing that anything in the nature of apre-arranged code would be gall and wormwood to Siddle, she explainedlaughingly:"Mr. Grant signals that he and Mr. Hart are going for a walk; he wants meto accompany them. But I can't, unfortunately. I promised dad to helpwith the accounts.""If you really mean what you say, my warning would seem to have fallen ondeaf ears."Siddle's voice was well under control, but his eyes glinted dangerously.His state was that of a man torn by passion who nevertheless felt thatany display of the rage possessing him would be fatal to his cause.But, rather unexpectedly, Doris took fire. Siddle's innuendoes andprotestations were sufficiently hard to bear without the added knowledgethat a ridiculous convention denied her the companionship of a man whomshe loved, and who, she was beginning to believe, loved her. She sweptround on Siddle like a wrathful goddess."I have borne with you patiently because of the acquaintance of years,but I shall be glad if this tittle-tattle of malice and ignorance nowceases," she said proudly. "Mr. Grant is my friend, and my father'sfriend. In the first horror of the crime which has besmirched our dearlittle village, we both treated Mr. Grant rather badly. We know betterto-day. Your Ingermans and your Elkins, and the rest of the busybodiesgathered at the inn, may defame him as they choose, or as they dare. Asfor me, I am his loyal comrade, and shall remain so after next Wednesday,or a score of Wednesdays. I am going in now, Mr. Siddle, and shall beengaged during the remainder of the evening. Your shop opens at six, andI am sure you will find some more profitable means of spending the timethan in telling me things I would rather not hear."Siddle caught her arm."Doris," he said fiercely, "you must not leave me without, at least,learning my true motive. I--"The girl wrested herself free from his grip. She realized what wascoming, and forestalled it."I care nothing for your motive," she cried. "You forget yourself!Please go!"She literally ran into the house. The chemist, unless he elected tobehave like a love-sick fool, had no option but to follow, and make hisway to the street by the side door.The only other happening of significance that Sunday was an unheraldedvisit by Winter to the policeman's residence.He popped in after dusk, opening the door without knocking."You in, Robinson?" he inquired."Yes, sir. Will you--""Shan't detain you more than a minute. At the inquest you said that youpersonally untied the rope which bound Miss Melhuish's body. Here are apiece of string and a newspaper. Would you mind showing me what sort ofknot was used?"Robinson was nearly struck dumb, and his fingers fumbled badly, but hemanaged to exhibit two hitches."Ah, thanks," said Winter, and was off in a jiffy.From the window of a darkened room Robinson watched the erect, burlyfigure of the detective until it was merged in the mists of night."Well, I'm--," he exclaimed bitterly."John, what are you swearing about?" demanded his wife from the kitchen."Something I heard to-day," answered her husband. "There was a chap of myname, John P. Robinson, an' he said that down in Judee they didn't knoweverything. And, by gum, he was right. They knew mighty little aboutLondon 'tecs, I'm thinking. But, hold on. Surely--"He bustled into his coat, and hastened to The Hollies. No, neither Mr.Grant nor Mr. Hart had spoken to a soul about the knot. Nor had Bates. Ofcourse, Robinson did not venture to describe Winter. Finally, he put theincident aside as a clear case of thought-reading.CHAPTER XVA MATTER OF HEREDITYShortly before noon on Monday occurred two events destined to assume aparamount importance in the affair which was wringing the withers ofSteynholme. As in the histories of both men and nations, these firststeps in great developments began quietly enough. For one thing, Furneauxreturned to the village. For another, the London telegraphist, whoexpected the day to prove practically a blank, was reading a newspaperwhen the telegraph instrument clicked the local call.Doris was checking and distributing the stock of stamps which had arrivedthat morning; her father was counting mail-bags in a small annex to themain room, the Knoleworth office having acquired a habit of making upshortages by docking the country branches. No member of the publichappened to be present. The girl could have heard what the Morse code wastapping forth had she chosen, but she had trained herself to disregardthe telegraph when occupied on other work.Suddenly, however, the telegraphist's pencil paused."Hello!" he said. "Theodore Siddle! That's the chemist opposite,isn't it!""Yes," said Doris, suspending her calculations at mention of the name."Well, his mother's dead.""Dead?" she echoed vacantly. Somehow, it had never hitherto dawned on herthat the chemist might possess relatives in some part of the country."That's what it says," went on the other. "'Regret inform you your motherdied this morning. Superintendent, Horton Asylum.'""In an asylum, too," said the girl, speaking at random."Yes. Horton is the place for epileptic lunatics, near Epsom, you know.""I didn't know. Does it mean that--that she was an epileptic lunatic?""So I should imagine, from the wording. If a nurse, or a matron, they'dsurely describe her as such.""I suppose we ought not to discuss Mr. Siddle's telegram," said Doris,after a pause."Well, no. But where's the harm? I wouldn't have yelled out the news ifwe three weren't alone. Where's that boy?""Gone to his dinner. Father will take it. By the way, say nothing to himas to the contents. Would you mind calling him?"Doris hurried swiftly to the sitting-room, and thence upstairs. Thetelegraphist explained the absence of a messenger, so Mr. Martindelivered the telegram in person.Crossing the street, he detected a dead bee. He picked it up, horrifiedat the thought that the Isle of Wight disease might have reached Sussex.So it was an absent-minded postmaster who handed the telegram overSiddle's counter, inquiring laconically:"Is there any answer?"Siddle opened the buff envelope, and read. He glanced sharply at Martin."No," he said. "What's wrong with that bee?""I don't know. I have my doubts. When I have a moment to spare I'll putit under the microscope."Siddle examined the telegram again. The handwriting was that beloved ofCivil Service Commissioners. Unquestionably, it was not Doris's. Nosooner had his friend gone off, still intent on the dead insect, thanSiddle followed. He knew that the bee would undergo scientific scrutinyat once, so gave Martin just enough time to dive into the sitting-roombefore entering the post office."Did you receive this telegram a few minutes ago!" he inquired.The young man became severely official."Which telegram?" he said stiffly."This one," and Siddle gave him the written message."Yes," was the answer."Excuse me, but--er--are its contents known to you only?""What do you mean, sir? It would cost me my berth if I divulged a word ofit to anyone.""I'm sorry. Pray don't take offense. I--I'm anxious that my friends,Mr. and Miss Martin, should not hear of it. That is what I reallyhave in mind."The telegraphist cooled down."You may be quite sure that neither they nor any other person inSteynholme will ever see the duplicate," he said confidentially. "I makeup a package containing duplicates each evening, and it is sent toheadquarters. If it will please you, I'll lock the copy now in my desk.""That is exceedingly good of you," said Siddle gratefully. "You, as aLondoner, will understand that such a telegram from--er--Horton is notthe sort of thing one would like to become known even in the mostlimited circle.""You can depend on me, sir."Siddle hastened back to his shop. The telegraphist looked after him."Queer!" he mused. "Miss Doris guessed him at once. Phi-ew, I must becareful! This village contains surprises."Doris, watching from an upper room, saw the visitor, and timed him. Sheimagined he had dispatched an answer. Being a woman, she soughtenlightenment a few minutes later."Mr. Siddle came in," she said tentatively."Yes," said the specialist, smiling. "And I agree with you, Miss Martin.We mustn't talk about telegrams, even among ourselves, unless it isnecessary departmentally."Doris was silenced, but she read the riddle correctly. The chemist wasparticularly anxious that no Steynholme resident should be made aware ofhis mother's death. She wondered why.She was enlightened when Furneaux paid a call about tea-time. She tookhim into the garden. The lawn at The Hollies was empty."Well, you entertained an acquaintance yesterday?" he began."Yes. Am I to tell you what happened?""Not a great deal, I imagine," he said, with a puzzling laugh."No, but I annoyed him, as Mr.----""No names!" broke in the detective hastily. "Names, especially modernones, destroy romance. Even the Georgian method of using initials, orleaving out vowels, lend an air of intrigue to the veriest balderdash.""But no one can overhear us," was the somewhat surprised comment."How true!" said Furneaux. "Pardon me, Miss Martin. Tell the story inyour own way."Doris had a good memory. She was invariably letter-perfect in a playafter a couple of rehearsals, and could prompt others if they faltered.The detective listened in silence while she repeated the conversationbetween Siddle and herself. He took no notes. In fact, he hardly ever didmake any record in a case unless it was essential to prove the exactwords of a suspected person."Good!" he said, when she had finished. "That sounds like thecomplete text.""I don't think I have left out anything of importance--that is, if asingle word of it _is_ important.""Oh, heaps," he assured her. "It's even better than I dared hope. Can youtell me if Siddle's mother is dead yet?"The question found Doris so thoroughly unprepared that she blurted out:"Have you had a telegram, too, then?""No. But Siddle has had one, eh? Don't be vexed. I'm not tricking youinto revealing post office secrets. I knew she was dying, and, when I sawyour father take a message to the chemist's shop I simply made anaccurate guess.... Now, I'm going to scare you, purposely and of maliceaforethought, because I want you to be a good little girl, and obeyorders. Mrs. Siddle, senior, now happily deceased, was an epilepticlunatic of a peculiarly dangerous type. She suffered from what is classedby the doctors as _furor epilepticus_, a form of spasmodic insanity notinconsistent with a high degree of bodily vigor and long periods ofapparently complete mental saneness. Now, if I were not speaking to onewho has shared her father's studies in bee-life, I would not introducethe subject of heredity. But _you_ know, Miss Martin, that such racialcharacteristics are transmitted, or transmissible, I should say, by sexopposites. Thus, an epileptic mother is more likely to give her taint toa son than to a daughter.... Yes, I mean all that, and more," he went on,seeing the look of horror, not unmixed with fear, in Doris's eyes. "Theremust be no more irritating of Siddle, or playing on his feelings--by you,at any rate. Treat him gently. If he insists on making love to you, be asfirm as you like in a non-committal way. I mean, by that, an entireabsence on your part of any suggestion that you are repulsing him becauseof a real or supposed preference for any other man.""Do you want me to believe that he is liable to attack me?" demanded thegirl, her naturally courageous spirit coming to her aid."I do," said Furneaux, speaking with marked earnestness."Yet you ask me to endure his company if he chooses to forcehimself on me?""For a few days.""But it may be a few years?""No. That is not to be thought of. Leave it to me to devise a way.Besides, you need not allow him so many opportunities that the strainwould become unbearable. You are busy, owing to the certain increase ofwork brought about by this murder. Your time will be greatly occupied.But, don't render him morbidly suspicious. For instance, no more dinnersat The Hollies. No more gadding about by night, if you hear weird noiseson the other side of the river. And you must absolutely deny yourself thepleasurable excitement of Mr. Grant's company.""You are carrying a warning to its extreme limit.""Exactly.""And am I to keep this knowledge to myself?""In whom would you confide?""My father, of course.""I know you better," and the detective's voice took on a profoundlyserious note. "Your father would never admit that what he knows to betrue of bees is equally true of humanity. You can trust the police tokeep a pretty sharp eye on Siddle, of course, but the present is astrenuous period, both for us and for people with maniacal tendencies, soaccidents may happen.""You have distressed me immeasurably," said the girl, striving to piercethe mask of that inscrutable face."I meant to," answered Furneaux quietly. "No half measures for me.I've looked up the asylum record of Mrs. Siddle, senior, and it's notnice reading.""There was a Mrs. Siddle, junior, then?""A Mrs. Theodore Siddle, if one adopts the conventional usage. Yes. Shedied last month.""Last month!" gasped Doris, feeling vaguely that she was moving in a mazeof deceit and subterfuge."On May 25th, to be precise. She lived apart from her husband. I havereason to believe she feared him.""Yet--"She hesitated, hardly able to put her jumbled thoughts into words."Yes. That's so," said the detective instantly. "Never mind. It's afairly decent world, taken _en bloc_. I ought to speak with authority. Isee enough of the seamy side of it, goodness knows. Now, forewarned isforearmed. Don't be nervous. Don't take risks. Everything will come rightin time. Remember, I'm not far away in an emergency. Should I chance tobe absent if you need advice, send for Mr. Franklin. You can easilydevise some official excuse, a mislaid letter, or an error in atelegram.""I think I shall feel confident if both of you are near," and the ghostof a smile lit Doris's wan features."We're a marvelous combination," grinned Furneaux, reverting at once tohis normal impishness. "I am all brain; he is all muscle. Such analliance prevails against the ungodly.""Is Mr. Grant in any danger?" inquired Doris suddenly."No."The two looked into each other's eyes. Doris was eager to ask a question,which Furneaux dared her to put. The detective won. She sighed."Very well," she said. "I'm to behave. Am I to regard myself as adecoy duck?""A duck, anyhow."She laughed lightly. Furneaux would vouchsafe no further information, itwould appear. For a girl of nineteen, Doris was uncommonly gifted withclear, analytical reasoning powers.The detective returned to the Hare and Hounds, and went upstairs. He metPeters on the landing."The devil!" he cried."My _dear_ pal!" retorted the journalist."Are you living here?""Why not?""Why not, indeed? Where the eagles are there is the carcase.""Your misquotation is offensive.""It was so intended.""Come and have a drink.""No.""I say 'yes.' You'll thank me on your bended knees afterwards. The SouthAmerican gent is having the time of his life. I've just been to my roomfor _Whitaker's Almanack_, wherewith a certain Don Walter Hart purposesflooring him."Wally Hart had, indeed, succeeded in running to earth the Argentinemagnate, and was giving Winter a most uncomfortable quarter of an hour."Ha!" shouted Hart, when Furneaux came in with Peters. "Here's the pocketmarvel who'll answer any question straight off. What is the staple exportof the Argentine!""How often have you been there?" demanded the detective dryly."Six times.""And you've lived there?" This to Winter."Yes," glowered the big man, fearing the worst."Then the answer is 'fools,'" cackled Furneaux.Wally laughed. He had remembered, just in time, that he had no right toclaim acquaintance with the representative of Scotland Yard, and therewere some farmers present, each of whom had a "likely animal" to offerthe buyer of blood stock."Gad, I think you're right," he said."You wanted me to say 'sheep,' I suppose?""Got it, at once.""As though one valuable horse wasn't worth a thousand sheep.""Just what my friend, Don Manoel Alcorta, of Los Andes ranch, Catamarca,always held," put in Winter, drawing the bow at a venture.Hart cocked an eye at him."Sir," he said, "I would take off my hat, if I wore one in Steynholme, toany man who claims the friendship of Don Manoel Alcorta, a sincerepatriot. I suggest that we crack a bottle to his immortal memory.""My doctor forbids me to touch wine," said Winter mournfully."But these bucolic breeders of browns and bays employ wiser medicos,I'll go bail. Landlord, a quart of the best, and six out, as they sayin London."Six glasses were duly filled with champagne. When it was consumed, Hartbuttonholed Peters."A word with you, scribe," he said. "Good-day, gentlemen. I leave you toyour nags. Treat Mr. Franklin fairly. The friend of Don Manoel Alcortamust be a true man."Winter heaved a sigh of relief when the professional revolutionisthad vanished."He's a funny 'un," commented one of the farmers."A bit touched, I reckon," said another. "Wot's 'e doin' now to theother one?"They looked through the window. The two were standing in the middle ofthe road, and Wally was shaking Peters violently. The argument was not sofierce as it appeared to be. Peters had been commanded to bring bothdetectives to dinner that evening; when he demurred, trying to hedge onthe question of Winter's identity, Hart grabbed him by the shoulder."Do as I tell you," he hissed. "Of course, I know now that the big fellowis the man Grant heard of a week ago. I was an idiot to take himseriously about the Argentine. Bring the pair of 'em, I tell you. We'llmake a night of it.""I'll try," said Peters faintly, "but if you stir up that wine sovigorously I won't answer for the consequences."Winter, wishing devoutly that would-be sellers of horseflesh were not sonumerous in the district, noted the names and addresses of the local men,and promised to write when he could make an appointment. Then he escapedupstairs, whither Furneaux soon followed. Winter had secured an extrabedroom, overlooking the river, which Tomlin had converted into asitting-room. Thus, he held a secure observation post both in front andrear of the hotel."Well, how did she take it!" inquired the Chief Inspector, when he andhis colleague were safe behind a closed door."Sensible girl," said Furneaux. "By the way, Siddle's mother is dead.Telegram came this morning. Things should happen now.""I don't quite see why.""No. You're still muddled after floundering in the mud of South America.What possessed you to let that cheerful idiot, Wally Hart, put you inthe cart?""How could I help it? I was extracting some really helpful facts aboutSiddle and Elkin from Tomlin and the others when a shock-headed whirlwindblew in, and nearly embraced me because I claimed acquaintance with theEl Dorado bar in Buenos Ayres. From that instant I was lost. Like St.Augustine on the gridiron, no sooner was I nicely toasted on one sidethan I was turned on to the other. That grinning penny-a-liner, Peters,too, helped as assistant torturer. Wait till he asks me for a 'pointer'in this or any other case. He sold me a pup to-day, but I'll land himwith a full-sized mastiff.""No, you won't. He's done you a lot of good. You were simply reeking withconceit when I met you this morning. It was 'Siddle this' and 'Siddlethat' until you fairly sickened me. One would have thought I hadn'tcleared the ground for you, left you with all lines open and yourselfunknown to the enemy. Sometimes, you make me tired.""Sorry, Charles," said Winter patronizingly. "I had a bit of luck onSunday, I admit. The chance turn taken by the conversation with Doris,with the result that I was able to occupy a strategic position on thecliff, and hear every word Siddle uttered, was really fortunate. But,isn't that just what men mean when they prate of success? Opportunityknocks once at every man's door, says the old saw. The clever man grabshold instantly. The indolent one, often a mere gabbler, opens his eyesand his mouth weeks afterwards, and cries, 'Dear me! Was that themuch-looked-for opportunity?' Of course, Robinson's by-play with the sackand rope was merely thrown in by the prodigal hand of Fate.""Stop!" yelped Furneaux. "Another platitude, and I'll assault you withthe tongs!"It was the invariable habit of the Big 'Un and Little 'Un to quarrel likecat and dog when the toils were closing in around a suspect. Woe, then,to the malefactor! His was a parlous state."Let's cool down, Charles!" said Winter, opening a leather case, andselecting, with great care, one out of half a dozen precisely similarcigars. "We're pretty sure of our man, but we haven't a scrap of evidenceagainst him. How, or where, to begin ringing him in I haven't thefaintest notion. If only he'd kill Grant we'd get him at once.""But he won't. He trusts to Ingerman playing that part of the game. He'sas artful as a pet fox. I bought soap, and a pound of sal volatile, buthe did up each parcel with sealing-wax.""Sal volatile!" smiled Winter. "I, too, went in for soap, but myimagination would not soar beyond a packet of cotton-wool. It was thelumpiest thing I could think of.""And perfectly useless!" sneered Furneaux. "I must say you do fling thetaxpayers' money about. Now, _my_ little lot will keep the electric bellsin my flat in order for two years.""You forget that constant association with you demands that I shouldfrequently plug my two ears," retorted Winter.Furneaux would surely have thrown back the jest had not a knock on thedoor interrupted him."Who's there? I'm busy," cried Winter."Me-ow!" whined Peters's voice."Oh, it's you, Tom. Come in!"The journalist crept in on tiptoe."Hush! We are not observed," he said. "Wally Hart threatens to choke meif you two don't dine with him and Grant to-night."There was silence for a little while. The detectives looked ateach other."At what time?" said Winter, at last.Peters was astonished, and showed it."Why, I assured him it was absolutely imposs.," he cried."Well, it isn't. In fact, it suits our plans. I want exercise, and shallwalk back from Knoleworth. Furneaux will make his own arrangements. TellGrant that I shall drop in without knocking.""And tell him I shall arrive by parachute," added Furneaux."In case of accidents, and there is a shoot-up, with myself as theunresisting victim, my front name is James," said Peters."The only good point about you," scoffed Winter."You're strong on names to-day," tittered the journalist. "Don ManoelAlcorta was a superb effort as an authority on gee-gees. Wally tells mehis donship is the recognized expert south of the line on seismicdisturbances, and spends his days and nights watching a needle makingscratches on a sensitive plate.""He would be useful here in a day or two," said Winter."Ah, thanks! Is that a tip?""Not for publication. What you must say is that this affair looks likebaffling the shrewdest wits in Scotland Yard.""My very phrase--my own ewe lamb. Pardon. I shouldn't have alludedto sheep.""The only known representative of the Yard in Steynholme is Furneaux,"smiled the Chief Inspector.Furneaux was drumming on a window-pane with his finger-tips."True," he cackled. "Just to prove it, he now informs you that Siddle,finding trade slow, has called on Mr. John Menzies Grant!"CHAPTER XVIFURNEAUX MAKES A SUCCESSFUL BIDThe lawn front of The Hollies was not visible from the upper story of theHare and Hounds owing to a clump of pines which had found foothold on thecliff, but, through the gap formed by the end of the post office garden,the entrance to the house from the Knoleworth road was discernible.Furneaux's dramatic announcement brought the other two to the window. Bythis time Peters, gifted with a nose for news like a well-trainedsetter's for partridges, had begun to associate the quiet-mannered,gentle-spoken chemist with the inner circle of the crime, so waited andwatched with the detectives for Siddle's reappearance.At any rate the visitor must have been admitted, because a long quarterof an hour elapsed before he came in sight again. He walked out slowlyinto the roadway, thrust his hands into his trousers pockets, and glancedto right and left. Then, turning abruptly, he stared at the dwelling hehad just quitted. What this slight but peculiar action signified was nothard to guess. Furneaux, indeed, put it into words."Having warned Grant off Miss Doris Martin, and been cursed for hispains, the foreman of the jury does not trouble to await furtherevidence, but arrives at a true and lawful verdict straight off,"announced the little man."We ought to hear things to-night," said Peters."We?" inquired Winter."Yes. Didn't I make it clear that I shared in the dinner invitation?""No, and I'm--""Don't say it!" pleaded the journalist. "If I fell from grace to-day,remember my unswerving loyalty since the hour we met on the platform atKnoleworth! Haven't I kept close as an oyster? And would anyconsideration on earth move me to publish an accurate and entertainingaccount of the roasting of Chief Inspector Winter by Wally Hart? Thinkwhat I'm sacrificing--a column of the best."Winter bent a weighing look on the speaker. There was treason in thethought, as King James remarked to the barber who tried to prove hisloyalty by pointing out how easily he might cut his majesty's throat anymorning. But Peters maintained the expression of a sphinx, and the bigman relaxed."The conditions are that not a word about this business appears inprint, either now or in the future until we have a criminal in thedock," he said."Accepted," said Peters.Furneaux laughed shrilly, even derisively, but him his colleague treatedwith majestic disdain. Then, the chemist having reentered the village,the group broke up, Peters to search his brains for "copy" which shouldbe readable yet contain no hint of the new trail, Winter to take train toKnoleworth, and Furneaux to tackle Fred Elkin, who, he had ascertainedearlier, would drive home from a neighboring hamlet about five o'clock.Elkin had returned when the detective reached the house, a somewhatpretentious place, half farm, half villa, and altogether horsey. Theentrance hall bristled with fox masks and brushes. A useful collection ofburnished bits and snaffles hung on a side wall. A couple of stuffedbadgers held two wicker stands for sticks and umbrellas, and whips andhunting-crops were ranged on hooks beneath a 12-bore and a rook rifle.A pert maid-servant took Furneaux's card, blanched when she read it, andforgot to close the door of the dining-room. Hence, the detective heardElkin's gruff comments:"What? _That_ chap? Wants to see me? Not more than I want to see him.Show him in."Furneaux, looking very meek and mild, entered an apartment of thecarpet-bag upholstery period. A set of six exceedingly good and raresporting prints caught his eye."Good day," he said, finding Elkin drinking tea, and eating a boiledegg. "You're feeling better, I'm glad to see."Now, no matter how ungracious a man may be, a courteous solicitude as tohis health demands a certain note of civility in return."Yes," he said. "Sit down. Will you join me?""I'll have a cup of tea, with pleasure," said Furneaux."Right-o! Just touch that bell, will you?"The other obeyed, and took a closer look at one of the prints. Yes, thedate was right, 1841, and the stippling admirable."Nice lot of pictures, those," he said cheerfully, when the frightenedmaid, much to her relief, had been told to bring another cup and a freshsupply of toast."Are they?" Elkin had taken them and some kitchen furniture for a baddebt."Yes. Will you sell them?""Well, I haven't thought about it. What'll you give?"Furneaux hesitated."I can't resist anything in the art line that takes my fancy," he said,after a pause of indecision. "What do you say to ten bob each?"Elkin valued the lot at that figure, but Furneaux was a fool, and shouldbe treated as such."Oh, come now!" he cried roguishly. "They're worth more than that."Furneaux reflected again."Three pounds is a good deal for six prints," he murmured, "but, to getit off my mind, I'll spring to guineas.""Make it three-ten and they're yours.""Three guineas is my absolute limit," said Furneaux."Done!" cried Elkin. The original debt was under two pounds, so he hadcleared more than fifty per cent. on the transaction, and was plus anumber of chairs and a table.Furneaux counted out the money, wrote a receipt on a leaf torn from hispocket-book, and stamped it."Sign that," he said, "pocket the cash, send the set to the Hare andHounds for me in a dog-cart now, and the deal is through."Leaving the table, he went and lifted down each picture carefully.Somewhat wonderingly, Elkin rang the bell once more, gave the necessaryinstructions, and the room was cleared of its art. He was quite sure nowthat Furneaux was, as he put it, "dotty." The latter, however, sat andenjoyed his tea as though well pleased with his bargain."And how are things going in the murder at The Hollies?" inquired thehorse-dealer, by way of a polite leading up to the visitor'sunexplained business."Fairly well," said the detective. "My chief difficulty was to convincecertain important people that you didn't kill Miss Melhuish. Once I--""Me!" roared Elkin, his pale blue eyes assuming a fiery tint. "_Me!_""Once I established that fact," went on the other severely, "a realstumbling-block was removed. You see, Elkin, you have behaved throughoutlike a perfect fool, and thus lent a sort of credibility to an otherwiseabsurd notion. Your furious hatred of Mr. Grant, for instance, born of anequally fatuous--or, shall I say? fat-headed--belief that Miss Martinwould marry you for the mere asking, led you into deep waters. It was amistake, too, when you lied to P.C. Robinson as to the time you came homeon that Monday night. You told him you walked straight here from the Hareand Hounds at ten o 'clock. You know you didn't--that it was nearer halfpast eleven when you reached this house. Consider what that discrepancyalone might have meant if Scotland Yard failed to take your measurecorrectly. Then add the fact that the murderer wore the hat, wig, andwhiskers in which you made a guy of yourself while filling the role ofSvengali last winter. Now, I ask you, Elkin, where would you have stoodwith the average British jury when the prosecution established thosethree things: Motive, your jealousy of Grant; time, your unaccounted-fordisappearance during the hour when the crime was committed; and disguise,a clumsy suggestion of Owd Ben's ghost? Really, I have known men broughtto the scaffold on circumstantial evidence little stronger than that.Instead of glaring at me like a cornered rat you ought to drop on yourknees and thank providence, as manifested through the intelligence of the'Yard,' that you are not now in a cell at Knoleworth, ruminating on yourown stupidity, and in no small jeopardy of your life."Many emotions chased each other across Fred Elkin's somewhat mean andcruel face while Furneaux rated him in this extraordinary manner.Surprise, wrath, even fear, had their phases. But, dominating all othersensations, was an overpowering indignation at the implied hopelessnessof his pursuit of Doris Martin.He literally howled an oath at his torturer. Furneaux was shocked."No, no," he protested in a horrified tone. "Don't swear at yourbest friend.""Friend! By--, I'll make you pay for what you've said. There's a lawto stop that sort of thing.""But the law requires witnesses. A slander isn't a slander unless it'suttered to your detriment before a third party. How different would beMr. Grant's action against you! Your well-wishers simply couldn't muzzleyou. Whether before your pot-house cronies or mere strangers, you chargedhim openly with being a murderer. I'm sorry for you, Elkin, if ever youcome before a judge. He'll rattle more than my three guineas out of you.Even now, you don't grasp the extent of your folly. Instead of telling mehow you spent that hour and a half on the night of the crime you have theincredible audacity to threaten me, _me_, the man who has saved you fromjail. One more word, you miserable swab, and I'll let Robinson arrestyou. You'll be set free, of course, when I stage the actual villain, buta few remands of a week each in custody will thin your hot blood. Youwere with Peggy Smith after leaving the Hare and Hounds, making a fool ofan honest girl who thinks you mean to wed her. Yet you blather aboutbeing 'practically engaged' to Doris Martin, a girl who wouldn't let youtie her shoe-lace. You're an impudent pup, Fred, and you know it. But youstock decent tea, so I'll take another cup. If you're wise, you'll take asecond one yourself. It's better for you than whiskey."Elkin, despite all his faults, was endowed with the shrewdnessinseparable from his business, because no man devoid of brains ever yetthrove as a horse-dealer. He smothered his rage, thinking he might learnmore from this strange-mannered detective by seeming complaisance."You're a bit rough on a fellow," he growled sulkily, pouring out thetea."For your good, my boy, solely for your good. Now, own up about Peggy.""Yes. That's right. She'd prove an alibi, so your torn-fool case breaksdown when the flag falls.""Does it? A girl may say anything to save her supposed lover. How willthe twelve good men and true view Doris Martin's evidence on Wednesday?What did _you_ mean, for instance, by your question to the coroner at thefirst hearing?""I thought Grant was guilty, and I think so still," came thesavage retort."A nice juryman you are, I must say! May I trouble you to pass thesugar?""Look here! What are you gettin' at? Damme if I can see through yourgame. What is it?""I didn't want to worry poor Peggy. And her father might set about you ifhe knew the facts, so I'm probably saving you a hiding as well as aperiod in jail. The only reliable witness we had as to events in Tomlin'splace was a commercial traveler, and he is positive that the house closedat ten o'clock. However, that's all right. How do you account for themarvelous improvement in your health? Dr. Foxton cannot understand yourillness. He says you are wiry, and have a strong constitution.""Dr. Foxton jolly near knocked me up," said Elkin. "I took his medicinetill I was sick as a cat.""But you took spirits, too.""That's nothing fresh. Anyhow, I've dropped both, and am picking upevery hour.""Since when?""Since yesterday morning, if you want to know.""I do. I'm most interested. Dr. Foxton doesn't compound his ownprescriptions, does he?""No. I get 'em made up at Siddle's.""Ah. These country chemists often keep drugs in stock till theydeteriorate, or even set up chemical changes. Have you the bottles?""Yes. But what the--""Anything left in them?""The last two are half full. Still--""What a cross-grained chap you are? I buy your pictures, drink your tea,rescue you from a positively dangerous position, warn you againstcarrying any farther a most serious libel, yet you won't let me help youin a matter affecting your health!""Help me? How?""Even you, I suppose, realize that Scotland Yard employs skilledanalysts. Give me your bottles, in strict confidence, of course, and I'lltell you what they really contain. Then you can compare the analyses withthe doctor's prescriptions. The knowledge should be useful, to say theleast. Siddle's reputation needn't suffer, but, unless I am greatlymistaken, you will have the whip hand of him in future."The prospect was alluring. Elkin would enjoy showing up the chemist, whohad treated him rather as a precocious infant of late."By jing!" he cried, "I'm on that. Bet you a quid--But, no. You'dhardly lay against your own opinion. Just wait a tick. I'll bring 'em."Furneaux stared fixedly at the table while his host was absent. Hisconscience was not pricking him with regard to an unmerited slur on thecountry chemists of Great Britain. All is fair in love and the detectionof crime, and he simply had to get hold of those bottles by some daringyet plausible ruse."Now--I wonder!" he muttered, as Elkin's step sounded on the stairs."There you are!" grinned the horse-dealer. "Take a dose of the last one.It'll stir your liver to some tune."Furneaux drew the corks out of both bottles, and sniffed the contents.Then he tasted, with much tongue-smacking."Um!" he said. "Stale laudanum, for a start. I expected as much. Boughtby the gallon and sold by the drop. Is that the dogcart with mypictures?""Yes.""Hail your man. He can give me a lift.""But there's lots of things I want to ask you--""Probably. I'm here to put questions, not to give information. I've gonea long way beyond the official tether already. If you've a grain ofsense, and I think you're not altogether lacking in that respect, you'llkeep a close tongue, and act on the tips thrown out. You'll find pearlsof price among the rubbish-heap of my remarks generally. Good-by. See youon Wednesday."And Furneaux climbed into the cart, holding the pictures so that theywould not rattle, and perhaps loosen the old gilded frames."Drive me to the chemist's" he said to the groom; within fiveminutes, he was explaining his purchase to Siddle, and requesting, asa favor, that the latter should wrap the set of prints in brownpaper, making two parcels, and tying each securely, so that theymight be dispatched by train.Siddle examined one, the first of the series, which depicted theAylesbury Steeplechase."Rather good," he said. "Where did you pick them up?""At Elkin's.""Indeed. What an unexpected place!""That's the only way a poor man can get hold of a decent thing nowadays.The dealers grab everything, and sell them as collections.""Art is not in my line, though anyone can see that these are excellent.""Yes. But you're looking at 'The Start.' Have a peep at this one,'The Finish.' The artist _would_ have his joke. You see that the darkhorse wins.""How did you persuade Elkin to part with them?""By paying him a tempting price, of course. I'm a weak-minded ass insuch matters."The chemist busied himself to oblige the detective, wrapping and tyingthe packages neatly. Furneaux insisted on paying sixpence for the paper,string, and labor. There was quite a friendly argument, but he carriedhis point.The dog-cart then brought him to the station, where he tipped anddismissed the man; a little later, he caught a London-bound train.At half past seven precisely, Winter turned in through theKnoleworth-side gate of The Hollies (there were two, the approach tothe house being semi-circular) and pushed the door open, as it wasstanding ajar.Grant was waiting in the hall, and greeted him pleasantly."Here's a telegram which is meant for you, I fancy," he said.Winter read:"Sorry to spoil your party. Compelled to travel to London. Returningearly to-morrow. F.""That's pretty Fanny's way," smiled the Chief Inspector. "But there'ssomething in the wind, or he would never have hurried off in thisfashion. He tells me that the only pleasant evening he spent inSteynholme was under your roof, Mr. Grant.""Come along in, Don Jaime!" drawled Hart's voice from the "den," whichhad been cleared of its litter, the lawn being deemed somewhat unsuitablefor the purposes of a drawing-room on that occasion. It was overlookedfrom too many quarters."Ah, we meet now under less uneven conditions, Mr. Hart," said Winter."Do you know that Enrico Suarez is in London?"Hart, startled for once in his life, gazed at the detective fixedly."Since when?" he cried."He crossed from Lisbon last week."Hart took a revolver from his hip pocket, and opened it, apparentlymaking sure that it was properly loaded."What's the law in England?" he inquired. "Can I shoot first, or must Iwait till the other fellow has had a pop?"Winter laughed."It's all right," he said. "Suarez is in Holloway, awaiting extradition.But I owed you one for the rise you took out of me to-day."A bell sounded, and Peters came in. He glanced around."Where's Furneaux?" he demanded."Gone to London. Why this keen interest?" said Winter."There's something up. Elkin dropped in at the Hare and Hounds. He wassimply bursting with curiosity, and had to talk to somebody. So hechose me.""He would," was the dry comment."Fact, 'pon me honor. I didn't lead him on an inch. It seems thatFurneaux bought some prints which caught his eye in Elkin's house, andTomlin says that that hexplains hit.""Explains what?""Furneaux's visit to Siddle, and certain bulky parcels brought in andbrought out again.""Queer little duck, Furneaux," said Hart. "Now that my mind is at easeabout the immediate future of the biggest rascal in Venezuela I can takean active part in Steynholme affairs once more. When it's all throughI'll make a novel of it, dashed if I don't, with the postmaster'sdaughter in the three-color process as a frontispiece.""But who will be the villain?" said Peters.Hart waved the negro-head pipe at the other three."Draw lots. I am indifferent," he said.CHAPTER XVIIAN OFFICIAL HOUSEBREAKERNo word bearing on the main topic in these men's minds was said duringdinner. Grant was attentive to his guests, but markedly silent, almostdistrait. Two such talkers as Hart and Peters, however, covered any gapsin this respect. Cigars and pipes were in evidence, and, horrible thoughit may sound in the ears of a _gourmet_, the port was circulating, whenWinter turned and gazed at the small window."Is that where the ghost appears!" he inquired."Yes," said Grant. "You know the whole story, of course?""Furneaux misses nothing, I assure you.""He missed a daylight apparition this afternoon, at any rate. I have nosecrets from my friends, so I may as well tell you--""That Siddle called, and implored you to consider Doris Martin's futureby avoiding her at present," put in the Chief Inspector.Such shocks were losing some of their effect, on the principle that a manhears the burst of the thousandth high-explosive shell with a good dealless trepidation than attended the efforts of the first dozen. Still,Grant gazed at the speaker in profound astonishment."You Scotland Yard men seem to know everything," he said."A mere pretense. Try him on sheep-raising in the Argentine, Jack,"murmured Hart."Wally, this business is developing a very serious side," protestedGrant. Hart stretched a long arm for the port decanter."Come, friend!" he addressed it gravely. "Let us commune! You and Itogether shall mingle joyous memories of"A draught of the Warm South,The true, the blushful Hippocrene.""We read Siddle's visit aright, it would appear," said Winter quietly."Yes. That was his mission, put in a nutshell.""And what did you say?""I told him that, after Wednesday, I would ask Doris Martin to marry me,which is the best answer I can give him and all the world.""Why 'after Wednesday'?""Because I shall know then the full extent of the annoyance whichIngerman can inflict.""Did you give Siddle that reason?""Yes."Winter frowned."You literary gentlemen are all alike," he said vexedly. "You become suchadepts in analyzing human duplicity in your books that you never dreamof trying to be wise as a serpent in your own affairs. The author whowill split legal hairs by way of brightening his work will sign acontract with a publisher that draws tears from his lawyer when a disputearises. Why be so candid with a rank outsider, like Siddle?""I distrust the man. Doris distrusts him, too.""So you take him into your confidence.""No. I merely give him chapter and verse to prove that his interferenceis useless.""Have you engaged a lawyer for Wednesday""No. Why should I? My hands are clean.""But your clothes may suffer if enough mud is slung at you. Wire to thisman in the morning, and mention my name--Winter, of course, notFranklin.""Codlin's your friend, not Short," said Hart. "Sorry. It's a time-wornjape, but it fitted in admirably."The detective scribbled a name and address on a card."I don't think you need worry about Ingerman," he went on, "though it'swell to be prepared. A smart solicitor can stop irrelevant statements,especially if ready for them. But there must be no more of thisheart-opening to all and sundry, Mr. Grant. Siddle is your rival. He,too, wants to marry Miss Martin, and regards you now as the onlystumbling-block.""Siddle! That stick!" gasped Grant."Ridiculous, indeed monstrous," agreed Winter, rather heatedly, "butnevertheless a candidate for the lady's hand."Then he laughed. Peters's keen eyes were watching him, and Wally Hart wasgiving more heed to the conversation than was revealed by a fixed stareat the negro's head in meerschaum."You've bothered me," he went on. "I thought you had more sense. Don'tyou understand that all these bits of gossip reach Ingerman through thefilter of the snug at the Hare and Hounds?""The man's visit was unexpected, and his mission even more so. I justblurted out the facts.""Well, you've rendered the services of a solicitor absolutelyindispensable now."Grant, by no means so clear-headed these days as was his wont, followedthe scent of Winter's red herring like the youngest hound in a pack; butWally Hart and Peters, lookers-on in this chase, harked back to theright line."May I--" they both broke in simultaneously."Place to the fourth estate," bowed Hart solemnly."Thanks," said the journalist. "May I put a question, Winter?""A score, if you like.""Totting up the average of the murder cases in which Furneaux and youhave been engaged, in how many days do you count on spotting your man?""Sometimes we never get him.""Oh, come a bit closer than that.""Generally, given a clear run, with an established motive, we know who heis within eight days.""Wednesday, in effect?""Can't say, this time?""Suppose, as a hypothesis, you are convinced of a man's guilt, but canobtain little or no evidence?""He goes through life a free and independent citizen of this or any othercountry. Arrests on suspicion are not my long suit.""How does one get evidence?" purred Hart. "It isn't scattered broadcastby a clever criminal. And you fellows seem to object to my method, whichhas been the only effectual one so far in this affair.""If you had shot that specter the other night there would have been thedeuce to pay.""But you would now be sure of the murderer?""Why do you assume that?""Like Eugene Aram, he can't keep away from the scene of his crime."Winter felt he was skating on thin ice, so hastened to escape."Detective work is nearly all guessing," he said sententiously, "yet onemust beware of what I may term obvious guessing. If cause and effect wereso closely allied in certain classes of crime my department would ceaseto exist, and the protection of life and property might be left safely tothe ordinary police. By the way, P. C. Robinson has been rather inactiveduring two whole days. That makes me suspicious. What's he up to? Can youthrow a light on him, Peters?"The journalist knew that he was being told peremptorily to cease prying.He kicked Hart under the table."Hi!" yelled Wally. "What's the matter? Strike your matches on your ownshin, not mine.""Peters is announcing that the discussion is now closed," saidWinter firmly."Very well. He needn't emphasize the warning by a hob-nailed boot. Whenmy injured feelings have recovered I'll discourse to you of strange folkand stranger doings on the banks of the Rio de la Plata, and your stockas an Argentine plutocrat will rise one hundred per cent, next timeyou're badgered by a man who knows the country.""Meanwhile, Robinson is hot-foot on the Elkin trail," laughed Peters."His face was a study to-day when the groom supplied details of thepicture-buying.""Furneaux wanted that transaction to be widely known," said Winter. "Hegave every publicity to it.""Did he secure a bargain, I wonder?" said Grant."Oh, I expect so. He doesn't waste his hard-earned money, even forofficial purposes."But Winter was well aware of, and kept to himself one phase of the artdeal, at any rate. Furneaux had persuaded Siddle to fasten two bulkypackages with string!He was shaving next morning when his colleague entered, spruce as ever inattire, but looking rather weary. The little man flung himself at fulllength on Winter's bed."Been up all night," he explained. "Chemical analysis is fascinating butslow work--like watching a moth evolve from a grub. Had a fearful job,too, to get an analyst to chuck a theater and attend to business. Theblighter talked of office hours. _Cre nom_! Ten till four, and an hourand a half for lunch! Why can't we run _our_ show on those lines, James!"Winter finished carefully the left side of his broad expanse of face."You came down by the mail, I suppose?" he said casually."What a genius you are!" sighed Furneaux. "If _I_ were trembling withexpectation I could no more put a banal question like that than swallowthe razor after I was done with it. You might at least have the commondecency to thank me for leaving you to gorge on rare meats and vintagewines while I dallied with the deadly railway sandwich."Winter scraped the other cheek, his chin, and upper lip."Shall I go to the bathroom first, or listen?" he inquired."Ah, well, I'm tired, and hiking these frail bones to bed till twelve, soI'll give you a condensed version," snapped Furneaux. "Elkin 's illness,begun by whiskey and over-excitement, developed into steady poisoning bySiddle. The chemist used a rare agent, too--pure nicotine--easy, in asense, to detect, but capable of a dozen reasonable explanations whenrevealed by the post-mortem. But Elkin wasn't to be killed outright, Igather. The idea was to upset stomach and brain till he was half crazy.As you can read print when it's before your eyes, I needn't go into thematter of motive; Elkin's behavior supplies all details.""How about the knots? Hurry! I hate the feeling of soap drying on myskin.""One running noose and twice two half hitches on each package.""Good! Charles, we're going to pull off a real twister.""_We!_ Well, that tikes it, as the girl said when her hat blew off withthe fluffy transformation pinned to it."Winter rushed to the bathroom, and Furneaux crept languidly to bed.Before going to Knoleworth, Mr. Franklin consulted with Tomlin as to asuitable dinner, to which the other guests staying in the inn, namely,Mr. Peters and the Scotland Yard gentleman--the little man with theFrench name--might be invited. This important point settled, Mr. Franklincaught an early train, and was absent all day, being, in fact, closetedwith Superintendent Fowler and a Treasury solicitor.Furneaux was sound asleep long after twelve o'clock, and swore at Tomlinin French when the landlord ventured to arouse him. Tomlin wentdownstairs scratching his head."Least said soonest mended," he communed, "but we may all be murdered inour beds if them's the sort of 'tecs we 'ave to look arter us."However, he cheered up towards night. Ingerman, a lawyer, and somepressmen, arriving for the inquest, filled every available room, and thekitchen was redolent of good fare. All parties gathered in thedining-room, of course, and Ingerman had an eye for Mr. Franklin's party.The scraps of talk he overheard were nothing more exciting than theprospects of a certain horse for the Stewards' Cup. Peters had the tipstraight from the stables. A racing certainty, with a stone in hand.After dinner the financier was surprised when Furneaux approached, andtapped him professionally on the shoulder."A word with you outside," he said.Ingerman was irritated--perhaps slightly alarmed."Can't we talk here?" he said, in that singularly melodious voice of his."Better not, but I shan't detain you more than five minutes.""Anything my legal adviser might wish to hear?""Not from me. Tell him yourself afterwards, if you like."In the quiet street the detective suddenly linked arms with hiscompanion. Probably he smiled sardonically when he felt a telltale quiverrun through Ingerman's lanky frame."You've brought down Norris, I see?" he began."Yes.""Meaning to make things hot for Grant tomorrow?""Meaning to give justice the materials--""Cut the cackle, Isidor. I know you, and it's high time you knew me.Grant has retained Belcher. Ah! that gets you, does it? You haven'tforgotten Belcher. Now, be reasonable! Or, rather, don't run your headinto a noose. Grant had no more to do with the murder of your wife thanyou had. Call off Norris, and Grant withdraws Belcher. Twig? It's deadeasy, because the Treasury solicitor will simply ask for another week'sadjournment, as the police are not ready to go on. In the meantime, youpay off Norris, and save your face. Is it a deal?""Am I to understand--""Don't wriggle! The key of the situation is held by Belcher. Name of apipe! What prompting does Belcher need from me or anybody else after theBokfontein Lands case?""But--""Isidor, this is the last word. I was at the funeral on Saturday, and metyour wife's mother and sister. They do love you, don't they?"Ingerman died game."If I have your assurance that Mr. Grant is really innocent of Adelaide'sdeath, that is sufficient," he said slowly."Well, if it pleases you to put it that way, I'm agreeable. Which is yourroad? Back to the hotel? I'm for a short stroll. Mind you, no wobbling!Go straight, and I'll attend to Belcher. But, good Lord! How his eyeswill sparkle when they light on you to-morrow!"Neither the redoubtable Belcher, nor the Bokfontein Lands, nor poorAdelaide Melhuish's mother and sister may figure further in thischronicle. The inquest opened at the appointed hour next day, and wasclosed down again for a week with a celerity that was most disappointingboth to the jury and the general public. Of three legal luminariespresent only one, the Treasury man, uttered a few bald words. Belcher andNorris did not even announce the names of their clients. Norris noticedthat Belcher surveyed Ingerman with a grim smile, but thought nothing ofit until he received a check later in the week. Then he made someinquiries, and smiled himself.The foreman of the jury looked a trifle pinched, though his cheeks boretwo spots of hectic color. Mr. Franklin, drawn to the court by curiosity,happened to glance at him once, and found him gazing at Furneaux in apeculiarly thoughtful manner.Elkin, thriving on a diet of tea and eggs, was also interested in therepresentative of Scotland Yard. He seemed to ignore Grant entirely.Doris Martin was not in court. Superintendent Fowler had called abouthalf, past nine to tell her she would not be asked to attend that day.Near Mr. Franklin sat a few village notabilities, who, since they had notthe remotest connection with anyone concerned in the tragedy, have beenleft hitherto in their Olympian solitude. He listened to their comments."As usual, the police are utterly at sea," said one."Yes, 'following up important clews,' the newspapers say," scoffedanother."It's a disgraceful thing if a crime like this goes undetected andunpunished.""Which is the Scotland Yard man!""The small chap, in the blue suit.""What? _That_ little rat!""Oh, he's sharp. I met a man in the train and he told me--"Mr. Franklin grinned amiably; Hobbs, the butcher, intercepting his eye,grinned back. It is not difficult to imagine what portion of theforegoing small talk reached Furneaux subsequently.Oddly enough, both detectives had missed a brief but illuminatingincident which took place in the Hare and Hounds the previous night,while Winter was finishing a cigar with Peters, and Furneaux wasbludgeoning Ingerinan into compliance with his wishes.Elkin's remarkable improvement in health was commented on by Hobbs, andSiddle took the credit."That last mixture has proved beneficial, then?" he said, eying thehorse-dealer closely."Top-hole," smirked Elkin. "But it's only fair to say that I've chuckedwhiskey, too.""Did you finish the bottle?""Which bottle?""Mine, of course.""Nearly.""Don't take any more. It was decidedly strong. I'll send a boy earlyto-morrow morning with a first-rate tonic, and you might give him any oldmedicine bottles you possess. I'm running short."Elkin hesitated a second or two."I'll tell my housekeeper to look 'em up," he said. After the inquest hecommunicated this episode to Furneaux as a great joke."Queer, isn't it?" he guffawed. "A couple of dozen bottles went back, asI'm always getting stuff for the gees, but those two weren't among 'em.You took care of that, eh? When will you have the analysis?""It'll be fully a week yet," said the detective. "Government offices arenot run like express trains, and this is a free job, you know. But, beadvised by me. Stick to plain food, and throw physic to the dogs."Another singular fact, unobserved by the public at large, was that apoliceman, either Robinson or a stranger, patrolled the high-street allday and all night, while no one outside official circles was aware thatother members of the force watched The Hollies, or were secreted amongthe trees on the cliffside, from dusk to dawn.Next morning, however, there was real cause for talk. Siddle's shop wasclosed. Over the letter-box, neatly printed, was gummed a notice:"Called away on business. Will open for one hour after arrival of 7 p. m.train. T. S."Everyone who passed stopped to read. Even Mr. Franklin joined Furneauxand Peters in a stroll across the road to have a look."I want you a minute," said the big man suddenly to Furneaux. There wasthat in his tone which forbade questioning, so Peters sheered off, wellcontent with the share permitted him in the inquiry thus far."That fellow, Hart, is no fool," went on Winter rapidly. "He said lastnight 'How does one get evidence?' It was not easy to answer. Siddle hasgone to his mother's funeral. What do you think!""You'd turn me into a housebreaker, would you?" whined Furneaux bitterly."I must do the job, of course, just because I'm a little one. Well, well!After a long and honorable career I have to become a sneak thief. It maycost me my pension.""There's no real difficulty. An orchard--""Bet you a new hat I went over the ground before you did.""Get over it quickly now, and get something out of it, and I'll _give_you a new hat. Got any tools?""I fetched 'em from town Tuesday morning," chortled Furneaux. "So nowwho's the brainy one?"He skipped into the hotel, while Winter went to the station to make sureof Siddle's departure and destination. Yes, the chemist had taken areturn ticket to Epsom, where a strip of dank meadow-land on the road toEsher marks the last resting-place of many of London's epileptics. Onreturning to the high-street, Winter lighted a cigar, a somewhat commonoccurrence in his everyday life, where-upon Furneaux walked swiftly upthe hill. A farmer, living near the center of the village, owned a rathershowy cob. Winter found the man, and persuaded him to trot the animal toand fro in front of the hotel. There was a good deal of noise andhoof-clattering, and people came to their doors to see what was going on.Obviously, if they were watching the antics of a skittish two-year-old inthe high-street, their eyes were blind to proceedings in the backpremises. Even the postmaster and his daughter were interested onlookers,and a policeman, who might have put a summary end to the display,vanished as though by magic.Luckily, Winter was a good judge of a horse. When the cob was stabled,and the farmer came to the inn to have a drink, he was forced to admit atendency to cow hocks, which, it would seem, is held a fatal blemish inthe Argentine.Meanwhile, Furneaux had dodged into a lane and thence to a bridle-pathwhich emerged near Bob Smith's forge. When he had traversed, roughlyspeaking, one-half of a rectangle in which the Hare and Hounds occupiedthe center of one of the longer sides, he climbed a gate and followed ahedge. Though not losing a second, he took every precaution to remainunseen, and, to the best of his belief, gained an inclosed yard at theback of Siddle's premises without having attracted attention. He slippedthe catch of a kitchen window only to discover that the sash wasfastened by screws also. The lock of the kitchen door yielded topersuasion, but there were bolts above and below. A wire screen in alarder window was impregnable. Short of cutting out a pane of glass, hecould not effect an entry on the ground floor.Nimble as a squirrel, and risking everything, he climbed to the roof ofan outhouse, and tried a bedroom window. Here he succeeded. When thecatch was forced, there were no further obstacles. In he went, pausingonly to look around and see if any curious or alarmed eye was watchinghim. He wondered why every back yard on that side of the high-street wasempty, not even a maid-servant or woman washing clothes being in sight,but understood and grinned when the commotion Winter was creating came inview from a front room.Then he undertook a methodical search, working with a rapid yetpainstaking thoroughness which missed nothing. From a wardrobe heselected an overcoat and pair of trousers which reeked with turpentine.They were old and soiled garments, very different from the well-cut blackcoat and waistcoat, with striped cloth trousers, worn daily by thechemist. He drew a blank in the remainder of the upstairs rooms, whichincluded a sitting-room, though he devoted fully quarter of an hour toreading the titles of Siddle's books.A safe in the little dispensing closet at the back of the shop promisedsheer defiance until Furneaux saw a bunch of keys resting beside amethylated spirit lamp."'Twas ever thus!" he cackled, lighting the lamp. "Heaven help us poordetectives if it wasn't!"In a word, since murder will out, Siddle had forgotten his keys!Probably, he had gone to the safe for money, and, while writing thenotice as to his absence, had laid down the keys and omitted to pickthem up again.Furneaux disregarded ledgers and account books. He examined a bankpass-book and a check-book. In a drawer which contained these and aquantity of gold he found a small, leather-bound book with a lock, whichno key on the bunch was tiny enough to fit. A bit of twisted wire soonovercame this difficulty, and Furneaux began to read.There were quaint diagrams, and surveyor's sketches, both in plan andsection, with curious notes, and occasional records of what appeared tobe passages from letters or conversations. The detective read, andread, referring back and forth, absorbed in his task, no doubt, butevidently puzzled.At last, he stuffed the book into a pocket, completed his scrutiny of thesafe, examined the bottles on the shelf labeled "poisons," and took asample of the colorless contents of one bottle marked "C10H14N2."Then he went to the kitchen, replaced all catches and the lock of thedoor, and let himself out by the way he had come.Winter saw him from afar, and hastened upstairs to the privatesitting-room. Furneaux appeared there soon."Well?" said the Chief Inspector eagerly."Got him, I think," said Furneaux.Not much might be gathered from that monosyllabic question and itsanswer, but its significance in Siddle's ears, could he have heard, wouldhave been that of the passing bell tolling for the dead.CHAPTER XVIIITHE TRUTH AT LASTNot often did Furneaux qualify an opinion by that dubious phrase, "Ithink," which, in its colloquial sense, implies that the thought containsa reservation as to possible error.Winter looked anxious. Both he and his colleague knew well when to dropthe good-natured banter they delighted in. They were face to face nowwith issues of life and death, dark and sinister conditions which hadalready destroyed one life, threatened another, and might envisagefurther horrors. Small wonder, then, if the Chief Inspector's usuallycheerful face was clouded, or that his hopes should be somewhat dashedwhen Furneaux seemed to lack the abounding confidence which was his mostmarked characteristic."You've got something, I see," he said, trying to speak encouragingly,and glancing at the bundle of clothing which Furneaux had wrapped in anewspaper before dropping from the bedroom window of Siddle's house."Yes, a lot. What to make of it is the puzzle. We either go ahead on theflimsiest of evidence or I carry out another housebreaking job thisafternoon and restore things in status quo. First, the bundle--an oldcovert-coating overcoat and a pair of frayed trousers which probablydraped Owd Ben's ghost. They've been soaked in turpentine, which, chemistor no chemist, is still the best agent for removing stains. We'll put 'emunder the glass after we've examined the book. Siddle keeps a sort ofdiary, a series of jumbled memoranda. If we can extract nutriment out ofthat we may have something tangible to go upon. Let's begin at the end."Opening the leather-bound note-book, Furneaux stood with his back to thewindow. Winter, owing to his superior height, could look over the lesserman's shoulder. Many an occult document affecting the famous crimes andsocial or dynastic intrigues of the previous decade had these twoexamined in that way, the main advantage of scrutiny in common being thatthey could compare readings or suggested readings without loss of time,and with the original manuscript before both pairs of eyes.In the first instance, there were no dates--only scraps of sentences, orcomments. The concluding entry in the book was:"A tactical error? Perhaps. Immovable."Then, taking the order backward:"Scout the very notion of such an infamy. You and every scandal-monger inS. may do your worst.""Free to confess that events have opened my eyes to the truth, so, notfor the first time, out of evil comes good.""A prig.""Visit for such a purpose a piece of unheard-of impudence."These were all on one page."Quite clearly a _precis_ of Grant's remarks when Siddle called onMonday," said Winter.At any other time, Furneaux would have waxed sarcastic. Now hemerely nodded."Stops in a queer way," he muttered. "Not a word about the inquest or themissing bottles."The preceding page held even more disjointed entries, which,nevertheless, provided a fair synopsis of Doris's spirited words on theSunday afternoon."Malice and ignorance.""Patient because of years.""Loyal comrade. Shall remain.""Code.""No difference in friendship.""E. hopeless. Contempt.""Skipping--good."On the next page:"Isidor G. Ingerman. Useful. Inquire.""E.'s boasts? Nonsensical, surely!""Why has D. gone?"Both men paused at that line."Detective?" suggested Winter."That's how I take it," agreed Furneaux.Then came a sign: "+10%.""Elkin's mixture was not 'as before.' It was fortified," grinnedFurneaux. "That's the exact increase of nicotine. By the way, I havea sample. We can take care of him on that charge, without a shadowof doubt."Winter blew softly on the back of his friend's head."You're thorough, Charles, thorough!" he murmured. "It's a treat to workwith you when you get really busy."Furneaux ran his thumb across the end of several leaves."I can tell you now," he said, "that there's nothing of real value in theearlier notes. So far as I can judge, they refer either to a sort ofsettlement with his wife or chance phrases used by Doris Martin whichmight imply that she was heart whole and fancy free. There's not a ballyword dealing with the murder, or that can be twisted into the vaguestallusion to it. But here's a plan and section which have a sort ofsignificance. I've seen the place, so recognized it, or thought I did. Wemust check it, of course. Here you are! You know the footbridge acrossthe river from Bush Walk?""Yes.""The eastern end is supported on a hollow pier of masonry, in which onemight tog up unseen. These drawings would be useful as an _AideMemoire_ on a dark night. A false step, with the river in flood, mightbe awkward.""What's that on the opposite page?""I give it up--at present."This somewhat rare display of modesty on Furneaux's part was readilyunderstandable. A series of straight lines and angles conveyed verylittle hint of their purport; but Winter smiled behind his friend's back."I've been prowling about this wretched inn longer than you," he said."Look outside, to the left.""Don't need to, now," cackled Furneaux. "It's the profile of a wall,gate, and outhouse along which one could reach the window of theclub-room. Would you mind stopping grinning like a Cheshire cat?""Anything else?""Yes. This one: 'S.M.? 1820.' That beats you, eh?""Dished completely.""Doris Martin, as usual, supplies the answer. An old volume of the_Sussex Miscellany_, probably that for 1820, contains the full story ofOwd Ben. I might have mentioned it to you, but focussed on currentevents. Siddle has it among his books, which, by the way, are made uplargely of scientific and popular criminal records.""Is that the lot?""I'm afraid so. Have a look.""Just a minute. I want to think."Winter turned and gazed through the open window. Seldom had a moregracious June decked England with garlands. The hour was then high noon,and a pastoral landscape was drowned in sunshine. The Chief Inspector cutthe end off a cigar dreamily but with care."Broadmoor--perhaps," he muttered. "But we can't hang him yet, Charles. Acouple of knots and a theory won't do for the Assizes. We haven't asolitary witness. Hardly a night but he goes home at 9.30. If only he hadkilled Grant! But--Adelaide Melhuish!"In sheer despair he struck a match."Well, let's overhaul these duds," said Furneaux savagely. "I'll chancethe dinner hour for the return visit. Steynholme folk eat at half pasttwelve to the tick, and you can hardly get up another horse show."There was a knock at the door."Let me in, quick!" came Peters's voice, and the handle was triedforcibly."Go away! I'm busy!" cried Winter."This is urgent, devilish urgent," said Peters.Furneaux snatched up the note-book, and Winter tore off his coat,throwing it over the package which reposed in an armchair. Then the ChiefInspector unlocked the door, blocking the way aggressively."Now, I must say--" he began.But Peters clutched his shoulder with a nervous hand."Siddle has just hurried up the street and entered his shop," he hissed.The journalist had not only kept his eyes open, but excelled in the artof putting two and two together, an arithmetical calculation which, asapplied to the affairs of life, is not so readily arrived at as manypeople imagine."Buncoed! He's missed his keys!" shrilled Furneaux."Confound the man! He might at least have attended his mother's funeral!"stormed Winter, retrieving his coat.Thus it happened that Furneaux was the first down the stairs, though thethree emerged from the door of the inn on each other's heels. A stoutman, in all likelihood a farmer with horses for sale, was mounting thetwo steps which led to the entrance. His head was down, and his weightforward, so he successfully resisted Furneaux's impact, but Peters andWinter were irresistible, and he tumbled over with a muffled yell.At that instant Siddle quitted his shop, and headed straight for the postoffice. In his right hand he carried an automatic pistol. The street waswide. Furneaux, absolutely fearless in the performance of his duty, ranin a curve so as to bar the chemist's path, and it was then that Siddlesaw him. The man's face was terrible to behold. His eyes were rolling,his teeth gnashing; he had bitten his tongue and cheeks, and hisstertorous breathing ejected from his mouth foam tinged with blood."Ha!" he screamed in a falsetto of fury, "not yet, little man, not yet!"With that he raised the pistol, and fired point-blank at the detective.Furneaux ducked, and seized a small stone, being otherwise quite unarmed.He threw it with unerring aim, and, as was determined subsequently,struck the hand holding the weapon. Possibly, almost by a miracle, theblow caused a faulty pressure, because the action jammed, though thepistol itself was most accurate and deadly in its properties.By this time Winter, sweeping Peters aside, was within ten feet of themaniac, who turned and ran into the shop. The door, a solid one, fittedwith a spring lock, slammed in the Chief Inspector's face, and resisted amighty effort to burst it open. A few yards away stood an empty,two-wheeled cart, uptilted, and Winter demanded the help of a few men whohad gathered on seeing or hearing the hubbub."I call on you in the King's name!" he shouted. "We must force that door!Then stand clear, all of you!"He raced to the cart, and, when his object was perceived, willing handsassisted in converting the heavy vehicle into a battering-ram. Thegradient of the hill favored the attack, which was made at an acuteangle, and the first assault smashed the lock. There were a couple ofseconds' delay while the cart was backed out, and the detectives rushedin, Furneaux leading, because Winter gave his great physical strength tothe shafts. But the Chief Inspector grabbed his tiny friend by thecollar as the latter darted around the counter and into the dispensaryin the rear."Two of us can't go abreast, and you'll only get hurt," he said, speakingwith a calmness that was majestic in the circumstances."The nicotine is gone!" yelped Furneaux; both saw that the safestood open.Behind the dispensary was a small passage, whence the stairs mounted, anda door led to the kitchen. That door was closed now, though it was openwhen Furneaux ransacked the house. Therefore, they made that way at once.No ordinary lock could resist Winter's shoulder, and he soon masteredthis barrier. But the kitchen was empty--the outer door locked butunbolted. Since it is practically impossible for the strongest man topull a door open, the two made for the window, and tore at screws andcatch with eager fingers. Furneaux, light and nimble-footed, scrambledthrough first, so it was he who found Siddle lying in the orchard beyondthe wall of the yard. The unhappy wretch had swallowed nearly the wholeremaining contents of the bottle of nicotine, or enough to poison a scoreof robust men. He presented a lamentable and distressing spectacle. Someof the more venturesome passers-by, who had crowded after the detectivesand Peters, could not bear to look on, and slunk away in horror.Furneaux soon brought an emetic, which failed to act. Siddle breathed hislast while the glass was at his lips.In that moment of crisis only three men did not lose their heads. Wintercleared away the gapers, while Furneaux remained with the body. P.C.Robinson came up the hill at a run, and was sent for a stretcher,bringing from Hobbs's shop the very one on which the ill-fated AdelaideMelhuish was carried from the river bank.But where was Peters? In the post office, writing the first of a seriesof thrilling dispatches to a London evening newspaper. What journalistever had a more sensational murder-case to supply "copy"? And when was"special correspondent" ever better primed for the task? He wrote on, andon, till the telegraphist cried halt. Then he hied him to London bytrain, and began the more ambitious "story" for next morning. What he didnot know he guessed correctly. A fagged but triumphant man was JimmiePeters when he "blew in" to the Savage Club at 1 A.M. to seek sustenanceand a whiskey and soda before going home.Furneaux was white and shaken when Winter escorted the stretcher-bearersto the orchard."Poor devil!" he said, as the men lifted the body. "Foredoomed frombirth! We can eradicate these diseases from cattle. Why not from men!"The villagers could not understand him. Already, in some mysterious way,the word had gone around that Siddle had murdered the actress, and takenhis own life to avoid arrest, after shooting at the detective who was hoton his trail.Not until Peters's articles came back to Steynholme did the public atlarge realize that the chemist undoubtedly meant to kill Doris Martin. Hewas going straight to the post office when the way was barred byFurneaux. The bullet which missed the latter actually pierced the zincplate of the letter-box, and scored a furrow, inches long, in an oakcounter which it struck laterally.The village did not recover its poise for hours. Grant and Hart, to whomBates brought the news about one o'clock, rose from an untasted luncheonand hurried to the high-street. Knots of people stared at Grant, somesheepishly, others with frank relief, because all who knew him liked him.One man, a retired ironmonger and an impulsive fellow, came forward andwrung his hand heartily. A few prominent residents followed suit. Grantwas greatly embarrassed, but managed to endure these awkward ifwell-meant congratulations. There could be no mistaking their intent. Hehad been tried for murder at the bar of public opinion, and was nowformally acquitted.Even Fred Elkin, ignorant as yet of his own peril, yielded to theinfluences of the moment and bustled through the crowd."Mr. Grant," he cried outspokenly, "I ask your pardon. I seem to havemade a d--d fool of myself!""Easier done than said," chimed in Hart. "But, among all thisbell-ringing, can anyone tell what has actually happened? Where'sPeters?""In the post office."The two went in, and found the journalist scribbling against time. Hartcoolly grabbed a few slips of manuscript, and commenced reading. Grantlooked about for Doris. She was not visible, but Mr. Martin, pallid andnervous, nodded toward the sitting-room. The younger man, taking thegesture as a tacit invitation, entered the room.Doris was sitting there, crying bitterly. Poor girl! She had seen thatportion of the drama which was enacted in the street, and the shock of itwas still poignant. She looked up and met her lover's eyes. Neitheruttered a word, but Grant did a very wise thing. He caught her by theshoulders, raised her to her feet, and, after kissing her squarely on thelips, gave her a comforting hug."It will be all right now, Doris," he whispered tenderly. "Suchthunderstorms clear the air."An eminent novelist might have found many more ornate ways of avowinghis sentiments, but never a more satisfactory one. At any rate, itserved, so what more need be said?Certain rills of evidence accumulated into a fair-sized stream beforenight fell. P.C. Robinson, for instance, scored a point by ascertainingthat Peggy Smith had seen Furneaux dropping from the bedroom window ofthe chemist's shop. She was some hundreds of yards away, and could not bepositive that some man, perhaps a glazier, had not been therelegitimately effecting repairs. Still, when she met Siddle hurrying fromthe station, she told him of the incident."He never even thanked me," she said, "but broke into a run. The look inhis eyes was awful."The girl had, in fact, confirmed his worst fears, and her neighborlysolicitude had merely hastened the end.Again, the railway officials showed that Siddle had returned fromVictoria instead of taking train to the asylum. Furneaux had guessedaright. The discovery that his keys had been left behind drove the maninto a panic of fright.It took nearly three weeks before the unhappy business was finallydisposed of. A Treasury solicitor was given the chance of his career bythe medico-legal disquisition which cleared up an extraordinary record.The annals of the disease which predisposed Theodore Siddle to crimewent back many years. He was a fairly wealthy man by inheritance, andadopted the profession of chemistry as a hobby. One fact stood outboldly. He was aware of his hereditary taint, and had settled down inSteynholme believing that a quiet life, free from care or thedistractions of a town, would enable him to overcome it. Probably, thelawyer held, the man owned two distinct individualities, and the baserinstincts gradually overpowered the humane ones.Of course, the whole history of those trying days had to come out in opencourt, and the postmaster's daughter was given a descriptive andpictorial boom which many an actress envied. Peters was restored to gracewhen he showed plainly that his articles had kept the fickle barometer ofpublic opinion at "set fair," in so far as Grant and Doris wereconcerned."But," as Hart drawled during a dinner of reconciliation, "you needn'thave been so infernally personal about my hat."Grant and Doris were married before the year was out. Mr. Martin retiredon a pension, and the young couple decided that they could neverdissociate The Hollies from the tragic memories bound up with itsghost-window and lawn. So the place was sold, and Steynholme knows "thepostmaster's daughter" no more. Winter and Furneaux week-ended with themrecently at a pretty little nook in Dorset. Hart, just home from theBalkans, traveled from town with the detectives, and Doris, a radiantyoung matron, was as flippant as the best of them.One evening, when the men were sitting late in the smoking-room, the talkturned on the now half-forgotten drama in which the hapless AdelaideMelhuish played her last role."I met Peters in the Savage Club the other night," said Hart, filling thenegro-head pipe with care while he talked, "and he was chortling abouthis 'psychological study,' as he called it, of that unfortunate chemist.He still clings to the theory that your wife was the intended victim,Grant. Do you agree with him?""Rubbish!" cried Furneaux, before his host could answer. "At best, Petersis only a clever ass. Siddle never had the remotest notion of killingMiss Doris Martin, as Mrs. Grant was then. We shall never know forcertain just what happened, but there are elements in the affair whichgive ground for reasonable guesswork. The first thing that impressedWinter and me--at least, I suppose I really evolved the idea, though mybulky friend elaborated it" (whereat Winter smiled forgivingly, andbeheaded a fresh Havana) "was the complete noiselessness of the crime.Here we had Mr. Grant startled by the face at the window, and actuallysearching outside the house for the ghostly visitant, while Miss Doriswas gazing at The Hollies from the other side of the river, and not asound was heard, though it was a summer's night, without a breath ofwind, and at an hour when the splash of a fish leaping in the streamwould have created a commotion. Now, Miss Melhuish was an active andwell-built young woman, an actress, too, and therefore likely to meet anemergency without instant collapse. Yet she allows herself to be struckdead or insensible without cry or struggle! How do you account for it?""Go on, Charles; don't be theatrical," jeered Winter. "You've got thestory pat. Even that simile of the jumping fish is mine.""True," agreed Furneaux. "I only brought it in as a sop. But, tocontinue, as the tub-thumper says. Isn't it permissible to assume thatSiddle accompanied the lady, either by prior arrangement or by contrivinga meeting which looked like mere chance? We know that she went to hisshop. We know, too, that he was clever and unscrupulous, and any allusionto Grant would stir his wits to the uttermost. He would see instantly howinterested Miss Melhuish was in the owner of The Hollies, while she, asmart Londoner, would recognize in Siddle an informant worth all the restof the babblers in Steynholme. At any rate, no matter how the thing wasbrought about, it is self-evident that Siddle brought his intended victiminto the grounds, and told her of the small uncovered window throughwhich she could peer at Grant after Miss Doris had gone. He showed herwhich path to use, and undoubtedly waited for her, and stayed her flightwhen Grant rose from his chair. She was close to him, and whollyunafraid, finding in him an ally. They were purposely hidden, in thegloom of dense foliage, and remained there until Grant had closed thewindow again. Then, and not till then, did the murderer strike, probablystifling her with his free hand. He had the implement in his pocket. Therope was secreted among the bushes. He could carry through the wholewretched crime in little more than a minute. And his psychology went fardeeper than Peters gave him credit for. He had weighed up the situationto a nicety. No matter who found the body, Mr. Grant was saddled with aresponsibility which might well prove disastrous, and was almost sure toaffect his relations with the Martin household. For instance, nothingshort of a miracle could have stopped Robinson from arresting him on acharge of murder.""You, then, are a miracle?" put in Hart, pointing the pipe at thelittle man."To the person of ordinary intelligence--yes.""After that," said Winter, "there is nothing more to be said. Let's seewho secures the pocket marvel as a partner at auction."       *       *       *       *       *As a fitting end to the strange story of wayward love and maniacal frenzywhich found an unusual habitat in a secluded hamlet like Steynholme, asmall vignette of its normal life may be etched in. The trope is germaneto the scene.On a wet afternoon in October Hobbs and Elkin had adjourned to the Hareand Hounds. Tomlin was reading a newspaper spread on the bar counter. Hewas alone. The day was Friday, and the last "commercial" of the week haddeparted by the mid-day train."Wot's yer tonic?" demanded the butcher."A glass of beer," threw Elkin over his shoulder. He had walked to thewindow, and was gazing moodily at the sign of the "plumber and decorator"who had taken Siddle's shop. The village could not really support anout-and-out chemist, so a local grocer had elected to stock patentmedicines as a side line.Tomlin made play with a beer-pump."Where's yer own?" inquired Hobbs hospitably.Elkin came and drank. After an interlude, Tomlin ran a finger down acolumn of the newspaper."By the way, Fred, didn't you tell me about that funny little chap,Furno, the 'tec, buyin' some pictures of yours?" he said."I did. Had him there, anyhow," chuckled Elkin."How much did you stick 'im for?""Three guineas.""They can't ha' bin this lot, then, though I've a notion it wur the samename, 'Aylesbury Steeplechase.'""What are you talking about?""This."Tomlin turned the paper, and Elkin read:At their monthly art sale on Wednesday Messrs. Brown, Jenkins and Browndisposed of an almost unique set of colored prints, by F. Smyth, dated1841. The series of six represented various phases of the long defunctAylesbury Steeplechase, "The Start," "The Brook," "The In-and-Out," andso on to "The Finish." It is understood that this notable series,produced during the best period of the art, and at the very zenith ofSmyth's fame, were acquired recently by a Sussex amateur at a low price.Bidding began at fifty guineas, and rose quickly to one hundred andtwenty, at which figure Messrs. Carnioli and Bruschi became the owners.Elkin read the paragraph twice, until the words burnt into his brain."No," he said thickly. "They're not mine.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg LiteraryArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how tosubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,are filed in directories based on their release date.

When they began distributing the palmit was close upon ten o'clock, the candles were burning dimly, thewicks wanted snuffing; it was all in a sort of mist. In the twilightof the church the crowd seemed heaving like the sea, and to BishopPyotr, who had been unwell for the last three days, it seemed thatall the faces--old and young, men's and women's--were alike,that everyone who came up for the palm had the same expression inhis eyes. In the mist he could not see the doors; the crowd keptmoving and looked as though there were no end to it. The femalechoir was singing, a nun was reading the prayers for the day.How stifling, how hot it was! How long the service went on! BishopPyotr was tired. His breathing was laboured and rapid, his throatwas parched, his shoulders ached with weariness, his legs weretrembling. And it disturbed him unpleasantly when a religious maniacuttered occasional shrieks in the gallery. And then all of a sudden,as though in a dream or delirium, it seemed to the bishop as thoughhis own mother Marya Timofyevna, whom he had not seen for nineyears, or some old woman just like his mother, came up to him outof the crowd, and, after taking a palm branch from him, walked awaylooking at him all the while good-humouredly with a kind, joyfulsmile until she was lost in the crowd. And for some reason tearsflowed down his face. There was peace in his heart, everything waswell, yet he kept gazing fixedly towards the left choir, where theprayers were being read, where in the dusk of evening you could notrecognize anyone, and--wept. Tears glistened on his face and onhis beard. Here someone close at hand was weeping, then someoneelse farther away, then others and still others, and little bylittle the church was filled with soft weeping. And a little later,within five minutes, the nuns' choir was singing; no one was weepingand everything was as before.Soon the service was over. When the bishop got into his carriageto drive home, the gay, melodious chime of the heavy, costly bellswas filling the whole garden in the moonlight. The white walls, thewhite crosses on the tombs, the white birch-trees and black shadows,and the far-away moon in the sky exactly over the convent, seemednow living their own life, apart and incomprehensible, yet verynear to man. It was the beginning of April, and after the warmspring day it turned cool; there was a faint touch of frost, andthe breath of spring could be felt in the soft, chilly air. Theroad from the convent to the town was sandy, the horses had to goat a walking pace, and on both sides of the carriage in the brilliant,peaceful moonlight there were people trudging along home from churchthrough the sand. And all was silent, sunk in thought; everythingaround seemed kindly, youthful, akin, everything--trees and skyand even the moon, and one longed to think that so it would bealways.At last the carriage drove into the town and rumbled along theprincipal street. The shops were already shut, but at Erakin's, themillionaire shopkeeper's, they were trying the new electric lights,which flickered brightly, and a crowd of people were gathered round.Then came wide, dark, deserted streets, one after another; then thehighroad, the open country, the fragrance of pines. And suddenlythere rose up before the bishop's eyes a white turreted wall, andbehind it a tall belfry in the full moonlight, and beside it fiveshining, golden cupolas: this was the Pankratievsky Monastery, inwhich Bishop Pyotr lived. And here, too, high above the monastery,was the silent, dreamy moon. The carriage drove in at the gate,crunching over the sand; here and there in the moonlight there wereglimpses of dark monastic figures, and there was the sound offootsteps on the flag-stones. . . ."You know, your holiness, your mamma arrived while you were away,"the lay brother informed the bishop as he went into his cell."My mother? When did she come?""Before the evening service. She asked first where you were andthen she went to the convent.""Then it was her I saw in the church, just now! Oh, Lord!"And the bishop laughed with joy."She bade me tell your holiness," the lay brother went on, "thatshe would come to-morrow. She had a little girl with her--hergrandchild, I suppose. They are staying at Ovsyannikov's inn.""What time is it now?""A little after eleven.""Oh, how vexing!"The bishop sat for a little while in the parlour, hesitating, andas it were refusing to believe it was so late. His arms and legswere stiff, his head ached. He was hot and uncomfortable. Afterresting a little he went into his bedroom, and there, too, he sata little, still thinking of his mother; he could hear the lay brothergoing away, and Father Sisoy coughing the other side of the wall.The monastery clock struck a quarter.The bishop changed his clothes and began reading the prayers beforesleep. He read attentively those old, long familiar prayers, andat the same time thought about his mother. She had nine childrenand about forty grandchildren. At one time, she had lived with herhusband, the deacon, in a poor village; she had lived there a verylong time from the age of seventeen to sixty. The bishop rememberedher from early childhood, almost from the age of three, and--howhe had loved her! Sweet, precious childhood, always fondly remembered!Why did it, that long-past time that could never return, why didit seem brighter, fuller, and more festive than it had really been?When in his childhood or youth he had been ill, how tender andsympathetic his mother had been! And now his prayers mingled withthe memories, which gleamed more and more brightly like a flame,and the prayers did not hinder his thinking of his mother.When he had finished his prayers he undressed and lay down, and atonce, as soon as it was dark, there rose before his mind his deadfather, his mother, his native village Lesopolye . . . the creakof wheels, the bleat of sheep, the church bells on bright summermornings, the gypsies under the window--oh, how sweet to thinkof it! He remembered the priest of Lesopolye, Father Simeon--mild,gentle, kindly; he was a lean little man, while his son, a divinitystudent, was a huge fellow and talked in a roaring bass voice. Thepriest's son had flown into a rage with the cook and abused her:"Ah, you Jehud's ass!" and Father Simeon overhearing it, said nota word, and was only ashamed because he could not remember wheresuch an ass was mentioned in the Bible. After him the priest atLesopolye had been Father Demyan, who used to drink heavily, andat times drank till he saw green snakes, and was even nicknamedDemyan Snakeseer. The schoolmaster at Lesopolye was Matvey Nikolaitch,who had been a divinity student, a kind and intelligent man, buthe, too, was a drunkard; he never beat the schoolchildren, but forsome reason he always had hanging on his wall a bunch of birch-twigs,and below it an utterly meaningless inscription in Latin: "Betulakinderbalsamica secuta." He had a shaggy black dog whom he calledSyntax.And his holiness laughed. Six miles from Lesopolye was the villageObnino with a wonder-working ikon. In the summer they used to carrythe ikon in procession about the neighbouring villages and ring thebells the whole day long; first in one village and then in another,and it used to seem to the bishop then that joy was quivering inthe air, and he (in those days his name was Pavlusha) used to followthe ikon, bareheaded and barefoot, with naive faith, with a naivesmile, infinitely happy. In Obnino, he remembered now, there werealways a lot of people, and the priest there, Father Alexey, tosave time during mass, used to make his deaf nephew Ilarion readthe names of those for whose health or whose souls' peace prayerswere asked. Ilarion used to read them, now and then getting a fiveor ten kopeck piece for the service, and only when he was grey andbald, when life was nearly over, he suddenly saw written on one ofthe pieces of paper: "What a fool you are, Ilarion." Up to fifteenat least Pavlusha was undeveloped and idle at his lessons, so muchso that they thought of taking him away from the clerical schooland putting him into a shop; one day, going to the post at Obninofor letters, he had stared a long time at the post-office clerksand asked: "Allow me to ask, how do you get your salary, every monthor every day?"His holiness crossed himself and turned over on the other side,trying to stop thinking and go to sleep."My mother has come," he remembered and laughed.The moon peeped in at the window, the floor was lighted up, andthere were shadows on it. A cricket was chirping. Through the wallFather Sisoy was snoring in the next room, and his aged snore hada sound that suggested loneliness, forlornness, even vagrancy. Sisoyhad once been housekeeper to the bishop of the diocese, and wascalled now "the former Father Housekeeper"; he was seventy yearsold, he lived in a monastery twelve miles from the town and stayedsometimes in the town, too. He had come to the Pankratievsky Monasterythree days before, and the bishop had kept him that he might talkto him at his leisure about matters of business, about the arrangementshere. . . .At half-past one they began ringing for matins. Father Sisoy couldbe heard coughing, muttering something in a discontented voice,then he got up and walked barefoot about the rooms."Father Sisoy," the bishop called.Sisoy went back to his room and a little later made his appearancein his boots, with a candle; he had on his cassock over hisunderclothes and on his head was an old faded skull-cap."I can't sleep," said the bishop, sitting up. "I must be unwell.And what it is I don't know. Fever!""You must have caught cold, your holiness. You must be rubbed withtallow." Sisoy stood a little and yawned. "O Lord, forgive me, asinner.""They had the electric lights on at Erakin's today," he said; "Idon't like it!"Father Sisoy was old, lean, bent, always dissatisfied with something,and his eyes were angry-looking and prominent as a crab's."I don't like it," he said, going away. "I don't like it. Botherit!"IINext day, Palm Sunday, the bishop took the service in the cathedralin the town, then he visited the bishop of the diocese, then visiteda very sick old lady, the widow of a general, and at last drovehome. Between one and two o'clock he had welcome visitors diningwith him--his mother and his niece Katya, a child of eight yearsold. All dinner-time the spring sunshine was streaming in at thewindows, throwing bright light on the white tablecloth and on Katya'sred hair. Through the double windows they could hear the noise ofthe rooks and the notes of the starlings in the garden."It is nine years since we have met," said the old lady. "And whenI looked at you in the monastery yesterday, good Lord! you've notchanged a bit, except maybe you are thinner and your beard is alittle longer. Holy Mother, Queen of Heaven! Yesterday at the eveningservice no one could help crying. I, too, as I looked at you,suddenly began crying, though I couldn't say why. His Holy Will!"And in spite of the affectionate tone in which she said this, hecould see she was constrained as though she were uncertain whetherto address him formally or familiarly, to laugh or not, and thatshe felt herself more a deacon's widow than his mother. And Katyagazed without blinking at her uncle, his holiness, as though tryingto discover what sort of a person he was. Her hair sprang up fromunder the comb and the velvet ribbon and stood out like a halo; shehad a turned-up nose and sly eyes. The child had broken a glassbefore sitting down to dinner, and now her grandmother, as shetalked, moved away from Katya first a wineglass and then a tumbler.The bishop listened to his mother and remembered how many, manyyears ago she used to take him and his brothers and sisters torelations whom she considered rich; in those days she was taken upwith the care of her children, now with her grandchildren, and shehad brought Katya. . . ."Your sister, Varenka, has four children," she told him; "Katya,here, is the eldest. And your brother-in-law Father Ivan fell sick,God knows of what, and died three days before the Assumption; andmy poor Varenka is left a beggar.""And how is Nikanor getting on?" the bishop asked about his eldestbrother."He is all right, thank God. Though he has nothing much, yet he canlive. Only there is one thing: his son, my grandson Nikolasha, didnot want to go into the Church; he has gone to the university tobe a doctor. He thinks it is better; but who knows! His Holy Will!""Nikolasha cuts up dead people," said Katya, spilling water overher knees."Sit still, child," her grandmother observed calmly, and took theglass out of her hand. "Say a prayer, and go on eating.""How long it is since we have seen each other!" said the bishop,and he tenderly stroked his mother's hand and shoulder; "and Imissed you abroad, mother, I missed you dreadfully.""Thank you.""I used to sit in the evenings at the open window, lonely and alone;often there was music playing, and all at once I used to be overcomewith homesickness and felt as though I would give everything onlyto be at home and see you."His mother smiled, beamed, but at once she made a grave face andsaid:"Thank you."His mood suddenly changed. He looked at his mother and could notunderstand how she had come by that respectfulness, that timidexpression of face: what was it for? And he did not recognize her.He felt sad and vexed. And then his head ached just as it had theday before; his legs felt fearfully tired, and the fish seemed tohim stale and tasteless; he felt thirsty all the time. . . .After dinner two rich ladies, landowners, arrived and sat for anhour and a half in silence with rigid countenances; the archimandrite,a silent, rather deaf man, came to see him about business. Thenthey began ringing for vespers; the sun was setting behind the woodand the day was over. When he returned from church, he hurriedlysaid his prayers, got into bed, and wrapped himself up as warm aspossible.It was disagreeable to remember the fish he had eaten at dinner.The moonlight worried him, and then he heard talking. In an adjoiningroom, probably in the parlour, Father Sisoy was talking politics:"There's war among the Japanese now. They are fighting. The Japanese,my good soul, are the same as the Montenegrins; they are the samerace. They were under the Turkish yoke together."And then he heard the voice of Marya Timofyevna:"So, having said our prayers and drunk tea, we went, you know, toFather Yegor at Novokatnoye, so. . ."And she kept on saying, "having had tea" or "having drunk tea," andit seemed as though the only thing she had done in her life was todrink tea.The bishop slowly, languidly, recalled the seminary, the academy.For three years he had been Greek teacher in the seminary: by thattime he could not read without spectacles. Then he had become amonk; he had been made a school inspector. Then he had defended histhesis for his degree. When he was thirty-two he had been maderector of the seminary, and consecrated archimandrite: and then hislife had been so easy, so pleasant; it seemed so long, so long, noend was in sight. Then he had begun to be ill, had grown very thinand almost blind, and by the advice of the doctors had to give upeverything and go abroad."And what then?" asked Sisoy in the next room."Then we drank tea . . ." answered Marya Timofyevna."Good gracious, you've got a green beard," said Katya suddenly insurprise, and she laughed.The bishop remembered that the grey-headed Father Sisoy's beardreally had a shade of green in it, and he laughed."God have mercy upon us, what we have to put up with with thisgirl!" said Sisoy, aloud, getting angry. "Spoilt child! Sit quiet!"The bishop remembered the perfectly new white church in which hehad conducted the services while living abroad, he remembered thesound of the warm sea. In his flat he had five lofty light rooms;in his study he had a new writing-table, lots of books. He had reada great deal and often written. And he remembered how he had pinedfor his native land, how a blind beggar woman had played the guitarunder his window every day and sung of love, and how, as he listened,he had always for some reason thought of the past. But eight yearshad passed and he had been called back to Russia, and now he was asuffragan bishop, and all the past had retreated far away into themist as though it were a dream. . . .Father Sisoy came into the bedroom with a candle."I say!" he said, wondering, "are you asleep already, your holiness?""What is it?""Why, it's still early, ten o'clock or less. I bought a candleto-day; I wanted to rub you with tallow.""I am in a fever . . ." said the bishop, and he sat up. "I reallyought to have something. My head is bad. . . ."Sisoy took off the bishop's shirt and began rubbing his chest andback with tallow."That's the way . . . that's the way . . ." he said. "Lord JesusChrist . . . that's the way. I walked to the town to-day; I was atwhat's-his-name's--the chief priest Sidonsky's. . . . I had teawith him. I don't like him. Lord Jesus Christ. . . . That's theway. I don't like him."IIIThe bishop of the diocese, a very fat old man, was ill with rheumatismor gout, and had been in bed for over a month. Bishop Pyotr wentto see him almost every day, and saw all who came to ask his help.And now that he was unwell he was struck by the emptiness, thetriviality of everything which they asked and for which they wept;he was vexed at their ignorance, their timidity; and all thisuseless, petty business oppressed him by the mass of it, and itseemed to him that now he understood the diocesan bishop, who hadonce in his young days written on "The Doctrines of the Freedom ofthe Will," and now seemed to be all lost in trivialities, to haveforgotten everything, and to have no thoughts of religion. Thebishop must have lost touch with Russian life while he was abroad;he did not find it easy; the peasants seemed to him coarse, thewomen who sought his help dull and stupid, the seminarists and theirteachers uncultivated and at times savage. And the documents comingin and going out were reckoned by tens of thousands; and whatdocuments they were! The higher clergy in the whole diocese gavethe priests, young and old, and even their wives and children, marksfor their behaviour--a five, a four, and sometimes even a three;and about this he had to talk and to read and write serious reports.And there was positively not one minute to spare; his soul wastroubled all day long, and the bishop was only at peace when he wasin church.He could not get used, either, to the awe which, through no wishof his own, he inspired in people in spite of his quiet, modestdisposition. All the people in the province seemed to him little,scared, and guilty when he looked at them. Everyone was timid inhis presence, even the old chief priests; everyone "flopped" at hisfeet, and not long previously an old lady, a village priest's wifewho had come to consult him, was so overcome by awe that she couldnot utter a single word, and went empty away. And he, who couldnever in his sermons bring himself to speak ill of people, neverreproached anyone because he was so sorry for them, was moved tofury with the people who came to consult him, lost his temper andflung their petitions on the floor. The whole time he had been here,not one person had spoken to him genuinely, simply, as to a humanbeing; even his old mother seemed now not the same! And why, hewondered, did she chatter away to Sisoy and laugh so much; whilewith him, her son, she was grave and usually silent and constrained,which did not suit her at all. The only person who behaved freelywith him and said what he meant was old Sisoy, who had spent hiswhole life in the presence of bishops and had outlived eleven ofthem. And so the bishop was at ease with him, although, of course,he was a tedious and nonsensical man.After the service on Tuesday, his holiness Pyotr was in the diocesanbishop's house receiving petitions there; he got excited and angry,and then drove home. He was as unwell as before; he longed to bein bed, but he had hardly reached home when he was informed that ayoung merchant called Erakin, who subscribed liberally to charities,had come to see him about a very important matter. The bishop hadto see him. Erakin stayed about an hour, talked very loud, almostshouted, and it was difficult to understand what he said."God grant it may," he said as he went away. "Most essential!According to circumstances, your holiness! I trust it may!"After him came the Mother Superior from a distant convent. And whenshe had gone they began ringing for vespers. He had to go to church.In the evening the monks sang harmoniously, with inspiration. Ayoung priest with a black beard conducted the service; and thebishop, hearing of the Bridegroom who comes at midnight and of theHeavenly Mansion adorned for the festival, felt no repentance forhis sins, no tribulation, but peace at heart and tranquillity. Andhe was carried back in thought to the distant past, to his childhoodand youth, when, too, they used to sing of the Bridegroom and ofthe Heavenly Mansion; and now that past rose up before him--living,fair, and joyful as in all likelihood it never had been. And perhapsin the other world, in the life to come, we shall think of thedistant past, of our life here, with the same feeling. Who knows?The bishop was sitting near the altar. It was dark; tears floweddown his face. He thought that here he had attained everything aman in his position could attain; he had faith and yet everythingwas not clear, something was lacking still. He did not want to die;and he still felt that he had missed what was most important,something of which he had dimly dreamed in the past; and he wastroubled by the same hopes for the future as he had felt in childhood,at the academy and abroad."How well they sing to-day!" he thought, listening to the singing."How nice it is!"IVOn Thursday he celebrated mass in the cathedral; it was the Washingof Feet. When the service was over and the people were going home,it was sunny, warm; the water gurgled in the gutters, and theunceasing trilling of the larks, tender, telling of peace, rosefrom the fields outside the town. The trees were already awakeningand smiling a welcome, while above them the infinite, fathomlessblue sky stretched into the distance, God knows whither.On reaching home his holiness drank some tea, then changed hisclothes, lay down on his bed, and told the lay brother to close theshutters on the windows. The bedroom was darkened. But what weariness,what pain in his legs and his back, a chill heavy pain, what a noisein his ears! He had not slept for a long time--for a very longtime, as it seemed to him now, and some trifling detail which hauntedhis brain as soon as his eyes were closed prevented him from sleeping.As on the day before, sounds reached him from the adjoining roomsthrough the walls, voices, the jingle of glasses and teaspoons. . . .Marya Timofyevna was gaily telling Father Sisoy some story withquaint turns of speech, while the latter answered in a grumpy,ill-humoured voice: "Bother them! Not likely! What next!" And thebishop again felt vexed and then hurt that with other people hisold mother behaved in a simple, ordinary way, while with him, herson, she was shy, spoke little, and did not say what she meant, andeven, as he fancied, had during all those three days kept tryingin his presence to find an excuse for standing up, because she wasembarrassed at sitting before him. And his father? He, too, probably,if he had been living, would not have been able to utter a word inthe bishop's presence. . . .Something fell down on the floor in the adjoining room and wasbroken; Katya must have dropped a cup or a saucer, for Father Sisoysuddenly spat and said angrily:"What a regular nuisance the child is! Lord forgive my transgressions!One can't provide enough for her."Then all was quiet, the only sounds came from outside. And when thebishop opened his eyes he saw Katya in his room, standing motionless,staring at him. Her red hair, as usual, stood up from under thecomb like a halo."Is that you, Katya?" he asked. "Who is it downstairs who keepsopening and shutting a door?""I don't hear it," answered Katya; and she listened."There, someone has just passed by.""But that was a noise in your stomach, uncle."He laughed and stroked her on the head."So you say Cousin Nikolasha cuts up dead people?" he asked aftera pause."Yes, he is studying.""And is he kind?""Oh, yes, he's kind. But he drinks vodka awfully.""And what was it your father died of?""Papa was weak and very, very thin, and all at once his throat wasbad. I was ill then, too, and brother Fedya; we all had bad throats.Papa died, uncle, and we got well."Her chin began quivering, and tears gleamed in her eyes and trickleddown her cheeks."Your holiness," she said in a shrill voice, by now weeping bitterly,"uncle, mother and all of us are left very wretched. . . . Give usa little money . . . do be kind . . . uncle darling. . . ."He, too, was moved to tears, and for a long time was too much touchedto speak. Then he stroked her on the head, patted her on the shoulderand said:"Very good, very good, my child. When the holy Easter comes, wewill talk it over. . . . I will help you. . . . I will help you. . . ."His mother came in quietly, timidly, and prayed before the ikon.Noticing that he was not sleeping, she said:"Won't you have a drop of soup?""No, thank you," he answered, "I am not hungry.""You seem to be unwell, now I look at you. I should think so; youmay well be ill! The whole day on your legs, the whole day. . . .And, my goodness, it makes one's heart ache even to look at you!Well, Easter is not far off; you will rest then, please God. Thenwe will have a talk, too, but now I'm not going to disturb you withmy chatter. Come along, Katya; let his holiness sleep a little."And he remembered how once very long ago, when he was a boy, shehad spoken exactly like that, in the same jestingly respectful tone,with a Church dignitary. . . . Only from her extraordinarily kindeyes and the timid, anxious glance she stole at him as she went outof the room could one have guessed that this was his mother. Heshut his eyes and seemed to sleep, but twice heard the clock strikeand Father Sisoy coughing the other side of the wall. And once morehis mother came in and looked timidly at him for a minute. Someonedrove up to the steps, as he could hear, in a coach or in a chaise.Suddenly a knock, the door slammed, the lay brother came into thebedroom."Your holiness," he called."Well?""The horses are here; it's time for the evening service.""What o'clock is it?""A quarter past seven."He dressed and drove to the cathedral. During all the "TwelveGospels" he had to stand in the middle of the church without moving,and the first gospel, the longest and the most beautiful, he readhimself. A mood of confidence and courage came over him. That firstgospel, "Now is the Son of Man glorified," he knew by heart; andas he read he raised his eyes from time to time, and saw on bothsides a perfect sea of lights and heard the splutter of candles,but, as in past years, he could not see the people, and it seemedas though these were all the same people as had been round him inthose days, in his childhood and his youth; that they would alwaysbe the same every year and till such time as God only knew.His father had been a deacon, his grandfather a priest, hisgreat-grandfather a deacon, and his whole family, perhaps from thedays when Christianity had been accepted in Russia, had belongedto the priesthood; and his love for the Church services, for thepriesthood, for the peal of the bells, was deep in him, ineradicable,innate. In church, particularly when he took part in the service,he felt vigorous, of good cheer, happy. So it was now. Only whenthe eighth gospel had been read, he felt that his voice had grownweak, even his cough was inaudible. His head had begun to acheintensely, and he was troubled by a fear that he might fall down.And his legs were indeed quite numb, so that by degrees he ceasedto feel them and could not understand how or on what he was standing,and why he did not fall. . . .It was a quarter to twelve when the service was over. When he reachedhome, the bishop undressed and went to bed at once without evensaying his prayers. He could not speak and felt that he could nothave stood up. When he had covered his head with the quilt he felta sudden longing to be abroad, an insufferable longing! He feltthat he would give his life not to see those pitiful cheap shutters,those low ceilings, not to smell that heavy monastery smell. Ifonly there were one person to whom he could have talked, have openedhis heart!For a long while he heard footsteps in the next room and could nottell whose they were. At last the door opened, and Sisoy came inwith a candle and a tea-cup in his hand."You are in bed already, your holiness?" he asked. "Here I havecome to rub you with spirit and vinegar. A thorough rubbing does agreat deal of good. Lord Jesus Christ! . . . That's the way . . .that's the way. . . . I've just been in our monastery. . . . I don'tlike it. I'm going away from here to-morrow, your holiness; I don'twant to stay longer. Lord Jesus Christ. . . . That's the way. . . ."Sisoy could never stay long in the same place, and he felt as thoughhe had been a whole year in the Pankratievsky Monastery. Above all,listening to him it was difficult to understand where his home was,whether he cared for anyone or anything, whether he believed inGod. . . . He did not know himself why he was a monk, and, indeed,he did not think about it, and the time when he had become a monkhad long passed out of his memory; it seemed as though he had beenborn a monk."I'm going away to-morrow; God be with them all.""I should like to talk to you. . . . I can't find the time," saidthe bishop softly with an effort. "I don't know anything or anybodyhere. . . .""I'll stay till Sunday if you like; so be it, but I don't want tostay longer. I am sick of them!""I ought not to be a bishop," said the bishop softly. "I ought tohave been a village priest, a deacon . . . or simply a monk. . . .All this oppresses me . . . oppresses me.""What? Lord Jesus Christ. . . . That's the way. Come, sleep well,your holiness! . . . What's the good of talking? It's no use.Good-night!"The bishop did not sleep all night. And at eight o'clock in themorning he began to have hemorrhage from the bowels. The lay brotherwas alarmed, and ran first to the archimandrite, then for themonastery doctor, Ivan Andreyitch, who lived in the town. The doctor,a stout old man with a long grey beard, made a prolonged examinationof the bishop, and kept shaking his head and frowning, then said:"Do you know, your holiness, you have got typhoid?"After an hour or so of hemorrhage the bishop looked much thinner,paler, and wasted; his face looked wrinkled, his eyes looked bigger,and he seemed older, shorter, and it seemed to him that he wasthinner, weaker, more insignificant than any one, that everythingthat had been had retreated far, far away and would never go onagain or be repeated."How good," he thought, "how good!"His old mother came. Seeing his wrinkled face and his big eyes, shewas frightened, she fell on her knees by the bed and began kissinghis face, his shoulders, his hands. And to her, too, it seemed thathe was thinner, weaker, and more insignificant than anyone, and nowshe forgot that he was a bishop, and kissed him as though he werea child very near and very dear to her."Pavlusha, darling," she said; "my own, my darling son! . . . Whyare you like this? Pavlusha, answer me!"Katya, pale and severe, stood beside her, unable to understand whatwas the matter with her uncle, why there was such a look of sufferingon her grandmother's face, why she was saying such sad and touchingthings. By now he could not utter a word, he could understandnothing, and he imagined he was a simple ordinary man, that he waswalking quickly, cheerfully through the fields, tapping with hisstick, while above him was the open sky bathed in sunshine, andthat he was free now as a bird and could go where he liked!"Pavlusha, my darling son, answer me," the old woman was saying."What is it? My own!""Don't disturb his holiness," Sisoy said angrily, walking about theroom. "Let him sleep . . . what's the use . . . it's no good. . . ."Three doctors arrived, consulted together, and went away again. Theday was long, incredibly long, then the night came on and passedslowly, slowly, and towards morning on Saturday the lay brotherwent in to the old mother who was lying on the sofa in the parlour,and asked her to go into the bedroom: the bishop had just breathedhis last.Next day was Easter Sunday. There were forty-two churches and sixmonasteries in the town; the sonorous, joyful clang of the bellshung over the town from morning till night unceasingly, setting thespring air aquiver; the birds were singing, the sun was shiningbrightly. The big market square was noisy, swings were going, barrelorgans were playing, accordions were squeaking, drunken voices wereshouting. After midday people began driving up and down the principalstreet.In short, all was merriment, everything was satisfactory, just asit had been the year before, and as it will be in all likelihoodnext year.A month later a new suffragan bishop was appointed, and no onethought anything more of Bishop Pyotr, and afterwards he wascompletely forgotten. And only the dead man's old mother, who isliving to-day with her son-in-law the deacon in a remote littledistrict town, when she goes out at night to bring her cow in andmeets other women at the pasture, begins talking of her childrenand her grandchildren, and says that she had a son a bishop, andthis she says timidly, afraid that she may not be believed. . . .And, indeed, there are some who do not believe her.THE LETTERThe clerical superintendent of the district, his Reverence FatherFyodor Orlov, a handsome, well-nourished man of fifty, grave andimportant as he always was, with an habitual expression of dignitythat never left his face, was walking to and fro in his littledrawing-room, extremely exhausted, and thinking intensely about thesame thing: "When would his visitor go?" The thought worried himand did not leave him for a minute. The visitor, Father Anastasy,the priest of one of the villages near the town, had come to himthree hours before on some very unpleasant and dreary business ofhis own, had stayed on and on, was now sitting in the corner at alittle round table with his elbow on a thick account book, andapparently had no thought of going, though it was getting on fornine o'clock in the evening.Not everyone knows when to be silent and when to go. It notinfrequently happens that even diplomatic persons of good worldlybreeding fail to observe that their presence is arousing a feelingakin to hatred in their exhausted or busy host, and that this feelingis being concealed with an effort and disguised with a lie. ButFather Anastasy perceived it clearly, and realized that his presencewas burdensome and inappropriate, that his Reverence, who had takenan early morning service in the night and a long mass at midday,was exhausted and longing for repose; every minute he was meaningto get up and go, but he did not get up, he sat on as though hewere waiting for something. He was an old man of sixty-five,prematurely aged, with a bent and bony figure, with a sunken faceand the dark skin of old age, with red eyelids and a long narrowback like a fish's; he was dressed in a smart cassock of a lightlilac colour, but too big for him (presented to him by the widowof a young priest lately deceased), a full cloth coat with a broadleather belt, and clumsy high boots the size and hue of which showedclearly that Father Anastasy dispensed with goloshes. In spite ofhis position and his venerable age, there was something pitiful,crushed and humiliated in his lustreless red eyes, in the strandsof grey hair with a shade of green in it on the nape of his neck,and in the big shoulder-blades on his lean back. . . . He sat withoutspeaking or moving, and coughed with circumspection, as thoughafraid that the sound of his coughing might make his presence morenoticeable.The old man had come to see his Reverence on business. Two monthsbefore he had been prohibited from officiating till further notice,and his case was being inquired into. His shortcomings were numerous.He was intemperate in his habits, fell out with the other clergyand the commune, kept the church records and accounts carelessly--these were the formal charges against him; but besides all that,there had been rumours for a long time past that he celebratedunlawful marriages for money and sold certificates of having fastedand taken the sacrament to officials and officers who came to himfrom the town. These rumours were maintained the more persistentlythat he was poor and had nine children to keep, who were as incompetentand unsuccessful as himself. The sons were spoilt and uneducated,and stayed at home doing nothing, while the daughters were ugly anddid not get married.Not having the moral force to be open, his Reverence walked up anddown the room and said nothing or spoke in hints."So you are not going home to-night?" he asked, stopping near thedark window and poking with his little finger into the cage wherea canary was asleep with its feathers puffed out.Father Anastasy started, coughed cautiously and said rapidly:"Home? I don't care to, Fyodor Ilyitch. I cannot officiate, as youknow, so what am I to do there? I came away on purpose that I mightnot have to look the people in the face. One is ashamed not toofficiate, as you know. Besides, I have business here, FyodorIlyitch. To-morrow after breaking the fast I want to talk thingsover thoroughly with the Father charged with the inquiry.""Ah! . . ." yawned his Reverence, "and where are you staying?""At Zyavkin's."Father Anastasy suddenly remembered that within two hours hisReverence had to take the Easter-night service, and he felt soashamed of his unwelcome burdensome presence that he made up hismind to go away at once and let the exhausted man rest. And the oldman got up to go. But before he began saying good-bye he stoodclearing his throat for a minute and looking searchingly at hisReverence's back, still with the same expression of vague expectationin his whole figure; his face was working with shame, timidity, anda pitiful forced laugh such as one sees in people who do not respectthemselves. Waving his hand as it were resolutely, he said with ahusky quavering laugh:"Father Fyodor, do me one more kindness: bid them give me atleave-taking . . . one little glass of vodka.""It's not the time to drink vodka now," said his Reverence sternly."One must have some regard for decency."Father Anastasy was still more overwhelmed by confusion; he laughed,and, forgetting his resolution to go away, he dropped back on hischair. His Reverence looked at his helpless, embarrassed face andhis bent figure and he felt sorry for the old man."Please God, we will have a drink to-morrow," he said, wishing tosoften his stem refusal. "Everything is good in due season."His Reverence believed in people's reforming, but now when a feelingof pity had been kindled in him it seemed to him that this disgraced,worn-out old man, entangled in a network of sins and weaknesses,was hopelessly wrecked, that there was no power on earth that couldstraighten out his spine, give brightness to his eyes and restrainthe unpleasant timid laugh which he laughed on purpose to smootheover to some slight extent the repulsive impression he made onpeople.The old man seemed now to Father Fyodor not guilty and not vicious,but humiliated, insulted, unfortunate; his Reverence thought of hiswife, his nine children, the dirty beggarly shelter at Zyavkin's;he thought for some reason of the people who are glad to see priestsdrunk and persons in authority detected in crimes; and thought thatthe very best thing Father Anastasy could do now would be to dieas soon as possible and to depart from this world for ever.There were a sound of footsteps."Father Fyodor, you are not resting?" a bass voice asked from thepassage."No, deacon; come in."Orlov's colleague, the deacon Liubimov, an elderly man with a bigbald patch on the top of his head, though his hair was still blackand he was still vigorous-looking, with thick black eyebrows likea Georgian's, walked in. He bowed to Father Anastasy and sat down."What good news have you?" asked his Reverence."What good news?" answered the deacon, and after a pause he wenton with a smile: "When your children are little, your trouble issmall; when your children are big, your trouble is great. Suchgoings on, Father Fyodor, that I don't know what to think of it.It's a regular farce, that's what it is."He paused again for a little, smiled still more broadly and said:"Nikolay Matveyitch came back from Harkov to-day. He has been tellingme about my Pyotr. He has been to see him twice, he tells me.""What has he been telling you, then?""He has upset me, God bless him. He meant to please me but when Icame to think it over, it seems there is not much to be pleased at.I ought to grieve rather than be pleased. . . 'Your Petrushka,'said he, 'lives in fine style. He is far above us now,' said he.'Well thank God for that,' said I. 'I dined with him,' said he,'and saw his whole manner of life. He lives like a gentleman,' hesaid; 'you couldn't wish to live better.' I was naturally interestedand I asked, 'And what did you have for dinner?' 'First,' he said,'a fish course something like fish soup, then tongue and peas,' andthen he said, 'roast turkey.' 'Turkey in Lent? that is somethingto please me,' said I. 'Turkey in Lent? Eh?'""Nothing marvellous in that," said his Reverence, screwing up hiseyes ironically. And sticking both thumbs in his belt, he drewhimself up and said in the tone in which he usually delivereddiscourses or gave his Scripture lessons to the pupils in thedistrict school: "People who do not keep the fasts are divided intotwo different categories: some do not keep them through laxity,others through infidelity. Your Pyotr does not keep them throughinfidelity. Yes."The deacon looked timidly at Father Fyodor's stern face and said:"There is worse to follow. . . . We talked and discussed one thingand another, and it turned out that my infidel of a son is livingwith some madame, another man's wife. She takes the place of wifeand hostess in his flat, pours out the tea, receives visitors andall the rest of it, as though she were his lawful wife. For overtwo years he has been keeping up this dance with this viper. It'sa regular farce. They have been living together for three years andno children.""I suppose they have been living in chastity!" chuckled FatherAnastasy, coughing huskily. "There are children, Father Deacon--there are, but they don't keep them at home! They send them to theFoundling! He-he-he! . . ." Anastasy went on coughing till he choked."Don't interfere, Father Anastasy," said his Reverence sternly."Nikolay Matveyitch asked him, 'What madame is this helping thesoup at your table?'" the deacon went on, gloomily scanningAnastasy's bent figure. "'That is my wife,' said he. 'When wasyour wedding?' Nikolay Matveyitch asked him, and Pyotr answered,'We were married at Kulikov's restaurant.'"His Reverence's eyes flashed wrathfully and the colour came intohis temples. Apart from his sinfulness, Pyotr was not a person heliked. Father Fyodor had, as they say, a grudge against him. Heremembered him a boy at school--he remembered him distinctly,because even then the boy had seemed to him not normal. As aschoolboy, Petrushka had been ashamed to serve at the altar, hadbeen offended at being addressed without ceremony, had not crossedhimself on entering the room, and what was still more noteworthy,was fond of talking a great deal and with heat--and, in FatherFyodor's opinion, much talking was unseemly in children and perniciousto them; moreover Petrushka had taken up a contemptuous and criticalattitude to fishing, a pursuit to which both his Reverence and thedeacon were greatly addicted. As a student Pyotr had not gone tochurch at all, had slept till midday, had looked down on people,and had been given to raising delicate and insoluble questions witha peculiarly provoking zest."What would you have?" his Reverence asked, going up to the deaconand looking at him angrily. "What would you have? This was to beexpected! I always knew and was convinced that nothing good wouldcome of your Pyotr! I told you so, and I tell you so now. What youhave sown, that now you must reap! Reap it!""But what have I sown, Father Fyodor?" the deacon asked softly,looking up at his Reverence."Why, who is to blame if not you? You're his father, he is youroffspring! You ought to have admonished him, have instilled thefear of God into him. A child must be taught! You have brought himinto the world, but you haven't trained him up in the right way.It's a sin! It's wrong! It's a shame!"His Reverence forgot his exhaustion, paced to and fro and went ontalking. Drops of perspiration came out on the deacon's bald headand forehead. He raised his eyes to his Reverence with a look ofguilt, and said:"But didn't I train him, Father Fyodor? Lord have mercy on us,haven't I been a father to my children? You know yourself I sparednothing for his good; I have prayed and done my best all my lifeto give him a thorough education. He went to the high school and Igot him tutors, and he took his degree at the University. And asto my not being able to influence his mind, Father Fyodor, why, youcan judge for yourself that I am not qualified to do so! Sometimeswhen he used to come here as a student, I would begin admonishinghim in my way, and he wouldn't heed me. I'd say to him, 'Go tochurch,' and he would answer, 'What for?' I would begin explaining,and he would say, 'Why? what for?' Or he would slap me on theshoulder and say, 'Everything in this world is relative, approximateand conditional. I don't know anything, and you don't know anythingeither, dad.'"Father Anastasy laughed huskily, cleared his throat and waved hisfingers in the air as though preparing to say something. His Reverenceglanced at him and said sternly:"Don't interfere, Father Anastasy."The old man laughed, beamed, and evidently listened with pleasureto the deacon as though he were glad there were other sinful personsin this world besides himself. The deacon spoke sincerely, with anaching heart, and tears actually came into his eyes. Father Fyodorfelt sorry for him."You are to blame, deacon, you are to blame," he said, but not sosternly and heatedly as before. "If you could beget him, you oughtto know how to instruct him. You ought to have trained him in hischildhood; it's no good trying to correct a student."A silence followed; the deacon clasped his hands and said with asigh:"But you know I shall have to answer for him!""To be sure you will!"After a brief silence his Reverence yawned and sighed at the samemoment and asked:"Who is reading the 'Acts'?""Yevstrat. Yevstrat always reads them."The deacon got up and, looking imploringly at his Reverence, asked:"Father Fyodor, what am I to do now?""Do as you please; you are his father, not I. You ought to knowbest.""I don't know anything, Father Fyodor! Tell me what to do, forgoodness' sake! Would you believe it, I am sick at heart! I can'tsleep now, nor keep quiet, and the holiday will be no holiday tome. Tell me what to do, Father Fyodor!""Write him a letter.""What am I to write to him?""Write that he mustn't go on like that. Write shortly, but sternlyand circumstantially, without softening or smoothing away his guilt.It is your parental duty; if you write, you will have done yourduty and will be at peace.""That's true. But what am I to write to him, to what effect? If Iwrite to him, he will answer, 'Why? what for? Why is it a sin?'"Father Anastasy laughed hoarsely again, and brandished his fingers."Why? what for? why is it a sin?" he began shrilly. "I was onceconfessing a gentleman, and I told him that excessive confidencein the Divine Mercy is a sin; and he asked, 'Why?' I tried to answerhim, but----" Anastasy slapped himself on the forehead. "I hadnothing here. He-he-he-he! . . ."Anastasy's words, his hoarse jangling laugh at what was not laughable,had an unpleasant effect on his Reverence and on the deacon. Theformer was on the point of saying, "Don't interfere" again, but hedid not say it, he only frowned."I can't write to him," sighed the deacon."If you can't, who can?""Father Fyodor!" said the deacon, putting his head on one side andpressing his hand to his heart. "I am an uneducated slow-wittedman, while the Lord has vouchsafed you judgment and wisdom. Youknow everything and understand everything. You can master anything,while I don't know how to put my words together sensibly. Be generous.Instruct me how to write the letter. Teach me what to say and howto say it. . . .""What is there to teach? There is nothing to teach. Sit down andwrite.""Oh, do me the favour, Father Fyodor! I beseech you! I know he willbe frightened and will attend to your letter, because, you see, youare a cultivated man too. Do be so good! I'll sit down, and you'lldictate to me. It will be a sin to write to-morrow, but now wouldbe the very time; my mind would be set at rest."His Reverence looked at the deacon's imploring face, thought of thedisagreeable Pyotr, and consented to dictate. He made the deaconsit down to his table and began."Well, write . . . 'Christ is risen, dear son . . .' exclamationmark. 'Rumours have reached me, your father,' then in parenthesis,'from what source is no concern of yours . . .' close the parenthesis.. . . Have you written it? 'That you are leading a life inconsistentwith the laws both of God and of man. Neither the luxurious comfort,nor the worldly splendour, nor the culture with which you seekoutwardly to disguise it, can hide your heathen manner of life. Inname you are a Christian, but in your real nature a heathen aspitiful and wretched as all other heathens--more wretched, indeed,seeing that those heathens who know not Christ are lost fromignorance, while you are lost in that, possessing a treasure, youneglect it. I will not enumerate here your vices, which you knowwell enough; I will say that I see the cause of your ruin in yourinfidelity. You imagine yourself to be wise, boast of your knowledgeof science, but refuse to see that science without faith, far fromelevating a man, actually degrades him to the level of a loweranimal, inasmuch as. . .'" The whole letter was in this strain.When he had finished writing it the deacon read it aloud, beamedall over and jumped up."It's a gift, it's really a gift!" he said, clasping his hands andlooking enthusiastically at his Reverence. "To think of the Lord'sbestowing a gift like that! Eh? Holy Mother! I do believe I couldn'twrite a letter like that in a hundred years. Lord save you!"Father Anastasy was enthusiastic too."One couldn't write like that without a gift," he said, getting upand wagging his fingers--"that one couldn't! His rhetoric wouldtrip any philosopher and shut him up. Intellect. Brilliant intellect!If you weren't married, Father Fyodor, you would have been a bishoplong ago, you would really!"Having vented his wrath in a letter, his Reverence felt relieved;his fatigue and exhaustion came back to him. The deacon was an oldfriend, and his Reverence did not hesitate to say to him:"Well deacon, go, and God bless you. I'll have half an hour's napon the sofa; I must rest."The deacon went away and took Anastasy with him. As is always thecase on Easter Eve, it was dark in the street, but the whole skywas sparkling with bright luminous stars. There was a scent ofspring and holiday in the soft still air."How long was he dictating?" the deacon said admiringly. "Tenminutes, not more! It would have taken someone else a month tocompose such a letter. Eh! What a mind! Such a mind that I don'tknow what to call it! It's a marvel! It's really a marvel!""Education!" sighed Anastasy as he crossed the muddy street; holdingup his cassock to his waist. "It's not for us to compare ourselveswith him. We come of the sacristan class, while he has had a learnededucation. Yes, he's a real man, there is no denying that.""And you listen how he'll read the Gospel in Latin at mass to-day!He knows Latin and he knows Greek. . . . Ah Petrushka, Petrushka!"the deacon said, suddenly remembering. "Now that will make himscratch his head! That will shut his mouth, that will bring it hometo him! Now he won't ask 'Why.' It is a case of one wit to outwitanother! Haha-ha!"The deacon laughed gaily and loudly. Since the letter had beenwritten to Pyotr he had become serene and more cheerful. Theconsciousness of having performed his duty as a father and his faithin the power of the letter had brought back his mirthfulness andgood-humour."Pyotr means a stone," said he, as he went into his house. "My Pyotris not a stone, but a rag. A viper has fastened upon him and hepampers her, and hasn't the pluck to kick her out. Tfoo! To thinkthere should be women like that, God forgive me! Eh? Has she noshame? She has fastened upon the lad, sticking to him, and keepshim tied to her apron strings. . . . Fie upon her!""Perhaps it's not she keeps hold of him, but he of her?""She is a shameless one anyway! Not that I am defending Pyotr. . . .He'll catch it. He'll read the letter and scratch his head! He'llburn with shame!""It's a splendid letter, only you know I wouldn't send it, FatherDeacon. Let him alone.""What?" said the deacon, disconcerted."Why. . . . Don't send it, deacon! What's the sense of it? Supposeyou send it; he reads it, and . . . and what then? You'll only upsethim. Forgive him. Let him alone!"The deacon looked in surprise at Anastasy's dark face, at hisunbuttoned cassock, which looked in the dusk like wings, and shruggedhis shoulders."How can I forgive him like that?" he asked. "Why I shall have toanswer for him to God!""Even so, forgive him all the same. Really! And God will forgiveyou for your kindness to him.""But he is my son, isn't he? Ought I not to teach him?""Teach him? Of course--why not? You can teach him, but why callhim a heathen? It will hurt his feelings, you know, deacon. . . ."The deacon was a widower, and lived in a little house with threewindows. His elder sister, an old maid, looked after his house forhim, though she had three years before lost the use of her legs andwas confined to her bed; he was afraid of her, obeyed her, and didnothing without her advice. Father Anastasy went in with him. Seeinghis table already laid with Easter cakes and red eggs, he beganweeping for some reason, probably thinking of his own home, and toturn these tears into a jest, he at once laughed huskily."Yes, we shall soon be breaking the fast," he said. "Yes . . . itwouldn't come amiss, deacon, to have a little glass now. Can we?I'll drink it so that the old lady does not hear," he whispered,glancing sideways towards the door.Without a word the deacon moved a decanter and wineglass towardshim. He unfolded the letter and began reading it aloud. And now theletter pleased him just as much as when his Reverence had dictatedit to him. He beamed with pleasure and wagged his head, as thoughhe had been tasting something very sweet."A-ah, what a letter!" he said. "Petrushka has never dreamt of sucha letter. It's just what he wants, something to throw him into afever. . .""Do you know, deacon, don't send it!" said Anastasy, pouring himselfout a second glass of vodka as though unconsciously. "Forgive him,let him alone! I am telling you . . . what I really think. If hisown father can't forgive him, who will forgive him? And so he'lllive without forgiveness. Think, deacon: there will be plenty tochastise him without you, but you should look out for some who willshow mercy to your son! I'll . . . I'll . . . have just one more.The last, old man. . . . Just sit down and write straight off tohim, 'I forgive you Pyotr!' He will under-sta-and! He will fe-elit! I understand it from myself, you see old man . . . deacon, Imean. When I lived like other people, I hadn't much to troubleabout, but now since I lost the image and semblance, there is onlyone thing I care about, that good people should forgive me. Andremember, too, it's not the righteous but sinners we must forgive.Why should you forgive your old woman if she is not sinful? No, youmust forgive a man when he is a sad sight to look at . . . yes!"Anastasy leaned his head on his fist and sank into thought."It's a terrible thing, deacon," he sighed, evidently strugglingwith the desire to take another glass--"a terrible thing! In sinmy mother bore me, in sin I have lived, in sin I shall die. . . .God forgive me, a sinner! I have gone astray, deacon! There is nosalvation for me! And it's not as though I had gone astray in mylife, but in old age--at death's door . . . I . . ."The old man, with a hopeless gesture, drank off another glass, thengot up and moved to another seat. The deacon, still keeping theletter in his hand, was walking up and down the room. He was thinkingof his son. Displeasure, distress and anxiety no longer troubledhim; all that had gone into the letter. Now he was simply picturingPyotr; he imagined his face, he thought of the past years when hisson used to come to stay with him for the holidays. His thoughtswere only of what was good, warm, touching, of which one might thinkfor a whole lifetime without wearying. Longing for his son, he readthe letter through once more and looked questioningly at Anastasy."Don't send it," said the latter, with a wave of his hand."No, I must send it anyway; I must . . . bring him to his senses alittle, all the same. It's just as well. . . ."The deacon took an envelope from the table, but before putting theletter into it he sat down to the table, smiled and added on hisown account at the bottom of the letter:"They have sent us a new inspector. He's much friskier than the oldone. He's a great one for dancing and talking, and there's nothinghe can't do, so that all the Govorovsky girls are crazy over him.Our military chief, Kostyrev, will soon get the sack too, they say.High time he did!" And very well pleased, without the faintest ideathat with this postscript he had completely spoiled the stern letter,the deacon addressed the envelope and laid it in the most conspicuousplace on the table.EASTER EVEI was standing on the bank of the River Goltva, waiting for theferry-boat from the other side. At ordinary times the Goltva is ahumble stream of moderate size, silent and pensive, gently glimmeringfrom behind thick reeds; but now a regular lake lay stretched outbefore me. The waters of spring, running riot, had overflowed bothbanks and flooded both sides of the river for a long distance,submerging vegetable gardens, hayfields and marshes, so that it wasno unusual thing to meet poplars and bushes sticking out above thesurface of the water and looking in the darkness like grim solitarycrags.The weather seemed to me magnificent. It was dark, yet I could seethe trees, the water and the people. . . . The world was lightedby the stars, which were scattered thickly all over the sky. I don'tremember ever seeing so many stars. Literally one could not haveput a finger in between them. There were some as big as a goose'segg, others tiny as hempseed. . . . They had come out for thefestival procession, every one of them, little and big, washed,renewed and joyful, and everyone of them was softly twinkling itsbeams. The sky was reflected in the water; the stars were bathingin its dark depths and trembling with the quivering eddies. The airwas warm and still. . . . Here and there, far away on the furtherbank in the impenetrable darkness, several bright red lights weregleaming. . . .A couple of paces from me I saw the dark silhouette of a peasantin a high hat, with a thick knotted stick in his hand."How long the ferry-boat is in coming!" I said."It is time it was here," the silhouette answered."You are waiting for the ferry-boat, too?""No I am not," yawned the peasant--"I am waiting for the illumination.I should have gone, but to tell you the truth, I haven't the fivekopecks for the ferry.""I'll give you the five kopecks.""No; I humbly thank you. . . . With that five kopecks put up acandle for me over there in the monastery. . . . That will be moreinteresting, and I will stand here. What can it mean, no ferry-boat,as though it had sunk in the water!"The peasant went up to the water's edge, took the rope in his hands,and shouted; "Ieronim! Ieron--im!"As though in answer to his shout, the slow peal of a great bellfloated across from the further bank. The note was deep and low,as from the thickest string of a double bass; it seemed as thoughthe darkness itself had hoarsely uttered it. At once there was thesound of a cannon shot. It rolled away in the darkness and endedsomewhere in the far distance behind me. The peasant took off hishat and crossed himself.'"Christ is risen," he said.Before the vibrations of the first peal of the bell had time to dieaway in the air a second sounded, after it at once a third, and thedarkness was filled with an unbroken quivering clamour. Near thered lights fresh lights flashed, and all began moving together andtwinkling restlessly."Ieron--im!" we heard a hollow prolonged shout."They are shouting from the other bank," said the peasant, "so thereis no ferry there either. Our Ieronim has gone to sleep."The lights and the velvety chimes of the bell drew one towards them.. . . I was already beginning to lose patience and grow anxious,but behold at last, staring into the dark distance, I saw the outlineof something very much like a gibbet. It was the long-expectedferry. It moved towards us with such deliberation that if it hadnot been that its lines grew gradually more definite, one mighthave supposed that it was standing still or moving to the otherbank."Make haste! Ieronim!" shouted my peasant. "The gentleman's tiredof waiting!"The ferry crawled to the bank, gave a lurch and stopped with acreak. A tall man in a monk's cassock and a conical cap stood onit, holding the rope."Why have you been so long?" I asked jumping upon the ferry."Forgive me, for Christ's sake," Ieronim answered gently. "Is thereno one else?""No one. . . ."Ieronim took hold of the rope in both hands, bent himself to thefigure of a mark of interrogation, and gasped. The ferry-boat creakedand gave a lurch. The outline of the peasant in the high hat beganslowly retreating from me--so the ferry was moving off. Ieronimsoon drew himself up and began working with one hand only. We weresilent, gazing towards the bank to which we were floating. Therethe illumination for which the peasant was waiting had begun. Atthe water's edge barrels of tar were flaring like huge camp fires.Their reflections, crimson as the rising moon, crept to meet us inlong broad streaks. The burning barrels lighted up their own smokeand the long shadows of men flitting about the fire; but furtherto one side and behind them from where the velvety chime floatedthere was still the same unbroken black gloom. All at once, cleavingthe darkness, a rocket zigzagged in a golden ribbon up the sky; itdescribed an arc and, as though broken to pieces against the sky,was scattered crackling into sparks. There was a roar from the banklike a far-away hurrah."How beautiful!" I said."Beautiful beyond words!" sighed Ieronim. "Such a night, sir! Anothertime one would pay no attention to the fireworks, but to-day onerejoices in every vanity. Where do you come from?"I told him where I came from."To be sure . . . a joyful day to-day. . . ." Ieronim went on in aweak sighing tenor like the voice of a convalescent. "The sky isrejoicing and the earth and what is under the earth. All the creaturesare keeping holiday. Only tell me kind sir, why, even in the timeof great rejoicing, a man cannot forget his sorrows?"I fancied that this unexpected question was to draw me into one ofthose endless religious conversations which bored and idle monksare so fond of. I was not disposed to talk much, and so I onlyasked:"What sorrows have you, father?""As a rule only the same as all men, kind sir, but to-day a specialsorrow has happened in the monastery: at mass, during the readingof the Bible, the monk and deacon Nikolay died.""Well, it's God's will!" I said, falling into the monastic tone."We must all die. To my mind, you ought to rejoice indeed. . . .They say if anyone dies at Easter he goes straight to the kingdomof heaven.""That's true."We sank into silence. The figure of the peasant in the high hatmelted into the lines of the bank. The tar barrels were flaring upmore and more."The Holy Scripture points clearly to the vanity of sorrow and sodoes reflection," said Ieronim, breaking the silence, "but why doesthe heart grieve and refuse to listen to reason? Why does one wantto weep bitterly?"Ieronim shrugged his shoulders, turned to me and said quickly:"If I died, or anyone else, it would not be worth notice perhaps;but, you see, Nikolay is dead! No one else but Nikolay! Indeed,it's hard to believe that he is no more! I stand here on my ferry-boatand every minute I keep fancying that he will lift up his voicefrom the bank. He always used to come to the bank and call to methat I might not be afraid on the ferry. He used to get up from hisbed at night on purpose for that. He was a kind soul. My God! howkindly and gracious! Many a mother is not so good to her child asNikolay was to me! Lord, save his soul!"Ieronim took hold of the rope, but turned to me again at once."And such a lofty intelligence, your honour," he said in a vibratingvoice. "Such a sweet and harmonious tongue! Just as they will singimmediately at early matins: 'Oh lovely! oh sweet is Thy Voice!'Besides all other human qualities, he had, too, an extraordinarygift!""What gift?" I asked.The monk scrutinized me, and as though he had convinced himselfthat he could trust me with a secret, he laughed good-humouredly."He had a gift for writing hymns of praise," he said. "It was amarvel, sir; you couldn't call it anything else! You would be amazedif I tell you about it. Our Father Archimandrite comes from Moscow,the Father Sub-Prior studied at the Kazan academy, we have wisemonks and elders, but, would you believe it, no one could writethem; while Nikolay, a simple monk, a deacon, had not studiedanywhere, and had not even any outer appearance of it, but he wrotethem! A marvel! A real marvel!" Ieronim clasped his hands and,completely forgetting the rope, went on eagerly:"The Father Sub-Prior has great difficulty in composing sermons;when he wrote the history of the monastery he worried all thebrotherhood and drove a dozen times to town, while Nikolay wrotecanticles! Hymns of praise! That's a very different thing from asermon or a history!""Is it difficult to write them?" I asked."There's great difficulty!" Ieronim wagged his head. "You can donothing by wisdom and holiness if God has not given you the gift.The monks who don't understand argue that you only need to know thelife of the saint for whom you are writing the hymn, and to makeit harmonize with the other hymns of praise. But that's a mistake,sir. Of course, anyone who writes canticles must know the life ofthe saint to perfection, to the least trivial detail. To be sure,one must make them harmonize with the other canticles and know whereto begin and what to write about. To give you an instance, the firstresponse begins everywhere with 'the chosen' or 'the elect.' . . .The first line must always begin with the 'angel.' In the canticleof praise to Jesus the Most Sweet, if you are interested in thesubject, it begins like this: 'Of angels Creator and Lord of allpowers!' In the canticle to the Holy Mother of God: 'Of angels theforemost sent down from on high,' to Nikolay, the Wonder-worker--'An angel in semblance, though in substance a man,' and so on.Everywhere you begin with the angel. Of course, it would be impossiblewithout making them harmonize, but the lives of the saints andconformity with the others is not what matters; what matters is thebeauty and sweetness of it. Everything must be harmonious, briefand complete. There must be in every line softness, graciousnessand tenderness; not one word should be harsh or rough or unsuitable.It must be written so that the worshipper may rejoice at heart andweep, while his mind is stirred and he is thrown into a tremor. Inthe canticle to the Holy Mother are the words: 'Rejoice, O Thou toohigh for human thought to reach! Rejoice, O Thou too deep for angels'eyes to fathom!' In another place in the same canticle: 'Rejoice,O tree that bearest the fair fruit of light that is the food of thefaithful! Rejoice, O tree of gracious spreading shade, under whichthere is shelter for multitudes!'"Ieronim hid his face in his hands, as though frightened at somethingor overcome with shame, and shook his head."Tree that bearest the fair fruit of light . . . tree of graciousspreading shade. . . ." he muttered. "To think that a man shouldfind words like those! Such a power is a gift from God! For brevityhe packs many thoughts into one phrase, and how smooth and completeit all is! 'Light-radiating torch to all that be . . .' comes inthe canticle to Jesus the Most Sweet. 'Light-radiating!' There isno such word in conversation or in books, but you see he inventedit, he found it in his mind! Apart from the smoothness and grandeurof language, sir, every line must be beautified in every way, theremust be flowers and lightning and wind and sun and all the objectsof the visible world. And every exclamation ought to be put so asto be smooth and easy for the ear. 'Rejoice, thou flower of heavenlygrowth!' comes in the hymn to Nikolay the Wonder-worker. It's notsimply 'heavenly flower,' but 'flower of heavenly growth.' It'ssmoother so and sweet to the ear. That was just as Nikolay wroteit! Exactly like that! I can't tell you how he used to write!""Well, in that case it is a pity he is dead," I said; "but let usget on, father, or we shall be late."Ieronim started and ran to the rope; they were beginning to pealall the bells. Probably the procession was already going on nearthe monastery, for all the dark space behind the tar barrels wasnow dotted with moving lights."Did Nikolay print his hymns?" I asked Ieronim."How could he print them?" he sighed. "And indeed, it would bestrange to print them. What would be the object? No one in themonastery takes any interest in them. They don't like them. Theyknew Nikolay wrote them, but they let it pass unnoticed. No oneesteems new writings nowadays, sir!""Were they prejudiced against him?""Yes, indeed. If Nikolay had been an elder perhaps the brethrenwould have been interested, but he wasn't forty, you know. Therewere some who laughed and even thought his writing a sin.""What did he write them for?""Chiefly for his own comfort. Of all the brotherhood, I was theonly one who read his hymns. I used to go to him in secret, thatno one else might know of it, and he was glad that I took an interestin them. He would embrace me, stroke my head, speak to me in caressingwords as to a little child. He would shut his cell, make me sitdown beside him, and begin to read. . . ."Ieronim left the rope and came up to me."We were dear friends in a way," he whispered, looking at me withshining eyes. "Where he went I would go. If I were not there hewould miss me. And he cared more for me than for anyone, and allbecause I used to weep over his hymns. It makes me sad to remember.Now I feel just like an orphan or a widow. You know, in our monasterythey are all good people, kind and pious, but . . . there is no onewith softness and refinement, they are just like peasants. They allspeak loudly, and tramp heavily when they walk; they are noisy,they clear their throats, but Nikolay always talked softly,caressingly, and if he noticed that anyone was asleep or prayinghe would slip by like a fly or a gnat. His face was tender,compassionate. . . ."Ieronim heaved a deep sigh and took hold of the rope again. We wereby now approaching the bank. We floated straight out of the darknessand stillness of the river into an enchanted realm, full of stiflingsmoke, crackling lights and uproar. By now one could distinctly seepeople moving near the tar barrels. The flickering of the lightsgave a strange, almost fantastic, expression to their figures andred faces. From time to time one caught among the heads and facesa glimpse of a horse's head motionless as though cast in copper."They'll begin singing the Easter hymn directly, . . ." said Ieronim,"and Nikolay is gone; there is no one to appreciate it. . . . Therewas nothing written dearer to him than that hymn. He used to takein every word! You'll be there, sir, so notice what is sung; ittakes your breath away!""Won't you be in church, then?""I can't; . . . I have to work the ferry. . . .""But won't they relieve you?""I don't know. . . . I ought to have been relieved at eight; but,as you see, they don't come! . . . And I must own I should have likedto be in the church. . . .""Are you a monk?""Yes . . . that is, I am a lay-brother."The ferry ran into the bank and stopped. I thrust a five-kopeckpiece into Ieronim's hand for taking me across and jumped on land.Immediately a cart with a boy and a sleeping woman in it drovecreaking onto the ferry. Ieronim, with a faint glow from the lightson his figure, pressed on the rope, bent down to it, and startedthe ferry back. . . .I took a few steps through mud, but a little farther walked on asoft freshly trodden path. This path led to the dark monasterygates, that looked like a cavern through a cloud of smoke, througha disorderly crowd of people, unharnessed horses, carts and chaises.All this crowd was rattling, snorting, laughing, and the crimsonlight and wavering shadows from the smoke flickered over it all. . . . A perfect chaos! And in this hubbub the people yet found roomto load a little cannon and to sell cakes. There was no less commotionon the other side of the wall in the monastery precincts, but therewas more regard for decorum and order. Here there was a smell ofjuniper and incense. They talked loudly, but there was no sound oflaughter or snorting. Near the tombstones and crosses people pressedclose to one another with Easter cakes and bundles in their arms.Apparently many had come from a long distance for their cakes tobe blessed and now were exhausted. Young lay brothers, making ametallic sound with their boots, ran busily along the iron slabsthat paved the way from the monastery gates to the church door.They were busy and shouting on the belfry, too."What a restless night!" I thought. "How nice!"One was tempted to see the same unrest and sleeplessness in allnature, from the night darkness to the iron slabs, the crosses onthe tombs and the trees under which the people were moving to andfro. But nowhere was the excitement and restlessness so marked asin the church. An unceasing struggle was going on in the entrancebetween the inflowing stream and the outflowing stream. Some weregoing in, others going out and soon coming back again to stand stillfor a little and begin moving again. People were scurrying fromplace to place, lounging about as though they were looking forsomething. The stream flowed from the entrance all round the church,disturbing even the front rows, where persons of weight and dignitywere standing. There could be no thought of concentrated prayer.There were no prayers at all, but a sort of continuous, childishlyirresponsible joy, seeking a pretext to break out and vent itselfin some movement, even in senseless jostling and shoving.The same unaccustomed movement is striking in the Easter serviceitself. The altar gates are flung wide open, thick clouds of incensefloat in the air near the candelabra; wherever one looks there arelights, the gleam and splutter of candles. . . . There is no reading;restless and lighthearted singing goes on to the end without ceasing.After each hymn the clergy change their vestments and come out toburn the incense, which is repeated every ten minutes.I had no sooner taken a place, when a wave rushed from in front andforced me back. A tall thick-set deacon walked before me with along red candle; the grey-headed archimandrite in his golden mitrehurried after him with the censer. When they had vanished from sightthe crowd squeezed me back to my former position. But ten minuteshad not passed before a new wave burst on me, and again the deaconappeared. This time he was followed by the Father Sub-Prior, theman who, as Ieronim had told me, was writing the history of themonastery.As I mingled with the crowd and caught the infection of the universaljoyful excitement, I felt unbearably sore on Ieronim's account. Whydid they not send someone to relieve him? Why could not someone ofless feeling and less susceptibility go on the ferry? 'Lift up thineeyes, O Sion, and look around,' they sang in the choir, 'for thychildren have come to thee as to a beacon of divine light from northand south, and from east and from the sea. . . .'I looked at the faces; they all had a lively expression of triumph,but not one was listening to what was being sung and taking it in,and not one was 'holding his breath.' Why was not Ieronim released?I could fancy Ieronim standing meekly somewhere by the wall, bendingforward and hungrily drinking in the beauty of the holy phrase. Allthis that glided by the ears of the people standing by me he wouldhave eagerly drunk in with his delicately sensitive soul, and wouldhave been spell-bound to ecstasy, to holding his breath, and therewould not have been a man happier than he in all the church. Nowhe was plying to and fro over the dark river and grieving for hisdead friend and brother.The wave surged back. A stout smiling monk, playing with his rosaryand looking round behind him, squeezed sideways by me, making wayfor a lady in a hat and velvet cloak. A monastery servant hurriedafter the lady, holding a chair over our heads.I came out of the church. I wanted to have a look at the deadNikolay, the unknown canticle writer. I walked about the monasterywall, where there was a row of cells, peeped into several windows,and, seeing nothing, came back again. I do not regret now that Idid not see Nikolay; God knows, perhaps if I had seen him I shouldhave lost the picture my imagination paints for me now. I imaginethe lovable poetical figure solitary and not understood, who wentout at nights to call to Ieronim over the water, and filled hishymns with flowers, stars and sunbeams, as a pale timid man withsoft mild melancholy features. His eyes must have shone, not onlywith intelligence, but with kindly tenderness and that hardlyrestrained childlike enthusiasm which I could hear in Ieronim'svoice when he quoted to me passages from the hymns.When we came out of church after mass it was no longer night. Themorning was beginning. The stars had gone out and the sky was amorose greyish blue. The iron slabs, the tombstones and the budson the trees were covered with dew There was a sharp freshness inthe air. Outside the precincts I did not find the same animatedscene as I had beheld in the night. Horses and men looked exhausted,drowsy, scarcely moved, while nothing was left of the tar barrelsbut heaps of black ash. When anyone is exhausted and sleepy hefancies that nature, too, is in the same condition. It seemed tome that the trees and the young grass were asleep. It seemed asthough even the bells were not pealing so loudly and gaily as atnight. The restlessness was over, and of the excitement nothing wasleft but a pleasant weariness, a longing for sleep and warmth.Now I could see both banks of the river; a faint mist hovered overit in shifting masses. There was a harsh cold breath from the water.When I jumped on to the ferry, a chaise and some two dozen men andwomen were standing on it already. The rope, wet and as I fancieddrowsy, stretched far away across the broad river and in placesdisappeared in the white mist."Christ is risen! Is there no one else?" asked a soft voice.I recognized the voice of Ieronim. There was no darkness now tohinder me from seeing the monk. He was a tall narrow-shouldered manof five-and-thirty, with large rounded features, with half-closedlistless-looking eyes and an unkempt wedge-shaped beard. He had anextraordinarily sad and exhausted look."They have not relieved you yet?" I asked in surprise."Me?" he answered, turning to me his chilled and dewy face with asmile. "There is no one to take my place now till morning. They'llall be going to the Father Archimandrite's to break the fastdirectly."With the help of a little peasant in a hat of reddish fur thatlooked like the little wooden tubs in which honey is sold, he threwhis weight on the rope; they gasped simultaneously, and the ferrystarted.We floated across, disturbing on the way the lazily rising mist.Everyone was silent. Ieronim worked mechanically with one hand. Heslowly passed his mild lustreless eyes over us; then his glancerested on the rosy face of a young merchant's wife with blackeyebrows, who was standing on the ferry beside me silently shrinkingfrom the mist that wrapped her about. He did not take his eyes offher face all the way.There was little that was masculine in that prolonged gaze. Itseemed to me that Ieronim was looking in the woman's face for thesoft and tender features of his dead friend.A NIGHTMAREKunin, a young man of thirty, who was a permanent member of theRural Board, on returning from Petersburg to his district, Borisovo,immediately sent a mounted messenger to Sinkino, for the priestthere, Father Yakov Smirnov.Five hours later Father Yakov appeared."Very glad to make your acquaintance," said Kunin, meeting him inthe entry. "I've been living and serving here for a year; it seemsas though we ought to have been acquainted before. You are verywelcome! But . . . how young you are!" Kunin added in surprise."What is your age?""Twenty-eight, . . ." said Father Yakov, faintly pressing Kunin'soutstretched hand, and for some reason turning crimson.Kunin led his visitor into his study and began looking at him moreattentively."What an uncouth womanish face!" he thought.There certainly was a good deal that was womanish in Father Yakov'sface: the turned-up nose, the bright red cheeks, and the largegrey-blue eyes with scanty, scarcely perceptible eyebrows. His longreddish hair, smooth and dry, hung down in straight tails on to hisshoulders. The hair on his upper lip was only just beginning toform into a real masculine moustache, while his little beard belongedto that class of good-for-nothing beards which among divinitystudents are for some reason called "ticklers." It was scanty andextremely transparent; it could not have been stroked or combed,it could only have been pinched. . . . All these scanty decorationswere put on unevenly in tufts, as though Father Yakov, thinking todress up as a priest and beginning to gum on the beard, had beeninterrupted halfway through. He had on a cassock, the colour ofweak coffee with chicory in it, with big patches on both elbows."A queer type," thought Kunin, looking at his muddy skirts. "Comesto the house for the first time and can't dress decently."Sit down, Father," he began more carelessly than cordially, as hemoved an easy-chair to the table. "Sit down, I beg you."Father Yakov coughed into his fist, sank awkwardly on to the edgeof the chair, and laid his open hands on his knees. With his shortfigure, his narrow chest, his red and perspiring face, he made fromthe first moment a most unpleasant impression on Kunin. The lattercould never have imagined that there were such undignified andpitiful-looking priests in Russia; and in Father Yakov's attitude,in the way he held his hands on his knees and sat on the very edgeof his chair, he saw a lack of dignity and even a shade of servility."I have invited you on business, Father. . . ." Kunin began, sinkingback in his low chair. "It has fallen to my lot to perform theagreeable duty of helping you in one of your useful undertakings.. . . On coming back from Petersburg, I found on my table a letterfrom the Marshal of Nobility. Yegor Dmitrevitch suggests that Ishould take under my supervision the church parish school which isbeing opened in Sinkino. I shall be very glad to, Father, with allmy heart. . . . More than that, I accept the proposition withenthusiasm."Kunin got up and walked about the study."Of course, both Yegor Dmitrevitch and probably you, too, are awarethat I have not great funds at my disposal. My estate is mortgaged,and I live exclusively on my salary as the permanent member. Sothat you cannot reckon on very much assistance, but I will do allthat is in my power. . . . And when are you thinking of opening theschool Father?""When we have the money, . . ." answered Father Yakov."You have some funds at your disposal already?""Scarcely any. . . . The peasants settled at their meeting thatthey would pay, every man of them, thirty kopecks a year; but that'sonly a promise, you know! And for the first beginning we shouldneed at least two hundred roubles. . . .""M'yes. . . . Unhappily, I have not that sum now," said Kunin witha sigh. "I spent all I had on my tour and got into debt, too. Letus try and think of some plan together."Kunin began planning aloud. He explained his views and watchedFather Yakov's face, seeking signs of agreement or approval in it.But the face was apathetic and immobile, and expressed nothing butconstrained shyness and uneasiness. Looking at it, one might havesupposed that Kunin was talking of matters so abstruse that FatherYakov did not understand and only listened from good manners, andwas at the same time afraid of being detected in his failure tounderstand."The fellow is not one of the brightest, that's evident . . ."thought Kunin. "He's rather shy and much too stupid."Father Yakov revived somewhat and even smiled only when the footmancame into the study bringing in two glasses of tea on a tray and acake-basket full of biscuits. He took his glass and began drinkingat once."Shouldn't we write at once to the bishop?" Kunin went on, meditatingaloud. "To be precise, you know, it is not we, not the Zemstvo, butthe higher ecclesiastical authorities, who have raised the questionof the church parish schools. They ought really to apportion thefunds. I remember I read that a sum of money had been set aside forthe purpose. Do you know nothing about it?"Father Yakov was so absorbed in drinking tea that he did not answerthis question at once. He lifted his grey-blue eyes to Kunin, thoughta moment, and as though recalling his question, he shook his headin the negative. An expression of pleasure and of the most ordinaryprosaic appetite overspread his face from ear to ear. He drank andsmacked his lips over every gulp. When he had drunk it to the verylast drop, he put his glass on the table, then took his glass backagain, looked at the bottom of it, then put it back again. Theexpression of pleasure faded from his face. . . . Then Kunin sawhis visitor take a biscuit from the cake-basket, nibble a littlebit off it, then turn it over in his hand and hurriedly stick itin his pocket."Well, that's not at all clerical!" thought Kunin, shrugging hisshoulders contemptuously. "What is it, priestly greed or childishness?"After giving his visitor another glass of tea and seeing him to theentry, Kunin lay down on the sofa and abandoned himself to theunpleasant feeling induced in him by the visit of Father Yakov."What a strange wild creature!" he thought. "Dirty, untidy, coarse,stupid, and probably he drinks. . . . My God, and that's a priest,a spiritual father! That's a teacher of the people! I can fancy theirony there must be in the deacon's face when before every mass hebooms out: 'Thy blessing, Reverend Father!' A fine reverend Father!A reverend Father without a grain of dignity or breeding, hidingbiscuits in his pocket like a schoolboy. . . . Fie! Good Lord, wherewere the bishop's eyes when he ordained a man like that? What canhe think of the people if he gives them a teacher like that? Onewants people here who . . ."And Kunin thought what Russian priests ought to be like."If I were a priest, for instance. . . . An educated priest fondof his work might do a great deal. . . . I should have had theschool opened long ago. And the sermons? If the priest is sincereand is inspired by love for his work, what wonderful rousing sermonshe might give!"Kunin shut his eyes and began mentally composing a sermon. A littlelater he sat down to the table and rapidly began writing."I'll give it to that red-haired fellow, let him read it in church,. . ." he thought.The following Sunday Kunin drove over to Sinkino in the morning tosettle the question of the school, and while he was there to makeacquaintance with the church of which he was a parishioner. In spiteof the awful state of the roads, it was a glorious morning. The sunwas shining brightly and cleaving with its rays the layers of whitesnow still lingering here and there. The snow as it took leave ofthe earth glittered with such diamonds that it hurt the eyes tolook, while the young winter corn was hastily thrusting up its greenbeside it. The rooks floated with dignity over the fields. A rookwould fly, drop to earth, and give several hops before standingfirmly on its feet. . . .The wooden church up to which Kunin drove was old and grey; thecolumns of the porch had once been painted white, but the colourhad now completely peeled off, and they looked like two ungainlyshafts. The ikon over the door looked like a dark smudged blur. Butits poverty touched and softened Kunin. Modestly dropping his eyes,he went into the church and stood by the door. The service had onlyjust begun. An old sacristan, bent into a bow, was reading the"Hours" in a hollow indistinct tenor. Father Yakov, who conductedthe service without a deacon, was walking about the church, burningincense. Had it not been for the softened mood in which Kunin foundhimself on entering the poverty-stricken church, he certainly wouldhave smiled at the sight of Father Yakov. The short priest waswearing a crumpled and extremely long robe of some shabby yellowmaterial; the hem of the robe trailed on the ground.The church was not full. Looking at the parishioners, Kunin wasstruck at the first glance by one strange circumstance: he sawnothing but old people and children. . . . Where were the men ofworking age? Where was the youth and manhood? But after he had stoodthere a little and looked more attentively at the aged-lookingfaces, Kunin saw that he had mistaken young people for old. He didnot, however, attach any significance to this little optical illusion.The church was as cold and grey inside as outside. There was notone spot on the ikons nor on the dark brown walls which was notbegrimed and defaced by time. There were many windows, but thegeneral effect of colour was grey, and so it was twilight in thechurch."Anyone pure in soul can pray here very well," thought Kunin. "Justas in St. Peter's in Rome one is impressed by grandeur, here oneis touched by the lowliness and simplicity."But his devout mood vanished like smoke as soon as Father Yakovwent up to the altar and began mass. Being still young and havingcome straight from the seminary bench to the priesthood, FatherYakov had not yet formed a set manner of celebrating the service.As he read he seemed to be vacillating between a high tenor and athin bass; he bowed clumsily, walked quickly, and opened and shutthe gates abruptly. . . . The old sacristan, evidently deaf andailing, did not hear the prayers very distinctly, and this veryoften led to slight misunderstandings. Before Father Yakov had timeto finish what he had to say, the sacristan began chanting hisresponse, or else long after Father Yakov had finished the old manwould be straining his ears, listening in the direction of the altarand saying nothing till his skirt was pulled. The old man had asickly hollow voice and an asthmatic quavering lisp. . . . Thecomplete lack of dignity and decorum was emphasized by a very smallboy who seconded the sacristan and whose head was hardly visibleover the railing of the choir. The boy sang in a shrill falsettoand seemed to be trying to avoid singing in tune. Kunin stayed alittle while, listened and went out for a smoke. He was disappointed,and looked at the grey church almost with dislike."They complain of the decline of religious feeling among the people. . ." he sighed. "I should rather think so! They'd better foist afew more priests like this one on them!"Kunin went back into the church three times, and each time he felta great temptation to get out into the open air again. Waiting tillthe end of the mass, he went to Father Yakov's. The priest's housedid not differ outwardly from the peasants' huts, but the thatchlay more smoothly on the roof and there were little white curtainsin the windows. Father Yakov led Kunin into a light little roomwith a clay floor and walls covered with cheap paper; in spite ofsome painful efforts towards luxury in the way of photographs inframes and a clock with a pair of scissors hanging on the weightthe furnishing of the room impressed him by its scantiness. Lookingat the furniture, one might have supposed that Father Yakov hadgone from house to house and collected it in bits; in one placethey had given him a round three-legged table, in another a stool,in a third a chair with a back bent violently backwards; in a fourtha chair with an upright back, but the seat smashed in; while in afifth they had been liberal and given him a semblance of a sofawith a flat back and a lattice-work seat. This semblance had beenpainted dark red and smelt strongly of paint. Kunin meant at firstto sit down on one of the chairs, but on second thoughts he satdown on the stool."This is the first time you have been to our church?" asked FatherYakov, hanging his hat on a huge misshapen nail."Yes it is. I tell you what, Father, before we begin on business,will you give me some tea? My soul is parched."Father Yakov blinked, gasped, and went behind the partition wall.There was a sound of whispering."With his wife, I suppose," thought Kunin; "it would be interestingto see what the red-headed fellow's wife is like."A little later Father Yakov came back, red and perspiring and withan effort to smile, sat down on the edge of the sofa."They will heat the samovar directly," he said, without looking athis visitor."My goodness, they have not heated the samovar yet!" Kunin thoughtwith horror. "A nice time we shall have to wait.""I have brought you," he said, "the rough draft of the letter Ihave written to the bishop. I'll read it after tea; perhaps you mayfind something to add. . . .""Very well."A silence followed. Father Yakov threw furtive glances at thepartition wall, smoothed his hair, and blew his nose."It's wonderful weather, . . ." he said."Yes. I read an interesting thing yesterday. . . . the Volsky Zemstvohave decided to give their schools to the clergy, that's typical."Kunin got up, and pacing up and down the clay floor, began to giveexpression to his reflections."That would be all right," he said, "if only the clergy were equalto their high calling and recognized their tasks. I am so unfortunateas to know priests whose standard of culture and whose moral qualitiesmake them hardly fit to be army secretaries, much less priests. Youwill agree that a bad teacher does far less harm than a bad priest."Kunin glanced at Father Yakov; he was sitting bent up, thinkingintently about something and apparently not listening to his visitor."Yasha, come here!" a woman's voice called from behind the partition.Father Yakov started and went out. Again a whispering began.Kunin felt a pang of longing for tea."No; it's no use my waiting for tea here," he thought, looking athis watch. "Besides I fancy I am not altogether a welcome visitor.My host has not deigned to say one word to me; he simply sits andblinks."Kunin took up his hat, waited for Father Yakov to return, and saidgood-bye to him."I have simply wasted the morning," he thought wrathfully on theway home. "The blockhead! The dummy! He cares no more about theschool than I about last year's snow. . . . No, I shall never getanything done with him! We are bound to fail! If the Marshal knewwhat the priest here was like, he wouldn't be in such a hurry totalk about a school. We ought first to try and get a decent priest,and then think about the school."By now Kunin almost hated Father Yakov. The man, his pitiful,grotesque figure in the long crumpled robe, his womanish face, hismanner of officiating, his way of life and his formal restrainedrespectfulness, wounded the tiny relic of religious feeling whichwas stored away in a warm corner of Kunin's heart together with hisnurse's other fairy tales. The coldness and lack of attention withwhich Father Yakov had met Kunin's warm and sincere interest inwhat was the priest's own work was hard for the former's vanity toendure. . . .On the evening of the same day Kunin spent a long time walking abouthis rooms and thinking. Then he sat down to the table resolutelyand wrote a letter to the bishop. After asking for money and ablessing for the school, he set forth genuinely, like a son, hisopinion of the priest at Sinkino."He is young," he wrote, "insufficiently educated, leads, I fancy,an intemperate life, and altogether fails to satisfy the idealswhich the Russian people have in the course of centuries formed ofwhat a pastor should be."After writing this letter Kunin heaved a deep sigh, and went to bedwith the consciousness that he had done a good deed.On Monday morning, while he was still in bed, he was informed thatFather Yakov had arrived. He did not want to get up, and instructedthe servant to say he was not at home. On Tuesday he went away toa sitting of the Board, and when he returned on Saturday he wastold by the servants that Father Yakov had called every day in hisabsence."He liked my biscuits, it seems," he thought.Towards evening on Sunday Father Yakov arrived. This time not onlyhis skirts, but even his hat, was bespattered with mud. Just as onhis first visit, he was hot and perspiring, and sat down on theedge of his chair as he had done then. Kunin determined not to talkabout the school--not to cast pearls."I have brought you a list of books for the school, Pavel Mihailovitch,. . ." Father Yakov began."Thank you."But everything showed that Father Yakov had come for something elsebesides the list. Has whole figure was expressive of extremeembarrassment, and at the same time there was a look of determinationupon his face, as on the face of a man suddenly inspired by an idea.He struggled to say something important, absolutely necessary, andstrove to overcome his timidity."Why is he dumb?" Kunin thought wrathfully. "He's settled himselfcomfortably! I haven't time to be bothered with him."To smoothe over the awkwardness of his silence and to conceal thestruggle going on within him, the priest began to smile constrainedly,and this slow smile, wrung out on his red perspiring face, and outof keeping with the fixed look in his grey-blue eyes, made Kuninturn away. He felt moved to repulsion."Excuse me, Father, I have to go out," he said.Father Yakov started like a man asleep who has been struck a blow,and, still smiling, began in his confusion wrapping round him theskirts of his cassock. In spite of his repulsion for the man, Kuninfelt suddenly sorry for him, and he wanted to soften his cruelty."Please come another time, Father," he said, "and before we part Iwant to ask you a favour. I was somehow inspired to write two sermonsthe other day. . . . I will give them to you to look at. If theyare suitable, use them.""Very good," said Father Yakov, laying his open hand on Kunin'ssermons which were lying on the table. "I will take them."After standing a little, hesitating and still wrapping his cassockround him, he suddenly gave up the effort to smile and lifted hishead resolutely."Pavel Mihailovitch," he said, evidently trying to speak loudly anddistinctly."What can I do for you?""I have heard that you . . . er . . . have dismissed your secretary,and . . . and are looking for a new one. . . .""Yes, I am. . . . Why, have you someone to recommend?""I. . . er . . . you see . . . I . . . Could you not give the postto me?""Why, are you giving up the Church?" said Kunin in amazement."No, no," Father Yakov brought out quickly, for some reason turningpale and trembling all over. "God forbid! If you feel doubtful,then never mind, never mind. You see, I could do the work betweenwhiles, . . so as to increase my income. . . . Never mind, don'tdisturb yourself!""H'm! . . . your income. . . . But you know, I only pay my secretarytwenty roubles a month.""Good heavens! I would take ten," whispered Father Yakov, lookingabout him. "Ten would be enough! You . . . you are astonished, andeveryone is astonished. The greedy priest, the grasping priest,what does he do with his money? I feel myself I am greedy, . . .and I blame myself, I condemn myself. . . . I am ashamed to lookpeople in the face. . . . I tell you on my conscience, PavelMihailovitch. . . . I call the God of truth to witness. . . ."Father Yakov took breath and went on:"On the way here I prepared a regular confession to make you, but. . . I've forgotten it all; I cannot find a word now. I get ahundred and fifty roubles a year from my parish, and everyone wonderswhat I do with the money. . . . But I'll explain it all truly. . . .I pay forty roubles a year to the clerical school for my brotherPyotr. He has everything found there, except that I have to providepens and paper.""Oh, I believe you; I believe you! But what's the object of allthis?" said Kunin, with a wave of the hand, feeling terribly oppressedby this outburst of confidence on the part of his visitor, and notknowing how to get away from the tearful gleam in his eyes."Then I have not yet paid up all that I owe to the consistory formy place here. They charged me two hundred roubles for the living,and I was to pay ten roubles a month. . . . You can judge what isleft! And, besides, I must allow Father Avraamy at least threeroubles a month.""What Father Avraamy?""Father Avraamy who was priest at Sinkino before I came. He wasdeprived of the living on account of . . . his failing, but youknow, he is still living at Sinkino! He has nowhere to go. Thereis no one to keep him. Though he is old, he must have a corner, andfood and clothing--I can't let him go begging on the roads in hisposition! It would be on my conscience if anything happened! Itwould be my fault! He is. . . in debt all round; but, you see, Iam to blame for not paying for him."Father Yakov started up from his seat and, looking frantically atthe floor, strode up and down the room."My God, my God!" he muttered, raising his hands and dropping themagain. "Lord, save us and have mercy upon us! Why did you take sucha calling on yourself if you have so little faith and no strength?There is no end to my despair! Save me, Queen of Heaven!""Calm yourself, Father," said Kunin."I am worn out with hunger, Pavel Mihailovitch," Father Yakov wenton. "Generously forgive me, but I am at the end of my strength. . . . I know if I were to beg and to bow down, everyone would help,but . . . I cannot! I am ashamed. How can I beg of the peasants?You are on the Board here, so you know. . . . How can one beg of abeggar? And to beg of richer people, of landowners, I cannot! Ihave pride! I am ashamed!"Father Yakov waved his hand, and nervously scratched his head withboth hands."I am ashamed! My God, I am ashamed! I am proud and can't bearpeople to see my poverty! When you visited me, Pavel Mihailovitch,I had no tea in the house! There wasn't a pinch of it, and you knowit was pride prevented me from telling you! I am ashamed of myclothes, of these patches here. . . . I am ashamed of my vestments,of being hungry. . . . And is it seemly for a priest to be proud?"Father Yakov stood still in the middle of the study, and, as thoughhe did not notice Kunin's presence, began reasoning with himself."Well, supposing I endure hunger and disgrace--but, my God, Ihave a wife! I took her from a good home! She is not used to hardwork; she is soft; she is used to tea and white bread and sheetson her bed. . . . At home she used to play the piano. . . . She isyoung, not twenty yet. . . . She would like, to be sure, to besmart, to have fun, go out to see people. . . . And she is worseoff with me than any cook; she is ashamed to show herself in thestreet. My God, my God! Her only treat is when I bring an apple orsome biscuit from a visit. . . ."Father Yakov scratched his head again with both hands."And it makes us feel not love but pity for each other. . . . Icannot look at her without compassion! And the things that happenin this life, O Lord! Such things that people would not believethem if they saw them in the newspaper. . . . And when will therebe an end to it all!""Hush, Father!" Kunin almost shouted, frightened at his tone. "Whytake such a gloomy view of life?""Generously forgive me, Pavel Mihailovitch . . ." muttered FatherYakov as though he were drunk, "Forgive me, all this . . . doesn'tmatter, and don't take any notice of it. . . . Only I do blamemyself, and always shall blame myself . . . always."Father Yakov looked about him and began whispering:"One morning early I was going from Sinkino to Lutchkovo; I saw awoman standing on the river bank, doing something. . . . I went upclose and could not believe my eyes. . . . It was horrible! Thewife of the doctor, Ivan Sergeitch, was sitting there washing herlinen. . . . A doctor's wife, brought up at a select boarding-school!She had got up you see, early and gone half a mile from the villagethat people should not see her. . . . She couldn't get over herpride! When she saw that I was near her and noticed her poverty,she turned red all over. . . . I was flustered--I was frightened,and ran up to help her, but she hid her linen from me; she wasafraid I should see her ragged chemises. . . .""All this is positively incredible," said Kunin, sitting down andlooking almost with horror at Father Yakov's pale face."Incredible it is! It's a thing that has never been! Pavel Mihailovitch,that a doctor's wife should be rinsing the linen in the river! Sucha thing does not happen in any country! As her pastor and spiritualfather, I ought not to allow it, but what can I do? What? Why, Iam always trying to get treated by her husband for nothing myself!It is true that, as you say, it is all incredible! One can hardlybelieve one's eyes. During Mass, you know, when I look out from thealtar and see my congregation, Avraamy starving, and my wife, andthink of the doctor's wife--how blue her hands were from the coldwater--would you believe it, I forget myself and stand senselesslike a fool, until the sacristan calls to me. . . . It's awful!"Father Yakov began walking about again."Lord Jesus!" he said, waving his hands, "holy Saints! I can'tofficiate properly. . . . Here you talk to me about the school, andI sit like a dummy and don't understand a word, and think of nothingbut food. . . . Even before the altar. . . . But . . . what am Idoing?" Father Yakov pulled himself up suddenly. "You want to goout. Forgive me, I meant nothing. . . . Excuse . . ."Kunin shook hands with Father Yakov without speaking, saw him intothe hall, and going back into his study, stood at the window. Hesaw Father Yakov go out of the house, pull his wide-brimmedrusty-looking hat over his eyes, and slowly, bowing his head, asthough ashamed of his outburst, walk along the road."I don't see his horse," thought Kunin.Kunin did not dare to think that the priest had come on foot everyday to see him; it was five or six miles to Sinkino, and the mudon the road was impassable. Further on he saw the coachman Andreyand the boy Paramon, jumping over the puddles and splashing FatherYakov with mud, run up to him for his blessing. Father Yakov tookoff his hat and slowly blessed Andrey, then blessed the boy andstroked his head.Kunin passed his hand over his eyes, and it seemed to him that hishand was moist. He walked away from the window and with dim eyeslooked round the room in which he still seemed to hear the timiddroning voice. He glanced at the table. Luckily, Father Yakov, inhis haste, had forgotten to take the sermons. Kunin rushed up tothem, tore them into pieces, and with loathing thrust them underthe table."And I did not know!" he moaned, sinking on to the sofa. "Afterbeing here over a year as member of the Rural Board, Honorary Justiceof the Peace, member of the School Committee! Blind puppet, egregiousidiot! I must make haste and help them, I must make haste!"He turned from side to side uneasily, pressed his temples and rackedhis brains."On the twentieth I shall get my salary, two hundred roubles. . . .On some good pretext I will give him some, and some to the doctor'swife. . . . I will ask them to perform a special service here, andwill get up an illness for the doctor. . . . In that way I shan'twound their pride. And I'll help Father Avraamy too. . . ."He reckoned his money on his fingers, and was afraid to own tohimself that those two hundred roubles would hardly be enough forhim to pay his steward, his servants, the peasant who brought themeat. . . . He could not help remembering the recent past when hewas senselessly squandering his father's fortune, when as a puppyof twenty he had given expensive fans to prostitutes, had paid tenroubles a day to Kuzma, his cab-driver, and in his vanity had madepresents to actresses. Oh, how useful those wasted rouble, three-rouble,ten-rouble notes would have been now!"Father Avraamy lives on three roubles a month!" thought Kunin."For a rouble the priest's wife could get herself a chemise, andthe doctor's wife could hire a washerwoman. But I'll help them,anyway! I must help them."Here Kunin suddenly recalled the private information he had sentto the bishop, and he writhed as from a sudden draught of cold air.This remembrance filled him with overwhelming shame before his innerself and before the unseen truth.So had begun and had ended a sincere effort to be of public serviceon the part of a well-intentioned but unreflecting and over-comfortableperson.THE MURDERIThe evening service was being celebrated at Progonnaya Station.Before the great ikon, painted in glaring colours on a backgroundof gold, stood the crowd of railway servants with their wives andchildren, and also of the timbermen and sawyers who worked closeto the railway line. All stood in silence, fascinated by the glareof the lights and the howling of the snow-storm which was aimlesslydisporting itself outside, regardless of the fact that it was theEve of the Annunciation. The old priest from Vedenyapino conductedthe service; the sacristan and Matvey Terehov were singing.Matvey's face was beaming with delight; he sang stretching out hisneck as though he wanted to soar upwards. He sang tenor and chantedthe "Praises" too in a tenor voice with honied sweetness andpersuasiveness. When he sang "Archangel Voices" he waved his armslike a conductor, and trying to second the sacristan's hollow basswith his tenor, achieved something extremely complex, and from hisface it could be seen that he was experiencing great pleasure.At last the service was over, and they all quietly dispersed, andit was dark and empty again, and there followed that hush which isonly known in stations that stand solitary in the open country orin the forest when the wind howls and nothing else is heard andwhen all the emptiness around, all the dreariness of life slowlyebbing away is felt.Matvey lived not far from the station at his cousin's tavern. Buthe did not want to go home. He sat down at the refreshment bar andbegan talking to the waiter in a low voice."We had our own choir in the tile factory. And I must tell you thatthough we were only workmen, our singing was first-rate, splendid.We were often invited to the town, and when the Deputy Bishop,Father Ivan, took the service at Trinity Church, the bishop's singerssang in the right choir and we in the left. Only they complainedin the town that we kept the singing on too long: 'the factory choirdrag it out,' they used to say. It is true we began St. Andrey'sprayers and the Praises between six and seven, and it was pasteleven when we finished, so that it was sometimes after midnightwhen we got home to the factory. It was good," sighed Matvey. "Verygood it was, indeed, Sergey Nikanoritch! But here in my father'shouse it is anything but joyful. The nearest church is four milesaway; with my weak health I can't get so far; there are no singersthere. And there is no peace or quiet in our family; day in dayout, there is an uproar, scolding, uncleanliness; we all eat outof one bowl like peasants; and there are beetles in the cabbagesoup. . . . God has not given me health, else I would have goneaway long ago, Sergey Nikanoritch."Matvey Terehov was a middle-aged man about forty-five, but he hada look of ill-health; his face was wrinkled and his lank, scantybeard was quite grey, and that made him seem many years older. Hespoke in a weak voice, circumspectly, and held his chest when hecoughed, while his eyes assumed the uneasy and anxious look onesees in very apprehensive people. He never said definitely what waswrong with him, but he was fond of describing at length how onceat the factory he had lifted a heavy box and had ruptured himself,and how this had led to "the gripes," and had forced him to giveup his work in the tile factory and come back to his native place;but he could not explain what he meant by "the gripes.""I must own I am not fond of my cousin," he went on, pouring himselfout some tea. "He is my elder; it is a sin to censure him, and Ifear the Lord, but I cannot bear it in patience. He is a haughty,surly, abusive man; he is the torment of his relations and workmen,and constantly out of humour. Last Sunday I asked him in an amiableway, 'Brother, let us go to Pahomovo for the Mass!' but he said 'Iam not going; the priest there is a gambler;' and he would not comehere to-day because, he said, the priest from Vedenyapino smokesand drinks vodka. He doesn't like the clergy! He reads Mass himselfand the Hours and the Vespers, while his sister acts as sacristan;he says, 'Let us pray unto the Lord'! and she, in a thin littlevoice like a turkey-hen, 'Lord, have mercy upon us! . . .' It's asin, that's what it is. Every day I say to him, 'Think what you aredoing, brother! Repent, brother!' and he takes no notice."Sergey Nikanoritch, the waiter, poured out five glasses of tea andcarried them on a tray to the waiting-room. He had scarcely gonein when there was a shout:"Is that the way to serve it, pig's face? You don't know how towait!"It was the voice of the station-master. There was a timid mutter,then again a harsh and angry shout:"Get along!"The waiter came back greatly crestfallen."There was a time when I gave satisfaction to counts and princes,"he said in a low voice; "but now I don't know how to serve tea. . . .He called me names before the priest and the ladies!"The waiter, Sergey Nikanoritch, had once had money of his own, andhad kept a buffet at a first-class station, which was a junction,in the principal town of a province. There he had worn a swallow-tailcoat and a gold chain. But things had gone ill with him; he hadsquandered all his own money over expensive fittings and service;he had been robbed by his staff, and getting gradually intodifficulties, had moved to another station less bustling. Here hiswife had left him, taking with her all the silver, and he moved toa third station of a still lower class, where no hot dishes wereserved. Then to a fourth. Frequently changing his situation andsinking lower and lower, he had at last come to Progonnaya, andhere he used to sell nothing but tea and cheap vodka, and for lunchhard-boiled eggs and dry sausages, which smelt of tar, and whichhe himself sarcastically said were only fit for the orchestra. Hewas bald all over the top of his head, and had prominent blue eyesand thick bushy whiskers, which he often combed out, looking intothe little looking-glass. Memories of the past haunted him continually;he could never get used to sausage "only fit for the orchestra,"to the rudeness of the station-master, and to the peasants who usedto haggle over the prices, and in his opinion it was as unseemlyto haggle over prices in a refreshment room as in a chemist's shop.He was ashamed of his poverty and degradation, and that shame wasnow the leading interest of his life."Spring is late this year," said Matvey, listening. "It's a goodjob; I don't like spring. In spring it is very muddy, SergeyNikanoritch. In books they write: Spring, the birds sing, the sunis setting, but what is there pleasant in that? A bird is a bird,and nothing more. I am fond of good company, of listening to folks,of talking of religion or singing something agreeable in chorus;but as for nightingales and flowers--bless them, I say!"He began again about the tile factory, about the choir, but SergeyNikanoritch could not get over his mortification, and kept shrugginghis shoulders and muttering. Matvey said good-bye and went home.There was no frost, and the snow was already melting on the roofs,though it was still falling in big flakes; they were whirling rapidlyround and round in the air and chasing one another in white cloudsalong the railway line. And the oak forest on both sides of theline, in the dim light of the moon which was hidden somewhere highup in the clouds, resounded with a prolonged sullen murmur. When aviolent storm shakes the trees, how terrible they are! Matvey walkedalong the causeway beside the line, covering his face and his hands,while the wind beat on his back. All at once a little nag, plasteredall over with snow, came into sight; a sledge scraped along thebare stones of the causeway, and a peasant, white all over, too,with his head muffled up, cracked his whip. Matvey looked roundafter him, but at once, as though it had been a vision, there wasneither sledge nor peasant to be seen, and he hastened his steps,suddenly scared, though he did not know why.Here was the crossing and the dark little house where the signalmanlived. The barrier was raised, and by it perfect mountains haddrifted and clouds of snow were whirling round like witches onbroomsticks. At that point the line was crossed by an old highroad,which was still called "the track." On the right, not far from thecrossing, by the roadside stood Terehov's tavern, which had been aposting inn. Here there was always a light twinkling at night.When Matvey reached home there was a strong smell of incense in allthe rooms and even in the entry. His cousin Yakov Ivanitch was stillreading the evening service. In the prayer-room where this was goingon, in the corner opposite the door, there stood a shrine ofold-fashioned ancestral ikons in gilt settings, and both walls toright and to left were decorated with ikons of ancient and modernfashion, in shrines and without them. On the table, which was drapedto the floor, stood an ikon of the Annunciation, and close by acyprus-wood cross and the censer; wax candles were burning. Besidethe table was a reading desk. As he passed by the prayer-room,Matvey stopped and glanced in at the door. Yakov Ivanitch was readingat the desk at that moment, his sister Aglaia, a tall lean old womanin a dark-blue dress and white kerchief, was praying with him. YakovIvanitch's daughter Dashutka, an ugly freckled girl of eighteen,was there, too, barefoot as usual, and wearing the dress in whichshe had at nightfall taken water to the cattle."Glory to Thee Who hast shown us the light!" Yakov Ivanitch boomedout in a chant, bowing low.Aglaia propped her chin on her hand and chanted in a thin, shrill,drawling voice. And upstairs, above the ceiling, there was the soundof vague voices which seemed menacing or ominous of evil. No onehad lived on the storey above since a fire there a long time ago.The windows were boarded up, and empty bottles lay about on thefloor between the beams. Now the wind was banging and droning, andit seemed as though someone were running and stumbling over thebeams.Half of the lower storey was used as a tavern, while Terehov'sfamily lived in the other half, so that when drunken visitors werenoisy in the tavern every word they said could be heard in therooms. Matvey lived in a room next to the kitchen, with a big stove,in which, in old days, when this had been a posting inn, bread hadbeen baked every day. Dashutka, who had no room of her own, livedin the same room behind the stove. A cricket chirped there alwaysat night and mice ran in and out.Matvey lighted a candle and began reading a book which he hadborrowed from the station policeman. While he was sitting over itthe service ended, and they all went to bed. Dashutka lay down,too. She began snoring at once, but soon woke up and said, yawning:"You shouldn't burn a candle for nothing, Uncle Matvey.""It's my candle," answered Matvey; "I bought it with my own money."Dashutka turned over a little and fell asleep again. Matvey sat upa good time longer--he was not sleepy--and when he had finishedthe last page he took a pencil out of a box and wrote on the book:"I, Matvey Terehov, have read this book, and think it the very bestof all the books I have read, for which I express my gratitude tothe non-commissioned officer of the Police Department of Railways,Kuzma Nikolaev Zhukov, as the possessor of this priceless book."He considered it an obligation of politeness to make such inscriptionsin other people's books.IIOn Annunciation Day, after the mail train had been sent off, Matveywas sitting in the refreshment bar, talking and drinking tea withlemon in it.The waiter and Zhukov the policeman were listening to him."I was, I must tell you," Matvey was saying, "inclined to religionfrom my earliest childhood. I was only twelve years old when I usedto read the epistle in church, and my parents were greatly delighted,and every summer I used to go on a pilgrimage with my dear mother.Sometimes other lads would be singing songs and catching crayfish,while I would be all the time with my mother. My elders commendedme, and, indeed, I was pleased myself that I was of such goodbehaviour. And when my mother sent me with her blessing to thefactory, I used between working hours to sing tenor there in ourchoir, and nothing gave me greater pleasure. I needn't say, I drankno vodka, I smoked no tobacco, and lived in chastity; but we allknow such a mode of life is displeasing to the enemy of mankind,and he, the unclean spirit, once tried to ruin me and began todarken my mind, just as now with my cousin. First of all, I took avow to fast every Monday and not to eat meat any day, and as timewent on all sorts of fancies came over me. For the first week ofLent down to Saturday the holy fathers have ordained a diet of dryfood, but it is no sin for the weak or those who work hard even todrink tea, yet not a crumb passed into my mouth till the Sunday,and afterwards all through Lent I did not allow myself a drop ofoil, and on Wednesdays and Fridays I did not touch a morsel at all.It was the same in the lesser fasts. Sometimes in St. Peter's fastour factory lads would have fish soup, while I would sit a littleapart from them and suck a dry crust. Different people have differentpowers, of course, but I can say of myself I did not find fast dayshard, and, indeed, the greater the zeal the easier it seems. Youare only hungry on the first days of the fast, and then you getused to it; it goes on getting easier, and by the end of a week youdon't mind it at all, and there is a numb feeling in your legs asthough you were not on earth, but in the clouds. And, besides that,I laid all sorts of penances on myself; I used to get up in thenight and pray, bowing down to the ground, used to drag heavy stonesfrom place to place, used to go out barefoot in the snow, and Ieven wore chains, too. Only, as time went on, you know, I wasconfessing one day to the priest and suddenly this reflectionoccurred to me: why, this priest, I thought, is married, he eatsmeat and smokes tobacco--how can he confess me, and what powerhas he to absolve my sins if he is more sinful that I? I even scrupleto eat Lenten oil, while he eats sturgeon, I dare say. I went toanother priest, and he, as ill luck would have it, was a fat fleshyman, in a silk cassock; he rustled like a lady, and he smelt oftobacco too. I went to fast and confess in the monastery, and myheart was not at ease even there; I kept fancying the monks werenot living according to their rules. And after that I could notfind a service to my mind: in one place they read the service toofast, in another they sang the wrong prayer, in a third the sacristanstammered. Sometimes, the Lord forgive me a sinner, I would standin church and my heart would throb with anger. How could one pray,feeling like that? And I fancied that the people in the church didnot cross themselves properly, did not listen properly; wherever Ilooked it seemed to me that they were all drunkards, that they brokethe fast, smoked, lived loose lives and played cards. I was theonly one who lived according to the commandments. The wily spiritdid not slumber; it got worse as it went on. I gave up singing inthe choir and I did not go to church at all; since my notion wasthat I was a righteous man and that the church did not suit me owingto its imperfections--that is, indeed, like a fallen angel, I waspuffed up in my pride beyond all belief. After this I began attemptingto make a church for myself. I hired from a deaf woman a tiny littleroom, a long way out of town near the cemetery, and made a prayer-roomlike my cousin's, only I had big church candlesticks, too, and areal censer. In this prayer-room of mine I kept the rules of holyMount Athos--that is, every day my matins began at midnight withoutfail, and on the eve of the chief of the twelve great holy days mymidnight service lasted ten hours and sometimes even twelve. Monksare allowed by rule to sit during the singing of the Psalter andthe reading of the Bible, but I wanted to be better than the monks,and so I used to stand all through. I used to read and sing slowly,with tears and sighing, lifting up my hands, and I used to gostraight from prayer to work without sleeping; and, indeed, I wasalways praying at my work, too. Well, it got all over the town'Matvey is a saint; Matvey heals the sick and senseless.' I neverhad healed anyone, of course, but we all know wherever any heresyor false doctrine springs up there's no keeping the female sex away.They are just like flies on the honey. Old maids and females of allsorts came trailing to me, bowing down to my feet, kissing my handsand crying out I was a saint and all the rest of it, and one evensaw a halo round my head. It was too crowded in the prayer-room. Itook a bigger room, and then we had a regular tower of Babel. Thedevil got hold of me completely and screened the light from my eyeswith his unclean hoofs. We all behaved as though we were frantic.I read, while the old maids and other females sang, and then afterstanding on their legs for twenty-four hours or longer withouteating or drinking, suddenly a trembling would come over them asthough they were in a fever; after that, one would begin screamingand then another--it was horrible! I, too, would shiver all overlike a Jew in a frying-pan, I don't know myself why, and our legsbegan to prance about. It's a strange thing, indeed: you don't wantto, but you prance about and waggle your arms; and after that,screaming and shrieking, we all danced and ran after one another--ran till we dropped; and in that way, in wild frenzy, I fellinto fornication."The policeman laughed, but, noticing that no one else was laughing,became serious and said:"That's Molokanism. I have heard they are all like that in theCaucasus.""But I was not killed by a thunderbolt," Matvey went on, crossinghimself before the ikon and moving his lips. "My dead mother musthave been praying for me in the other world. When everyone in thetown looked upon me as a saint, and even the ladies and gentlemenof good family used to come to me in secret for consolation, Ihappened to go into our landlord, Osip Varlamitch, to ask forgiveness--it was the Day of Forgiveness--and he fastened the door withthe hook, and we were left alone face to face. And he began toreprove me, and I must tell you Osip Varlamitch was a man of brains,though without education, and everyone respected and feared him,for he was a man of stern, God-fearing life and worked hard. He hadbeen the mayor of the town, and a warden of the church for twentyyears maybe, and had done a great deal of good; he had covered allthe New Moscow Road with gravel, had painted the church, and haddecorated the columns to look like malachite. Well, he fastened thedoor, and--'I have been wanting to get at you for a long time,you rascal, . . .' he said. 'You think you are a saint,' he said.'No you are not a saint, but a backslider from God, a heretic andan evildoer! . . .' And he went on and on. . . . I can't tell youhow he said it, so eloquently and cleverly, as though it were allwritten down, and so touchingly. He talked for two hours. His wordspenetrated my soul; my eyes were opened. I listened, listened and--burst into sobs! 'Be an ordinary man,' he said, 'eat and drink,dress and pray like everyone else. All that is above the ordinaryis of the devil. Your chains,' he said, 'are of the devil; yourfasting is of the devil; your prayer-room is of the devil. It isall pride,' he said. Next day, on Monday in Holy Week, it pleasedGod I should fall ill. I ruptured myself and was taken to thehospital. I was terribly worried, and wept bitterly and trembled.I thought there was a straight road before me from the hospital tohell, and I almost died. I was in misery on a bed of sickness forsix months, and when I was discharged the first thing I did Iconfessed, and took the sacrament in the regular way and became aman again. Osip Varlamitch saw me off home and exhorted me: 'Remember,Matvey, that anything above the ordinary is of the devil.' And nowI eat and drink like everyone else and pray like everyone else. . . . If it happens now that the priest smells of tobacco or vodka Idon't venture to blame him, because the priest, too, of course, isan ordinary man. But as soon as I am told that in the town or inthe village a saint has set up who does not eat for weeks, and makesrules of his own, I know whose work it is. So that is how I carriedon in the past, gentlemen. Now, like Osip Varlamitch, I am continuallyexhorting my cousins and reproaching them, but I am a voice cryingin the wilderness. God has not vouchsafed me the gift."Matvey's story evidently made no impression whatever. SergeyNikanoritch said nothing, but began clearing the refreshments offthe counter, while the policeman began talking of how rich Matvey'scousin was."He must have thirty thousand at least," he said.Zhukov the policeman, a sturdy, well-fed, red-haired man with afull face (his cheeks quivered when he walked), usually sat lollingand crossing his legs when not in the presence of his superiors.As he talked he swayed to and fro and whistled carelessly, whilehis face had a self-satisfied replete air, as though he had justhad dinner. He was making money, and he always talked of it withthe air of a connoisseur. He undertook jobs as an agent, and whenanyone wanted to sell an estate, a horse or a carriage, they appliedto him."Yes, it will be thirty thousand, I dare say," Sergey Nikanoritchassented. "Your grandfather had an immense fortune," he said,addressing Matvey. "Immense it was; all left to your father andyour uncle. Your father died as a young man and your uncle got holdof it all, and afterwards, of course, Yakov Ivanitch. While youwere going pilgrimages with your mama and singing tenor in thefactory, they didn't let the grass grow under their feet.""Fifteen thousand comes to your share," said the policeman swayingfrom side to side. "The tavern belongs to you in common, so thecapital is in common. Yes. If I were in your place I should havetaken it into court long ago. I would have taken it into court forone thing, and while the case was going on I'd have knocked hisface to a jelly."Yakov Ivanitch was disliked because, when anyone believes differentlyfrom others, it upsets even people who are indifferent to religion.The policeman disliked him also because he, too, sold horses andcarriages."You don't care about going to law with your cousin because youhave plenty of money of your own," said the waiter to Matvey, lookingat him with envy. "It is all very well for anyone who has means,but here I shall die in this position, I suppose. . . ."Matvey began declaring that he hadn't any money at all, but SergeyNikanoritch was not listening. Memories of the past and of theinsults which he endured every day came showering upon him. Hisbald head began to perspire; he flushed and blinked."A cursed life!" he said with vexation, and he banged the sausageon the floor.IIIThe story ran that the tavern had been built in the time of AlexanderI, by a widow who had settled here with her son; her name was AvdotyaTerehov. The dark roofed-in courtyard and the gates always keptlocked excited, especially on moonlight nights, a feeling ofdepression and unaccountable uneasiness in people who drove by withposting-horses, as though sorcerers or robbers were living in it;and the driver always looked back after he passed, and whipped uphis horses. Travellers did not care to put up here, as the peopleof the house were always unfriendly and charged heavily. The yardwas muddy even in summer; huge fat pigs used to lie there in themud, and the horses in which the Terehovs dealt wandered aboutuntethered, and often it happened that they ran out of the yard anddashed along the road like mad creatures, terrifying the pilgrimwomen. At that time there was a great deal of traffic on the road;long trains of loaded waggons trailed by, and all sorts of adventureshappened, such as, for instance, that thirty years ago some waggonersgot up a quarrel with a passing merchant and killed him, and aslanting cross is standing to this day half a mile from the tavern;posting-chaises with bells and the heavy _dormeuses_ of countrygentlemen drove by; and herds of horned cattle passed bellowing andstirring up clouds of dust.When the railway came there was at first at this place only aplatform, which was called simply a halt; ten years afterwards thepresent station, Progonnaya, was built. The traffic on the oldposting-road almost ceased, and only local landowners and peasantsdrove along it now, but the working people walked there in crowdsin spring and autumn. The posting-inn was transformed into arestaurant; the upper storey was destroyed by fire, the roof hadgrown yellow with rust, the roof over the yard had fallen by degrees,but huge fat pigs, pink and revolting, still wallowed in the mudin the yard. As before, the horses sometimes ran away and, lashingtheir tails dashed madly along the road. In the tavern they soldtea, hay oats and flour, as well as vodka and beer, to be drunk onthe premises and also to be taken away; they sold spirituous liquorswarily, for they had never taken out a licence.The Terehovs had always been distinguished by their piety, so muchso that they had even been given the nickname of the "Godlies." Butperhaps because they lived apart like bears, avoided people andthought out all their ideas for themselves, they were given todreams and to doubts and to changes of faith and almost eachgeneration had a peculiar faith of its own. The grandmother Avdotya,who had built the inn, was an Old Believer; her son and both hergrandsons (the fathers of Matvey and Yakov) went to the Orthodoxchurch, entertained the clergy, and worshipped before the new ikonsas devoutly as they had done before the old. The son in old agerefused to eat meat and imposed upon himself the rule of silence,considering all conversation as sin; it was the peculiarity of thegrandsons that they interpreted the Scripture not simply, but soughtin it a hidden meaning, declaring that every sacred word must containa mystery.Avdotya's great-grandson Matvey had struggled from early childhoodwith all sorts of dreams and fancies and had been almost ruined byit; the other great-grandson, Yakov Ivanitch, was orthodox, butafter his wife's death he gave up going to church and prayed athome. Following his example, his sister Aglaia had turned, too; shedid not go to church herself, and did not let Dashutka go. Of Aglaiait was told that in her youth she used to attend the Flagellantmeetings in Vedenyapino, and that she was still a Flagellant insecret, and that was why she wore a white kerchief.Yakov Ivanitch was ten years older than Matvey--he was a veryhandsome tall old man with a big grey beard almost to his waist,and bushy eyebrows which gave his face a stern, even ill-naturedexpression. He wore a long jerkin of good cloth or a black sheepskincoat, and altogether tried to be clean and neat in dress; he woregoloshes even in dry weather. He did not go to church, because, tohis thinking, the services were not properly celebrated and becausethe priests drank wine at unlawful times and smoked tobacco. Everyday he read and sang the service at home with Aglaia. At Vedenyapinothey left out the "Praises" at early matins, and had no eveningservice even on great holidays, but he used to read through at homeeverything that was laid down for every day, without hurrying orleaving out a single line, and even in his spare time read aloudthe Lives of the Saints. And in everyday life he adhered strictlyto the rules of the church; thus, if wine were allowed on some dayin Lent "for the sake of the vigil," then he never failed to drinkwine, even if he were not inclined.He read, sang, burned incense and fasted, not for the sake ofreceiving blessings of some sort from God, but for the sake of goodorder. Man cannot live without religion, and religion ought to beexpressed from year to year and from day to day in a certain order,so that every morning and every evening a man might turn to Godwith exactly those words and thoughts that were befitting thatspecial day and hour. One must live, and, therefore, also pray asis pleasing to God, and so every day one must read and sing whatis pleasing to God--that is, what is laid down in the rule of thechurch. Thus the first chapter of St. John must only be read onEaster Day, and "It is most meet" must not be sung from Easter toAscension, and so on. The consciousness of this order and itsimportance afforded Yakov Ivanitch great gratification during hisreligious exercises. When he was forced to break this order by somenecessity--to drive to town or to the bank, for instance hisconscience was uneasy and he felt miserable.When his cousin Matvey had returned unexpectedly from the factoryand settled in the tavern as though it were his home, he had fromthe very first day disturbed his settled order. He refused to praywith them, had meals and drank tea at wrong times, got up late,drank milk on Wednesdays and Fridays on the pretext of weak health;almost every day he went into the prayer-room while they were atprayers and cried: "Think what you are doing, brother! Repent,brother!" These words threw Yakov into a fury, while Aglaia couldnot refrain from beginning to scold; or at night Matvey would stealinto the prayer-room and say softly: "Cousin, your prayer is notpleasing to God. For it is written, First be reconciled with thybrother and then offer thy gift. You lend money at usury, you dealin vodka--repent!"In Matvey's words Yakov saw nothing but the usual evasions ofempty-headed and careless people who talk of loving your neighbour,of being reconciled with your brother, and so on, simply to avoidpraying, fasting and reading holy books, and who talk contemptuouslyof profit and interest simply because they don't like working. Ofcourse, to be poor, save nothing, and put by nothing was a greatdeal easier than being rich.But yet he was troubled and could not pray as before. As soon ashe went into the prayer-room and opened the book he began to beafraid his cousin would come in and hinder him; and, in fact, Matveydid soon appear and cry in a trembling voice: "Think what you aredoing, brother! Repent, brother!" Aglaia stormed and Yakov, too,flew into a passion and shouted: "Go out of my house!" while Matveyanswered him: "The house belongs to both of us."Yakov would begin singing and reading again, but he could not regainhis calm, and unconsciously fell to dreaming over his book. Thoughhe regarded his cousin's words as nonsense, yet for some reason ithad of late haunted his memory that it is hard for a rich man toenter the kingdom of heaven, that the year before last he had madea very good bargain over buying a stolen horse, that one day whenhis wife was alive a drunkard had died of vodka in his tavern. . . .He slept badly at nights now and woke easily, and he could hearthat Matvey, too, was awake, and continually sighing and pining forhis tile factory. And while Yakov turned over from one side toanother at night he thought of the stolen horse and the drunkenman, and what was said in the gospels about the camel.It looked as though his dreaminess were coming over him again. Andas ill-luck would have it, although it was the end of March, everyday it kept snowing, and the forest roared as though it were winter,and there was no believing that spring would ever come. The weatherdisposed one to depression, and to quarrelling and to hatred andin the night, when the wind droned over the ceiling, it seemed asthough someone were living overhead in the empty storey; little bylittle the broodings settled like a burden on his mind, his headburned and he could not sleep.IVOn the morning of the Monday before Good Friday, Matvey heard fromhis room Dashutka say to Aglaia:"Uncle Matvey said, the other day, that there is no need to fast."Matvey remembered the whole conversation he had had the eveningbefore with Dashutka, and he felt hurt all at once."Girl, don't do wrong!" he said in a moaning voice, like a sickman. "You can't do without fasting; our Lord Himself fasted fortydays. I only explained that fasting does a bad man no good.""You should just listen to the factory hands; they can teach yougoodness," Aglaia said sarcastically as she washed the floor (sheusually washed the floors on working days and was always angry witheveryone when she did it). "We know how they keep the fasts in thefactory. You had better ask that uncle of yours--ask him abouthis 'Darling,' how he used to guzzle milk on fast days with her,the viper. He teaches others; he forgets about his viper. But askhim who was it he left his money with--who was it?"Matvey had carefully concealed from everyone, as though it were afoul sore, that during that period of his life when old women andunmarried girls had danced and run about with him at their prayershe had formed a connection with a working woman and had had a childby her. When he went home he had given this woman all he had savedat the factory, and had borrowed from his landlord for his journey,and now he had only a few roubles which he spent on tea and candles.The "Darling" had informed him later on that the child was dead,and asked him in a letter what she should do with the money. Thisletter was brought from the station by the labourer. Aglaia interceptedit and read it, and had reproached Matvey with his "Darling" everyday since."Just fancy, nine hundred roubles," Aglaia went on. "You gave ninehundred roubles to a viper, no relation, a factory jade, blast you!"She had flown into a passion by now and was shouting shrilly: "Can'tyou speak? I could tear you to pieces, wretched creature! Ninehundred roubles as though it were a farthing. You might have leftit to Dashutka--she is a relation, not a stranger--or else haveit sent to Byelev for Marya's poor orphans. And your viper did notchoke, may she be thrice accursed, the she-devil! May she neverlook upon the light of day!"Yakov Ivanitch called to her: it was time to begin the "Hours." Shewashed, put on a white kerchief, and by now quiet and meek, wentinto the prayer-room to the brother she loved. When she spoke toMatvey or served peasants in the tavern with tea she was a gaunt,keen-eyed, ill-humoured old woman; in the prayer-room her face wasserene and softened, she looked younger altogether, she curtsiedaffectedly, and even pursed up her lips.Yakov Ivanitch began reading the service softly and dolefully, ashe always did in Lent. After he had read a little he stopped tolisten to the stillness that reigned through the house, and thenwent on reading again, with a feeling of gratification; he foldedhis hands in supplication, rolled his eyes, shook his head, sighed.But all at once there was the sound of voices. The policeman andSergey Nikanoritch had come to see Matvey. Yakov Ivanitch wasembarrassed at reading aloud and singing when there were strangersin the house, and now, hearing voices, he began reading in a whisperand slowly. He could hear in the prayer-room the waiter say:"The Tatar at Shtchepovo is selling his business for fifteen hundred.He'll take five hundred down and an I.O.U. for the rest. And so,Matvey Vassilitch, be so kind as to lend me that five hundredroubles. I will pay you two per cent a month.""What money have I got?" cried Matvey, amazed. "I have no money!""Two per cent a month will be a godsend to you," the policemanexplained. "While lying by, your money is simply eaten by the moth,and that's all that you get from it."Afterwards the visitors went out and a silence followed. But YakovIvanitch had hardly begun reading and singing again when a voicewas heard outside the door:"Brother, let me have a horse to drive to Vedenyapino."It was Matvey. And Yakov was troubled again. "Which can you gowith?" he asked after a moment's thought. "The man has gone withthe sorrel to take the pig, and I am going with the little stallionto Shuteykino as soon as I have finished.""Brother, why is it you can dispose of the horses and not I?" Matveyasked with irritation."Because I am not taking them for pleasure, but for work.""Our property is in common, so the horses are in common, too, andyou ought to understand that, brother."A silence followed. Yakov did not go on praying, but waited forMatvey to go away from the door."Brother," said Matvey, "I am a sick man. I don't want possession--let them go; you have them, but give me a small share to keepme in my illness. Give it me and I'll go away."Yakov did not speak. He longed to be rid of Matvey, but he couldnot give him money, since all the money was in the business; besides,there had never been a case of the family dividing in the wholehistory of the Terehovs. Division means ruin.Yakov said nothing, but still waited for Matvey to go away, andkept looking at his sister, afraid that she would interfere, andthat there would be a storm of abuse again, as there had been inthe morning. When at last Matvey did go Yakov went on reading, butnow he had no pleasure in it. There was a heaviness in his head anda darkness before his eyes from continually bowing down to theground, and he was weary of the sound of his soft dejected voice.When such a depression of spirit came over him at night, he put itdown to not being able to sleep; by day it frightened him, and hebegan to feel as though devils were sitting on his head and shoulders.Finishing the service after a fashion, dissatisfied and ill-humoured,he set off for Shuteykino. In the previous autumn a gang of navvieshad dug a boundary ditch near Progonnaya, and had run up a bill atthe tavern for eighteen roubles, and now he had to find their foremanin Shuteykino and get the money from him. The road had been spoiltby the thaw and the snowstorm; it was of a dark colour and full ofholes, and in parts it had given way altogether. The snow had sunkaway at the sides below the road, so that he had to drive, as itwere, upon a narrow causeway, and it was very difficult to turn offit when he met anything. The sky had been overcast ever since themorning and a damp wind was blowing. . . .A long train of sledges met him; peasant women were carting bricks.Yakov had to turn off the road. His horse sank into the snow up toits belly; the sledge lurched over to the right, and to avoid fallingout he bent over to the left, and sat so all the time the sledgesmoved slowly by him. Through the wind he heard the creaking of thesledge poles and the breathing of the gaunt horses, and the womensaying about him, "There's Godly coming," while one, gazing withcompassion at his horse, said quickly:"It looks as though the snow will be lying till Yegory's Day! Theyare worn out with it!"Yakov sat uncomfortably huddled up, screwing up his eyes on accountof the wind, while horses and red bricks kept passing before him.And perhaps because he was uncomfortable and his side ached, hefelt all at once annoyed, and the business he was going about seemedto him unimportant, and he reflected that he might send the labourernext day to Shuteykino. Again, as in the previous sleepless night,he thought of the saying about the camel, and then memories of allsorts crept into his mind; of the peasant who had sold him thestolen horse, of the drunken man, of the peasant women who hadbrought their samovars to him to pawn. Of course, every merchanttries to get as much as he can, but Yakov felt depressed that hewas in trade; he longed to get somewhere far away from this routine,and he felt dreary at the thought that he would have to read theevening service that day. The wind blew straight into his face andsoughed in his collar; and it seemed as though it were whisperingto him all these thoughts, bringing them from the broad white plain. . . . Looking at that plain, familiar to him from childhood, Yakovremembered that he had had just this same trouble and these samethoughts in his young days when dreams and imaginings had come uponhim and his faith had wavered.He felt miserable at being alone in the open country; he turnedback and drove slowly after the sledges, and the women laughed andsaid:"Godly has turned back."At home nothing had been cooked and the samovar was not heated onaccount of the fast, and this made the day seem very long. YakovIvanitch had long ago taken the horse to the stable, dispatched theflour to the station, and twice taken up the Psalms to read, andyet the evening was still far off. Aglaia has already washed allthe floors, and, having nothing to do, was tidying up her chest,the lid of which was pasted over on the inside with labels offbottles. Matvey, hungry and melancholy, sat reading, or went up tothe Dutch stove and slowly scrutinized the tiles which reminded himof the factory. Dashutka was asleep; then, waking up, she went totake water to the cattle. When she was getting water from the wellthe cord broke and the pail fell in. The labourer began looking fora boathook to get the pail out, and Dashutka, barefooted, with legsas red as a goose's, followed him about in the muddy snow, repeating:"It's too far!" She meant to say that the well was too deep for thehook to reach the bottom, but the labourer did not understand her,and evidently she bothered him, so that he suddenly turned aroundand abused her in unseemly language. Yakov Ivanitch, coming outthat moment into the yard, heard Dashutka answer the labourer in along rapid stream of choice abuse, which she could only have learnedfrom drunken peasants in the tavern."What are you saying, shameless girl!" he cried to her, and he waspositively aghast. "What language!"And she looked at her father in perplexity, dully, not understandingwhy she should not use those words. He would have admonished her,but she struck him as so savage and benighted; and for the firsttime he realized that she had no religion. And all this life in theforest, in the snow, with drunken peasants, with coarse oaths,seemed to him as savage and benighted as this girl, and instead ofgiving her a lecture he only waved his hand and went back into theroom.At that moment the policeman and Sergey Nikanoritch came in againto see Matvey. Yakov Ivanitch thought that these people, too, hadno religion, and that that did not trouble them in the least; andhuman life began to seem to him as strange, senseless and unenlightenedas a dog's. Bareheaded he walked about the yard, then he went outon to the road, clenching his fists. Snow was falling in big flakesat the time. His beard was blown about in the wind. He kept shakinghis head, as though there were something weighing upon his head andshoulders, as though devils were sitting on them; and it seemed tohim that it was not himself walking about, but some wild beast, ahuge terrible beast, and that if he were to cry out his voice wouldbe a roar that would sound all over the forest and the plain, andwould frighten everyone. . . .VWhen he went back into the house the policeman was no longer there,but the waiter was sitting with Matvey, counting something on thereckoning beads. He was in the habit of coming often, almost everyday, to the tavern; in old days he had come to see Yakov Ivanitch,now he came to see Matvey. He was continually reckoning on thebeads, while his face perspired and looked strained, or he wouldask for money or, stroking his whiskers, would describe how he hadonce been in a first-class station and used to prepare champagne-punchfor officers, and at grand dinners served the sturgeon-soup withhis own hands. Nothing in this world interested him but refreshmentbars, and he could only talk about things to eat, about wines andthe paraphernalia of the dinner-table. On one occasion, handing acup of tea to a young woman who was nursing her baby and wishingto say something agreeable to her, he expressed himself in thisway:"The mother's breast is the baby's refreshment bar."Reckoning with the beads in Matvey's room, he asked for money; saidhe could not go on living at Progonnaya, and several times repeatedin a tone of voice that sounded as though he were just going tocry:"Where am I to go? Where am I to go now? Tell me that, please."Then Matvey went into the kitchen and began peeling some boiledpotatoes which he had probably put away from the day before. It wasquiet, and it seemed to Yakov Ivanitch that the waiter was gone.It was past the time for evening service; he called Aglaia, and,thinking there was no one else in the house sang out aloud withoutembarrassment. He sang and read, but was inwardly pronouncing otherwords, "Lord, forgive me! Lord, save me!" and, one after another,without ceasing, he made low bows to the ground as though he wantedto exhaust himself, and he kept shaking his head, so that Aglaialooked at him with wonder. He was afraid Matvey would come in, andwas certain that he would come in, and felt an anger against himwhich he could overcome neither by prayer nor by continually bowingdown to the ground.Matvey opened the door very softly and went into the prayer-room."It's a sin, such a sin!" he said reproachfully, and heaved a sigh."Repent! Think what you are doing, brother!"Yakov Ivanitch, clenching his fists and not looking at him for fearof striking him, went quickly out of the room. Feeling himself ahuge terrible wild beast, just as he had done before on the road,he crossed the passage into the grey, dirty room, reeking with smokeand fog, in which the peasants usually drank tea, and there he spenta long time walking from one corner to the other, treading heavily,so that the crockery jingled on the shelves and the tables shook.It was clear to him now that he was himself dissatisfied with hisreligion, and could not pray as he used to do. He must repent, hemust think things over, reconsider, live and pray in some otherway. But how pray? And perhaps all this was a temptation of thedevil, and nothing of this was necessary? . . . How was it to be?What was he to do? Who could guide him? What helplessness! He stoppedand, clutching at his head, began to think, but Matvey's being nearhim prevented him from reflecting calmly. And he went rapidly intothe room.Matvey was sitting in the kitchen before a bowl of potato, eating.Close by, near the stove, Aglaia and Dashutka were sitting facingone another, spinning yarn. Between the stove and the table at whichMatvey was sitting was stretched an ironing-board; on it stood acold iron."Sister," Matvey asked, "let me have a little oil!""Who eats oil on a day like this?" asked Aglaia."I am not a monk, sister, but a layman. And in my weak health I maytake not only oil but milk.""Yes, at the factory you may have anything."Aglaia took a bottle of Lenten oil from the shelf and banged itangrily down before Matvey, with a malignant smile evidently pleasedthat he was such a sinner."But I tell you, you can't eat oil!" shouted Yakov.Aglaia and Dashutka started, but Matvey poured the oil into thebowl and went on eating as though he had not heard."I tell you, you can't eat oil!" Yakov shouted still more loudly;he turned red all over, snatched up the bowl, lifted it higher thanhis head, and dashed it with all his force to the ground, so thatit flew into fragments. "Don't dare to speak!" he cried in a furiousvoice, though Matvey had not said a word. "Don't dare!" he repeated,and struck his fist on the table.Matvey turned pale and got up."Brother!" he said, still munching--"brother, think what you areabout!""Out of my house this minute!" shouted Yakov; he loathed Matvey'swrinkled face, and his voice, and the crumbs on his moustache, andthe fact that he was munching. "Out, I tell you!""Brother, calm yourself! The pride of hell has confounded you!""Hold your tongue!" (Yakov stamped.) "Go away, you devil!""If you care to know," Matvey went on in a loud voice, as he, too,began to get angry, "you are a backslider from God and a heretic.The accursed spirits have hidden the true light from you; yourprayer is not acceptable to God. Repent before it is too late! Thedeathbed of the sinner is terrible! Repent, brother!"Yakov seized him by the shoulders and dragged him away from thetable, while he turned whiter than ever, and frightened and bewildered,began muttering, "What is it? What's the matter?" and, strugglingand making efforts to free himself from Yakov's hands, he accidentallycaught hold of his shirt near the neck and tore the collar; and itseemed to Aglaia that he was trying to beat Yakov. She uttered ashriek, snatched up the bottle of Lenten oil and with all her forcebrought it down straight on the skull of the cousin she hated.Matvey reeled, and in one instant his face became calm and indifferent.Yakov, breathing heavily, excited, and feeling pleasure at thegurgle the bottle had made, like a living thing, when it had struckthe head, kept him from falling and several times (he rememberedthis very distinctly) motioned Aglaia towards the iron with hisfinger; and only when the blood began trickling through his handsand he heard Dashutka's loud wail, and when the ironing-board fellwith a crash, and Matvey rolled heavily on it, Yakov left off feelinganger and understood what had happened."Let him rot, the factory buck!" Aglaia brought out with repulsion,still keeping the iron in her hand. The white bloodstained kerchiefslipped on to her shoulders and her grey hair fell in disorder."He's got what he deserved!"Everything was terrible. Dashutka sat on the floor near the stovewith the yarn in her hands, sobbing, and continually bowing down,uttering at each bow a gasping sound. But nothing was so terribleto Yakov as the potato in the blood, on which he was afraid ofstepping, and there was something else terrible which weighed uponhim like a bad dream and seemed the worst danger, though he couldnot take it in for the first minute. This was the waiter, SergeyNikanoritch, who was standing in the doorway with the reckoningbeads in his hands, very pale, looking with horror at what washappening in the kitchen. Only when he turned and went quickly intothe passage and from there outside, Yakov grasped who it was andfollowed him.Wiping his hands on the snow as he went, he reflected. The ideaflashed through his mind that their labourer had gone away longbefore and had asked leave to stay the night at home in the village;the day before they had killed a pig, and there were huge bloodstainsin the snow and on the sledge, and even one side of the top of thewell was splattered with blood, so that it could not have seemedsuspicious even if the whole of Yakov's family had been stainedwith blood. To conceal the murder would be agonizing, but for thepoliceman, who would whistle and smile ironically, to come from thestation, for the peasants to arrive and bind Yakov's and Aglaia'shands, and take them solemnly to the district courthouse and fromthere to the town, while everyone on the way would point at themand say mirthfully, "They are taking the Godlies!"--this seemedto Yakov more agonizing than anything, and he longed to lengthenout the time somehow, so as to endure this shame not now, but later,in the future."I can lend you a thousand roubles, . . ." he said, overtakingSergey Nikanoritch. "If you tell anyone, it will do no good. . . .There's no bringing the man back, anyway;" and with difficultykeeping up with the waiter, who did not look round, but tried towalk away faster than ever, he went on: "I can give you fifteenhundred. . . ."He stopped because he was out of breath, while Sergey Nikanoritchwalked on as quickly as ever, probably afraid that he would bekilled, too. Only after passing the railway crossing and going halfthe way from the crossing to the station, he furtively looked roundand walked more slowly. Lights, red and green, were already gleamingin the station and along the line; the wind had fallen, but flakesof snow were still coming down and the road had turned white again.But just at the station Sergey Nikanoritch stopped, thought a minute,and turned resolutely back. It was growing dark."Oblige me with the fifteen hundred, Yakov Ivanitch," he said,trembling all over. "I agree."VIYakov Ivanitch's money was in the bank of the town and was investedin second mortgages; he only kept a little at home, Just what waswanted for necessary expenses. Going into the kitchen he felt forthe matchbox, and while the sulphur was burning with a blue lighthe had time to make out the figure of Matvey, which was still lyingon the floor near the table, but now it was covered with a whitesheet, and nothing could be seen but his boots. A cricket waschirruping. Aglaia and Dashutka were not in the room, they wereboth sitting behind the counter in the tea-room, spinning yarn insilence. Yakov Ivanitch crossed to his own room with a little lampin his hand, and pulled from under the bed a little box in whichhe kept his money. This time there were in it four hundred andtwenty one-rouble notes and silver to the amount of thirty-fiveroubles; the notes had an unpleasant heavy smell. Putting the moneytogether in his cap, Yakov Ivanitch went out into the yard and thenout of the gate. He walked, looking from side to side, but therewas no sign of the waiter."Hi!" cried Yakov.A dark figure stepped out from the barrier at the railway crossingand came irresolutely towards him."Why do you keep walking about?" said Yakov with vexation, as herecognized the waiter. "Here you are; there is a little less thanfive hundred. . . . I've no more in the house.""Very well; . . . very grateful to you," muttered Sergey Nikanoritch,taking the money greedily and stuffing it into his pockets. He wastrembling all over, and that was perceptible in spite of the darkness."Don't worry yourself, Yakov Ivanitch. . . . What should I chatterfor: I came and went away, that's all I've had to do with it. Asthe saying is, I know nothing and I can tell nothing . . ." And atonce he added with a sigh "Cursed life!"For a minute they stood in silence, without looking at each other."So it all came from a trifle, goodness knows how, . . ." said thewaiter, trembling. "I was sitting counting to myself when all atonce a noise. . . . I looked through the door, and just on accountof Lenten oil you. . . . Where is he now?""Lying there in the kitchen.""You ought to take him somewhere. . . . Why put it off?"Yakov accompanied him to the station without a word, then went homeagain and harnessed the horse to take Matvey to Limarovo. He haddecided to take him to the forest of Limarovo, and to leave himthere on the road, and then he would tell everyone that Matvey hadgone off to Vedenyapino and had not come back, and then everyonewould think that he had been killed by someone on the road. He knewthere was no deceiving anyone by this, but to move, to do something,to be active, was not as agonizing as to sit still and wait. Hecalled Dashutka, and with her carried Matvey out. Aglaia stayedbehind to clean up the kitchen.When Yakov and Dashutka turned back they were detained at the railwaycrossing by the barrier being let down. A long goods train waspassing, dragged by two engines, breathing heavily, and flingingpuffs of crimson fire out of their funnels.The foremost engine uttered a piercing whistle at the crossing insight of the station."It's whistling, . . ." said Dashutka.The train had passed at last, and the signalman lifted the barrierwithout haste."Is that you, Yakov Ivanitch? I didn't know you, so you'll be rich."And then when they had reached home they had to go to bed.Aglaia and Dashutka made themselves a bed in the tea-room and laydown side by side, while Yakov stretched himself on the counter.They neither said their prayers nor lighted the ikon lamp beforelying down to sleep. All three lay awake till morning, but did notutter a single word, and it seemed to them that all night someonewas walking about in the empty storey overhead.Two days later a police inspector and the examining magistrate camefrom the town and made a search, first in Matvey's room and thenin the whole tavern. They questioned Yakov first of all, and hetestified that on the Monday Matvey had gone to Vedenyapino toconfess, and that he must have been killed by the sawyers who wereworking on the line.And when the examining magistrate had asked him how it had happenedthat Matvey was found on the road, while his cap had turned up athome--surely he had not gone to Vedenyapino without his cap?--and why they had not found a single drop of blood beside him in thesnow on the road, though his head was smashed in and his face andchest were black with blood, Yakov was confused, lost his head andanswered:"I cannot tell."And just what Yakov had so feared happened: the policeman came, thedistrict police officer smoked in the prayer-room and Aglaia fellupon him with abuse and was rude to the police inspector; andafterwards when Yakov and Aglaia were led out to the yard, thepeasants crowded at the gates and said, "They are taking the Godlies!"and it seemed that they were all glad.At the inquiry the policeman stated positively that Yakov and Aglaiahad killed Matvey in order not to share with him, and that Matveyhad money of his own, and that if it was not found at the searchevidently Yakov and Aglaia had got hold of it. And Dashutka wasquestioned. She said that Uncle Matvey and Aunt Aglaia quarrelledand almost fought every day over money, and that Uncle Matvey wasrich, so much so that he had given someone--"his Darling"--ninehundred roubles.Dashutka was left alone in the tavern. No one came now to drink teaor vodka, and she divided her time between cleaning up the rooms,drinking mead and eating rolls; but a few days later they questionedthe signalman at the railway crossing, and he said that late onMonday evening he had seen Yakov and Dashutka driving from Limarovo.Dashutka, too, was arrested, taken to the town and put in prison.It soon became known, from what Aglaia said, that Sergey Nikanoritchhad been present at the murder. A search was made in his room, andmoney was found in an unusual place, in his snowboots under thestove, and the money was all in small change, three hundred one-roublenotes. He swore he had made this money himself, and that he hadn'tbeen in the tavern for a year, but witnesses testified that he waspoor and had been in great want of money of late, and that he usedto go every day to the tavern to borrow from Matvey; and the policemandescribed how on the day of the murder he had himself gone twiceto the tavern with the waiter to help him to borrow. It was recalledat this juncture that on Monday evening Sergey Nikanoritch had notbeen there to meet the passenger train, but had gone off somewhere.And he, too, was arrested and taken to the town.The trial took place eleven months later.Yakov Ivanitch looked much older and much thinner, and spoke in alow voice like a sick man. He felt weak, pitiful, lower in staturethat anyone else, and it seemed as though his soul, too, like hisbody, had grown older and wasted, from the pangs of his conscienceand from the dreams and imaginings which never left him all thewhile he was in prison. When it came out that he did not go tochurch the president of the court asked him:"Are you a dissenter?""I can't tell," he answered.He had no religion at all now; he knew nothing and understoodnothing; and his old belief was hateful to him now, and seemed tohim darkness and folly. Aglaia was not in the least subdued, andshe still went on abusing the dead man, blaming him for all theirmisfortunes. Sergey Nikanoritch had grown a beard instead of whiskers.At the trial he was red and perspiring, and was evidently ashamedof his grey prison coat and of sitting on the same bench with humblepeasants. He defended himself awkwardly, and, trying to prove thathe had not been to the tavern for a whole year, got into an altercationwith every witness, and the spectators laughed at him. Dashutka hadgrown fat in prison. At the trial she did not understand the questionsput to her, and only said that when they killed Uncle Matvey shewas dreadfully frightened, but afterwards she did not mind.All four were found guilty of murder with mercenary motives. YakovIvanitch was sentenced to penal servitude for twenty years; Aglaiafor thirteen and a half; Sergey Nikanoritch to ten; Dashutka tosix.VIILate one evening a foreign steamer stopped in the roads of Due inSahalin and asked for coal. The captain was asked to wait tillmorning, but he did not want to wait over an hour, saying that ifthe weather changed for the worse in the night there would be arisk of his having to go off without coal. In the Gulf of Tartarythe weather is liable to violent changes in the course of half anhour, and then the shores of Sahalin are dangerous. And already ithad turned fresh, and there was a considerable sea running.A gang of convicts were sent to the mine from the Voevodsky prison,the grimmest and most forbidding of all the prisons in Sahalin. Thecoal had to be loaded upon barges, and then they had to be towedby a steam-cutter alongside the steamer which was anchored morethan a quarter of a mile from the coast, and then the unloading andreloading had to begin--an exhausting task when the barge keptrocking against the steamer and the men could scarcely keep on theirlegs for sea-sickness. The convicts, only just roused from theirsleep, still drowsy, went along the shore, stumbling in the darknessand clanking their fetters. On the left, scarcely visible, was atall, steep, extremely gloomy-looking cliff, while on the rightthere was a thick impenetrable mist, in which the sea moaned witha prolonged monotonous sound, "Ah! . . . ah! . . . ah! . . . ah!. . ." And it was only when the overseer was lighting his pipe,casting as he did so a passing ray of light on the escort with agun and on the coarse faces of two or three of the nearest convicts,or when he went with his lantern close to the water that the whitecrests of the foremost waves could be discerned.One of this gang was Yakov Ivanitch, nicknamed among the convictsthe "Brush," on account of his long beard. No one had addressed himby his name or his father's name for a long time now; they calledhim simply Yashka.He was here in disgrace, as, three months after coming to Siberia,feeling an intense irresistible longing for home, he had succumbedto temptation and run away; he had soon been caught, had beensentenced to penal servitude for life and given forty lashes. Thenhe was punished by flogging twice again for losing his prisonclothes, though on each occasion they were stolen from him. Thelonging for home had begun from the very time he had been broughtto Odessa, and the convict train had stopped in the night atProgonnaya; and Yakov, pressing to the window, had tried to see hisown home, and could see nothing in the darkness. He had no one withwhom to talk of home. His sister Aglaia had been sent right acrossSiberia, and he did not know where she was now. Dashutka was inSahalin, but she had been sent to live with some ex-convict in afar away settlement; there was no news of her except that once asettler who had come to the Voevodsky Prison told Yakov that Dashutkahad three children. Sergey Nikanoritch was serving as a footman ata government official's at Due, but he could not reckon on everseeing him, as he was ashamed of being acquainted with convicts ofthe peasant class.The gang reached the mine, and the men took their places on thequay. It was said there would not be any loading, as the weatherkept getting worse and the steamer was meaning to set off. Theycould see three lights. One of them was moving: that was thesteam-cutter going to the steamer, and it seemed to be coming backto tell them whether the work was to be done or not. Shivering withthe autumn cold and the damp sea mist, wrapping himself in his shorttorn coat, Yakov Ivanitch looked intently without blinking in thedirection in which lay his home. Ever since he had lived in prisontogether with men banished here from all ends of the earth--withRussians, Ukrainians, Tatars, Georgians, Chinese, Gypsies, Jews--and ever since he had listened to their talk and watched theirsufferings, he had begun to turn again to God, and it seemed to himat last that he had learned the true faith for which all his family,from his grandmother Avdotya down, had so thirsted, which they hadsought so long and which they had never found. He knew it all nowand understood where God was, and how He was to be served, and theonly thing he could not understand was why men's destinies were sodiverse, why this simple faith which other men receive from God fornothing and together with their lives, had cost him such a pricethat his arms and legs trembled like a drunken man's from all thehorrors and agonies which as far as he could see would go on withouta break to the day of his death. He looked with strained eyes intothe darkness, and it seemed to him that through the thousand milesof that mist he could see home, could see his native province, hisdistrict, Progonnaya, could see the darkness, the savagery, theheartlessness, and the dull, sullen, animal indifference of the menhe had left there. His eyes were dimmed with tears; but still hegazed into the distance where the pale lights of the steamer faintlygleamed, and his heart ached with yearning for home, and he longedto live, to go back home to tell them there of his new faith andto save from ruin if only one man, and to live without sufferingif only for one day.The cutter arrived, and the overseer announced in a loud voice thatthere would be no loading."Back!" he commanded. "Steady!"They could hear the hoisting of the anchor chain on the steamer. Astrong piercing wind was blowing by now; somewhere on the steepcliff overhead the trees were creaking. Most likely a storm wascoming.UPROOTED_An Incident of My Travels_I WAS on my way back from evening service. The clock in the belfryof the Svyatogorsky Monastery pealed out its soft melodious chimesby way of prelude and then struck twelve. The great courtyard ofthe monastery stretched out at the foot of the Holy Mountains onthe banks of the Donets, and, enclosed by the high hostel buildingsas by a wall, seemed now in the night, when it was lighted up onlyby dim lanterns, lights in the windows, and the stars, a livinghotch-potch full of movement, sound, and the most original confusion.From end to end, so far as the eye could see, it was all choked upwith carts, old-fashioned coaches and chaises, vans, tilt-carts,about which stood crowds of horses, dark and white, and horned oxen,while people bustled about, and black long-skirted lay brothersthreaded their way in and out in all directions. Shadows and streaksof light cast from the windows moved over the carts and the headsof men and horses, and in the dense twilight this all assumed themost monstrous capricious shapes: here the tilted shafts stretchedupwards to the sky, here eyes of fire appeared in the face of ahorse, there a lay brother grew a pair of black wings. . . . Therewas the noise of talk, the snorting and munching of horses, thecreaking of carts, the whimpering of children. Fresh crowds keptwalking in at the gate and belated carts drove up.The pines which were piled up on the overhanging mountain, one aboveanother, and leaned towards the roof of the hostel, gazed into thecourtyard as into a deep pit, and listened in wonder; in their darkthicket the cuckoos and nightingales never ceased calling. . . .Looking at the confusion, listening to the uproar, one fancied thatin this living hotch-potch no one understood anyone, that everyonewas looking for something and would not find it, and that thismultitude of carts, chaises and human beings could not ever succeedin getting off.More than ten thousand people flocked to the Holy Mountains for thefestivals of St. John the Divine and St. Nikolay the wonder-worker.Not only the hostel buildings, but even the bakehouse, the tailoringroom, the carpenter's shop, the carriage house, were filled tooverflowing. . . . Those who had arrived towards night clusteredlike flies in autumn, by the walls, round the wells in the yard,or in the narrow passages of the hostel, waiting to be shown aresting-place for the night. The lay brothers, young and old, werein an incessant movement, with no rest or hope of being relieved.By day or late at night they produced the same impression of menhastening somewhere and agitated by something, yet, in spite oftheir extreme exhaustion, their faces remained full of courage andkindly welcome, their voices friendly, their movements rapid. . . .For everyone who came they had to find a place to sleep, and toprovide food and drink; to those who were deaf, slow to understand,or profuse in questions, they had to give long and wearisomeexplanations, to tell them why there were no empty rooms, at whato'clock the service was to be where holy bread was sold, and so on.They had to run, to carry, to talk incessantly, but more than that,they had to be polite, too, to be tactful, to try to arrange thatthe Greeks from Mariupol, accustomed to live more comfortably thanthe Little Russians, should be put with other Greeks, that someshopkeeper from Bahmut or Lisitchansk, dressed like a lady, shouldnot be offended by being put with peasants. There were continualcries of: "Father, kindly give us some kvass! Kindly give us somehay!" or "Father, may I drink water after confession?" And the laybrother would have to give out kvass or hay or to answer: "Addressyourself to the priest, my good woman, we have not the authorityto give permission." Another question would follow, "Where is thepriest then?" and the lay brother would have to explain where wasthe priest's cell. With all this bustling activity, he yet had tomake time to go to service in the church, to serve in the partdevoted to the gentry, and to give full answers to the mass ofnecessary and unnecessary questions which pilgrims of the educatedclass are fond of showering about them. Watching them during thecourse of twenty-four hours, I found it hard to imagine when theseblack moving figures sat down and when they slept.When, coming back from the evening service, I went to the hostelin which a place had been assigned me, the monk in charge of thesleeping quarters was standing in the doorway, and beside him, onthe steps, was a group of several men and women dressed liketownsfolk."Sir," said the monk, stopping me, "will you be so good as to allowthis young man to pass the night in your room? If you would do usthe favour! There are so many people and no place left--it isreally dreadful!"And he indicated a short figure in a light overcoat and a strawhat. I consented, and my chance companion followed me. Unlockingthe little padlock on my door, I was always, whether I wanted toor not, obliged to look at the picture that hung on the doorposton a level with my face. This picture with the title, "A Meditationon Death," depicted a monk on his knees, gazing at a coffin and ata skeleton laying in it. Behind the man's back stood another skeleton,somewhat more solid and carrying a scythe."There are no bones like that," said my companion, pointing to theplace in the skeleton where there ought to have been a pelvis."Speaking generally, you know, the spiritual fare provided for thepeople is not of the first quality," he added, and heaved throughhis nose a long and very melancholy sigh, meant to show me that Ihad to do with a man who really knew something about spiritual fare.While I was looking for the matches to light a candle he sighedonce more and said:"When I was in Harkov I went several times to the anatomy theatreand saw the bones there; I have even been in the mortuary. Am I notin your way?"My room was small and poky, with neither table nor chairs in it,but quite filled up with a chest of drawers by the window, the stoveand two little wooden sofas which stood against the walls, facingone another, leaving a narrow space to walk between them. Thinrusty-looking little mattresses lay on the little sofas, as wellas my belongings. There were two sofas, so this room was evidentlyintended for two, and I pointed out the fact to my companion."They will soon be ringing for mass, though," he said, "and I shan'thave to be in your way very long."Still under the impression that he was in my way and feeling awkward,he moved with a guilty step to his little sofa, sighed guiltily andsat down. When the tallow candle with its dim, dilatory flame hadleft off flickering and burned up sufficiently to make us bothvisible, I could make out what he was like. He was a young man oftwo-and-twenty, with a round and pleasing face, dark childlike eyes,dressed like a townsman in grey cheap clothes, and as one couldjudge from his complexion and narrow shoulders, not used to manuallabour. He was of a very indefinite type; one could take him neitherfor a student nor for a man in trade, still less for a workman. Butlooking at his attractive face and childlike friendly eyes, I wasunwilling to believe he was one of those vagabond impostors withwhom every conventual establishment where they give food and lodgingis flooded, and who give themselves out as divinity students,expelled for standing up for justice, or for church singers whohave lost their voice. . . . There was something characteristic,typical, very familiar in his face, but what exactly, I could notremember nor make out.For a long time he sat silent, pondering. Probably because I hadnot shown appreciation of his remarks about bones and the mortuary,he thought that I was ill-humoured and displeased at his presence.Pulling a sausage out of his pocket, he turned it about before hiseyes and said irresolutely:"Excuse my troubling you, . . . have you a knife?"I gave him a knife."The sausage is disgusting," he said, frowning and cutting himselfoff a little bit. "In the shop here they sell you rubbish and fleeceyou horribly. . . . I would offer you a piece, but you would scarcelycare to consume it. Will you have some?"In his language, too, there was something typical that had a verygreat deal in common with what was characteristic in his face, butwhat it was exactly I still could not decide. To inspire confidenceand to show that I was not ill-humoured, I took some of the profferedsausage. It certainly was horrible; one needed the teeth of a goodhouse-dog to deal with it. As we worked our jaws we got intoconversation; we began complaining to each other of the lengthinessof the service."The rule here approaches that of Mount Athos," I said; "but atAthos the night services last ten hours, and on great feast-days--fourteen! You should go there for prayers!""Yes," answered my companion, and he wagged his head, "I have beenhere for three weeks. And you know, every day services, every dayservices. On ordinary days at midnight they ring for matins, atfive o'clock for early mass, at nine o'clock for late mass. Sleepis utterly out of the question. In the daytime there are hymns ofpraise, special prayers, vespers. . . . And when I was preparingfor the sacrament I was simply dropping from exhaustion." He sighedand went on: "And it's awkward not to go to church. . . . The monksgive one a room, feed one, and, you know, one is ashamed not to go.One wouldn't mind standing it for a day or two, perhaps, but threeweeks is too much--much too much! Are you here for long?""I am going to-morrow evening.""But I am staying another fortnight.""But I thought it was not the rule to stay for so long here?" Isaid."Yes, that's true: if anyone stays too long, sponging on the monks,he is asked to go. Judge for yourself, if the proletariat wereallowed to stay on here as long as they liked there would never bea room vacant, and they would eat up the whole monastery. That'strue. But the monks make an exception for me, and I hope they won'tturn me out for some time. You know I am a convert.""You mean?""I am a Jew baptized. . . . Only lately I have embraced orthodoxy."Now I understood what I had before been utterly unable to understandfrom his face: his thick lips, and his way of twitching up the rightcorner of his mouth and his right eyebrow, when he was talking, andthat peculiar oily brilliance of his eyes which is only found inJews. I understood, too, his phraseology. . . . From furtherconversation I learned that his name was Alexandr Ivanitch, and hadin the past been Isaac, that he was a native of the Mogilev province,and that he had come to the Holy Mountains from Novotcherkassk,where he had adopted the orthodox faith.Having finished his sausage, Alexandr Ivanitch got up, and, raisinghis right eyebrow, said his prayer before the ikon. The eyebrowremained up when he sat down again on the little sofa and begangiving me a brief account of his long biography."From early childhood I cherished a love for learning," he beganin a tone which suggested he was not speaking of himself, but ofsome great man of the past. "My parents were poor Hebrews; theyexist by buying and selling in a small way; they live like beggars,you know, in filth. In fact, all the people there are poor andsuperstitious; they don't like education, because education, verynaturally, turns a man away from religion. . . . They are fearfulfanatics. . . . Nothing would induce my parents to let me be educated,and they wanted me to take to trade, too, and to know nothing butthe Talmud. . . . But you will agree, it is not everyone who canspend his whole life struggling for a crust of bread, wallowing infilth, and mumbling the Talmud. At times officers and countrygentlemen would put up at papa's inn, and they used to talk a greatdeal of things which in those days I had never dreamed of; and, ofcourse, it was alluring and moved me to envy. I used to cry andentreat them to send me to school, but they taught me to read Hebrewand nothing more. Once I found a Russian newspaper, and took ithome with me to make a kite of it. I was beaten for it, though Icouldn't read Russian. Of course, fanaticism is inevitable, forevery people instinctively strives to preserve its nationality, butI did not know that then and was very indignant. . . ."Having made such an intellectual observation, Isaac, as he had been,raised his right eyebrow higher than ever in his satisfaction andlooked at me, as it were, sideways, like a cock at a grain of corn,with an air as though he would say: "Now at last you see for certainthat I am an intellectual man, don't you?" After saying somethingmore about fanaticism and his irresistible yearning for enlightenment,he went on:"What could I do? I ran away to Smolensk. And there I had a cousinwho relined saucepans and made tins. Of course, I was glad to workunder him, as I had nothing to live upon; I was barefoot and inrags. . . . I thought I could work by day and study at night andon Saturdays. And so I did, but the police found out I had nopassport and sent me back by stages to my father. . . ."Alexandr Ivanitch shrugged one shoulder and sighed."What was one to do?" he went on, and the more vividly the pastrose up before his mind, the more marked his Jewish accent became."My parents punished me and handed me over to my grandfather, afanatical old Jew, to be reformed. But I went off at night to Shklov.And when my uncle tried to catch me in Shklov, I went off to Mogilev;there I stayed two days and then I went off to Starodub with acomrade."Later on he mentioned in his story Gonel, Kiev, Byelaya, Tserkov,Uman, Balt, Bendery and at last reached Odessa."In Odessa I wandered about for a whole week, out of work and hungry,till I was taken in by some Jews who went about the town buyingsecond-hand clothes. I knew how to read and write by then, and haddone arithmetic up to fractions, and I wanted to go to studysomewhere, but I had not the means. What was I to do? For six monthsI went about Odessa buying old clothes, but the Jews paid me nowages, the rascals. I resented it and left them. Then I went bysteamer to Perekop.""What for?""Oh, nothing. A Greek promised me a job there. In short, till I wassixteen I wandered about like that with no definite work and noroots till I got to Poltava. There a student, a Jew, found out thatI wanted to study, and gave me a letter to the Harkov students. Ofcourse, I went to Harkov. The students consulted together and beganto prepare me for the technical school. And, you know, I must saythe students that I met there were such that I shall never forgetthem to the day of my death. To say nothing of their giving me foodand lodging, they set me on the right path, they made me think,showed me the object of life. Among them were intellectual remarkablepeople who by now are celebrated. For instance, you have heard ofGrumaher, haven't you?""No, I haven't.""You haven't! He wrote very clever articles in the _Harkov Gazette_,and was preparing to be a professor. Well, I read a great deal andattended the student's societies, where you hear nothing that iscommonplace. I was working up for six months, but as one has tohave been through the whole high-school course of mathematics toenter the technical school, Grumaher advised me to try for theveterinary institute, where they admit high-school boys from thesixth form. Of course, I began working for it. I did not want tobe a veterinary surgeon but they told me that after finishing thecourse at the veterinary institute I should be admitted to thefaculty of medicine without examination. I learnt all Kuehner; Icould read Cornelius Nepos, _a livre ouvert_; and in Greek I readthrough almost all Curtius. But, you know, one thing and another,. . . the students leaving and the uncertainty of my position, andthen I heard that my mamma had come and was looking for me all overHarkov. Then I went away. What was I to do? But luckily I learnedthat there was a school of mines here on the Donets line. Why shouldI not enter that? You know the school of mines qualifies one as amining foreman--a splendid berth. I know of mines where the foremenget a salary of fifteen hundred a year. Capital. . . . I enteredit. . . ."With an expression of reverent awe on his face Alexandr Ivanitchenumerated some two dozen abstruse sciences in which instructionwas given at the school of mines; he described the school itself,the construction of the shafts, and the condition of the miners. . . .Then he told me a terrible story which sounded like an invention,though I could not help believing it, for his tone in telling itwas too genuine and the expression of horror on his Semitic facewas too evidently sincere."While I was doing the practical work, I had such an accident oneday!" he said, raising both eyebrows. "I was at a mine here in theDonets district. You have seen, I dare say, how people are let downinto the mine. You remember when they start the horse and set thegates moving one bucket on the pulley goes down into the mine, whilethe other comes up; when the first begins to come up, then thesecond goes down--exactly like a well with two pails. Well, oneday I got into the bucket, began going down, and can you fancy, allat once I heard, Trrr! The chain had broken and I flew to the deviltogether with the bucket and the broken bit of chain. . . . I fellfrom a height of twenty feet, flat on my chest and stomach, whilethe bucket, being heavier, reached the bottom before me, and I hitthis shoulder here against its edge. I lay, you know, stunned. Ithought I was killed, and all at once I saw a fresh calamity: theother bucket, which was going up, having lost the counter-balancingweight, was coming down with a crash straight upon me. . . . Whatwas I to do? Seeing the position, I squeezed closer to the wall,crouching and waiting for the bucket to come full crush next minuteon my head. I thought of papa and mamma and Mogilev and Grumaher.. . . I prayed. . . . But happily . . . it frightens me even tothink of it. . . ."Alexandr Ivanitch gave a constrained smile and rubbed his foreheadwith his hand."But happily it fell beside me and only caught this side a little.. . . It tore off coat, shirt and skin, you know, from this side.. . . The force of it was terrific. I was unconscious after it.They got me out and sent me to the hospital. I was there four months,and the doctors there said I should go into consumption. I alwayshave a cough now and a pain in my chest. And my psychic conditionis terrible. . . . When I am alone in a room I feel overcome withterror. Of course, with my health in that state, to be a miningforeman is out of the question. I had to give up the school ofmines. . . .""And what are you doing now?" I asked."I have passed my examination as a village schoolmaster. Now Ibelong to the orthodox church, and I have a right to be a teacher.In Novotcherkassk, where I was baptized, they took a great interestin me and promised me a place in a church parish school. I am goingthere in a fortnight, and shall ask again."Alexandr Ivanitch took off his overcoat and remained in a shirtwith an embroidered Russian collar and a worsted belt."It is time for bed," he said, folding his overcoat for a pillow,and yawning. "Till lately, you know, I had no knowledge of God atall. I was an atheist. When I was lying in the hospital I thoughtof religion, and began reflecting on that subject. In my opinion,there is only one religion possible for a thinking man, and thatis the Christian religion. If you don't believe in Christ, thenthere is nothing else to believe in, . . . is there? Judaism hasoutlived its day, and is preserved only owing to the peculiaritiesof the Jewish race. When civilization reaches the Jews there willnot be a trace of Judaism left. All young Jews are atheists now,observe. The New Testament is the natural continuation of the Old,isn't it?"I began trying to find out the reasons which had led him to takeso grave and bold a step as the change of religion, but he keptrepeating the same, "The New Testament is the natural continuationof the Old"--a formula obviously not his own, but acquired--which did not explain the question in the least. In spite of myefforts and artifices, the reasons remained obscure. If one couldbelieve that he had embraced Orthodoxy from conviction, as he saidhe had done, what was the nature and foundation of this convictionit was impossible to grasp from his words. It was equally impossibleto assume that he had changed his religion from interested motives:his cheap shabby clothes, his going on living at the expense of theconvent, and the uncertainty of his future, did not look likeinterested motives. There was nothing for it but to accept the ideathat my companion had been impelled to change his religion by thesame restless spirit which had flung him like a chip of wood fromtown to town, and which he, using the generally accepted formula,called the craving for enlightenment.Before going to bed I went into the corridor to get a drink ofwater. When I came back my companion was standing in the middle ofthe room, and he looked at me with a scared expression. His facelooked a greyish white, and there were drops of perspiration on hisforehead."My nerves are in an awful state," he muttered with a sickly smile,"awful! It's acute psychological disturbance. But that's of noconsequence."And he began reasoning again that the New Testament was a naturalcontinuation of the Old, that Judaism has outlived its day. . . .Picking out his phrases, he seemed to be trying to put together theforces of his conviction and to smother with them the uneasinessof his soul, and to prove to himself that in giving up the religionof his fathers he had done nothing dreadful or peculiar, but hadacted as a thinking man free from prejudice, and that therefore hecould boldly remain in a room all alone with his conscience. He wastrying to convince himself, and with his eyes besought my assistance.Meanwhile a big clumsy wick had burned up on our tallow candle. Itwas by now getting light. At the gloomy little window, which wasturning blue, we could distinctly see both banks of the Donets Riverand the oak copse beyond the river. It was time to sleep."It will be very interesting here to-morrow," said my companionwhen I put out the candle and went to bed. "After early mass, theprocession will go in boats from the Monastery to the Hermitage."Raising his right eyebrow and putting his head on one side, heprayed before the ikons, and, without undressing, lay down on hislittle sofa."Yes," he said, turning over on the other side."Why yes?" I asked."When I accepted orthodoxy in Novotcherkassk my mother was lookingfor me in Rostov. She felt that I meant to change my religion," hesighed, and went on: "It is six years since I was there in theprovince of Mogilev. My sister must be married by now."After a short silence, seeing that I was still awake, he begantalking quietly of how they soon, thank God, would give him a job,and that at last he would have a home of his own, a settled position,his daily bread secure. . . . And I was thinking that this man wouldnever have a home of his own, nor a settled position, nor his dailybread secure. He dreamed aloud of a village school as of the PromisedLand; like the majority of people, he had a prejudice against awandering life, and regarded it as something exceptional, abnormaland accidental, like an illness, and was looking for salvation inordinary workaday life. The tone of his voice betrayed that he wasconscious of his abnormal position and regretted it. He seemed asit were apologizing and justifying himself.Not more than a yard from me lay a homeless wanderer; in the roomsof the hostels and by the carts in the courtyard among the pilgrimssome hundreds of such homeless wanderers were waiting for themorning, and further away, if one could picture to oneself the wholeof Russia, a vast multitude of such uprooted creatures was pacingat that moment along highroads and side-tracks, seeking somethingbetter, or were waiting for the dawn, asleep in wayside inns andlittle taverns, or on the grass under the open sky. . . . As I fellasleep I imagined how amazed and perhaps even overjoyed all thesepeople would have been if reasoning and words could be found toprove to them that their life was as little in need of justificationas any other. In my sleep I heard a bell ring outside as plaintivelyas though shedding bitter tears, and the lay brother calling outseveral times:"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon us! Come to mass!"When I woke up my companion was not in the room. It was sunny andthere was a murmur of the crowds through the window. Going out, Ilearned that mass was over and that the procession had set off forthe Hermitage some time before. The people were wandering in crowdsupon the river bank and, feeling at liberty, did not know what todo with themselves: they could not eat or drink, as the late masswas not yet over at the Hermitage; the Monastery shops where pilgrimsare so fond of crowding and asking prices were still shut. In spiteof their exhaustion, many of them from sheer boredom were trudgingto the Hermitage. The path from the Monastery to the Hermitage,towards which I directed my steps, twined like a snake along thehigh steep bank, going up and down and threading in and out amongthe oaks and pines. Below, the Donets gleamed, reflecting the sun;above, the rugged chalk cliff stood up white with bright green onthe top from the young foliage of oaks and pines, which, hangingone above another, managed somehow to grow on the vertical cliffwithout falling. The pilgrims trailed along the path in single file,one behind another. The majority of them were Little Russians fromthe neighbouring districts, but there were many from a distance,too, who had come on foot from the provinces of Kursk and Orel; inthe long string of varied colours there were Greek settlers, too,from Mariupol, strongly built, sedate and friendly people, utterlyunlike their weakly and degenerate compatriots who fill our southernseaside towns. There were men from the Donets, too, with red stripeson their breeches, and emigrants from the Tavritchesky province.There were a good many pilgrims of a nondescript class, like myAlexandr Ivanitch; what sort of people they were and where theycame from it was impossible to tell from their faces, from theirclothes, or from their speech. The path ended at the littlelanding-stage, from which a narrow road went to the left to theHermitage, cutting its way through the mountain. At the landing-stagestood two heavy big boats of a forbidding aspect, like the NewZealand pirogues which one may see in the works of Jules Verne. Oneboat with rugs on the seats was destined for the clergy and thesingers, the other without rugs for the public. When the processionwas returning I found myself among the elect who had succeeded insqueezing themselves into the second. There were so many of theelect that the boat scarcely moved, and one had to stand all theway without stirring and to be careful that one's hat was notcrushed. The route was lovely. Both banks--one high, steep andwhite, with overhanging pines and oaks, with the crowds hurryingback along the path, and the other shelving, with green meadows andan oak copse bathed in sunshine--looked as happy and rapturousas though the May morning owed its charm only to them. The reflectionof the sun in the rapidly flowing Donets quivered and raced awayin all directions, and its long rays played on the chasubles, onthe banners and on the drops splashed up by the oars. The singingof the Easter hymns, the ringing of the bells, the splash of theoars in the water, the calls of the birds, all mingled in the airinto something tender and harmonious. The boat with the priests andthe banners led the way; at its helm the black figure of a laybrother stood motionless as a statue.When the procession was getting near the Monastery, I noticedAlexandr Ivanitch among the elect. He was standing in front of themall, and, his mouth wide open with pleasure and his right eyebrowcocked up, was gazing at the procession. His face was beaming;probably at such moments, when there were so many people round himand it was so bright, he was satisfied with himself, his new religion,and his conscience.When a little later we were sitting in our room, drinking tea, hestill beamed with satisfaction; his face showed that he was satisfiedboth with the tea and with me, that he fully appreciated my beingan intellectual, but that he would know how to play his part withcredit if any intellectual topic turned up. . . ."Tell me, what psychology ought I to read?" he began an intellectualconversation, wrinkling up his nose."Why, what do you want it for?""One cannot be a teacher without a knowledge of psychology. Beforeteaching a boy I ought to understand his soul."I told him that psychology alone would not be enough to make oneunderstand a boy's soul, and moreover psychology for a teacher whohad not yet mastered the technical methods of instruction in reading,writing, and arithmetic would be a luxury as superfluous as thehigher mathematics. He readily agreed with me, and began describinghow hard and responsible was the task of a teacher, how hard it wasto eradicate in the boy the habitual tendency to evil and superstition,to make him think honestly and independently, to instil into himtrue religion, the ideas of personal dignity, of freedom, and soon. In answer to this I said something to him. He agreed again. Heagreed very readily, in fact. Obviously his brain had not a veryfirm grasp of all these "intellectual subjects."Up to the time of my departure we strolled together about theMonastery, whiling away the long hot day. He never left my side aminute; whether he had taken a fancy to me or was afraid of solitude,God only knows! I remember we sat together under a clump of yellowacacia in one of the little gardens that are scattered on themountain side."I am leaving here in a fortnight," he said; "it is high time.""Are you going on foot?""From here to Slavyansk I shall walk, then by railway to Nikitovka;from Nikitovka the Donets line branches off, and along that branchline I shall walk as far as Hatsepetovka, and there a railway guard,I know, will help me on my way."I thought of the bare, deserted steppe between Nikitovka andHatsepetovka, and pictured to myself Alexandr Ivanitch stridingalong it, with his doubts, his homesickness, and his fear of solitude. . . . He read boredom in my face, and sighed."And my sister must be married by now," he said, thinking aloud,and at once, to shake off melancholy thoughts, pointed to the topof the rock and said:"From that mountain one can see Izyum."As we were walking up the mountain he had a little misfortune. Isuppose he stumbled, for he slit his cotton trousers and tore thesole of his shoe."Tss!" he said, frowning as he took off a shoe and exposed a barefoot without a stocking. "How unpleasant! . . . That's a complication,you know, which . . . Yes!"Turning the shoe over and over before his eyes, as though unableto believe that the sole was ruined for ever, he spent a long timefrowning, sighing, and clicking with his tongue.I had in my trunk a pair of boots, old but fashionable, with pointedtoes and laces. I had brought them with me in case of need, andonly wore them in wet weather. When we got back to our room I madeup a phrase as diplomatic as I could and offered him these boots.He accepted them and said with dignity:"I should thank you, but I know that you consider thanks a convention."He was pleased as a child with the pointed toes and the laces, andeven changed his plans."Now I shall go to Novotcherkassk in a week, and not in a fortnight,"he said, thinking aloud. "In shoes like these I shall not be ashamedto show myself to my godfather. I was not going away from here justbecause I hadn't any decent clothes. . . ."When the coachman was carrying out my trunk, a lay brother with agood ironical face came in to sweep out the room. Alexandr Ivanitchseemed flustered and embarrassed and asked him timidly:"Am I to stay here or go somewhere else?"He could not make up his mind to occupy a whole room to himself,and evidently by now was feeling ashamed of living at the expenseof the Monastery. He was very reluctant to part from me; to put offbeing lonely as long as possible, he asked leave to see me on myway.The road from the Monastery, which had been excavated at the costof no little labour in the chalk mountain, moved upwards, goingalmost like a spiral round the mountain, over roots and under sullenoverhanging pines. . . .The Donets was the first to vanish from our sight, after it theMonastery yard with its thousands of people, and then the greenroofs. . . . Since I was mounting upwards everything seemed vanishinginto a pit. The cross on the church, burnished by the rays of thesetting sun, gleamed brightly in the abyss and vanished. Nothingwas left but the oaks, the pines, and the white road. But then ourcarriage came out on a level country, and that was all left belowand behind us. Alexandr Ivanitch jumped out and, smiling mournfully,glanced at me for the last time with his childish eyes, and vanishedfrom me for ever. . . .The impressions of the Holy Mountains had already become memories,and I saw something new: the level plain, the whitish-brown distance,the way side copse, and beyond it a windmill which stood with outmoving, and seemed bored at not being allowed to wave its sailsbecause it was a holiday.THE STEPPE_The Story of a Journey_IEARLY one morning in July a shabby covered chaise, one of thoseantediluvian chaises without springs in which no one travels inRussia nowadays, except merchant's clerks, dealers and the lesswell-to-do among priests, drove out of N., the principal town ofthe province of Z., and rumbled noisily along the posting-track.It rattled and creaked at every movement; the pail, hanging onbehind, chimed in gruffly, and from these sounds alone and from thewretched rags of leather hanging loose about its peeling body onecould judge of its decrepit age and readiness to drop to pieces.Two of the inhabitants of N. were sitting in the chaise; they werea merchant of N. called Ivan Ivanitch Kuzmitchov, a man with ashaven face wearing glasses and a straw hat, more like a governmentclerk than a merchant, and Father Christopher Sireysky, the priestof the Church of St. Nikolay at N., a little old man with long hair,in a grey canvas cassock, a wide-brimmed top-hat and a colouredembroidered girdle. The former was absorbed in thought, and kepttossing his head to shake off drowsiness; in his countenance anhabitual business-like reserve was struggling with the genialexpression of a man who has just said good-bye to his relatives andhas had a good drink at parting. The latter gazed with moist eyeswonderingly at God's world, and his smile was so broad that itseemed to embrace even the brim of his hat; his face was red andlooked frozen. Both of them, Father Christopher as well as Kuzmitchov,were going to sell wool. At parting with their families they hadjust eaten heartily of pastry puffs and cream, and although it wasso early in the morning had had a glass or two. . . . Both were inthe best of humours.Apart from the two persons described above and the coachman Deniska,who lashed the pair of frisky bay horses, there was another figurein the chaise--a boy of nine with a sunburnt face, wet with tears.This was Yegorushka, Kuzmitchov's nephew. With the sanction of hisuncle and the blessing of Father Christopher, he was now on his wayto go to school. His mother, Olga Ivanovna, the widow of a collegiatesecretary, and Kuzmitchov's sister, who was fond of educated peopleand refined society, had entreated her brother to take Yegorushkawith him when he went to sell wool and to put him to school; andnow the boy was sitting on the box beside the coachman Deniska,holding on to his elbow to keep from falling off, and dancing upand down like a kettle on the hob, with no notion where he was goingor what he was going for. The rapid motion through the air blew outhis red shirt like a balloon on his back and made his new hat witha peacock's feather in it, like a coachman's, keep slipping on tothe back of his head. He felt himself an intensely unfortunateperson, and had an inclination to cry.When the chaise drove past the prison, Yegorushka glanced at thesentinels pacing slowly by the high white walls, at the littlebarred windows, at the cross shining on the roof, and rememberedhow the week before, on the day of the Holy Mother of Kazan, he hadbeen with his mother to the prison church for the Dedication Feast,and how before that, at Easter, he had gone to the prison withDeniska and Ludmila the cook, and had taken the prisoners Easterbread, eggs, cakes and roast beef. The prisoners had thanked themand made the sign of the cross, and one of them had given Yegorushkaa pewter buckle of his own making.The boy gazed at the familiar places, while the hateful chaise flewby and left them all behind. After the prison he caught glimpsesof black grimy foundries, followed by the snug green cemeterysurrounded by a wall of cobblestones; white crosses and tombstones,nestling among green cherry-trees and looking in the distance likepatches of white, peeped out gaily from behind the wall. Yegorushkaremembered that when the cherries were in blossom those white patchesmelted with the flowers into a sea of white; and that when thecherries were ripe the white tombstones and crosses were dottedwith splashes of red like bloodstains. Under the cherry trees inthe cemetery Yegorushka's father and granny, Zinaida Danilovna, laysleeping day and night. When Granny had died she had been put in along narrow coffin and two pennies had been put upon her eyes, whichwould not keep shut. Up to the time of her death she had been brisk,and used to bring soft rolls covered with poppy seeds from themarket. Now she did nothing but sleep and sleep. . . .Beyond the cemetery came the smoking brickyards. From under thelong roofs of reeds that looked as though pressed flat to the ground,a thick black smoke rose in great clouds and floated lazily upwards.The sky was murky above the brickyards and the cemetery, and greatshadows from the clouds of smoke crept over the fields and acrossthe roads. Men and horses covered with red dust were moving aboutin the smoke near the roofs.The town ended with the brickyards and the open country began.Yegorushka looked at the town for the last time, pressed his faceagainst Deniska's elbow, and wept bitterly."Come, not done howling yet, cry-baby!" cried Kuzmitchov. "You areblubbering again, little milksop! If you don't want to go, staybehind; no one is taking you by force!"Never mind, never mind, Yegor boy, never mind," Father Christophermuttered rapidly--"never mind, my boy. . . . Call upon God. . . .You are not going for your harm, but for your good. Learning islight, as the saying is, and ignorance is darkness. . . . That isso, truly.""Do you want to go back?" asked Kuzmitchov."Yes, . . . yes, . . ." answered Yegorushka, sobbing."Well, you'd better go back then. Anyway, you are going for nothing;it's a day's journey for a spoonful of porridge.""Never mind, never mind, my boy," Father Christopher went on. "Callupon God. . . . Lomonosov set off with the fishermen in the sameway, and he became a man famous all over Europe. Learning inconjunction with faith brings forth fruit pleasing to God. What arethe words of the prayer? For the glory of our Maker, for the comfortof our parents, for the benefit of our Church and our country. . . .Yes, indeed!""The benefit is not the same in all cases," said Kuzmitchov, lightinga cheap cigar; "some will study twenty years and get no sense fromit.""That does happen.""Learning is a benefit to some, but others only muddle their brains.My sister is a woman who does not understand; she is set uponrefinement, and wants to turn Yegorka into a learned man, and shedoes not understand that with my business I could settle Yegorkahappily for the rest of his life. I tell you this, that if everyonewere to go in for being learned and refined there would be no oneto sow the corn and do the trading; they would all die of hunger.""And if all go in for trading and sowing corn there will be no oneto acquire learning."And considering that each of them had said something weighty andconvincing, Kuzmitchov and Father Christopher both looked seriousand cleared their throats simultaneously.Deniska, who had been listening to their conversation withoutunderstanding a word of it, shook his head and, rising in his seat,lashed at both the bays. A silence followed.Meanwhile a wide boundless plain encircled by a chain of low hillslay stretched before the travellers' eyes. Huddling together andpeeping out from behind one another, these hills melted togetherinto rising ground, which stretched right to the very horizon anddisappeared into the lilac distance; one drives on and on and cannotdiscern where it begins or where it ends. . . . The sun had alreadypeeped out from beyond the town behind them, and quietly, withoutfuss, set to its accustomed task. At first in the distance beforethem a broad, bright, yellow streak of light crept over the groundwhere the earth met the sky, near the little barrows and thewindmills, which in the distance looked like tiny men waving theirarms. A minute later a similar streak gleamed a little nearer, creptto the right and embraced the hills. Something warm touchedYegorushka's spine; the streak of light, stealing up from behind,darted between the chaise and the horses, moved to meet the otherstreak, and soon the whole wide steppe flung off the twilight ofearly morning, and was smiling and sparkling with dew.The cut rye, the coarse steppe grass, the milkwort, the wild hemp,all withered from the sultry heat, turned brown and half dead, nowwashed by the dew and caressed by the sun, revived, to fade again.Arctic petrels flew across the road with joyful cries; marmotscalled to one another in the grass. Somewhere, far away to the left,lapwings uttered their plaintive notes. A covey of partridges,scared by the chaise, fluttered up and with their soft "trrrr!"flew off to the hills. In the grass crickets, locusts and grasshopperskept up their churring, monotonous music.But a little time passed, the dew evaporated, the air grew stagnant,and the disillusioned steppe began to wear its jaded July aspect.The grass drooped, everything living was hushed. The sun-bakedhills, brownish-green and lilac in the distance, with their quietshadowy tones, the plain with the misty distance and, arched abovethem, the sky, which seems terribly deep and transparent in thesteppes, where there are no woods or high hills, seemed now endless,petrified with dreariness. . . .How stifling and oppressive it was! The chaise raced along, whileYegorushka saw always the same--the sky, the plain, the low hills. . . . The music in the grass was hushed, the petrels had flown away,the partridges were out of sight, rooks hovered idly over thewithered grass; they were all alike and made the steppe even moremonotonous.A hawk flew just above the ground, with an even sweep of its wings,suddenly halted in the air as though pondering on the drearinessof life, then fluttered its wings and flew like an arrow over thesteppe, and there was no telling why it flew off and what it wanted.In the distance a windmill waved its sails. . . .Now and then a glimpse of a white potsherd or a heap of stones brokethe monotony; a grey stone stood out for an instant or a parchedwillow with a blue crow on its top branch; a marmot would run acrossthe road and--again there flitted before the eyes only the highgrass, the low hills, the rooks. . . .But at last, thank God, a waggon loaded with sheaves came to meetthem; a peasant wench was lying on the very top. Sleepy, exhaustedby the heat, she lifted her head and looked at the travellers.Deniska gaped, looking at her; the horses stretched out their nosestowards the sheaves; the chaise, squeaking, kissed the waggon, andthe pointed ears passed over Father Christopher's hat like a brush."You are driving over folks, fatty!" cried Deniska. "What a swollenlump of a face, as though a bumble-bee had stung it!"The girl smiled drowsily, and moving her lips lay down again; thena solitary poplar came into sight on the low hill. Someone hadplanted it, and God only knows why it was there. It was hard totear the eyes away from its graceful figure and green drapery. Wasthat lovely creature happy? Sultry heat in summer, in winter frostand snowstorms, terrible nights in autumn when nothing is to beseen but darkness and nothing is to be heard but the senseless angryhowling wind, and, worst of all, alone, alone for the whole of life. . . . Beyond the poplar stretches of wheat extended like a brightyellow carpet from the road to the top of the hills. On the hillsthe corn was already cut and laid up in sheaves, while at the bottomthey were still cutting. . . . Six mowers were standing in a rowswinging their scythes, and the scythes gleamed gaily and utteredin unison together "Vzhee, vzhee!" From the movements of the peasantwomen binding the sheaves, from the faces of the mowers, from theglitter of the scythes, it could be seen that the sultry heat wasbaking and stifling. A black dog with its tongue hanging out ranfrom the mowers to meet the chaise, probably with the intention ofbarking, but stopped halfway and stared indifferently at Deniska,who shook his whip at him; it was too hot to bark! One peasant womangot up and, putting both hands to her aching back, followedYegorushka's red shirt with her eyes. Whether it was that the colourpleased her or that he reminded her of her children, she stood along time motionless staring after him.But now the wheat, too, had flashed by; again the parched plain,the sunburnt hills, the sultry sky stretched before them; again ahawk hovered over the earth. In the distance, as before, a windmillwhirled its sails, and still it looked like a little man waving hisarms. It was wearisome to watch, and it seemed as though one wouldnever reach it, as though it were running away from the chaise.Father Christopher and Kuzmitchov were silent. Deniska lashed thehorses and kept shouting to them, while Yegorushka had left offcrying, and gazed about him listlessly. The heat and the tedium ofthe steppes overpowered him. He felt as though he had been travellingand jolting up and down for a very long time, that the sun had beenbaking his back a long time. Before they had gone eight miles hebegan to feel "It must be time to rest." The geniality graduallyfaded out of his uncle's face and nothing else was left but the airof business reserve; and to a gaunt shaven face, especially whenit is adorned with spectacles and the nose and temples are coveredwith dust, this reserve gives a relentless, inquisitorial appearance.Father Christopher never left off gazing with wonder at God's world,and smiling. Without speaking, he brooded over something pleasantand nice, and a kindly, genial smile remained imprinted on his face.It seemed as though some nice and pleasant thought were imprintedon his brain by the heat."Well, Deniska, shall we overtake the waggons to-day?" askedKuzmitchov.Deniska looked at the sky, rose in his seat, lashed at his horsesand then answered:"By nightfall, please God, we shall overtake them."There was a sound of dogs barking. Half a dozen steppe sheep-dogs,suddenly leaping out as though from ambush, with ferocious howlingbarks, flew to meet the chaise. All of them, extraordinarily furious,surrounded the chaise, with their shaggy spider-like muzzles andtheir eyes red with anger, and jostling against one another in theiranger, raised a hoarse howl. They were filled with passionate hatredof the horses, of the chaise, and of the human beings, and seemedready to tear them into pieces. Deniska, who was fond of teasingand beating, was delighted at the chance of it, and with a malignantexpression bent over and lashed at the sheep-dogs with his whip.The brutes growled more than ever, the horses flew on; and Yegorushka,who had difficulty in keeping his seat on the box, realized, lookingat the dogs' eyes and teeth, that if he fell down they would instantlytear him to bits; but he felt no fear and looked at them as malignantlyas Deniska, and regretted that he had no whip in his hand.The chaise came upon a flock of sheep."Stop!" cried Kuzmitchov. "Pull up! Woa!"Deniska threw his whole body backwards and pulled up the horses."Come here!" Kuzmitchov shouted to the shepherd. "Call off the dogs,curse them!"The old shepherd, tattered and barefoot, wearing a fur cap, with adirty sack round his loins and a long crook in his hand--a regularfigure from the Old Testament--called off the dogs, and takingoff his cap, went up to the chaise. Another similar Old Testamentfigure was standing motionless at the other end of the flock, staringwithout interest at the travellers."Whose sheep are these?" asked Kuzmitchov."Varlamov's," the old man answered in a loud voice."Varlamov's," repeated the shepherd standing at the other end ofthe flock."Did Varlamov come this way yesterday or not?""He did not; his clerk came. . . .""Drive on!"The chaise rolled on and the shepherds, with their angry dogs, wereleft behind. Yegorushka gazed listlessly at the lilac distance infront, and it began to seem as though the windmill, waving itssails, were getting nearer. It became bigger and bigger, grew quitelarge, and now he could distinguish clearly its two sails. One sailwas old and patched, the other had only lately been made of newwood and glistened in the sun. The chaise drove straight on, whilethe windmill, for some reason, began retreating to the left. Theydrove on and on, and the windmill kept moving away to the left, andstill did not disappear."A fine windmill Boltva has put up for his son," observed Deniska."And how is it we don't see his farm?""It is that way, beyond the creek."Boltva's farm, too, soon came into sight, but yet the windmill didnot retreat, did not drop behind; it still watched Yegorushka withits shining sail and waved. What a sorcerer!IITowards midday the chaise turned off the road to the right; it wenton a little way at walking pace and then stopped. Yegorushka hearda soft, very caressing gurgle, and felt a different air breathe onhis face with a cool velvety touch. Through a little pipe of hemlockstuck there by some unknown benefactor, water was running in a thintrickle from a low hill, put together by nature of huge monstrousstones. It fell to the ground, and limpid, sparkling gaily in thesun, and softly murmuring as though fancying itself a great tempestuoustorrent, flowed swiftly away to the left. Not far from its sourcethe little stream spread itself out into a pool; the burning sunbeamsand the parched soil greedily drank it up and sucked away itsstrength; but a little further on it must have mingled with anotherrivulet, for a hundred paces away thick reeds showed green andluxuriant along its course, and three snipe flew up from them witha loud cry as the chaise drove by.The travellers got out to rest by the stream and feed the horses.Kuzmitchov, Father Christopher and Yegorushka sat down on a mat inthe narrow strip of shade cast by the chaise and the unharnessedhorses. The nice pleasant thought that the heat had imprinted inFather Christopher's brain craved expression after he had had adrink of water and eaten a hard-boiled egg. He bent a friendly lookupon Yegorushka, munched, and began:"I studied too, my boy; from the earliest age God instilled intome good sense and understanding, so that while I was just such alad as you I was beyond others, a comfort to my parents and preceptorsby my good sense. Before I was fifteen I could speak and make versesin Latin, just as in Russian. I was the crosier-bearer to hisHoliness Bishop Christopher. After mass one day, as I remember itwas the patron saint's day of His Majesty Tsar Alexandr Pavlovitchof blessed memory, he unrobed at the altar, looked kindly at me andasked, 'Puer bone, quam appelaris?' And I answered, 'Christopherussum;' and he said, 'Ergo connominati sumus'--that is, that wewere namesakes. . . Then he asked in Latin, 'Whose son are you?'To which I answered, also in Latin, that I was the son of deaconSireysky of the village of Lebedinskoe. Seeing my readiness and theclearness of my answers, his Holiness blessed me and said, 'Writeto your father that I will not forget him, and that I will keep youin view.' The holy priests and fathers who were standing round thealtar, hearing our discussion in Latin, were not a little surprised,and everyone expressed his pleasure in praise of me. Before I hadmoustaches, my boy, I could read Latin, Greek, and French; I knewphilosophy, mathematics, secular history, and all the sciences. TheLord gave me a marvellous memory. Sometimes, if I read a thing onceor twice, I knew it by heart. My preceptors and patrons were amazed,and so they expected I should make a learned man, a luminary of theChurch. I did think of going to Kiev to continue my studies, butmy parents did not approve. 'You'll be studying all your life,'said my father; 'when shall we see you finished?' Hearing suchwords, I gave up study and took a post. . . . Of course, I did notbecome a learned man, but then I did not disobey my parents; I wasa comfort to them in their old age and gave them a creditablefuneral. Obedience is more than fasting and prayer."I suppose you have forgotten all your learning?" observed Kuzmitchov."I should think so! Thank God, I have reached my eightieth year!Something of philosophy and rhetoric I do remember, but languagesand mathematics I have quite forgotten."Father Christopher screwed up his eyes, thought a minute and saidin an undertone:"What is a substance? A creature is a self-existing object, notrequiring anything else for its completion."He shook his head and laughed with feeling."Spiritual nourishment!" he said. "Of a truth matter nourishes theflesh and spiritual nourishment the soul!""Learning is all very well," sighed Kuzmitchov, "but if we don'tovertake Varlamov, learning won't do much for us.""A man isn't a needle--we shall find him. He must be going hisrounds in these parts."Among the sedge were flying the three snipe they had seen before,and in their plaintive cries there was a note of alarm and vexationat having been driven away from the stream. The horses were steadilymunching and snorting. Deniska walked about by them and, trying toappear indifferent to the cucumbers, pies, and eggs that the gentrywere eating, he concentrated himself on the gadflies and horsefliesthat were fastening upon the horses' backs and bellies; he squashedhis victims apathetically, emitting a peculiar, fiendishly triumphant,guttural sound, and when he missed them cleared his throat with anair of vexation and looked after every lucky one that escaped death."Deniska, where are you? Come and eat," said Kuzmitchov, heaving adeep sigh, a sign that he had had enough.Deniska diffidently approached the mat and picked out five thickand yellow cucumbers (he did not venture to take the smaller andfresher ones), took two hard-boiled eggs that looked dark and werecracked, then irresolutely, as though afraid he might get a blowon his outstretched hand, touched a pie with his finger."Take them, take them," Kuzmitchov urged him on.Deniska took the pies resolutely, and, moving some distance away,sat down on the grass with his back to the chaise. At once therewas such a sound of loud munching that even the horses turned roundto look suspiciously at Deniska.After his meal Kuzmitchov took a sack containing something out ofthe chaise and said to Yegorushka:"I am going to sleep, and you mind that no one takes the sack fromunder my head."Father Christopher took off his cassock, his girdle, and his fullcoat, and Yegorushka, looking at him, was dumb with astonishment.He had never imagined that priests wore trousers, and FatherChristopher had on real canvas trousers thrust into high boots, anda short striped jacket. Looking at him, Yegorushka thought that inthis costume, so unsuitable to his dignified position, he lookedwith his long hair and beard very much like Robinson Crusoe. Aftertaking off their outer garments Kuzmitchov and Father Christopherlay down in the shade under the chaise, facing one another, andclosed their eyes. Deniska, who had finished munching, stretchedhimself out on his back and also closed his eyes."You look out that no one takes away the horses!" he said toYegorushka, and at once fell asleep.Stillness reigned. There was no sound except the munching andsnorting of the horses and the snoring of the sleepers; somewherefar away a lapwing wailed, and from time to time there sounded theshrill cries of the three snipe who had flown up to see whethertheir uninvited visitors had gone away; the rivulet babbled, lispingsoftly, but all these sounds did not break the stillness, did notstir the stagnation, but, on the contrary, lulled all nature toslumber.Yegorushka, gasping with the heat, which was particularly oppressiveafter a meal, ran to the sedge and from there surveyed the country.He saw exactly the same as he had in the morning: the plain, thelow hills, the sky, the lilac distance; only the hills stood nearer;and he could not see the windmill, which had been left far behind.From behind the rocky hill from which the stream flowed rose another,smoother and broader; a little hamlet of five or six homesteadsclung to it. No people, no trees, no shade were to be seen aboutthe huts; it looked as though the hamlet had expired in the burningair and was dried up. To while away the time Yegorushka caught agrasshopper in the grass, held it in his closed hand to his ear,and spent a long time listening to the creature playing on itsinstrument. When he was weary of its music he ran after a flock ofyellow butterflies who were flying towards the sedge on thewatercourse, and found himself again beside the chaise, withoutnoticing how he came there. His uncle and Father Christopher weresound asleep; their sleep would be sure to last two or three hourstill the horses had rested. . . . How was he to get through thatlong time, and where was he to get away from the heat? A hardproblem. . . . Mechanically Yegorushka put his lips to the tricklethat ran from the waterpipe; there was a chilliness in his mouthand there was the smell of hemlock. He drank at first eagerly, thenwent on with effort till the sharp cold had run from his mouth allover his body and the water was spilt on his shirt. Then he wentup to the chaise and began looking at the sleeping figures. Hisuncle's face wore, as before, an expression of business-like reserve.Fanatically devoted to his work, Kuzmitchov always, even in hissleep and at church when they were singing, "Like the cherubim,"thought about his business and could never forget it for a moment;and now he was probably dreaming about bales of wool, waggons,prices, Varlamov. . . . Father Christopher, now, a soft, frivolousand absurd person, had never all his life been conscious of anythingwhich could, like a boa-constrictor, coil about his soul and holdit tight. In all the numerous enterprises he had undertaken in hisday what attracted him was not so much the business itself, but thebustle and the contact with other people involved in every undertaking.Thus, in the present expedition, he was not so much interested inwool, in Varlamov, and in prices, as in the long journey, theconversations on the way, the sleeping under a chaise, and the mealsat odd times. . . . And now, judging from his face, he must havebeen dreaming of Bishop Christopher, of the Latin discussion, ofhis wife, of puffs and cream and all sorts of things that Kuzmitchovcould not possibly dream of.While Yegorushka was watching their sleeping faces he suddenly hearda soft singing; somewhere at a distance a woman was singing, andit was difficult to tell where and in what direction. The song wassubdued, dreary and melancholy, like a dirge, and hardly audible,and seemed to come first from the right, then from the left, thenfrom above, and then from underground, as though an unseen spiritwere hovering over the steppe and singing. Yegorushka looked abouthim, and could not make out where the strange song came from. Thenas he listened he began to fancy that the grass was singing; in itssong, withered and half-dead, it was without words, but plaintivelyand passionately, urging that it was not to blame, that the sun wasburning it for no fault of its own; it urged that it ardently longedto live, that it was young and might have been beautiful but forthe heat and the drought; it was guiltless, but yet it prayedforgiveness and protested that it was in anguish, sad and sorry foritself. . . .Yegorushka listened for a little, and it began to seem as thoughthis dreary, mournful song made the air hotter, more suffocatingand more stagnant. . . . To drown the singing he ran to the sedge,humming to himself and trying to make a noise with his feet. Fromthere he looked about in all directions and found out who wassinging. Near the furthest hut in the hamlet stood a peasant womanin a short petticoat, with long thin legs like a heron. She wassowing something. A white dust floated languidly from her sievedown the hillock. Now it was evident that she was singing. A coupleof yards from her a little bare-headed boy in nothing but a smockwas standing motionless. As though fascinated by the song, he stoodstock-still, staring away into the distance, probably at Yegorushka'scrimson shirt.The song ceased. Yegorushka sauntered back to the chaise, and towhile away the time went again to the trickle of water.And again there was the sound of the dreary song. It was the samelong-legged peasant woman in the hamlet over the hill. Yegorushka'sboredom came back again. He left the pipe and looked upwards. Whathe saw was so unexpected that he was a little frightened. Just abovehis head on one of the big clumsy stones stood a chubby little boy,wearing nothing but a shirt, with a prominent stomach and thin legs,the same boy who had been standing before by the peasant woman. Hewas gazing with open mouth and unblinking eyes at Yegorushka'scrimson shirt and at the chaise, with a look of blank astonishmentand even fear, as though he saw before him creatures of anotherworld. The red colour of the shirt charmed and allured him. But thechaise and the men sleeping under it excited his curiosity; perhapshe had not noticed how the agreeable red colour and curiosity hadattracted him down from the hamlet, and now probably he was surprisedat his own boldness. For a long while Yegorushka stared at him, andhe at Yegorushka. Both were silent and conscious of some awkwardness.After a long silence Yegorushka asked:"What's your name?"The stranger's cheeks puffed out more than ever; he pressed hisback against the rock, opened his eyes wide, moved his lips, andanswered in a husky bass: "Tit!"The boys said not another word to each other; after a brief silence,still keeping his eyes fixed on Yegorushka, the mysterious Titkicked up one leg, felt with his heel for a niche and clambered upthe rock; from that point he ascended to the next rock, staggeringbackwards and looking intently at Yegorushka, as though afraid hemight hit him from behind, and so made his way upwards till hedisappeared altogether behind the crest of the hill.After watching him out of sight, Yegorushka put his arms round hisknees and leaned his head on them. . . . The burning sun scorchedthe back of his head, his neck, and his spine. The melancholy songdied away, then floated again on the stagnant stifling air. Therivulet gurgled monotonously, the horses munched, and time draggedon endlessly, as though it, too, were stagnant and had come to astandstill. It seemed as though a hundred years had passed sincethe morning. Could it be that God's world, the chaise and the horseswould come to a standstill in that air, and, like the hills, turnto stone and remain for ever in one spot? Yegorushka raised hishead, and with smarting eyes looked before him; the lilac distance,which till then had been motionless, began heaving, and with thesky floated away into the distance. . . . It drew after it the browngrass, the sedge, and with extraordinary swiftness Yegorushka floatedafter the flying distance. Some force noiselessly drew him onwards,and the heat and the wearisome song flew after in pursuit. Yegorushkabent his head and shut his eyes. . . .Deniska was the first to wake up. Something must have bitten him,for he jumped up, quickly scratched his shoulder and said:"Plague take you, cursed idolater!"Then he went to the brook, had a drink and slowly washed. Hissplashing and puffing roused Yegorushka from his lethargy. The boylooked at his wet face with drops of water and big freckles whichmade it look like marble, and asked:"Shall we soon be going?"Deniska looked at the height of the sun and answered:"I expect so."He dried himself with the tail of his shirt and, making a veryserious face, hopped on one leg."I say, which of us will get to the sedge first?" he said.Yegorushka was exhausted by the heat and drowsiness, but he racedoff after him all the same. Deniska was in his twentieth year, wasa coachman and going to be married, but he had not left off beinga boy. He was very fond of flying kites, chasing pigeons, playingknuckle-bones, running races, and always took part in children'sgames and disputes. No sooner had his master turned his back orgone to sleep than Deniska would begin doing something such ashopping on one leg or throwing stones. It was hard for any grown-upperson, seeing the genuine enthusiasm with which he frolicked aboutin the society of children, to resist saying, "What a baby!" Children,on the other hand, saw nothing strange in the invasion of theirdomain by the big coachman. "Let him play," they thought, "as longas he doesn't fight!" In the same way little dogs see nothing strangein it when a simple-hearted big dog joins their company uninvitedand begins playing with them.Deniska outstripped Yegorushka, and was evidently very much pleasedat having done so. He winked at him, and to show that he could hopon one leg any distance, suggested to Yegorushka that he should hopwith him along the road and from there, without resting, back tothe chaise. Yegorushka declined this suggestion, for he was verymuch out of breath and exhausted.All at once Deniska looked very grave, as he did not look even whenKuzmitchov gave him a scolding or threatened him with a stick;listening intently, he dropped quietly on one knee and an expressionof sternness and alarm came into his face, such as one sees inpeople who hear heretical talk. He fixed his eyes on one spot,raised his hand curved into a hollow, and suddenly fell on hisstomach on the ground and slapped the hollow of his hand down uponthe grass."Caught!" he wheezed triumphantly, and, getting up, lifted a biggrasshopper to Yegorushka's eyes.The two boys stroked the grasshopper's broad green back with theirfingers and touched his antenna, supposing that this would pleasethe creature. Then Deniska caught a fat fly that had been suckingblood and offered it to the grasshopper. The latter moved his hugejaws, that were like the visor of a helmet, with the utmost unconcern,as though he had been long acquainted with Deniska, and bit off thefly's stomach. They let him go. With a flash of the pink lining ofhis wings, he flew down into the grass and at once began his churringnotes again. They let the fly go, too. It preened its wings, andwithout its stomach flew off to the horses.A loud sigh was heard from under the chaise. It was Kuzmitchovwaking up. He quickly raised his head, looked uneasily into thedistance, and from that look, which passed by Yegorushka and Deniskawithout sympathy or interest, it could be seen that his thought onawaking was of the wool and of Varlamov."Father Christopher, get up; it is time to start," he said anxiously."Wake up; we've slept too long as it is! Deniska, put the horsesin."Father Christopher woke up with the same smile with which he hadfallen asleep; his face looked creased and wrinkled from sleep, andseemed only half the size. After washing and dressing, he proceededwithout haste to take out of his pocket a little greasy psalter;and standing with his face towards the east, began in a whisperrepeating the psalms of the day and crossing himself."Father Christopher," said Kuzmitchov reproachfully, "it's time tostart; the horses are ready, and here are you, . . . upon my word.""In a minute, in a minute," muttered Father Christopher. "I mustread the psalms. . . . I haven't read them to-day.""The psalms can wait.""Ivan Ivanitch, that is my rule every day. . . . I can't . . .""God will overlook it."For a full quarter of an hour Father Christopher stood facing theeast and moving his lips, while Kuzmitchov looked at him almostwith hatred and impatiently shrugged his shoulders. He was particularlyirritated when, after every "Hallelujah," Father Christopher drewa long breath, rapidly crossed himself and repeated three times,intentionally raising his voice so that the others might crossthemselves, "Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah! Glory be to Thee,O Lord!" At last he smiled, looked upwards at the sky, and, puttingthe psalter in his pocket, said:"Finis!"A minute later the chaise had started on the road. As though itwere going backwards and not forwards, the travellers saw the samescene as they had before midday.The low hills were still plunged in the lilac distance, and no endcould be seen to them. There were glimpses of high grass and heapsof stones; strips of stubble land passed by them and still the samerooks, the same hawk, moving its wings with slow dignity, movedover the steppe. The air was more sultry than ever; from the sultryheat and the stillness submissive nature was spellbound into silence. . . . No wind, no fresh cheering sound, no cloud.But at last, when the sun was beginning to sink into the west, thesteppe, the hills and the air could bear the oppression no longer,and, driven out of all patience, exhausted, tried to fling off theyoke. A fleecy ashen-grey cloud unexpectedly appeared behind thehills. It exchanged glances with the steppe, as though to say, "HereI am," and frowned. Suddenly something burst in the stagnant air;there was a violent squall of wind which whirled round and round,roaring and whistling over the steppe. At once a murmur rose fromthe grass and last year's dry herbage, the dust curled in spiraleddies over the road, raced over the steppe, and carrying with itstraws, dragon flies and feathers, rose up in a whirling blackcolumn towards the sky and darkened the sun. Prickly uprooted plantsran stumbling and leaping in all directions over the steppe, andone of them got caught in the whirlwind, turned round and roundlike a bird, flew towards the sky, and turning into a little blackspeck, vanished from sight. After it flew another, and then a third,and Yegorushka saw two of them meet in the blue height and clutchat one another as though they were wrestling.A bustard flew up by the very road. Fluttering his wings and histail, he looked, bathed in the sunshine, like an angler's glitteringtin fish or a waterfly flashing so swiftly over the water that itswings cannot be told from its antenna, which seem to be growingbefore, behind and on all sides. . . . Quivering in the air likean insect with a shimmer of bright colours, the bustard flew highup in a straight line, then, probably frightened by a cloud of dust,swerved to one side, and for a long time the gleam of his wingscould be seen. . . .Then a corncrake flew up from the grass, alarmed by the hurricaneand not knowing what was the matter. It flew with the wind and notagainst it, like all the other birds, so that all its feathers wereruffled up and it was puffed out to the size of a hen and lookedvery angry and impressive. Only the rooks who had grown old on thesteppe and were accustomed to its vagaries hovered calmly over thegrass, or taking no notice of anything, went on unconcernedly peckingwith their stout beaks at the hard earth.There was a dull roll of thunder beyond the hills; there came awhiff of fresh air. Deniska gave a cheerful whistle and lashed hishorses. Father Christopher and Kuzmitchov held their hats and lookedintently towards the hills. . . . How pleasant a shower of rainwould have been!One effort, one struggle more, and it seemed the steppe would havegot the upper hand. But the unseen oppressive force gradually rivetedits fetters on the wind and the air, laid the dust, and the stillnesscame back again as though nothing had happened, the cloud hid, thesun-baked hills frowned submissively, the air grew calm, and onlysomewhere the troubled lapwings wailed and lamented their destiny. . . .Soon after that the evening came on.IIIIn the dusk of evening a big house of one storey, with a rusty ironroof and with dark windows, came into sight. This house was calleda posting-inn, though it had nothing like a stableyard, and it stoodin the middle of the steppe, with no kind of enclosure round it. Alittle to one side of it a wretched little cherry orchard shut inby a hurdle fence made a dark patch, and under the windows stoodsleepy sunflowers drooping their heavy heads. From the orchard camethe clatter of a little toy windmill, set there to frighten awayhares by the rattle. Nothing more could be seen near the house, andnothing could be heard but the steppe. The chaise had scarcelystopped at the porch with an awning over it, when from the housethere came the sound of cheerful voices, one a man's, another awoman's; there was the creak of a swing-door, and in a flash a tallgaunt figure, swinging its arms and fluttering its coat, was standingby the chaise. This was the innkeeper, Moisey Moisevitch, a man nolonger young, with a very pale face and a handsome beard as blackas charcoal. He was wearing a threadbare black coat, which hungflapping on his narrow shoulders as though on a hatstand, andfluttered its skirts like wings every time Moisey Moisevitch flungup his hands in delight or horror. Besides his coat the innkeeperwas wearing full white trousers, not stuck into his boots, and avelvet waistcoat with brown flowers on it that looked like giganticbugs.Moisey Moisevitch was at first dumb with excess of feeling onrecognizing the travellers, then he clasped his hands and uttereda moan. His coat swung its skirts, his back bent into a bow, andhis pale face twisted into a smile that suggested that to see thechaise was not merely a pleasure to him, but actually a joy so sweetas to be painful."Oh dear! oh dear!" he began in a thin sing-song voice, breathless,fussing about and preventing the travellers from getting out of thechaise by his antics. "What a happy day for me! Oh, what am I todo now? Ivan Ivanitch! Father Christopher! What a pretty littlegentleman sitting on the box, God strike me dead! Oh, my goodness!why am I standing here instead of asking the visitors indoors?Please walk in, I humbly beg you. . . . You are kindly welcome!Give me all your things. . . . Oh, my goodness me!"Moisey Moisevitch, who was rummaging in the chaise and assistingthe travellers to alight, suddenly turned back and shouted in avoice as frantic and choking as though he were drowning and callingfor help:"Solomon! Solomon!""Solomon! Solomon!" a woman's voice repeated indoors.The swing-door creaked, and in the doorway appeared a rather shortyoung Jew with a big beak-like nose, with a bald patch surroundedby rough red curly hair; he was dressed in a short and very shabbyreefer jacket, with rounded lappets and short sleeves, and in shortserge trousers, so that he looked skimpy and short-tailed like anunfledged bird. This was Solomon, the brother of Moisey Moisevitch.He went up to the chaise, smiling rather queerly, and did not speakor greet the travellers."Ivan Ivanitch and Father Christopher have come," said MoiseyMoisevitch in a tone as though he were afraid his brother would notbelieve him. "Dear, dear! What a surprise! Such honoured guests tohave come us so suddenly! Come, take their things, Solomon. Walkin, honoured guests."A little later Kuzmitchov, Father Christopher, and Yegorushka weresitting in a big gloomy empty room at an old oak table. The tablewas almost in solitude, for, except a wide sofa covered with tornAmerican leather and three chairs, there was no other furniture inthe room. And, indeed, not everybody would have given the chairsthat name. They were a pitiful semblance of furniture, covered withAmerican leather that had seen its best days, and with backs bentbackwards at an unnaturally acute angle, so that they looked likechildren's sledges. It was hard to imagine what had been the unknowncarpenter's object in bending the chairbacks so mercilessly, andone was tempted to imagine that it was not the carpenter's fault,but that some athletic visitor had bent the chairs like this as afeat, then had tried to bend them back again and had made themworse. The room looked gloomy, the walls were grey, the ceilingsand the cornices were grimy; on the floor were chinks and yawningholes that were hard to account for (one might have fancied theywere made by the heel of the same athlete), and it seemed as thoughthe room would still have been dark if a dozen lamps had hung init. There was nothing approaching an ornament on the walls or thewindows. On one wall, however, there hung a list of regulations ofsome sort under a two-headed eagle in a grey wooden frame, and onanother wall in the same sort of frame an engraving with theinscription, "The Indifference of Man." What it was to which menwere indifferent it was impossible to make out, as the engravingwas very dingy with age and was extensively flyblown. There was asmell of something decayed and sour in the room.As he led the visitors into the room, Moisey Moisevitch went onwriggling, gesticulating, shrugging and uttering joyful exclamations;he considered these antics necessary in order to seem polite andagreeable."When did our waggons go by?" Kuzmitchov asked."One party went by early this morning, and the other, Ivan Ivanitch,put up here for dinner and went on towards evening.""Ah! . . . Has Varlamov been by or not?""No, Ivan Ivanitch. His clerk, Grigory Yegoritch, went by yesterdaymorning and said that he had to be to-day at the Molokans' farm.""Good! so we will go after the waggons directly and then on to theMolokans'.""Mercy on us, Ivan Ivanitch!" Moisey Moisevitch cried in horror,flinging up his hands. "Where are you going for the night? You willhave a nice little supper and stay the night, and to-morrow morning,please God, you can go on and overtake anyone you like.""There is no time for that. . . . Excuse me, Moisey Moisevitch,another time; but now I must make haste. We'll stay a quarter ofan hour and then go on; we can stay the night at the Molokans'.""A quarter of an hour!" squealed Moisey Moisevitch. "Have you nofear of God, Ivan Ivanitch? You will compel me to hide your capsand lock the door! You must have a cup of tea and a snack ofsomething, anyway.""We have no time for tea," said Kuzmitchov.Moisey Moisevitch bent his head on one side, crooked his knees, andput his open hands before him as though warding off a blow, whilewith a smile of agonized sweetness he began imploring:"Ivan Ivanitch! Father Christopher! Do be so good as to take a cupof tea with me. Surely I am not such a bad man that you can't evendrink tea in my house? Ivan Ivanitch!""Well, we may just as well have a cup of tea," said Father Christopher,with a sympathetic smile; "that won't keep us long.""Very well," Kuzmitchov assented.Moisey Moisevitch, in a fluster uttered an exclamation of joy, andshrugging as though he had just stepped out of cold weather intowarm, ran to the door and cried in the same frantic voice in whichhe had called Solomon:"Rosa! Rosa! Bring the samovar!"A minute later the door opened, and Solomon came into the roomcarrying a large tray in his hands. Setting the tray on the table,he looked away sarcastically with the same queer smile as before.Now, by the light of the lamp, it was possible to see his smiledistinctly; it was very complex, and expressed a variety of emotions,but the predominant element in it was undisguised contempt. Heseemed to be thinking of something ludicrous and silly, to be feelingcontempt and dislike, to be pleased at something and waiting forthe favourable moment to turn something into ridicule and to burstinto laughter. His long nose, his thick lips, and his sly prominenteyes seemed tense with the desire to laugh. Looking at his face,Kuzmitchov smiled ironically and asked:"Solomon, why did you not come to our fair at N. this summer, andact some Jewish scenes?"Two years before, as Yegorushka remembered very well, at one of thebooths at the fair at N., Solomon had performed some scenes ofJewish life, and his acting had been a great success. The allusionto this made no impression whatever upon Solomon. Making no answer,he went out and returned a little later with the samovar.When he had done what he had to do at the table he moved a littleaside, and, folding his arms over his chest and thrusting out oneleg, fixed his sarcastic eyes on Father Christopher. There wassomething defiant, haughty, and contemptuous in his attitude, andat the same time it was comic and pitiful in the extreme, becausethe more impressive his attitude the more vividly it showed up hisshort trousers, his bobtail coat, his caricature of a nose, and hisbird-like plucked-looking little figure.Moisey Moisevitch brought a footstool from the other room and satdown a little way from the table."I wish you a good appetite! Tea and sugar!" he began, trying toentertain his visitors. "I hope you will enjoy it. Such rare guests,such rare ones; it is years since I last saw Father Christopher.And will no one tell me who is this nice little gentleman?" heasked, looking tenderly at Yegorushka."He is the son of my sister, Olga Ivanovna," answered Kuzmitchov."And where is he going?""To school. We are taking him to a high school."In his politeness, Moisey Moisevitch put on a look of wonder andwagged his head expressively."Ah, that is a fine thing," he said, shaking his finger at thesamovar. "That's a fine thing. You will come back from the highschool such a gentleman that we shall all take off our hats to you.You will be wealthy and wise and so grand that your mamma will bedelighted. Oh, that's a fine thing!"He paused a little, stroked his knees, and began again in a jocoseand deferential tone."You must excuse me, Father Christopher, but I am thinking of writingto the bishop to tell him you are robbing the merchants of theirliving. I shall take a sheet of stamped paper and write that Isuppose Father Christopher is short of pence, as he has taken upwith trade and begun selling wool.""H'm, yes . . . it's a queer notion in my old age," said FatherChristopher, and he laughed. "I have turned from priest to merchant,brother. I ought to be at home now saying my prayers, instead ofgalloping about the country like a Pharaoh in his chariot. . . .Vanity!""But it will mean a lot of pence!""Oh, I dare say! More kicks than halfpence, and serve me right. Thewool's not mine, but my son-in-law Mikhail's!""Why doesn't he go himself?""Why, because . . . His mother's milk is scarcely dry upon his lips.He can buy wool all right, but when it comes to selling, he has nosense; he is young yet. He has wasted all his money; he wanted togrow rich and cut a dash, but he tried here and there, and no onewould give him his price. And so the lad went on like that for ayear, and then he came to me and said, 'Daddy, you sell the woolfor me; be kind and do it! I am no good at the business!' And thatis true enough. As soon as there is anything wrong then it's 'Daddy,'but till then they could get on without their dad. When he wasbuying he did not consult me, but now when he is in difficultiesit's Daddy's turn. And what does his dad know about it? If it werenot for Ivan Ivanitch, his dad could do nothing. I have a lot ofworry with them.""Yes; one has a lot of worry with one's children, I can tell youthat," sighed Moisey Moisevitch. "I have six of my own. One needsschooling, another needs doctoring, and a third needs nursing, andwhen they grow up they are more trouble still. It is not onlynowadays, it was the same in Holy Scripture. When Jacob had littlechildren he wept, and when they grew up he wept still more bitterly.""H'm, yes . . ." Father Christopher assented pensively, looking athis glass. "I have no cause myself to rail against the Lord. I havelived to the end of my days as any man might be thankful to live.. . . I have married my daughters to good men, my sons I have setup in life, and now I am free; I have done my work and can go whereI like. I live in peace with my wife. I eat and drink and sleep andrejoice in my grandchildren, and say my prayers and want nothingmore. I live on the fat of the land, and don't need to curry favourwith anyone. I have never had any trouble from childhood, and nowsuppose the Tsar were to ask me, 'What do you need? What would youlike?' why, I don't need anything. I have everything I want andeverything to be thankful for. In the whole town there is no happierman than I am. My only trouble is I have so many sins, but there--only God is without sin. That's right, isn't it?""No doubt it is.""I have no teeth, of course; my poor old back aches; there is onething and another, . . . asthma and that sort of thing. . . . Iache. . . . The flesh is weak, but then think of my age! I am inthe eighties! One can't go on for ever; one mustn't outstay one'swelcome."Father Christopher suddenly thought of something, spluttered intohis glass and choked with laughter. Moisey Moisevitch laughed, too,from politeness, and he, too, cleared his throat."So funny!" said Father Christopher, and he waved his hand. "Myeldest son Gavrila came to pay me a visit. He is in the medicalline, and is a district doctor in the province of Tchernigov. . . .'Very well . . .' I said to him, 'here I have asthma and one thingand another. . . . You are a doctor; cure your father!' He undressedme on the spot, tapped me, listened, and all sorts of tricks, . . .kneaded my stomach, and then he said, 'Dad, you ought to be treatedwith compressed air.'" Father Christopher laughed convulsively,till the tears came into his eyes, and got up."And I said to him, 'God bless your compressed air!'" he broughtout through his laughter, waving both hands. "God bless yourcompressed air!"Moisey Moisevitch got up, too, and with his hands on his stomach,went off into shrill laughter like the yap of a lap-dog."God bless the compressed air!" repeated Father Christopher, laughing.Moisey Moisevitch laughed two notes higher and so violently thathe could hardly stand on his feet."Oh dear!" he moaned through his laughter. "Let me get my breath. . . . You'll be the death of me."He laughed and talked, though at the same time he was castingtimorous and suspicious looks at Solomon. The latter was standingin the same attitude and still smiling. To judge from his eyes andhis smile, his contempt and hatred were genuine, but that was soout of keeping with his plucked-looking figure that it seemed toYegorushka as though he were putting on his defiant attitude andbiting sarcastic smile to play the fool for the entertainment oftheir honoured guests.After drinking six glasses of tea in silence, Kuzmitchov cleared aspace before him on the table, took his bag, the one which he keptunder his head when he slept under the chaise, untied the stringand shook it. Rolls of paper notes were scattered out of the bagon the table."While we have the time, Father Christopher, let us reckon up,"said Kuzmitchov.Moisey Moisevitch was embarrassed at the sight of the money. He gotup, and, as a man of delicate feeling unwilling to pry into otherpeople's secrets, he went out of the room on tiptoe, swaying hisarms. Solomon remained where he was."How many are there in the rolls of roubles?" Father Christopherbegan."The rouble notes are done up in fifties, . . . the three-roublenotes in nineties, the twenty-five and hundred roubles in thousands.You count out seven thousand eight hundred for Varlamov, and I willcount out for Gusevitch. And mind you don't make a mistake. . ."Yegorushka had never in his life seen so much money as was lyingon the table before him. There must have been a great deal of money,for the roll of seven thousand eight hundred, which Father Christopherput aside for Varlamov, seemed very small compared with the wholeheap. At any other time such a mass of money would have impressedYegorushka, and would have moved him to reflect how many cracknels,buns and poppy-cakes could be bought for that money. Now he lookedat it listlessly, only conscious of the disgusting smell of keroseneand rotten apples that came from the heap of notes. He was exhaustedby the jolting ride in the chaise, tired out and sleepy. His headwas heavy, his eyes would hardly keep open and his thoughts weretangled like threads. If it had been possible he would have beenrelieved to lay his head on the table, so as not to see the lampand the fingers moving over the heaps of notes, and to have let histired sleepy thoughts go still more at random. When he tried tokeep awake, the light of the lamp, the cups and the fingers grewdouble, the samovar heaved and the smell of rotten apples seemedeven more acrid and disgusting."Ah, money, money!" sighed Father Christopher, smiling. "You bringtrouble! Now I expect my Mihailo is asleep and dreaming that I amgoing to bring him a heap of money like this.""Your Mihailo Timofevitch is a man who doesn't understand business,"said Kuzmitchov in an undertone; "he undertakes what isn't his work,but you understand and can judge. You had better hand over yourwool to me, as I have said already, and I would give you half arouble above my own price--yes, I would, simply out of regard foryou. . . .""No, Ivan Ivanitch." Father Christopher sighed. "I thank you foryour kindness. . . . Of course, if it were for me to decide, Ishouldn't think twice about it; but as it is, the wool is not mine,as you know. . . ."Moisey Moisevitch came in on tiptoe. Trying from delicacy not tolook at the heaps of money, he stole up to Yegorushka and pulledat his shirt from behind."Come along, little gentleman," he said in an undertone, "come andsee the little bear I can show you! Such a queer, cross little bear.Oo-oo!"The sleepy boy got up and listlessly dragged himself after MoiseyMoisevitch to see the bear. He went into a little room, where,before he saw anything, he felt he could not breathe from the smellof something sour and decaying, which was much stronger here thanin the big room and probably spread from this room all over thehouse. One part of the room was occupied by a big bed, covered witha greasy quilt and another by a chest of drawers and heaps of ragsof all kinds from a woman's stiff petticoat to children's littlebreeches and braces. A tallow candle stood on the chest of drawers.Instead of the promised bear, Yegorushka saw a big fat Jewess withher hair hanging loose, in a red flannel skirt with black sprigson it; she turned with difficulty in the narrow space between thebed and the chest of drawers and uttered drawn-out moaning as thoughshe had toothache. On seeing Yegorushka, she made a doleful,woe-begone face, heaved a long drawn-out sigh, and before he hadtime to look round, put to his lips a slice of bread smeared withhoney."Eat it, dearie, eat it!" she said. "You are here without yourmamma, and no one to look after you. Eat it up."Yegorushka did eat it, though after the goodies and poppy-cakes hehad every day at home, he did not think very much of the honey,which was mixed with wax and bees' wings. He ate while MoiseyMoisevitch and the Jewess looked at him and sighed."Where are you going, dearie?" asked the Jewess."To school," answered Yegorushka."And how many brothers and sisters have you got?""I am the only one; there are no others.""O-oh!" sighed the Jewess, and turned her eyes upward. "Poor mamma,poor mamma! How she will weep and miss you! We are going to sendour Nahum to school in a year. O-oh!""Ah, Nahum, Nahum!" sighed Moisey Moisevitch, and the skin of hispale face twitched nervously. "And he is so delicate."The greasy quilt quivered, and from beneath it appeared a child'scurly head on a very thin neck; two black eyes gleamed and staredwith curiosity at Yegorushka. Still sighing, Moisey Moisevitch andthe Jewess went to the chest of drawers and began talking in Yiddish.Moisey Moisevitch spoke in a low bass undertone, and altogether histalk in Yiddish was like a continual "ghaal-ghaal-ghaal-ghaal, . . ."while his wife answered him in a shrill voice like a turkeycock's,and the whole effect of her talk was something like "Too-too-too-too!"While they were consulting, another little curly head on a thinneck peeped out of the greasy quilt, then a third, then a fourth.. . . If Yegorushka had had a fertile imagination he might haveimagined that the hundred-headed hydra was hiding under the quilt."Ghaal-ghaal-ghaal-ghaal!" said Moisey Moisevitch."Too-too-too-too!" answered the Jewess.The consultation ended in the Jewess's diving with a deep sigh intothe chest of drawers, and, unwrapping some sort of green rag there,she took out a big rye cake made in the shape of a heart."Take it, dearie," she said, giving Yegorushka the cake; "you haveno mamma now--no one to give you nice things."Yegorushka stuck the cake in his pocket and staggered to the door,as he could not go on breathing the foul, sour air in which theinnkeeper and his wife lived. Going back to the big room, he settledhimself more comfortably on the sofa and gave up trying to checkhis straying thoughts.As soon as Kuzmitchov had finished counting out the notes he putthem back into the bag. He did not treat them very respectfully andstuffed them into the dirty sack without ceremony, as indifferentlyas though they had not been money but waste paper.Father Christopher was talking to Solomon."Well, Solomon the Wise!" he said, yawning and making the sign ofthe cross over his mouth. "How is business?""What sort of business are you talking about?" asked Solomon, andhe looked as fiendish, as though it were a hint of some crime onhis part."Oh, things in general. What are you doing?""What am I doing?" Solomon repeated, and he shrugged his shoulders."The same as everyone else. . . . You see, I am a menial, I am mybrother's servant; my brother's the servant of the visitors; thevisitors are Varlamov's servants; and if I had ten millions, Varlamovwould be my servant.""Why would he be your servant?""Why, because there isn't a gentleman or millionaire who isn't readyto lick the hand of a scabby Jew for the sake of making a kopeck.Now, I am a scabby Jew and a beggar. Everybody looks at me as thoughI were a dog, but if I had money Varlamov would play the fool beforeme just as Moisey does before you."Father Christopher and Kuzmitchov looked at each other. Neither ofthem understood Solomon. Kuzmitchov looked at him sternly and dryly,and asked:"How can you compare yourself with Varlamov, you blockhead?""I am not such a fool as to put myself on a level with Varlamov,"answered Solomon, looking sarcastically at the speaker. "ThoughVarlamov is a Russian, he is at heart a scabby Jew; money and gainare all he lives for, but I threw my money in the stove! I don'twant money, or land, or sheep, and there is no need for people tobe afraid of me and to take off their hats when I pass. So I amwiser than your Varlamov and more like a man!"A little later Yegorushka, half asleep, heard Solomon in a hoarsehollow voice choked with hatred, in hurried stuttering phrases,talking about the Jews. At first he talked correctly in Russian,then he fell into the tone of a Jewish recitation, and began speakingas he had done at the fair with an exaggerated Jewish accent."Stop! . . ." Father Christopher said to him. "If you don't likeyour religion you had better change it, but to laugh at it is asin; it is only the lowest of the low who will make fun of hisreligion.""You don't understand," Solomon cut him short rudely. "I am talkingof one thing and you are talking of something else. . . .""One can see you are a foolish fellow," sighed Father Christopher."I admonish you to the best of my ability, and you are angry. Ispeak to you like an old man quietly, and you answer like a turkeycock:'Bla---bla---bla!' You really are a queer fellow. . . ."Moisey Moisevitch came in. He looked anxiously at Solomon and athis visitors, and again the skin on his face quivered nervously.Yegorushka shook his head and looked about him; he caught a passingglimpse of Solomon's face at the very moment when it was turnedthree-quarters towards him and when the shadow of his long nosedivided his left cheek in half; the contemptuous smile mingled withthat shadow; the gleaming sarcastic eyes, the haughty expression,and the whole plucked-looking little figure, dancing and doublingitself before Yegorushka's eyes, made him now not like a buffoon,but like something one sometimes dreams of, like an evil spirit."What a ferocious fellow you've got here, Moisey Moisevitch! Godbless him!" said Father Christopher with a smile. "You ought tofind him a place or a wife or something. . . . There's no knowingwhat to make of him. . . ."Kuzmitchov frowned angrily. Moisey Moisevitch looked uneasily andinquiringly at his brother and the visitors again."Solomon, go away!" he said shortly. "Go away!" and he added somethingin Yiddish. Solomon gave an abrupt laugh and went out."What was it?" Moisey Moisevitch asked Father Christopher anxiously."He forgets himself," answered Kuzmitchov. "He's rude and thinkstoo much of himself.""I knew it!" Moisey Moisevitch cried in horror, clasping his hands."Oh dear, oh dear!" he muttered in a low voice. "Be so kind as toexcuse it, and don't be angry. He is such a queer fellow, such aqueer fellow! Oh dear, oh dear! He is my own brother, but I havenever had anything but trouble from him. You know he's. . ."Moisey Moisevitch crooked his finger by his forehead and went on:"He is not in his right mind; . . . he's hopeless. And I don't knowwhat I am to do with him! He cares for nobody, he respects nobody,and is afraid of nobody. . . . You know he laughs at everybody, hesays silly things, speaks familiarly to anyone. You wouldn't believeit, Varlamov came here one day and Solomon said such things to himthat he gave us both a taste of his whip. . . . But why whip me?Was it my fault? God has robbed him of his wits, so it is God'swill, and how am I to blame?"Ten minutes passed and Moisey Moisevitch was still muttering in anundertone and sighing:"He does not sleep at night, and is always thinking and thinkingand thinking, and what he is thinking about God only knows. If yougo to him at night he is angry and laughs. He doesn't like me either. . . . And there is nothing he wants! When our father died he leftus each six thousand roubles. I bought myself an inn, married, andnow I have children; and he burnt all his money in the stove. Sucha pity, such a pity! Why burn it? If he didn't want it he couldgive it to me, but why burn it?"Suddenly the swing-door creaked and the floor shook under footsteps.Yegorushka felt a draught of cold air, and it seemed to him asthough some big black bird had passed by him and had fluttered itswings close in his face. He opened his eyes. . . . His uncle wasstanding by the sofa with his sack in his hands ready for departure;Father Christopher, holding his broad-brimmed top-hat, was bowingto someone and smiling--not his usual soft kindly smile, but arespectful forced smile which did not suit his face at all--whileMoisey Moisevitch looked as though his body had been broken intothree parts, and he were balancing and doing his utmost not to dropto pieces. Only Solomon stood in the corner with his arms folded,as though nothing had happened, and smiled contemptuously as before."Your Excellency must excuse us for not being tidy," moaned MoiseyMoisevitch with the agonizingly sweet smile, taking no more noticeof Kuzmitchov or Father Christopher, but swaying his whole personso as to avoid dropping to pieces. "We are plain folks, yourExcellency."Yegorushka rubbed his eyes. In the middle of the room there reallywas standing an Excellency, in the form of a young plump and verybeautiful woman in a black dress and a straw hat. Before Yegorushkahad time to examine her features the image of the solitary gracefulpoplar he had seen that day on the hill for some reason came intohis mind."Has Varlamov been here to-day?" a woman's voice inquired."No, your Excellency," said Moisey Moisevitch."If you see him to-morrow, ask him to come and see me for a minute."All at once, quite unexpectedly, Yegorushka saw half an inch fromhis eyes velvety black eyebrows, big brown eyes, delicate femininecheeks with dimples, from which smiles seemed radiating all overthe face like sunbeams. There was a glorious scent."What a pretty boy!" said the lady. "Whose boy is it? KazimirMihalovitch, look what a charming fellow! Good heavens, he isasleep!"And the lady kissed Yegorushka warmly on both cheeks, and he smiledand, thinking he was asleep, shut his eyes. The swing-door squeaked,and there was the sound of hurried footsteps, coming in and goingout."Yegorushka, Yegorushka!" he heard two bass voices whisper. "Getup; it is time to start."Somebody, it seemed to be Deniska, set him on his feet and led himby the arm. On the way he half-opened his eyes and once more sawthe beautiful lady in the black dress who had kissed him. She wasstanding in the middle of the room and watched him go out, smilingat him and nodding her head in a friendly way. As he got near thedoor he saw a handsome, stoutly built, dark man in a bowler hat andin leather gaiters. This must have been the lady's escort."Woa!" he heard from the yard.At the front door Yegorushka saw a splendid new carriage and a pairof black horses. On the box sat a groom in livery, with a long whipin his hands. No one but Solomon came to see the travellers off.His face was tense with a desire to laugh; he looked as though hewere waiting impatiently for the visitors to be gone, so that hemight laugh at them without restraint."The Countess Dranitsky," whispered Father Christopher, clamberinginto the chaise."Yes, Countess Dranitsky," repeated Kuzmitchov, also in a whisper.The impression made by the arrival of the countess was probablyvery great, for even Deniska spoke in a whisper, and only venturedto lash his bays and shout when the chaise had driven a quarter ofa mile away and nothing could be seen of the inn but a dim light.IVWho was this elusive, mysterious Varlamov of whom people talked somuch, whom Solomon despised, and whom even the beautiful countessneeded? Sitting on the box beside Deniska, Yegorushka, half asleep,thought about this person. He had never seen him. But he had oftenheard of him and pictured him in his imagination. He knew thatVarlamov possessed several tens of thousands of acres of land, abouta hundred thousand sheep, and a great deal of money. Of his mannerof life and occupation Yegorushka knew nothing, except that he wasalways "going his rounds in these parts," and he was always beinglooked for.At home Yegorushka had heard a great deal of the Countess Dranitsky,too. She, too, had some tens of thousands of acres, a great manysheep, a stud farm and a great deal of money, but she did not "gorounds," but lived at home in a splendid house and grounds, aboutwhich Ivan Ivanitch, who had been more than once at the countess'son business, and other acquaintances told many marvellous tales;thus, for instance, they said that in the countess's drawing-room,where the portraits of all the kings of Poland hung on the walls,there was a big table-clock in the form of a rock, on the rock agold horse with diamond eyes, rearing, and on the horse the figureof a rider also of gold, who brandished his sword to right and toleft whenever the clock struck. They said, too, that twice a yearthe countess used to give a ball, to which the gentry and officialsof the whole province were invited, and to which even Varlamov usedto come; all the visitors drank tea from silver samovars, ate allsorts of extraordinary things (they had strawberries and raspberries,for instance, in winter at Christmas), and danced to a band whichplayed day and night. . . ."And how beautiful she is," thought Yegorushka, remembering herface and smile.Kuzmitchov, too, was probably thinking about the countess. For whenthe chaise had driven a mile and a half he said:"But doesn't that Kazimir Mihalovitch plunder her right and left!The year before last when, do you remember, I bought some wool fromher, he made over three thousand from my purchase alone.""That is just what you would expect from a Pole," said FatherChristopher."And little does it trouble her. Young and foolish, as they say,her head is full of nonsense."Yegorushka, for some reason, longed to think of nothing but Varlamovand the countess, particularly the latter. His drowsy brain utterlyrefused ordinary thoughts, was in a cloud and retained only fantasticfairy-tale images, which have the advantage of springing into thebrain of themselves without any effort on the part of the thinker,and completely vanishing of themselves at a mere shake of the head;and, indeed, nothing that was around him disposed to ordinarythoughts. On the right there were the dark hills which seemed tobe screening something unseen and terrible; on the left the wholesky about the horizon was covered with a crimson glow, and it washard to tell whether there was a fire somewhere, or whether it wasthe moon about to rise. As by day the distance could be seen, butits tender lilac tint had gone, quenched by the evening darkness,in which the whole steppe was hidden like Moisey Moisevitch'schildren under the quilt.Corncrakes and quails do not call in the July nights, the nightingaledoes not sing in the woodland marsh, and there is no scent offlowers, but still the steppe is lovely and full of life. As soonas the sun goes down and the darkness enfolds the earth, the day'sweariness is forgotten, everything is forgiven, and the steppebreathes a light sigh from its broad bosom. As though because thegrass cannot see in the dark that it has grown old, a gay youthfultwitter rises up from it, such as is not heard by day; chirruping,twittering, whistling, scratching, the basses, tenors and sopranosof the steppe all mingle in an incessant, monotonous roar of soundin which it is sweet to brood on memories and sorrows. The monotonoustwitter soothes to sleep like a lullaby; you drive and feel you arefalling asleep, but suddenly there comes the abrupt agitated cryof a wakeful bird, or a vague sound like a voice crying out inwonder "A-ah, a-ah!" and slumber closes one's eyelids again. Or youdrive by a little creek where there are bushes and hear the bird,called by the steppe dwellers "the sleeper," call "Asleep, asleep,asleep!" while another laughs or breaks into trills of hystericalweeping--that is the owl. For whom do they call and who hearsthem on that plain, God only knows, but there is deep sadness andlamentation in their cry. . . . There is a scent of hay and drygrass and belated flowers, but the scent is heavy, sweetly mawkishand soft.Everything can be seen through the mist, but it is hard to make outthe colours and the outlines of objects. Everything looks differentfrom what it is. You drive on and suddenly see standing before youright in the roadway a dark figure like a monk; it stands motionless,waiting, holding something in its hands. . . . Can it be a robber?The figure comes closer, grows bigger; now it is on a level withthe chaise, and you see it is not a man, but a solitary bush or agreat stone. Such motionless expectant figures stand on the lowhills, hide behind the old barrows, peep out from the high grass,and they all look like human beings and arouse suspicion.And when the moon rises the night becomes pale and dim. The mistseems to have passed away. The air is transparent, fresh and warm;one can see well in all directions and even distinguish the separatestalks of grass by the wayside. Stones and bits of pots can be seenat a long distance. The suspicious figures like monks look blackeragainst the light background of the night, and seem more sinister.More and more often in the midst of the monotonous chirruping therecomes the sound of the "A-ah, a-ah!" of astonishment troubling themotionless air, and the cry of a sleepless or delirious bird. Broadshadows move across the plain like clouds across the sky, and inthe inconceivable distance, if you look long and intently at it,misty monstrous shapes rise up and huddle one against another. . . .It is rather uncanny. One glances at the pale green, star-spangledsky on which there is no cloudlet, no spot, and understands why thewarm air is motionless, why nature is on her guard, afraid to stir:she is afraid and reluctant to lose one instant of life. Of theunfathomable depth and infinity of the sky one can only form aconception at sea and on the steppe by night when the moon isshining. It is terribly lonely and caressing; it looks down languidand alluring, and its caressing sweetness makes one giddy.You drive on for one hour, for a second. . . . You meet upon theway a silent old barrow or a stone figure put up God knows when andby whom; a nightbird floats noiselessly over the earth, and littleby little those legends of the steppes, the tales of men you havemet, the stories of some old nurse from the steppe, and all thethings you have managed to see and treasure in your soul, come backto your mind. And then in the churring of insects, in the sinisterfigures, in the ancient barrows, in the blue sky, in the moonlight,in the flight of the nightbird, in everything you see and hear,triumphant beauty, youth, the fulness of power, and the passionatethirst for life begin to be apparent; the soul responds to the callof her lovely austere fatherland, and longs to fly over the steppeswith the nightbird. And in the triumph of beauty, in the exuberanceof happiness you are conscious of yearning and grief, as though thesteppe knew she was solitary, knew that her wealth and her inspirationwere wasted for the world, not glorified in song, not wanted byanyone; and through the joyful clamour one hears her mournful,hopeless call for singers, singers!"Woa! Good-evening, Panteley! Is everything all right?""First-rate, Ivan Ivanitch!"Haven't you seen Varlamov, lads?""No, we haven't."Yegorushka woke up and opened his eyes. The chaise had stopped. Onthe right the train of waggons stretched for a long way ahead onthe road, and men were moving to and fro near them. All the waggonsbeing loaded up with great bales of wool looked very high and fat,while the horses looked short-legged and little."Well, then, we shall go on to the Molokans'!" Kuzmitchov saidaloud. "The Jew told us that Varlamov was putting up for the nightat the Molokans'. So good-bye, lads! Good luck to you!""Good-bye, Ivan Ivanitch," several voices replied."I say, lads," Kuzmitchov cried briskly, "you take my little ladalong with you! Why should he go jolting off with us for nothing?You put him on the bales, Panteley, and let him come on slowly, andwe shall overtake you. Get down, Yegor! Go on; it's all right. . . ."Yegorushka got down from the box-seat. Several hands caught him,lifted him high into the air, and he found himself on somethingbig, soft, and rather wet with dew. It seemed to him now as thoughthe sky were quite close and the earth far away."Hey, take his little coat!" Deniska shouted from somewhere farbelow.His coat and bundle flung up from far below fell close to Yegorushka.Anxious not to think of anything, he quickly put his bundle underhis head and covered himself with his coat, and stretching his legsout and shrinking a little from the dew, he laughed with content."Sleep, sleep, sleep, . . ." he thought."Don't be unkind to him, you devils!" he heard Deniska's voicebelow."Good-bye, lads; good luck to you," shouted Kuzmitchov. "I relyupon you!""Don't you be uneasy, Ivan Ivanitch!"Deniska shouted to the horses, the chaise creaked and started, notalong the road, but somewhere off to the side. For two minutes therewas silence, as though the waggons were asleep and there was nosound except the clanking of the pails tied on at the back of thechaise as it slowly died away in the distance. Then someone at thehead of the waggons shouted:"Kiruha! Sta-art!"The foremost of the waggons creaked, then the second, then thethird. . . . Yegorushka felt the waggon he was on sway and creakalso. The waggons were moving. Yegorushka took a tighter hold ofthe cord with which the bales were tied on, laughed again withcontent, shifted the cake in his pocket, and fell asleep just ashe did in his bed at home. . . .When he woke up the sun had risen, it was screened by an ancientbarrow, and, trying to shed its light upon the earth, it scatteredits beams in all directions and flooded the horizon with gold. Itseemed to Yegorushka that it was not in its proper place, as theday before it had risen behind his back, and now it was much moreto his left. . . . And the whole landscape was different. Therewere no hills now, but on all sides, wherever one looked, therestretched the brown cheerless plain; here and there upon it smallbarrows rose up and rooks flew as they had done the day before. Thebelfries and huts of some village showed white in the distanceahead; as it was Sunday the Little Russians were at home baking andcooking--that could be seen by the smoke which rose from everychimney and hung, a dark blue transparent veil, over the village.In between the huts and beyond the church there were blue glimpsesof a river, and beyond the river a misty distance. But nothing wasso different from yesterday as the road. Something extraordinarilybroad, spread out and titanic, stretched over the steppe by way ofa road. It was a grey streak well trodden down and covered withdust, like all roads. Its width puzzled Yegorushka and broughtthoughts of fairy tales to his mind. Who travelled along that road?Who needed so much space? It was strange and unintelligible. Itmight have been supposed that giants with immense strides, such asIlya Muromets and Solovy the Brigand, were still surviving in Russia,and that their gigantic steeds were still alive. Yegorushka, lookingat the road, imagined some half a dozen high chariots racing alongside by side, like some he used to see in pictures in his Scripturehistory; these chariots were each drawn by six wild furious horses,and their great wheels raised a cloud of dust to the sky, while thehorses were driven by men such as one may see in one's dreams orin imagination brooding over fairy tales. And if those figures hadexisted, how perfectly in keeping with the steppe and the road theywould have been!Telegraph-poles with two wires on them stretched along the rightside of the road to its furthermost limit. Growing smaller andsmaller they disappeared near the village behind the huts and greentrees, and then again came into sight in the lilac distance in theform of very small thin sticks that looked like pencils stuck intothe ground. Hawks, falcons, and crows sat on the wires and lookedindifferently at the moving waggons.Yegorushka was lying in the last of the waggons, and so could seethe whole string. There were about twenty waggons, and there was adriver to every three waggons. By the last waggon, the one in whichYegorushka was, there walked an old man with a grey beard, as shortand lean as Father Christopher, but with a sunburnt, stern andbrooding face. It is very possible that the old man was not sternand not brooding, but his red eyelids and his sharp long nose gavehis face a stern frigid expression such as is common with peoplein the habit of continually thinking of serious things in solitude.Like Father Christopher he was wearing a wide-brimmed top-hat, notlike a gentleman's, but made of brown felt, and in shape more likea cone with the top cut off than a real top-hat. Probably from ahabit acquired in cold winters, when he must more than once havebeen nearly frozen as he trudged beside the waggons, he kept slappinghis thighs and stamping with his feet as he walked. Noticing thatYegorushka was awake, he looked at him and said, shrugging hisshoulders as though from the cold:"Ah, you are awake, youngster! So you are the son of Ivan Ivanitch?""No; his nephew. . . .""Nephew of Ivan Ivanitch? Here I have taken off my boots and amhopping along barefoot. My feet are bad; they are swollen, and it'seasier without my boots . . . easier, youngster . . . without boots,I mean. . . . So you are his nephew? He is a good man; no harm inhim. . . . God give him health. . . . No harm in him . . . I meanIvan Ivanitch. . . . He has gone to the Molokans'. . . . O Lord,have mercy upon us!"The old man talked, too, as though it were very cold, pausing andnot opening his mouth properly; and he mispronounced the labialconsonants, stuttering over them as though his lips were frozen.As he talked to Yegorushka he did not once smile, and he seemedstern.Two waggons ahead of them there walked a man wearing a longreddish-brown coat, a cap and high boots with sagging bootlegs andcarrying a whip in his hand. This was not an old man, only aboutforty. When he looked round Yegorushka saw a long red face with ascanty goat-beard and a spongy looking swelling under his righteye. Apart from this very ugly swelling, there was another peculiarthing about him which caught the eye at once: in his left hand hecarried a whip, while he waved the right as though he were conductingan unseen choir; from time to time he put the whip under his arm,and then he conducted with both hands and hummed something tohimself.The next driver was a long rectilinear figure with extremely slopingshoulders and a back as flat as a board. He held himself as stifflyerect as though he were marching or had swallowed a yard measure.His hands did not swing as he walked, but hung down as if they werestraight sticks, and he strode along in a wooden way, after themanner of toy soldiers, almost without bending his knees, and tryingto take as long steps as possible. While the old man or the ownerof the spongy swelling were taking two steps he succeeded in takingonly one, and so it seemed as though he were walking more slowlythan any of them, and would drop behind. His face was tied up in arag, and on his head something stuck up that looked like a monk'speaked cap; he was dressed in a short Little Russian coat, withfull dark blue trousers and bark shoes.Yegorushka did not even distinguish those that were farther on. Helay on his stomach, picked a little hole in the bale, and, havingnothing better to do, began twisting the wool into a thread. Theold man trudging along below him turned out not to be so stern asone might have supposed from his face. Having begun a conversation,he did not let it drop."Where are you going?" he asked, stamping with his feet."To school," answered Yegorushka."To school? Aha! . . . Well, may the Queen of Heaven help you. Yes.One brain is good, but two are better. To one man God gives onebrain, to another two brains, and to another three. . . . To anotherthree, that is true. . . . One brain you are born with, one you getfrom learning, and a third with a good life. So you see, my lad,it is a good thing if a man has three brains. Living is easier forhim, and, what's more, dying is, too. Dying is, too. . . . And weshall all die for sure."The old man scratched his forehead, glanced upwards at Yegorushkawith his red eyes, and went on:"Maxim Nikolaitch, the gentleman from Slavyanoserbsk, brought alittle lad to school, too, last year. I don't know how he is gettingon there in studying the sciences, but he was a nice good littlelad. . . . God give them help, they are nice gentlemen. Yes, he,too, brought his boy to school. . . . In Slavyanoserbsk there isno establishment, I suppose, for study. No. . . . But it is a nicetown. . . . There's an ordinary school for simple folks, but forthe higher studies there is nothing. No, that's true. What's yourname? . . .""Yegorushka.""Yegory, then. . . . The holy martyr Yegory, the Bearer of Victory,whose day is the twenty-third of April. And my christian name isPanteley, . . . Panteley Zaharov Holodov. . . . We are Holodovs. . . . I am a native of--maybe you've heard of it--Tim in theprovince of Kursk. My brothers are artisans and work at trades inthe town, but I am a peasant. . . . I have remained a peasant. Sevenyears ago I went there--home, I mean. I went to the village andto the town. . . . To Tim, I mean. Then, thank God, they were allalive and well; . . . but now I don't know. . . . Maybe some ofthem are dead. . . . And it's time they did die, for some of themare older than I am. Death is all right; it is good so long, ofcourse, as one does not die without repentance. There is no worseevil than an impenitent death; an impenitent death is a joy to thedevil. And if you want to die penitent, so that you may not beforbidden to enter the mansions of the Lord, pray to the holy martyrVarvara. She is the intercessor. She is, that's the truth. . . .For God has given her such a place in the heavens that everyone hasthe right to pray to her for penitence."Panteley went on muttering, and apparently did not trouble whetherYegorushka heard him or not. He talked listlessly, mumbling tohimself, without raising or dropping his voice, but succeeded intelling him a great deal in a short time. All he said was made upof fragments that had very little connection with one another, andquite uninteresting for Yegorushka. Possibly he talked only in orderto reckon over his thoughts aloud after the night spent in silence,in order to see if they were all there. After talking of repentance,he spoke about a certain Maxim Nikolaitch from Slavyanoserbsk."Yes, he took his little lad; . . . he took him, that's true . . ."One of the waggoners walking in front darted from his place, ranto one side and began lashing on the ground with his whip. He wasa stalwart, broad-shouldered man of thirty, with curly flaxen hairand a look of great health and vigour. Judging from the movementsof his shoulders and the whip, and the eagerness expressed in hisattitude, he was beating something alive. Another waggoner, a shortstubby little man with a bushy black beard, wearing a waistcoat anda shirt outside his trousers, ran up to him. The latter broke intoa deep guffaw of laughter and coughing and said: "I say, lads, Dymovhas killed a snake!"There are people whose intelligence can be gauged at once by theirvoice and laughter. The man with the black beard belonged to thatclass of fortunate individuals; impenetrable stupidity could befelt in his voice and laugh. The flaxen-headed Dymov had finished,and lifting from the ground with his whip something like a cord,flung it with a laugh into the cart."That's not a viper; it's a grass snake!" shouted someone.The man with the wooden gait and the bandage round his face strodeup quickly to the dead snake, glanced at it and flung up hisstick-like arms."You jail-bird!" he cried in a hollow wailing voice. "What have youkilled a grass snake for? What had he done to you, you damned brute?Look, he has killed a grass snake; how would you like to be treatedso?""Grass snakes ought not to be killed, that's true," Panteley mutteredplacidly, "they ought not. . . They are not vipers; though it lookslike a snake, it is a gentle, innocent creature. . . . It's friendlyto man, the grass snake is."Dymov and the man with the black beard were probably ashamed, forthey laughed loudly, and not answering, slouched lazily back totheir waggons. When the hindmost waggon was level with the spotwhere the dead snake lay, the man with his face tied up standingover it turned to Panteley and asked in a tearful voice:"Grandfather, what did he want to kill the grass snake for?"His eyes, as Yegorushka saw now, were small and dingy looking; hisface was grey, sickly and looked somehow dingy too while his chinwas red and seemed very much swollen."Grandfather, what did he kill it for?" he repeated, striding alongbeside Panteley."A stupid fellow. His hands itch to kill, and that is why he doesit," answered the old man; "but he oughtn't to kill a grass snake,that's true. . . . Dymov is a ruffian, we all know, he killseverything he comes across, and Kiruha did not interfere. He oughtto have taken its part, but instead of that, he goes off into'Ha-ha-ha!' and 'Ho-ho-ho!' . . . But don't be angry, Vassya. . . .Why be angry? They've killed it--well, never mind them. Dymovis a ruffian and Kiruha acted from foolishness--never mind. . . .They are foolish people without understanding--but there, don'tmind them. Emelyan here never touches what he shouldn't; he neverdoes; . . . that is true, . . . because he is a man of education,while they are stupid. . . . Emelyan, he doesn't touch things."The waggoner in the reddish-brown coat and the spongy swelling onhis face, who was conducting an unseen choir, stopped. Hearing hisname, and waiting till Panteley and Vassya came up to him, he walkedbeside them."What are you talking about?" he asked in a husky muffled voice."Why, Vassya here is angry," said Panteley. "So I have been sayingthings to him to stop his being angry. . . . Oh, how my swollenfeet hurt! Oh, oh! They are more inflamed than ever for Sunday,God's holy day!""It's from walking," observed Vassya."No, lad, no. It's not from walking. When I walk it seems easier;when I lie down and get warm, . . . it's deadly. Walking is easierfor me."Emelyan, in his reddish-brown coat, walked between Panteley andVassya and waved his arms, as though they were going to sing. Afterwaving them a little while he dropped them, and croaked out hopelessly:"I have no voice. It's a real misfortune. All last night and thismorning I have been haunted by the trio 'Lord, have Mercy' that wesang at the wedding at Marionovsky's. It's in my head and in mythroat. It seems as though I could sing it, but I can't; I have novoice."He paused for a minute, thinking, then went on:"For fifteen years I was in the choir. In all the Lugansky worksthere was, maybe, no one with a voice like mine. But, confound it,I bathed two years ago in the Donets, and I can't get a single notetrue ever since. I took cold in my throat. And without a voice Iam like a workman without hands.""That's true," Panteley agreed."I think of myself as a ruined man and nothing more."At that moment Vassya chanced to catch sight of Yegorushka. Hiseyes grew moist and smaller than ever."There's a little gentleman driving with us," and he covered hisnose with his sleeve as though he were bashful. "What a grand driver!Stay with us and you shall drive the waggons and sell wool."The incongruity of one person being at once a little gentleman anda waggon driver seemed to strike him as very queer and funny, forhe burst into a loud guffaw, and went on enlarging upon the idea.Emelyan glanced upwards at Yegorushka, too, but coldly and cursorily.He was absorbed in his own thoughts, and had it not been for Vassya,would not have noticed Yegorushka's presence. Before five minuteshad passed he was waving his arms again, then describing to hiscompanions the beauties of the wedding anthem, "Lord, have Mercy,"which he had remembered in the night. He put the whip under his armand waved both hands.A mile from the village the waggons stopped by a well with a crane.Letting his pail down into the well, black-bearded Kiruha lay onhis stomach on the framework and thrust his shaggy head, hisshoulders, and part of his chest into the black hole, so thatYegorushka could see nothing but his short legs, which scarcelytouched the ground. Seeing the reflection of his head far down atthe bottom of the well, he was delighted and went off into his deepbass stupid laugh, and the echo from the well answered him. Whenhe got up his neck and face were as red as beetroot. The first torun up and drink was Dymov. He drank laughing, often turning fromthe pail to tell Kiruha something funny, then he turned round, anduttered aloud, to be heard all over the steppe, five very bad words.Yegorushka did not understand the meaning of such words, but heknew very well they were bad words. He knew the repulsion his friendsand relations silently felt for such words. He himself, withoutknowing why, shared that feeling and was accustomed to think thatonly drunk and disorderly people enjoy the privilege of utteringsuch words aloud. He remembered the murder of the grass snake,listened to Dymov's laughter, and felt something like hatred forthe man. And as ill-luck would have it, Dymov at that moment caughtsight of Yegorushka, who had climbed down from the waggon and goneup to the well. He laughed aloud and shouted:"I say, lads, the old man has been brought to bed of a boy in thenight!"Kiruha laughed his bass laugh till he coughed. Someone else laughedtoo, while Yegorushka crimsoned and made up his mind finally thatDymov was a very wicked man.With his curly flaxen head, with his shirt opened on his chest andno hat on, Dymov looked handsome and exceptionally strong; in everymovement he made one could see the reckless dare-devil and athlete,knowing his value. He shrugged his shoulders, put his arms akimbo,talked and laughed louder than any of the rest, and looked as thoughhe were going to lift up something very heavy with one hand andastonish the whole world by doing so. His mischievous mocking eyesglided over the road, the waggons, and the sky without resting onanything, and seemed looking for someone to kill, just as a pastime,and something to laugh at. Evidently he was afraid of no one, wouldstick at nothing, and most likely was not in the least interestedin Yegorushka's opinion of him. . . . Yegorushka meanwhile hatedhis flaxen head, his clear face, and his strength with his wholeheart, listened with fear and loathing to his laughter, and keptthinking what word of abuse he could pay him out with.Panteley, too, went up to the pail. He took out of his pocket alittle green glass of an ikon lamp, wiped it with a rag, filled itfrom the pail and drank from it, then filled it again, wrapped thelittle glass in the rag, and then put it back into his pocket."Grandfather, why do you drink out of a lamp?" Yegorushka askedhim, surprised."One man drinks out of a pail and another out of a lamp," the oldman answered evasively. "Every man to his own taste. . . . You drinkout of the pail--well, drink, and may it do you good. . . .""You darling, you beauty!" Vassya said suddenly, in a caressing,plaintive voice. "You darling!"His eyes were fixed on the distance; they were moist and smiling,and his face wore the same expression as when he had looked atYegorushka."Who is it you are talking to?" asked Kiruha."A darling fox, . . . lying on her back, playing like a dog."Everyone began staring into the distance, looking for the fox, butno one could see it, only Vassya with his grey muddy-looking eyes,and he was enchanted by it. His sight was extraordinarily keen, asYegorushka learnt afterwards. He was so long-sighted that the brownsteppe was for him always full of life and interest. He had onlyto look into the distance to see a fox, a hare, a bustard, or someother animal keeping at a distance from men. There was nothingstrange in seeing a hare running away or a flying bustard--everyonecrossing the steppes could see them; but it was not vouchsafed toeveryone to see wild animals in their own haunts when they were notrunning nor hiding, nor looking about them in alarm. Yet Vassya sawfoxes playing, hares washing themselves with their paws, bustardspreening their wings and hammering out their hollow nests. Thanksto this keenness of sight, Vassya had, besides the world seen byeveryone, another world of his own, accessible to no one else, andprobably a very beautiful one, for when he saw something and wasin raptures over it it was impossible not to envy him.When the waggons set off again, the church bells were ringing forservice.VThe train of waggons drew up on the bank of a river on one side ofa village. The sun was blazing, as it had been the day before; theair was stagnant and depressing. There were a few willows on thebank, but the shade from them did not fall on the earth, but on thewater, where it was wasted; even in the shade under the waggon itwas stifling and wearisome. The water, blue from the reflection ofthe sky in it, was alluring.Styopka, a waggoner whom Yegorushka noticed now for the first time,a Little Russian lad of eighteen, in a long shirt without a belt,and full trousers that flapped like flags as he walked, undressedquickly, ran along the steep bank and plunged into the water. Hedived three times, then swam on his back and shut his eyes in hisdelight. His face was smiling and wrinkled up as though he werebeing tickled, hurt and amused.On a hot day when there is nowhere to escape from the sultry,stifling heat, the splash of water and the loud breathing of a manbathing sounds like good music to the ear. Dymov and Kiruha, lookingat Styopka, undressed quickly and one after the other, laughingloudly in eager anticipation of their enjoyment, dropped into thewater, and the quiet, modest little river resounded with snortingand splashing and shouting. Kiruha coughed, laughed and shouted asthough they were trying to drown him, while Dymov chased him andtried to catch him by the leg."Ha-ha-ha!" he shouted. "Catch him! Hold him!"Kiruha laughed and enjoyed himself, but his expression was the sameas it had been on dry land, stupid, with a look of astonishment onit as though someone had, unnoticed, stolen up behind him and hithim on the head with the butt-end of an axe. Yegorushka undressed,too, but did not let himself down by the bank, but took a run anda flying leap from the height of about ten feet. Describing an arcin the air, he fell into the water, sank deep, but did not reachthe bottom; some force, cold and pleasant to the touch, seemed tohold him up and bring him back to the surface. He popped out and,snorting and blowing bubbles, opened his eyes; but the sun wasreflected in the water quite close to his face. At first blindingspots of light, then rainbow colours and dark patches, flittedbefore his eyes. He made haste to dive again, opened his eyes inthe water and saw something cloudy-green like a sky on a moonlightnight. Again the same force would not let him touch the bottom andstay in the coolness, but lifted him to the surface. He popped outand heaved a sigh so deep that he had a feeling of space andfreshness, not only in his chest, but in his stomach. Then, to getfrom the water everything he possibly could get, he allowed himselfevery luxury; he lay on his back and basked, splashed, frolicked,swam on his face, on his side, on his back and standing up--justas he pleased till he was exhausted. The other bank was thicklyovergrown with reeds; it was golden in the sun, and the flowers ofthe reeds hung drooping to the water in lovely tassels. In one placethe reeds were shaking and nodding, with their flowers rustling--Styopka and Kiruha were hunting crayfish."A crayfish, look, lads! A crayfish!" Kiruha cried triumphantly andactually showed a crayfish.Yegorushka swam up to the reeds, dived, and began fumbling amongtheir roots. Burrowing in the slimy, liquid mud, he felt somethingsharp and unpleasant--perhaps it really was a crayfish. But atthat minute someone seized him by the leg and pulled him to thesurface. Spluttering and coughing, Yegorushka opened his eyes andsaw before him the wet grinning face of the dare-devil Dymov. Theimpudent fellow was breathing hard, and from a look in his eyes heseemed inclined for further mischief. He held Yegorushka tight bythe leg, and was lifting his hand to take hold of his neck. ButYegorushka tore himself away with repulsion and terror, as thoughdisgusted at being touched and afraid that the bully would drownhim, and said:"Fool! I'll punch you in the face."Feeling that this was not sufficient to express his hatred, hethought a minute and added:"You blackguard! You son of a bitch!"But Dymov, as though nothing were the matter, took no further noticeof Yegorushka, but swam off to Kiruha, shouting:"Ha-ha-ha! Let us catch fish! Mates, let us catch fish.""To be sure," Kiruha agreed; "there must be a lot of fish here.""Styopka, run to the village and ask the peasants for a net!"They won't give it to me.""They will, you ask them. Tell them that they should give it to usfor Christ's sake, because we are just the same as pilgrims.""That's true."Styopka clambered out of the water, dressed quickly, and without acap on he ran, his full trousers flapping, to the village. The waterlost all its charm for Yegorushka after his encounter with Dymov.He got out and began dressing. Panteley and Vassya were sitting onthe steep bank, with their legs hanging down, looking at the bathers.Emelyan was standing naked, up to his knees in the water, holdingon to the grass with one hand to prevent himself from falling whilethe other stroked his body. With his bony shoulder-blades, with theswelling under his eye, bending down and evidently afraid of thewater, he made a ludicrous figure. His face was grave and severe.He looked angrily at the water, as though he were just going toupbraid it for having given him cold in the Donets and robbed himof his voice."And why don't you bathe?" Yegorushka asked Vassya."Oh, I don't care for it, . . ." answered Vassya."How is it your chin is swollen?""It's bad. . . . I used to work at the match factory, little sir.. . . The doctor used to say that it would make my jaw rot. The airis not healthy there. There were three chaps beside me who had theirjaws swollen, and with one of them it rotted away altogether."Styopka soon came back with the net. Dymov and Kiruha were alreadyturning blue and getting hoarse by being so long in the water, butthey set about fishing eagerly. First they went to a deep placebeside the reeds; there Dymov was up to his neck, while the waterwent over squat Kiruha's head. The latter spluttered and blewbubbles, while Dymov stumbling on the prickly roots, fell over andgot caught in the net; both flopped about in the water, and made anoise, and nothing but mischief came of their fishing."It's deep," croaked Kiruha. "You won't catch anything.""Don't tug, you devil!" shouted Dymov trying to put the net in theproper position. "Hold it up.""You won't catch anything here," Panteley shouted from the bank."You are only frightening the fish, you stupids! Go more to theleft! It's shallower there!"Once a big fish gleamed above the net; they all drew a breath, andDymov struck the place where it had vanished with his fist, and hisface expressed vexation."Ugh!" cried Panteley, and he stamped his foot. "You've let theperch slip! It's gone!"Moving more to the left, Dymov and Kiruha picked out a shallowerplace, and then fishing began in earnest. They had wandered offsome hundred paces from the waggons; they could be seen silentlytrying to go as deep as they could and as near the reeds, movingtheir legs a little at a time, drawing out the nets, beating thewater with their fists to drive them towards the nets. From thereeds they got to the further bank; they drew the net out, then,with a disappointed air, lifting their knees high as they walked,went back into the reeds. They were talking about something, butwhat it was no one could hear. The sun was scorching their backs,the flies were stinging them, and their bodies had turned frompurple to crimson. Styopka was walking after them with a pail inhis hands; he had tucked his shirt right up under his armpits, andwas holding it up by the hem with his teeth. After every successfulcatch he lifted up some fish, and letting it shine in the sun,shouted:"Look at this perch! We've five like that!"Every time Dymov, Kiruha and Styopka pulled out the net they couldbe seen fumbling about in the mud in it, putting some things intothe pail and throwing other things away; sometimes they passedsomething that was in the net from hand to hand, examined itinquisitively, then threw that, too, away."What is it?" they shouted to them from the bank.Styopka made some answer, but it was hard to make out his words.Then he climbed out of the water and, holding the pail in bothhands, forgetting to let his shirt drop, ran to the waggons."It's full!" he shouted, breathing hard. "Give us another!"Yegorushka looked into the pail: it was full. A young pike pokedits ugly nose out of the water, and there were swarms of crayfishand little fish round about it. Yegorushka put his hand down to thebottom and stirred up the water; the pike vanished under the crayfishand a perch and a tench swam to the surface instead of it. Vassya,too, looked into the pail. His eyes grew moist and his face lookedas caressing as before when he saw the fox. He took something outof the pail, put it to his mouth and began chewing it."Mates," said Styopka in amazement, "Vassya is eating a live gudgeon!Phoo!""It's not a gudgeon, but a minnow," Vassya answered calmly, stillmunching.He took a fish's tail out of his mouth, looked at it caressingly,and put it back again. While he was chewing and crunching with histeeth it seemed to Yegorushka that he saw before him something nothuman. Vassya's swollen chin, his lustreless eyes, his extraordinarysharp sight, the fish's tail in his mouth, and the caressingfriendliness with which he crunched the gudgeon made him like ananimal.Yegorushka felt dreary beside him. And the fishing was over, too.He walked about beside the waggons, thought a little, and, feelingbored, strolled off to the village.Not long afterwards he was standing in the church, and with hisforehead leaning on somebody's back, listened to the singing of thechoir. The service was drawing to a close. Yegorushka did notunderstand church singing and did not care for it. He listened alittle, yawned, and began looking at the backs and heads beforehim. In one head, red and wet from his recent bathe, he recognizedEmelyan. The back of his head had been cropped in a straight linehigher than is usual; the hair in front had been cut unbecominglyhigh, and Emelyan's ears stood out like two dock leaves, and seemedto feel themselves out of place. Looking at the back of his headand his ears, Yegorushka, for some reason, thought that Emelyan wasprobably very unhappy. He remembered the way he conducted with hishands, his husky voice, his timid air when he was bathing, and feltintense pity for him. He longed to say something friendly to him."I am here, too," he said, putting out his hand.People who sing tenor or bass in the choir, especially those whohave at any time in their lives conducted, are accustomed to lookwith a stern and unfriendly air at boys. They do not give up thishabit, even when they leave off being in a choir. Turning toYegorushka, Emelyan looked at him from under his brows and said:"Don't play in church!"Then Yegorushka moved forwards nearer to the ikon-stand. Here hesaw interesting people. On the right side, in front of everyone, alady and a gentleman were standing on a carpet. There were chairsbehind them. The gentleman was wearing newly ironed shantung trousers;he stood as motionless as a soldier saluting, and held high hisbluish shaven chin. There was a very great air of dignity in hisstand-up collar, in his blue chin, in his small bald patch and hiscane. His neck was so strained from excess of dignity, and his chinwas drawn up so tensely, that it looked as though his head wereready to fly off and soar upwards any minute. The lady, who wasstout and elderly and wore a white silk shawl, held her head on oneside and looked as though she had done someone a favour, and wantedto say: "Oh, don't trouble yourself to thank me; I don't like it. . . ." A thick wall of Little Russian heads stood all round thecarpet.Yegorushka went up to the ikon-stand and began kissing the localikons. Before each image he slowly bowed down to the ground, withoutgetting up, looked round at the congregation, then got up and kissedthe ikon. The contact of his forehead with the cold floor affordedhim great satisfaction. When the beadle came from the altar with apair of long snuffers to put out the candles, Yegorushka jumped upquickly from the floor and ran up to him."Have they given out the holy bread?" he asked."There is none; there is none," the beadle muttered gruffly. "Itis no use your. . ."The service was over; Yegorushka walked out of the church in aleisurely way, and began strolling about the market-place. He hadseen a good many villages, market-places, and peasants in his time,and everything that met his eyes was entirely without interest forhim. At a loss for something to do, he went into a shop over thedoor of which hung a wide strip of red cotton. The shop consistedof two roomy, badly lighted parts; in one half they sold draperyand groceries, in the other there were tubs of tar, and there werehorse-collars hanging from the ceiling; from both came the savourysmell of leather and tar. The floor of the shop had been watered;the man who watered it must have been a very whimsical and originalperson, for it was sprinkled in patterns and mysterious symbols.The shopkeeper, an overfed-looking man with a broad face and roundbeard, apparently a Great Russian, was standing, leaning his personover the counter. He was nibbling a piece of sugar as he drank histea, and heaved a deep sigh at every sip. His face expressed completeindifference, but each sigh seemed to be saying:"Just wait a minute; I will give it you.""Give me a farthing's worth of sunflower seeds," Yegorushka said,addressing him.The shopkeeper raised his eyebrows, came out from behind the counter,and poured a farthing's worth of sunflower seeds into Yegorushka'spocket, using an empty pomatum pot as a measure. Yegorushka did notwant to go away. He spent a long time in examining the box of cakes,thought a little and asked, pointing to some little cakes coveredwith the mildew of age:"How much are these cakes?""Two for a farthing."Yegorushka took out of his pocket the cake given him the day beforeby the Jewess, and asked him:"And how much do you charge for cakes like this?"The shopman took the cake in his hands, looked at it from all sides,and raised one eyebrow."Like that?" he asked.Then he raised the other eyebrow, thought a minute, and answered:"Two for three farthings. . . ."A silence followed."Whose boy are you?" the shopman asked, pouring himself out sometea from a red copper teapot."The nephew of Ivan Ivanitch.""There are all sorts of Ivan Ivanitchs," the shopkeeper sighed. Helooked over Yegorushka's head towards the door, paused a minute andasked:"Would you like some tea?""Please. . . ." Yegorushka assented not very readily, though hefelt an intense longing for his usual morning tea.The shopkeeper poured him out a glass and gave him with it a bitof sugar that looked as though it had been nibbled. Yegorushka satdown on the folding chair and began drinking it. He wanted to askthe price of a pound of sugar almonds, and had just broached thesubject when a customer walked in, and the shopkeeper, leaving hisglass of tea, attended to his business. He led the customer intothe other half, where there was a smell of tar, and was there along time discussing something with him. The customer, a manapparently very obstinate and pig-headed, was continually shakinghis head to signify his disapproval, and retreating towards thedoor. The shopkeeper tried to persuade him of something and beganpouring some oats into a big sack for him."Do you call those oats?" the customer said gloomily. "Those arenot oats, but chaff. It's a mockery to give that to the hens; enoughto make the hens laugh. . . . No, I will go to Bondarenko."When Yegorushka went back to the river a small camp fire was smokingon the bank. The waggoners were cooking their dinner. Styopka wasstanding in the smoke, stirring the cauldron with a big notchedspoon. A little on one side Kiruha and Vassya, with eyes reddenedfrom the smoke, were sitting cleaning the fish. Before them lay thenet covered with slime and water weeds, and on it lay gleaming fishand crawling crayfish.Emelyan, who had not long been back from the church, was sittingbeside Panteley, waving his arm and humming just audibly in a huskyvoice: "To Thee we sing. . . ." Dymov was moving about by the horses.When they had finished cleaning them, Kiruha and Vassya put thefish and the living crayfish together in the pail, rinsed them, andfrom the pail poured them all into the boiling water."Shall I put in some fat?" asked Styopka, skimming off the froth."No need. The fish will make its own gravy," answered Kiruha.Before taking the cauldron off the fire Styopka scattered into thewater three big handfuls of millet and a spoonful of salt; finallyhe tried it, smacked his lips, licked the spoon, and gave aself-satisfied grunt, which meant that the grain was done.All except Panteley sat down near the cauldron and set to work withtheir spoons."You there! Give the little lad a spoon!" Panteley observed sternly."I dare say he is hungry too!""Ours is peasant fare," sighed Kiruha."Peasant fare is welcome, too, when one is hungry."They gave Yegorushka a spoon. He began eating, not sitting, butstanding close to the cauldron and looking down into it as in ahole. The grain smelt of fish and fish-scales were mixed up withthe millet. The crayfish could not be hooked out with a spoon, andthe men simply picked them out of the cauldron with their hands;Vassya did so particularly freely, and wetted his sleeves as wellas his hands in the mess. But yet the stew seemed to Yegorushkavery nice, and reminded him of the crayfish soup which his motherused to make at home on fast-days. Panteley was sitting apartmunching bread."Grandfather, why aren't you eating?" Emelyan asked him."I don't eat crayfish. . . . Nasty things," the old man said, andturned away with disgust.While they were eating they all talked. From this conversationYegorushka gathered that all his new acquaintances, in spite of thedifferences of their ages and their characters, had one point incommon which made them all alike: they were all people with asplendid past and a very poor present. Of their past they all--every one of them--spoke with enthusiasm; their attitude to thepresent was almost one of contempt. The Russian loves recallinglife, but he does not love living. Yegorushka did not yet know that,and before the stew had been all eaten he firmly believed that themen sitting round the cauldron were the injured victims of fate.Panteley told them that in the past, before there were railways,he used to go with trains of waggons to Moscow and to Nizhni, andused to earn so much that he did not know what to do with his money;and what merchants there used to be in those days! what fish! howcheap everything was! Now the roads were shorter, the merchantswere stingier, the peasants were poorer, the bread was dearer,everything had shrunk and was on a smaller scale. Emelyan told themthat in old days he had been in the choir in the Lugansky works,and that he had a remarkable voice and read music splendidly, whilenow he had become a peasant and lived on the charity of his brother,who sent him out with his horses and took half his earnings. Vassyahad once worked in a match factory; Kiruha had been a coachman ina good family, and had been reckoned the smartest driver of athree-in-hand in the whole district. Dymov, the son of a well-to-dopeasant, lived at ease, enjoyed himself and had known no troubletill he was twenty, when his stern harsh father, anxious to trainhim to work, and afraid he would be spoiled at home, had sent himto a carrier's to work as a hired labourer. Styopka was the onlyone who said nothing, but from his beardless face it was evidentthat his life had been a much better one in the past.Thinking of his father, Dymov frowned and left off eating. Sullenlyfrom under his brows he looked round at his companions and his eyerested upon Yegorushka."You heathen, take off your cap," he said rudely. "You can't eatwith your cap on, and you a gentleman too!"Yegorushka took off his hat and did not say a word, but the stewlost all savour for him, and he did not hear Panteley and Vassyaintervening on his behalf. A feeling of anger with the insultingfellow was rankling oppressively in his breast, and he made up hismind that he would do him some injury, whatever it cost him.After dinner everyone sauntered to the waggons and lay down in theshade."Are we going to start soon, grandfather?" Yegorushka asked Panteley."In God's good time we shall set off. There's no starting yet; itis too hot. . . . O Lord, Thy will be done. Holy Mother. . . Liedown, little lad."Soon there was a sound of snoring from under the waggons. Yegorushkameant to go back to the village, but on consideration, yawned andlay down by the old man.VIThe waggons remained by the river the whole day, and set off againwhen the sun was setting.Yegorushka was lying on the bales again; the waggon creaked softlyand swayed from side to side. Panteley walked below, stamping hisfeet, slapping himself on his thighs and muttering. The air wasfull of the churring music of the steppes, as it had been the daybefore.Yegorushka lay on his back, and, putting his hands under his head,gazed upwards at the sky. He watched the glow of sunset kindle,then fade away; guardian angels covering the horizon with theirgold wings disposed themselves to slumber. The day had passedpeacefully; the quiet peaceful night had come, and they could staytranquilly at home in heaven. . . . Yegorushka saw the sky by degreesgrow dark and the mist fall over the earth--saw the stars lightup, one after the other. . . .When you gaze a long while fixedly at the deep sky thoughts andfeelings for some reason merge in a sense of loneliness. One beginsto feel hopelessly solitary, and everything one used to look uponas near and akin becomes infinitely remote and valueless; the starsthat have looked down from the sky thousands of years already, themists and the incomprehensible sky itself, indifferent to the brieflife of man, oppress the soul with their silence when one is leftface to face with them and tries to grasp their significance. Oneis reminded of the solitude awaiting each one of us in the grave,and the reality of life seems awful . . . full of despair. . . .Yegorushka thought of his grandmother, who was sleeping now underthe cherry-trees in the cemetery. He remembered how she lay in hercoffin with pennies on her eyes, how afterwards she was shut in andlet down into the grave; he even recalled the hollow sound of theclods of earth on the coffin lid. . . . He pictured his granny inthe dark and narrow coffin, helpless and deserted by everyone. Hisimagination pictured his granny suddenly awakening, not understandingwhere she was, knocking upon the lid and calling for help, and inthe end swooning with horror and dying again. He imagined his motherdead, Father Christopher, Countess Dranitsky, Solomon. But howevermuch he tried to imagine himself in the dark tomb, far from home,outcast, helpless and dead, he could not succeed; for himselfpersonally he could not admit the possibility of death, and feltthat he would never die. . . .Panteley, for whom death could not be far away, walked below andwent on reckoning up his thoughts."All right. . . . Nice gentlefolk, . . ." he muttered. "Took hislittle lad to school--but how he is doing now I haven't heard say--in Slavyanoserbsk. I say there is no establishment for teachingthem to be very clever. . . . No, that's true--a nice little lad,no harm in him. . . . He'll grow up and be a help to his father. . . . You, Yegory, are little now, but you'll grow big and willkeep your father and mother. . . . So it is ordained of God, 'Honouryour father and your mother.' . . . I had children myself, but theywere burnt. . . . My wife was burnt and my children, . . . that'strue. . . . The hut caught fire on the night of Epiphany. . . . Iwas not at home, I was driving in Oryol. In Oryol. . . . Maryadashed out into the street, but remembering that the children wereasleep in the hut, ran back and was burnt with her children. . . .Next day they found nothing but bones."About midnight Yegorushka and the waggoners were again sitting rounda small camp fire. While the dry twigs and stems were burning up,Kiruha and Vassya went off somewhere to get water from a creek;they vanished into the darkness, but could be heard all the timetalking and clinking their pails; so the creek was not far away.The light from the fire lay a great flickering patch on the earth;though the moon was bright, yet everything seemed impenetrably blackbeyond that red patch. The light was in the waggoners' eyes, andthey saw only part of the great road; almost unseen in the darknessthe waggons with the bales and the horses looked like a mountainof undefined shape. Twenty paces from the camp fire at the edge ofthe road stood a wooden cross that had fallen aslant. Before thecamp fire had been lighted, when he could still see things at adistance, Yegorushka had noticed that there was a similar oldslanting cross on the other side of the great road.Coming back with the water, Kiruha and Vassya filled the cauldronand fixed it over the fire. Styopka, with the notched spoon in hishand, took his place in the smoke by the cauldron, gazing dreamilyinto the water for the scum to rise. Panteley and Emelyan weresitting side by side in silence, brooding over something. Dymov waslying on his stomach, with his head propped on his fists, lookinginto the fire. . . . Styopka's shadow was dancing over him, so thathis handsome face was at one minute covered with darkness, at thenext lighted up. . . . Kiruha and Vassya were wandering about at alittle distance gathering dry grass and bark for the fire. Yegorushka,with his hands in his pockets, was standing by Panteley, watchinghow the fire devoured the grass.All were resting, musing on something, and they glanced cursorilyat the cross over which patches of red light were dancing. Thereis something melancholy, pensive, and extremely poetical about asolitary tomb; one feels its silence, and the silence gives one thesense of the presence of the soul of the unknown man who lies underthe cross. Is that soul at peace on the steppe? Does it grieve inthe moonlight? Near the tomb the steppe seems melancholy, drearyand mournful; the grass seems more sorrowful, and one fancies thegrasshoppers chirrup less freely, and there is no passer-by whowould not remember that lonely soul and keep looking back at thetomb, till it was left far behind and hidden in the mists. . . ."Grandfather, what is that cross for?" asked Yegorushka.Panteley looked at the cross and then at Dymov and asked:"Nikola, isn't this the place where the mowers killed the merchants?"Dymov not very readily raised himself on his elbow, looked at theroad and said:"Yes, it is. . . ."A silence followed. Kiruha broke up some dry stalks, crushed themup together and thrust them under the cauldron. The fire flared upbrightly; Styopka was enveloped in black smoke, and the shadow castby the cross danced along the road in the dusk beside the waggons."Yes, they were killed," Dymov said reluctantly. "Two merchants,father and son, were travelling, selling holy images. They put upin the inn not far from here that is now kept by Ignat Fomin. Theold man had a drop too much, and began boasting that he had a lotof money with him. We all know merchants are a boastful set, Godpreserve us. . . . They can't resist showing off before the likesof us. And at the time some mowers were staying the night at theinn. So they overheard what the merchants said and took note ofit.""O Lord! . . . Holy Mother!" sighed Panteley."Next day, as soon as it was light," Dymov went on, "the merchantswere preparing to set off and the mowers tried to join them. 'Letus go together, your worships. It will be more cheerful and therewill be less danger, for this is an out-of-the-way place. . . .'The merchants had to travel at a walking pace to avoid breaking theimages, and that just suited the mowers. . . ."Dymov rose into a kneeling position and stretched."Yes," he went on, yawning. "Everything went all right till theyreached this spot, and then the mowers let fly at them with theirscythes. The son, he was a fine young fellow, snatched the scythefrom one of them, and he used it, too. . . . Well, of course, theygot the best of it because there were eight of them. They hackedat the merchants so that there was not a sound place left on theirbodies; when they had finished they dragged both of them off theroad, the father to one side and the son to the other. Oppositethat cross there is another cross on this side. . . . Whether itis still standing, I don't know. . . . I can't see from here. . . .""It is," said Kiruha."They say they did not find much money afterwards.""No," Panteley confirmed; "they only found a hundred roubles.""And three of them died afterwards, for the merchant had cut thembadly with the scythe, too. They died from loss of blood. One hadhis hand cut off, so that they say he ran three miles without hishand, and they found him on a mound close to Kurikovo. He wassquatting on his heels, with his head on his knees, as though hewere lost in thought, but when they looked at him there was no lifein him and he was dead. . . .""They found him by the track of blood," said Panteley.Everyone looked at the cross, and again there was a hush. Fromsomewhere, most likely from the creek, floated the mournful cry ofthe bird: "Sleep! sleep! sleep!""There are a great many wicked people in the world," said Emelyan."A great many," assented Panteley, and he moved up closer to thefire as though he were frightened. "A great many," he went on in alow voice. "I've seen lots and lots of them. . . . Wicked people!. . . I have seen a great many holy and just, too. . . . Queen ofHeaven, save us and have mercy on us. I remember once thirty yearsago, or maybe more, I was driving a merchant from Morshansk. Themerchant was a jolly handsome fellow, with money, too . . . themerchant was . . . a nice man, no harm in him. . . . So we put upfor the night at an inn. And in Russia the inns are not what theyare in these parts. There the yards are roofed in and look like theground floor, or let us say like barns in good farms. Only a barnwould be a bit higher. So we put up there and were all right. Mymerchant was in a room, while I was with the horses, and everythingwas as it should be. So, lads, I said my prayers before going tosleep and began walking about the yard. And it was a dark night, Icouldn't see anything; it was no good trying. So I walked about abit up to the waggons, or nearly, when I saw a light gleaming. Whatcould it mean? I thought the people of the inn had gone to bed longago, and besides the merchant and me there were no other guests inthe inn. . . . Where could the light have come from? I felt suspicious.. . . I went closer . . . towards the light. . . . The Lord havemercy upon me! and save me, Queen of Heaven! I looked and there wasa little window with a grating, . . . close to the ground, in thehouse. . . I lay down on the ground and looked in; as soon as Ilooked in a cold chill ran all down me. . . ."Kiruha, trying not to make a noise, thrust a handful of twigs intothe fire. After waiting for it to leave off crackling and hissing,the old man went on:"I looked in and there was a big cellar, black and dark. . . . Therewas a lighted lantern on a tub. In the middle of the cellar wereabout a dozen men in red shirts with their sleeves turned up,sharpening long knives. . . . Ugh! So we had fallen into a nest ofrobbers. . . . What's to be done? I ran to the merchant, waked himup quietly, and said: 'Don't be frightened, merchant,' said I, 'butwe are in a bad way. We have fallen into a nest of robbers,' I said.He turned pale and asked: 'What are we to do now, Panteley? I havea lot of money that belongs to orphans. As for my life,' he said,'that's in God's hands. I am not afraid to die, but it's dreadfulto lose the orphans' money,' said he. . . . What were we to do? Thegates were locked; there was no getting out. If there had been afence one could have climbed over it, but with the yard shut up!. . . 'Come, don't be frightened, merchant,' said I; 'but pray toGod. Maybe the Lord will not let the orphans suffer. Stay still.'said I, 'and make no sign, and meanwhile, maybe, I shall think ofsomething. . . .' Right! . . . I prayed to God and the Lord put thethought into my mind. . . . I clambered up on my chaise and softly,. . . softly so that no one should hear, began pulling out the strawin the thatch, made a hole and crept out, crept out. . . . Then Ijumped off the roof and ran along the road as fast as I could. Iran and ran till I was nearly dead. . . . I ran maybe four mileswithout taking breath, if not more. Thank God I saw a village. Iran up to a hut and began tapping at a window. 'Good Christianpeople,' I said, and told them all about it, 'do not let a Christiansoul perish. . . .' I waked them all up. . . . The peasants gatheredtogether and went with me, . . one with a cord, one with an oakstick,others with pitchforks. . . . We broke in the gates of the inn-yardand went straight to the cellar. . . . And the robbers had justfinished sharpening their knives and were going to kill the merchant.The peasants took them, every one of them, bound them and carriedthem to the police. The merchant gave them three hundred roublesin his joy, and gave me five gold pieces and put my name down. Theysaid that they found human bones in the cellar afterwards, heapsand heaps of them. . . . Bones! . . . So they robbed people andthen buried them, so that there should be no traces. . . . Well,afterwards they were punished at Morshansk."Panteley had finished his story, and he looked round at his listeners.They were gazing at him in silence. The water was boiling by nowand Styopka was skimming off the froth."Is the fat ready?" Kiruha asked him in a whisper."Wait a little. . . . Directly."Styopka, his eyes fixed on Panteley as though he were afraid thatthe latter might begin some story before he was back, ran to thewaggons; soon he came back with a little wooden bowl and beganpounding some lard in it."I went another journey with a merchant, too, . . ." Panteley wenton again, speaking as before in a low voice and with fixed unblinkingeyes. "His name, as I remember now, was Pyotr Grigoritch. He was anice man, . . . the merchant was. We stopped in the same way at aninn. . . . He indoors and me with the horses. . . . The people ofthe house, the innkeeper and his wife, seemed friendly good sortof people; the labourers, too, seemed all right; but yet, lads, Icouldn't sleep. I had a queer feeling in my heart, . . . a queerfeeling, that was just it. The gates were open and there were plentyof people about, and yet I felt afraid and not myself. Everyone hadbeen asleep long ago. It was the middle of the night; it would soonbe time to get up, and I was lying alone in my chaise and could notclose my eyes, as though I were some owl. And then, lads, I heardthis sound, 'Toop! toop! toop!' Someone was creeping up to thechaise. I poke my head out, and there was a peasant woman in nothingbut her shift and with her feet bare. . . . 'What do you want, goodwoman?' I asked. And she was all of a tremble; her face wasterror-stricken. . . 'Get up, good man,' said she; 'the people areplotting evil. . . . They mean to kill your merchant. With my ownears I heard the master whispering with his wife. . . .' So it wasnot for nothing, the foreboding of my heart! 'And who are you?' Iasked. 'I am their cook,' she said. . . . Right! . . . So I got outof the chaise and went to the merchant. I waked him up and said:'Things aren't quite right, Pyotr Grigoritch. . . . Make haste androuse yourself from sleep, your worship, and dress now while thereis still time,' I said; 'and to save our skins, let us get awayfrom trouble.' He had no sooner begun dressing when the door openedand, mercy on us! I saw, Holy Mother! the innkeeper and his wifecome into the room with three labourers. . . . So they had persuadedthe labourers to join them. 'The merchant has a lot of money, andwe'll go shares,' they told them. Every one of the five had a longknife in their hand each a knife. The innkeeper locked the door andsaid: 'Say your prayers, travellers, . . . and if you begin screaming,'they said, 'we won't let you say your prayers before you die. . . .'As though we could scream! I had such a lump in my throat I couldnot cry out. . . . The merchant wept and said: 'Good Christianpeople! you have resolved to kill me because my money tempts you.Well, so be it; I shall not be the first nor shall I be the last.Many of us merchants have been murdered at inns. But why, goodChristian brothers,' says he, 'murder my driver? Why should he haveto suffer for my money?' And he said that so pitifully! And theinnkeeper answered him: 'If we leave him alive,' said he, 'he willbe the first to bear witness against us. One may just as well killtwo as one. You can but answer once for seven misdeeds. . . Sayyour prayers, that's all you can do, and it is no good talking!'The merchant and I knelt down side by side and wept and said ourprayers. He thought of his children. I was young in those days; Iwanted to live. . . . We looked at the images and prayed, and sopitifully that it brings a tear even now. . . . And the innkeeper'swife looks at us and says: 'Good people,' said she, 'don't bear agrudge against us in the other world and pray to God for ourpunishment, for it is want that drives us to it.' We prayed andwept and prayed and wept, and God heard us. He had pity on us, Isuppose. . . . At the very minute when the innkeeper had taken themerchant by the beard to rip open his throat with his knife suddenlysomeone seemed to tap at the window from the yard! We all started,and the innkeeper's hands dropped. . . . Someone was tapping at thewindow and shouting: 'Pyotr Grigoritch,' he shouted, 'are you here?Get ready and let's go!' The people saw that someone had come forthe merchant; they were terrified and took to their heels. . . .And we made haste into the yard, harnessed the horses, and were outof sight in a minute. . .""Who was it knocked at the window?" asked Dymov."At the window? It must have been a holy saint or angel, for therewas no one else. . . . When we drove out of the yard there wasn'ta soul in the street. . . . It was the Lord's doing."Panteley told other stories, and in all of them "long knives" figuredand all alike sounded made up. Had he heard these stories fromsomeone else, or had he made them up himself in the remote past,and afterwards, as his memory grew weaker, mixed up his experienceswith his imaginations and become unable to distinguish one from theother? Anything is possible, but it is strange that on this occasionand for the rest of the journey, whenever he happened to tell astory, he gave unmistakable preference to fiction, and never toldof what he really had experienced. At the time Yegorushka took itall for the genuine thing, and believed every word; later on itseemed to him strange that a man who in his day had travelled allover Russia and seen and known so much, whose wife and children hadbeen burnt to death, so failed to appreciate the wealth of his lifethat whenever he was sitting by the camp fire he was either silentor talked of what had never been.Over their porridge they were all silent, thinking of what they hadjust heard. Life is terrible and marvellous, and so, however terriblea story you tell in Russia, however you embroider it with nests ofrobbers, long knives and such marvels, it always finds an echo ofreality in the soul of the listener, and only a man who has been agood deal affected by education looks askance distrustfully, andeven he will be silent. The cross by the roadside, the dark balesof wool, the wide expanse of the plain, and the lot of the mengathered together by the camp fire--all this was of itself somarvellous and terrible that the fantastic colours of legend andfairy-tale were pale and blended with life.All the others ate out of the cauldron, but Panteley sat apart andate his porridge out of a wooden bowl. His spoon was not like thosethe others had, but was made of cypress wood, with a little crosson it. Yegorushka, looking at him, thought of the little ikon glassand asked Styopka softly:"Why does Grandfather sit apart?""He is an Old Believer," Styopka and Vassya answered in a whisper.And as they said it they looked as though they were speaking ofsome secret vice or weakness.All sat silent, thinking. After the terrible stories there was noinclination to speak of ordinary things. All at once in the midstof the silence Vassya drew himself up and, fixing his lustrelesseyes on one point, pricked up his ears."What is it?" Dymov asked him."Someone is coming," answered Vassya."Where do you see him?""Yo-on-der! There's something white. . ."There was nothing to be seen but darkness in the direction in whichVassya was looking; everyone listened, but they could hear no soundof steps."Is he coming by the highroad?" asked Dymov."No, over the open country. . . . He is coming this way."A minute passed in silence."And maybe it's the merchant who was buried here walking over thesteppe," said Dymov.All looked askance at the cross, exchanged glances and suddenlybroke into a laugh. They felt ashamed of their terror."Why should he walk?" asked Panteley. "It's only those walk at nightwhom the earth will not take to herself. And the merchants were allright. . . . The merchants have received the crown of martyrs."But all at once they heard the sound of steps; someone was comingin haste."He's carrying something," said Vassya.They could hear the grass rustling and the dry twigs crackling underthe feet of the approaching wayfarer. But from the glare of thecamp fire nothing could be seen. At last the steps sounded closeby, and someone coughed. The flickering light seemed to part; aveil dropped from the waggoners' eyes, and they saw a man facingthem.Whether it was due to the flickering light or because everyonewanted to make out the man's face first of all, it happened, strangelyenough, that at the first glance at him they all saw, first of all,not his face nor his clothes, but his smile. It was an extraordinarilygood-natured, broad, soft smile, like that of a baby on waking, oneof those infectious smiles to which it is difficult not to respondby smiling too. The stranger, when they did get a good look at him,turned out to be a man of thirty, ugly and in no way remarkable.He was a tall Little Russian, with a long nose, long arms and longlegs; everything about him seemed long except his neck, which wasso short that it made him seem stooping. He was wearing a cleanwhite shirt with an embroidered collar, white trousers, and newhigh boots, and in comparison with the waggoners he looked quite adandy. In his arms he was carrying something big, white, and at thefirst glance strange-looking, and the stock of a gun also peepedout from behind his shoulder.Coming from the darkness into the circle of light, he stopped shortas though petrified, and for half a minute looked at the waggonersas though he would have said: "Just look what a smile I have!"Then he took a step towards the fire, smiled still more radiantlyand said:"Bread and salt, friends!""You are very welcome!" Panteley answered for them all.The stranger put down by the fire what he was carrying in his arms--it was a dead bustard--and greeted them once more.They all went up to the bustard and began examining it."A fine big bird; what did you kill it with?" asked Dymov."Grape-shot. You can't get him with small shot, he won't let youget near enough. Buy it, friends! I will let you have it for twentykopecks.""What use would it be to us? It's good roast, but I bet it wouldbe tough boiled; you could not get your teeth into it. . . .""Oh, what a pity! I would take it to the gentry at the farm; theywould give me half a rouble for it. But it's a long way to go--twelve miles!"The stranger sat down, took off his gun and laid it beside him.He seemed sleepy and languid; he sat smiling, and, screwing up hiseyes at the firelight, apparently thinking of something veryagreeable. They gave him a spoon; he began eating."Who are you?" Dymov asked him.The stranger did not hear the question; he made no answer, and didnot even glance at Dymov. Most likely this smiling man did not tastethe flavour of the porridge either, for he seemed to eat itmechanically, lifting the spoon to his lips sometimes very full andsometimes quite empty. He was not drunk, but he seemed to havesomething nonsensical in his head."I ask you who you are?" repeated Dymov."I?" said the unknown, starting. "Konstantin Zvonik from Rovno.It's three miles from here."And anxious to show straight off that he was not quite an ordinarypeasant, but something better, Konstantin hastened to add:"We keep bees and fatten pigs.""Do you live with your father or in a house of your own?""No; now I am living in a house of my own. I have parted. Thismonth, just after St. Peter's Day, I got married. I am a marriedman now! . . . It's eighteen days since the wedding.""That's a good thing," said Panteley. "Marriage is a good thing. . . . God's blessing is on it.""His young wife sits at home while he rambles about the steppe,"laughed Kiruha. "Queer chap!"As though he had been pinched on the tenderest spot, Konstantinstarted, laughed and flushed crimson."But, Lord, she is not at home!" he said quickly, taking the spoonout of his mouth and looking round at everyone with an expressionof delight and wonder. "She is not; she has gone to her mother'sfor three days! Yes, indeed, she has gone away, and I feel as thoughI were not married. . . ."Konstantin waved his hand and turned his head; he wanted to go onthinking, but the joy which beamed in his face prevented him. Asthough he were not comfortable, he changed his attitude, laughed,and again waved his hand. He was ashamed to share his happy thoughtswith strangers, but at the same time he had an irresistible longingto communicate his joy."She has gone to Demidovo to see her mother," he said, blushing andmoving his gun. "She'll be back to-morrow. . . . She said she wouldbe back to dinner.""And do you miss her?" said Dymov."Oh, Lord, yes; I should think so. We have only been married sucha little while, and she has gone away. . . . Eh! Oh, but she is atricky one, God strike me dead! She is such a fine, splendid girl,such a one for laughing and singing, full of life and fire! Whenshe is there your brain is in a whirl, and now she is away I wanderabout the steppe like a fool, as though I had lost something. Ihave been walking since dinner."Konstantin rubbed his eyes, looked at the fire and laughed."You love her, then, . . ." said Panteley."She is so fine and splendid," Konstantin repeated, not hearinghim; "such a housewife, clever and sensible. You wouldn't findanother like her among simple folk in the whole province. She hasgone away. . . . But she is missing me, I kno-ow! I know the littlemagpie. She said she would be back to-morrow by dinner-time. . . .And just think how queer!" Konstantin almost shouted, speaking anote higher and shifting his position. "Now she loves me and is sadwithout me, and yet she would not marry me.""But eat," said Kiruha."She would not marry me," Konstantin went on, not heeding him. "Ihave been struggling with her for three years! I saw her at theKalatchik fair; I fell madly in love with her, was ready to hangmyself. . . . I live at Rovno, she at Demidovo, more than twentymiles apart, and there was nothing I could do. I sent match-makersto her, and all she said was: 'I won't!' Ah, the magpie! I sent herone thing and another, earrings and cakes, and twenty pounds ofhoney--but still she said: 'I won't!' And there it was. If youcome to think of it, I was not a match for her! She was young andlovely, full of fire, while I am old: I shall soon be thirty, anda regular beauty, too; a fine beard like a goat's, a clear complexionall covered with pimples--how could I be compared with her! Theonly thing to be said is that we are well off, but then the Vahramenkysare well off, too. They've six oxen, and they keep a couple oflabourers. I was in love, friends, as though I were plague-stricken.I couldn't sleep or eat; my brain was full of thoughts, and in sucha maze, Lord preserve us! I longed to see her, and she was inDemidovo. What do you think? God be my witness, I am not lying,three times a week I walked over there on foot just to have a lookat her. I gave up my work! I was so frantic that I even wanted toget taken on as a labourer in Demidovo, so as to be near her. I wasin misery! My mother called in a witch a dozen times; my fathertried thrashing me. For three years I was in this torment, and thenI made up my mind. 'Damn my soul!' I said. 'I will go to the townand be a cabman. . . . It seems it is fated not to be.' At EasterI went to Demidovo to have a last look at her. . . ."Konstantin threw back his head and went off into a mirthful tinklinglaugh, as though he had just taken someone in very cleverly."I saw her by the river with the lads," he went on. "I was overcomewith anger. . . . I called her aside and maybe for a full hour Isaid all manner of things to her. She fell in love with me! Forthree years she did not like me! she fell in love with me for whatI said to her. . . .""What did you say to her?" asked Dymov."What did I say? I don't remember. . . How could one remember? Mywords flowed at the time like water from a tap, without stoppingto take breath. Ta-ta-ta! And now I can't utter a word. . . . Well,so she married me. . . . She's gone now to her mother's, the magpie,and while she is away here I wander over the steppe. I can't stayat home. It's more than I can do!"Konstantin awkwardly released his feet, on which he was sitting,stretched himself on the earth, and propped his head in his fists,then got up and sat down again. Everyone by now thoroughly understoodthat he was in love and happy, poignantly happy; his smile, hiseyes, and every movement, expressed fervent happiness. He could notfind a place for himself, and did not know what attitude to taketo keep himself from being overwhelmed by the multitude of hisdelightful thoughts. Having poured out his soul before thesestrangers, he settled down quietly at last, and, looking at thefire, sank into thought.At the sight of this happy man everyone felt depressed and longedto be happy, too. Everyone was dreamy. Dymov got up, walked aboutsoftly by the fire, and from his walk, from the movement of hisshoulder-blades, it could be seen that he was weighed down bydepression and yearning. He stood still for a moment, looked atKonstantin and sat down.The camp fire had died down by now; there was no flicker, and thepatch of red had grown small and dim. . . . And as the fire wentout the moonlight grew clearer and clearer. Now they could see thefull width of the road, the bales of wool, the shafts of the waggons,the munching horses; on the further side of the road there was thedim outline of the second cross. . . .Dymov leaned his cheek on his hand and softly hummed some plaintivesong. Konstantin smiled drowsily and chimed in with a thin voice.They sang for half a minute, then sank into silence. Emelyan started,jerked his elbows and wriggled his fingers."Lads," he said in an imploring voice, "let's sing something sacred!"Tears came into his eyes. "Lads," he repeated, pressing his handson his heart, "let's sing something sacred!""I don't know anything," said Konstantin.Everyone refused, then Emelyan sang alone. He waved both arms,nodded his head, opened his mouth, but nothing came from his throatbut a discordant gasp. He sang with his arms, with his head, withhis eyes, even with the swelling on his face; he sang passionatelywith anguish, and the more he strained his chest to extract at leastone note from it, the more discordant were his gasps.Yegorushka, like the rest, was overcome with depression. He wentto his waggon, clambered up on the bales and lay down. He lookedat the sky, and thought of happy Konstantin and his wife. Why didpeople get married? What were women in the world for? Yegorushkaput the vague questions to himself, and thought that a man wouldcertainly be happy if he had an affectionate, merry and beautifulwoman continually living at his side. For some reason he rememberedthe Countess Dranitsky, and thought it would probably be verypleasant to live with a woman like that; he would perhaps havemarried her with pleasure if that idea had not been so shameful.He recalled her eyebrows, the pupils of her eyes, her carriage, theclock with the horseman. . . . The soft warm night moved softlydown upon him and whispered something in his ear, and it seemed tohim that it was that lovely woman bending over him, looking at himwith a smile and meaning to kiss him. . . .Nothing was left of the fire but two little red eyes, which kepton growing smaller and smaller. Konstantin and the waggoners weresitting by it, dark motionless figures, and it seemed as thoughthere were many more of them than before. The twin crosses wereequally visible, and far, far away, somewhere by the highroad theregleamed a red light--other people cooking their porridge, mostlikely."Our Mother Russia is the he-ad of all the world!" Kiruha sang outsuddenly in a harsh voice, choked and subsided. The steppe echocaught up his voice, carried it on, and it seemed as though stupidityitself were rolling on heavy wheels over the steppe."It's time to go," said Panteley. "Get up, lads."While they were putting the horses in, Konstantin walked by thewaggons and talked rapturously of his wife."Good-bye, mates!" he cried when the waggons started. "Thank youfor your hospitality. I shall go on again towards that light. It'smore than I can stand."And he quickly vanished in the mist, and for a long time they couldhear him striding in the direction of the light to tell those otherstrangers of his happiness.When Yegorushka woke up next day it was early morning; the sun hadnot yet risen. The waggons were at a standstill. A man in a whitecap and a suit of cheap grey material, mounted on a little Cossackstallion, was talking to Dymov and Kiruha beside the foremost waggon.A mile and a half ahead there were long low white barns and littlehouses with tiled roofs; there were neither yards nor trees to beseen beside the little houses."What village is that, Grandfather?" asked Yegorushka."That's the Armenian Settlement, youngster," answered Panteley."The Armenians live there. They are a good sort of people, . . .the Arnienians are."The man in grey had finished talking to Dymov and Kiruha; he pulledup his little stallion and looked across towards the settlement."What a business, only think!" sighed Panteley, looking towards thesettlement, too, and shuddering at the morning freshness. "He hassent a man to the settlement for some papers, and he doesn't come. . . . He should have sent Styopka.""Who is that, Grandfather?" asked Yegorushka."Varlamov."My goodness! Yegorushka jumped up quickly, getting upon his knees,and looked at the white cap. It was hard to recognize the mysteriouselusive Varlamov, who was sought by everyone, who was always "onhis rounds," and who had far more money than Countess Dranitsky,in the short, grey little man in big boots, who was sitting on anugly little nag and talking to peasants at an hour when all decentpeople were asleep."He is all right, a good man," said Panteley, looking towards thesettlement. "God give him health--a splendid gentleman, SemyonAlexandritch. . . . It's people like that the earth rests upon.That's true. . . . The cocks are not crowing yet, and he is alreadyup and about. . . . Another man would be asleep, or gallivantingwith visitors at home, but he is on the steppe all day, . . . onhis rounds. . . . He does not let things slip. . . . No-o! He's afine fellow. . ."Varlamov was talking about something, while he kept his eyes fixed.The little stallion shifted from one leg to another impatiently."Semyon Alexandritch!" cried Panteley, taking off his hat. "Allowus to send Styopka! Emelyan, call out that Styopka should be sent."But now at last a man on horseback could be seen coming from thesettlement. Bending very much to one side and brandishing his whipabove his head like a gallant young Caucasian, and wanting toastonish everyone by his horsemanship, he flew towards the waggonswith the swiftness of a bird."That must be one of his circuit men," said Panteley. "He must havea hundred such horsemen or maybe more."Reaching the first waggon, he pulled up his horse, and taking offhis hat, handed Varlamov a little book. Varlamov took several papersout of the book, read them and cried:"And where is Ivantchuk's letter?"The horseman took the book back, looked at the papers and shruggedhis shoulders. He began saying something, probably justifying himselfand asking to be allowed to ride back to the settlement again. Thelittle stallion suddenly stirred as though Varlamov had grownheavier. Varlamov stirred too."Go along!" he cried angrily, and he waved his whip at the man.Then he turned his horse round and, looking through the papers inthe book, moved at a walking pace alongside the waggons. When hereached the hindmost, Yegorushka strained his eyes to get a betterlook at him. Varlamov was an elderly man. His face, a simple Russiansunburnt face with a small grey beard, was red, wet with dew andcovered with little blue veins; it had the same expression ofbusinesslike coldness as Ivan Ivanitch's face, the same look offanatical zeal for business. But yet what a difference could befelt between him and Kuzmitchov! Uncle Ivan Ivanitch always had onhis face, together with his business-like reserve, a look of anxietyand apprehension that he would not find Varlamov, that he would belate, that he would miss a good price; nothing of that sort, socharacteristic of small and dependent persons, could be seen in theface or figure of Varlamov. This man made the price himself, wasnot looking for anyone, and did not depend on anyone; howeverordinary his exterior, yet in everything, even in the manner ofholding his whip, there was a sense of power and habitual authorityover the steppe.As he rode by Yegorushka he did not glance at him. Only the littlestallion deigned to notice Yegorushka; he looked at him with hislarge foolish eyes, and even he showed no interest. Panteley bowedto Varlamov; the latter noticed it, and without taking his eyes offthe sheets of paper, said lisping:"How are you, old man?"Varlamov's conversation with the horseman and the way he hadbrandished his whip had evidently made an overwhelming impressionon the whole party. Everyone looked grave. The man on horseback,cast down at the anger of the great man, remained stationary, withhis hat off, and the rein loose by the foremost waggon; he wassilent, and seemed unable to grasp that the day had begun so badlyfor him."He is a harsh old man, . ." muttered Panteley. "It's a pity he isso harsh! But he is all right, a good man. . . . He doesn't abusemen for nothing. . . . It's no matter. . . ."After examining the papers, Varlamov thrust the book into his pocket;the little stallion, as though he knew what was in his mind, withoutwaiting for orders, started and dashed along the highroad.VIIOn the following night the waggoners had halted and were cookingtheir porridge. On this occasion there was a sense of overwhelmingoppression over everyone. It was sultry; they all drank a greatdeal, but could not quench their thirst. The moon was intenselycrimson and sullen, as though it were sick. The stars, too, weresullen, the mist was thicker, the distance more clouded. Natureseemed as though languid and weighed down by some foreboding.There was not the same liveliness and talk round the camp fire asthere had been the day before. All were dreary and spoke listlesslyand without interest. Panteley did nothing but sigh and complainof his feet, and continually alluded to impenitent deathbeds.Dymov was lying on his stomach, chewing a straw in silence; therewas an expression of disgust on his face as though the straw smeltunpleasant, a spiteful and exhausted look. . . . Vassya complainedthat his jaw ached, and prophesied bad weather; Emelyan was notwaving his arms, but sitting still and looking gloomily at the fire.Yegorushka, too, was weary. This slow travelling exhausted him, andthe sultriness of the day had given him a headache.While they were cooking the porridge, Dymov, to relieve his boredom,began quarrelling with his companions."Here he lolls, the lumpy face, and is the first to put his spoonin," he said, looking spitefully at Emelyan. "Greedy! always contrivesto sit next the cauldron. He's been a church-singer, so he thinkshe is a gentleman! There are a lot of singers like you begging alongthe highroad!""What are you pestering me for?" asked Emelyan, looking at himangrily."To teach you not to be the first to dip into the cauldron. Don'tthink too much of yourself!""You are a fool, and that is all about it!" wheezed out Emelyan.Knowing by experience how such conversations usually ended, Panteleyand Vassya intervened and tried to persuade Dymov not to quarrelabout nothing."A church-singer!" The bully would not desist, but laughedcontemptuously. "Anyone can sing like that--sit in the churchporch and sing 'Give me alms, for Christ's sake!' Ugh! you are anice fellow!"Emelyan did not speak. His silence had an irritating effect onDymov. He looked with still greater hatred at the ex-singer andsaid:"I don't care to have anything to do with you, or I would show youwhat to think of yourself.""But why are you pushing me, you Mazeppa?" Emelyan cried, flaringup. "Am I interfering with you?""What did you call me?" asked Dymov, drawing himself up, and hiseyes were suffused with blood. "Eh! I am a Mazeppa? Yes? Take that,then; go and look for it."Dymov snatched the spoon out of Emelyan's hand and flung it faraway. Kiruha, Vassya, and Styopka ran to look for it, while Emelyanfixed an imploring and questioning look on Panteley. His facesuddenly became small and wrinkled; it began twitching, and theex-singer began to cry like a child.Yegorushka, who had long hated Dymov, felt as though the air allat once were unbearably stifling, as though the fire were scorchinghis face; he longed to run quickly to the waggons in the darkness,but the bully's angry bored eyes drew the boy to him. With apassionate desire to say something extremely offensive, he took astep towards Dymov and brought out, gasping for breath:"You are the worst of the lot; I can't bear you!"After this he ought to have run to the waggons, but he could notstir from the spot and went on:"In the next world you will burn in hell! I'll complain to IvanIvanitch. Don't you dare insult Emelyan!""Say this too, please," laughed Dyrnov: "'every little sucking-pigwants to lay down the law.' Shall I pull your ear?"Yegorushka felt that he could not breathe; and something which hadnever happened to him before--he suddenly began shaking all over,stamping his feet and crying shrilly:"Beat him, beat him!"Tears gushed from his eyes; he felt ashamed, and ran staggeringback to the waggon. The effect produced by his outburst he did notsee. Lying on the bales and twitching his arms and legs, he whispered:"Mother, mother!"And these men and the shadows round the camp fire, and the darkbales and the far-away lightning, which was flashing every minutein the distance--all struck him now as terrible and unfriendly.He was overcome with terror and asked himself in despair why andhow he had come into this unknown land in the company of terriblepeasants? Where was his uncle now, where was Father Christopher,where was Deniska? Why were they so long in coming? Hadn't theyforgotten him? At the thought that he was forgotten and cast outto the mercy of fate, he felt such a cold chill of dread that hehad several times an impulse to jump off the bales of wool, and runback full speed along the road; but the thought of the huge darkcrosses, which would certainly meet him on the way, and the lightningflashing in the distance, stopped him. . . . And only when hewhispered, "Mother, mother!" he felt as it were a little better.The waggoners must have been full of dread, too. After Yegorushkahad run away from the camp fire they sat at first for a long timein silence, then they began speaking in hollow undertones aboutsomething, saying that it was coming and that they must make hasteand get away from it. . . . They quickly finished supper, put outthe fire and began harnessing the horses in silence. From theirfluster and the broken phrases they uttered it was apparent theyforesaw some trouble. Before they set off on their way, Dymov wentup to Panteley and asked softly:"What's his name?""Yegory," answered Panteley.Dymov put one foot on the wheel, caught hold of the cord which wastied round the bales and pulled himself up. Yegorushka saw his faceand curly head. The face was pale and looked grave and exhausted,but there was no expression of spite in it."Yera!" he said softly, "here, hit me!"Yegorushka looked at him in surprise. At that instant there was aflash of lightning."It's all right, hit me," repeated Dymov. And without waiting forYegorushka to hit him or to speak to him, he jumped down and said:"How dreary I am!"Then, swaying from one leg to the other and moving his shoulder-blades,he sauntered lazily alongside the string of waggons and repeatedin a voice half weeping, half angry:"How dreary I am! O Lord! Don't you take offence, Emelyan," he saidas he passed Emelyan. "Ours is a wretched cruel life!"There was a flash of lightning on the right, and, like a reflectionin the looking-glass, at once a second flash in the distance."Yegory, take this," cried Panteley, throwing up something big anddark."What is it?" asked Yegorushka."A mat. There will be rain, so cover yourself up."Yegorushka sat up and looked about him. The distance had grownperceptibly blacker, and now oftener than every minute winked witha pale light. The blackness was being bent towards the right asthough by its own weight."Will there be a storm, Grandfather?" asked Yegorushka."Ah, my poor feet, how they ache!" Panteley said in a high-pitchedvoice, stamping his feet and not hearing the boy.On the left someone seemed to strike a match in the sky; a palephosphorescent streak gleamed and went out. There was a sound asthough someone very far away were walking over an iron roof, probablybarefoot, for the iron gave a hollow rumble."It's set in!" cried Kiruha.Between the distance and the horizon on the right there was a flashof lightning so vivid that it lighted up part of the steppe and thespot where the clear sky met the blackness. A terrible cloud wasswooping down, without haste, a compact mass; big black shreds hungfrom its edge; similar shreds pressing one upon another were pilingup on the right and left horizon. The tattered, ragged look of thestorm-cloud gave it a drunken disorderly air. There was a distinct,not smothered, growl of thunder. Yegorushka crossed himself andbegan quickly putting on his great-coat."I am dreary!" Dymov's shout floated from the foremost waggon, andit could be told from his voice that he was beginning to beill-humoured again. "I am so dreary!"All at once there was a squall of wind, so violent that it almostsnatched away Yegorushka's bundle and mat; the mat fluttered in alldirections and flapped on the bale and on Yegorushka's face. Thewind dashed whistling over the steppe, whirled round in disorderand raised such an uproar from the grass that neither the thundernor the creaking of the wheels could be heard; it blew from theblack storm-cloud, carrying with it clouds of dust and the scentof rain and wet earth. The moonlight grew mistier, as it weredirtier; the stars were even more overcast; and clouds of dust couldbe seen hurrying along the edge of the road, followed by theirshadows. By now, most likely, the whirlwind eddying round and liftingfrom the earth dust, dry grass and feathers, was mounting to thevery sky; uprooted plants must have been flying by that very blackstorm-cloud, and how frightened they must have been! But throughthe dust that clogged the eyes nothing could be seen but the flashof lightning.Yegorushka, thinking it would pour with rain in a minute, knelt upand covered himself with the mat."Panteley-ey!" someone shouted in the front. "A. . . a. . . va!""I can't!" Panteley answered in a loud high voice. "A . . . a. . . va! Arya . . . a!"There was an angry clap of thunder, which rolled across the skyfrom right to left, then back again, and died away near the foremostwaggon."Holy, holy, holy, Lord of Sabaoth," whispered Yegorushka, crossinghimself. "Fill heaven and earth with Thy glory."The blackness in the sky yawned wide and breathed white fire. Atonce there was another clap of thunder. It had scarcely ceased whenthere was a flash of lightning so broad that Yegorushka suddenlysaw through a slit in the mat the whole highroad to the very horizon,all the waggoners and even Kiruha's waistcoat. The black shreds hadby now moved upwards from the left, and one of them, a coarse,clumsy monster like a claw with fingers, stretched to the moon.Yegorushka made up his mind to shut his eyes tight, to pay noattention to it, and to wait till it was all over.The rain was for some reason long in coming. Yegorushka peeped outfrom the mat in the hope that perhaps the storm-cloud was passingover. It was fearfully dark. Yegorushka could see neither Panteley,nor the bale of wool, nor himself; he looked sideways towards theplace where the moon had lately been, but there was the same blackdarkness there as over the waggons. And in the darkness the flashesof lightning seemed more violent and blinding, so that they hurthis eyes."Panteley!" called Yegorushka.No answer followed. But now a gust of wind for the last time flungup the mat and hurried away. A quiet regular sound was heard. A bigcold drop fell on Yegorushka's knee, another trickled over his hand.He noticed that his knees were not covered, and tried to rearrangethe mat, but at that moment something began pattering on the road,then on the shafts and the bales. It was the rain. As though theyunderstood one another, the rain and the mat began prattling ofsomething rapidly, gaily and most annoyingly like two magpies.Yegorushka knelt up or rather squatted on his boots. While the rainwas pattering on the mat, he leaned forward to screen his knees,which were suddenly wet. He succeeded in covering his knees, butin less than a minute was aware of a penetrating, unpleasant dampnessbehind on his back and the calves of his legs. He returned to hisformer position, exposing his knees to the rain, and wondered whatto do to rearrange the mat which he could not see in the darkness.But his arms were already wet, the water was trickling up his sleevesand down his collar, and his shoulder-blades felt chilly. And hemade up his mind to do nothing but sit motionless and wait till itwas all over."Holy, holy, holy!" he whispered.Suddenly, exactly over his head, the sky cracked with a fearfuldeafening din; he huddled up and held his breath, waiting for thefragments to fall upon his head and back. He inadvertently openedhis eyes and saw a blinding intense light flare out and flash fivetimes on his fingers, his wet sleeves, and on the trickles of waterrunning from the mat upon the bales and down to the ground. Therewas a fresh peal of thunder as violent and awful; the sky was notgrowling and rumbling now, but uttering short crashing sounds likethe crackling of dry wood."Trrah! tah! tah! tah!" the thunder rang out distinctly, rolledover the sky, seemed to stumble, and somewhere by the foremostwaggons or far behind to fall with an abrupt angry "Trrra!"The flashes of lightning had at first been only terrible, but withsuch thunder they seemed sinister and menacing. Their magic lightpierced through closed eyelids and sent a chill all over the body.What could he do not to see them? Yegorushka made up his mind toturn over on his face. Cautiously, as though afraid of being watched,he got on all fours, and his hands slipping on the wet bale, heturned back again."Trrah! tah! tah!" floated over his head, rolled under the waggonsand exploded "Kraa!"Again he inadvertently opened his eyes and saw a new danger: threehuge giants with long pikes were following the waggon! A flash oflightning gleamed on the points of their pikes and lighted up theirfigures very distinctly. They were men of huge proportions, withcovered faces, bowed heads, and heavy footsteps. They seemed gloomyand dispirited and lost in thought. Perhaps they were not followingthe waggons with any harmful intent, and yet there was somethingawful in their proximity.Yegorushka turned quickly forward, and trembling all over cried:"Panteley! Grandfather!""Trrah! tah! tah!" the sky answered him.He opened his eyes to see if the waggoners were there. There wereflashes of lightning in two places, which lighted up the road tothe far distance, the whole string of waggons and all the waggoners.Streams of water were flowing along the road and bubbles weredancing. Panteley was walking beside the waggon; his tall hat andhis shoulder were covered with a small mat; his figure expressedneither terror nor uneasiness, as though he were deafened by thethunder and blinded by the lightning."Grandfather, the giants!" Yegorushka shouted to him in tears.But the old man did not hear. Further away walked Emelyan. He wascovered from head to foot with a big mat and was triangular inshape. Vassya, without anything over him, was walking with the samewooden step as usual, lifting his feet high and not bending hisknees. In the flash of lightning it seemed as though the waggonswere not moving and the men were motionless, that Vassya's liftedfoot was rigid in the same position. . . .Yegorushka called the old man once more. Getting no answer, he satmotionless, and no longer waited for it all to end. He was convincedthat the thunder would kill him in another minute, that he wouldaccidentally open his eyes and see the terrible giants, and he leftoff crossing himself, calling the old man and thinking of his mother,and was simply numb with cold and the conviction that the stormwould never end.But at last there was the sound of voices."Yegory, are you asleep?" Panteley cried below. "Get down! Is hedeaf, the silly little thing? . . .""Something like a storm!" said an unfamiliar bass voice, and thestranger cleared his throat as though he had just tossed off a goodglass of vodka.Yegorushka opened his eyes. Close to the waggon stood Panteley,Emelyan, looking like a triangle, and the giants. The latter wereby now much shorter, and when Yegorushka looked more closely atthem they turned out to be ordinary peasants, carrying on theirshoulders not pikes but pitchforks. In the space between Panteleyand the triangular figure, gleamed the window of a low-pitched hut.So the waggons were halting in the village. Yegorushka flung offthe mat, took his bundle and made haste to get off the waggon. Nowwhen close to him there were people talking and a lighted windowhe no longer felt afraid, though the thunder was crashing as beforeand the whole sky was streaked with lightning."It was a good storm, all right, . . ." Panteley was muttering."Thank God, . . . my feet are a little softened by the rain. It wasall right. . . . Have you got down, Yegory? Well, go into the hut;it is all right. . . .""Holy, holy, holy!" wheezed Emelyan, "it must have struck something. . . . Are you of these parts?" he asked the giants."No, from Glinovo. We belong to Glinovo. We are working at thePlaters'.""Threshing?""All sorts. Just now we are getting in the wheat. The lightning,the lightning! It is long since we have had such a storm. . . ."Yegorushka went into the hut. He was met by a lean hunchbacked oldwoman with a sharp chin. She stood holding a tallow candle in herhands, screwing up her eyes and heaving prolonged sighs."What a storm God has sent us!" she said. "And our lads are out forthe night on the steppe; they'll have a bad time, poor dears! Takeoff your things, little sir, take off your things."Shivering with cold and shrugging squeamishly, Yegorushka pulledoff his drenched overcoat, then stretched out his arms and straddledhis legs, and stood a long time without moving. The slightestmovement caused an unpleasant sensation of cold and wetness. Hissleeves and the back of his shirt were sopped, his trousers stuckto his legs, his head was dripping."What's the use of standing there, with your legs apart, littlelad?" said the old woman. "Come, sit down."Holding his legs wide apart, Yegorushka went up to the table andsat down on a bench near somebody's head. The head moved, puffed astream of air through its nose, made a chewing sound and subsided.A mound covered with a sheepskin stretched from the head along thebench; it was a peasant woman asleep.The old woman went out sighing, and came back with a big water melonand a little sweet melon."Have something to eat, my dear! I have nothing else to offer you,. . ." she said, yawning. She rummaged in the table and took out along sharp knife, very much like the one with which the brigandskilled the merchants in the inn. "Have some, my dear!"Yegorushka, shivering as though he were in a fever, ate a slice ofsweet melon with black bread and then a slice of water melon, andthat made him feel colder still."Our lads are out on the steppe for the night, . . ." sighed theold woman while he was eating. "The terror of the Lord! I'd lightthe candle under the ikon, but I don't know where Stepanida has putit. Have some more, little sir, have some more. . . ."The old woman gave a yawn and, putting her right hand behind her,scratched her left shoulder."It must be two o'clock now," she said; "it will soon be time toget up. Our lads are out on the steppe for the night; they are allwet through for sure. . . .""Granny," said Yegorushka. "I am sleepy.""Lie down, my dear, lie down," the old woman sighed, yawning. "LordJesus Christ! I was asleep, when I heard a noise as though someonewere knocking. I woke up and looked, and it was the storm God hadsent us. . . . I'd have lighted the candle, but I couldn't findit."Talking to herself, she pulled some rags, probably her own bed, offthe bench, took two sheepskins off a nail by the stove, and beganlaying them out for a bed for Yegorushka. "The storm doesn't growless," she muttered. "If only nothing's struck in an unlucky hour.Our lads are out on the steppe for the night. Lie down and sleep,my dear. . . . Christ be with you, my child. . . . I won't takeaway the melon; maybe you'll have a bit when you get up."The sighs and yawns of the old woman, the even breathing of thesleeping woman, the half-darkness of the hut, and the sound of therain outside, made one sleepy. Yegorushka was shy of undressingbefore the old woman. He only took off his boots, lay down andcovered himself with the sheepskin."Is the little lad lying down?" he heard Panteley whisper a littlelater."Yes," answered the old woman in a whisper. "The terror of the Lord!It thunders and thunders, and there is no end to it.""It will soon be over," wheezed Panteley, sitting down; "it's gettingquieter. . . . The lads have gone into the huts, and two have stayedwith the horses. The lads have. . . . They can't; . . . the horseswould be taken away. . . . I'll sit here a bit and then go and takemy turn. . . . We can't leave them; they would be taken. . . ."Panteley and the old woman sat side by side at Yegorushka's feet,talking in hissing whispers and interspersing their speech withsighs and yawns. And Yegorushka could not get warm. The warm heavysheepskin lay on him, but he was trembling all over; his arms andlegs were twitching, and his whole inside was shivering. . . . Heundressed under the sheepskin, but that was no good. His shiveringgrew more and more acute.Panteley went out to take his turn with the horses, and afterwardscame back again, and still Yegorushka was shivering all over andcould not get to sleep. Something weighed upon his head and chestand oppressed him, and he did not know what it was, whether it wasthe old people whispering, or the heavy smell of the sheepskin. Themelon he had eaten had left an unpleasant metallic taste in hismouth. Moreover he was being bitten by fleas."Grandfather, I am cold," he said, and did not know his own voice."Go to sleep, my child, go to sleep," sighed the old woman.Tit came up to the bedside on his thin little legs and waved hisarms, then grew up to the ceiling and turned into a windmill. . . .Father Christopher, not as he was in the chaise, but in his fullvestments with the sprinkler in his hand, walked round the mill,sprinkling it with holy water, and it left off waving. Yegorushka,knowing this was delirium, opened his eyes."Grandfather," he called, "give me some water."No one answered. Yegorushka felt it insufferably stifling anduncomfortable lying down. He got up, dressed, and went out of thehut. Morning was beginning. The sky was overcast, but it was nolonger raining. Shivering and wrapping himself in his wet overcoat,Yegorushka walked about the muddy yard and listened to the silence;he caught sight of a little shed with a half-open door made ofreeds. He looked into this shed, went into it, and sat down in adark corner on a heap of dry dung.There was a tangle of thoughts in his heavy head; his mouth was dryand unpleasant from the metallic taste. He looked at his hat,straightened the peacock's feather on it, and thought how he hadgone with his mother to buy the hat. He put his hand into his pocketand took out a lump of brownish sticky paste. How had that pastecome into his pocket? He thought a minute, smelt it; it smelt ofhoney. Aha! it was the Jewish cake! How sopped it was, poor thing!Yegorushka examined his coat. It was a little grey overcoat withbig bone buttons, cut in the shape of a frock-coat. At home, beinga new and expensive article, it had not been hung in the hall, butwith his mother's dresses in her bedroom; he was only allowed towear it on holidays. Looking at it, Yegorushka felt sorry for it.He thought that he and the great-coat were both abandoned to themercy of destiny; he thought that he would never get back home, andbegan sobbing so violently that he almost fell off the heap of dung.A big white dog with woolly tufts like curl-papers about its face,sopping from the rain, came into the shed and stared with curiosityat Yegorushka. It seemed to be hesitating whether to bark or not.Deciding that there was no need to bark, it went cautiously up toYegorushka, ate the sticky plaster and went out again."There are Varlamov's men!" someone shouted in the street.After having his cry out, Yegorushka went out of the shed and,walking round a big puddle, made his way towards the street. Thewaggons were standing exactly opposite the gateway. The drenchedwaggoners, with their muddy feet, were sauntering beside them orsitting on the shafts, as listless and drowsy as flies in autumn.Yegorushka looked at them and thought: "How dreary and comfortlessto be a peasant!" He went up to Panteley and sat down beside himon the shaft."Grandfather, I'm cold," he said, shivering and thrusting his handsup his sleeves."Never mind, we shall soon be there," yawned Panteley. "Never mind,you will get warm."It must have been early when the waggons set off, for it was nothot. Yegorushka lay on the bales of wool and shivered with cold,though the sun soon came out and dried his clothes, the bales, andthe earth. As soon as he closed his eyes he saw Tit and the windmillagain. Feeling a sickness and heaviness all over, he did his utmostto drive away these images, but as soon as they vanished thedare-devil Dymov, with red eyes and lifted fists, rushed at Yegorushkawith a roar, or there was the sound of his complaint: "I am sodreary!" Varlamov rode by on his little Cossack stallion; happyKonstantin passed, with a smile and the bustard in his arms. Andhow tedious these people were, how sickening and unbearable!Once--it was towards evening--he raised his head to ask forwater. The waggons were standing on a big bridge across a broadriver. There was black smoke below over the river, and through itcould be seen a steamer with a barge in tow. Ahead of them, beyondthe river, was a huge mountain dotted with houses and churches; atthe foot of the mountain an engine was being shunted along besidesome goods trucks.Yegorushka had never before seen steamers, nor engines, nor broadrivers. Glancing at them now, he was not alarmed or surprised; therewas not even a look of anything like curiosity in his face. Hemerely felt sick, and made haste to turn over to the edge of thebale. He was sick. Panteley, seeing this, cleared his throat andshook his head."Our little lad's taken ill," he said. "He must have got a chillto the stomach. The little lad must. . . away from home; it's a badlookout!"VIIIThe waggons stopped at a big inn for merchants, not far from thequay. As Yegorushka climbed down from the waggon he heard a veryfamiliar voice. Someone was helping him to get down, and saying:"We arrived yesterday evening. . . . We have been expecting you allday. We meant to overtake you yesterday, but it was out of our way;we came by the other road. I say, how you have crumpled your coat!You'll catch it from your uncle!"Yegorushka looked into the speaker's mottled face and rememberedthat this was Deniska."Your uncle and Father Christopher are in the inn now, drinkingtea; come along!"And he led Yegorushka to a big two-storied building, dark and gloomylike the almshouse at N. After going across the entry, up a darkstaircase and through a narrow corridor, Yegorushka and Deniskareached a little room in which Ivan Ivanitch and Father Christopherwere sitting at the tea-table. Seeing the boy, both the old menshowed surprise and pleasure."Aha! Yegor Ni-ko-la-aitch!" chanted Father Christopher. "Mr.Lomonosov!""Ah, our gentleman that is to be," said Kuzmitchov, "pleased to seeyou!"Yegorushka took off his great-coat, kissed his uncle's hand andFather Christopher's, and sat down to the table."Well, how did you like the journey, puer bone?" Father Christopherpelted him with questions as he poured him out some tea, with hisradiant smile. "Sick of it, I've no doubt? God save us all fromhaving to travel by waggon or with oxen. You go on and on, Godforgive us; you look ahead and the steppe is always lying stretchedout the same as it was--you can't see the end of it! It's nottravelling but regular torture. Why don't you drink your tea? Drinkit up; and in your absence, while you have been trailing along withthe waggons, we have settled all our business capitally. Thank Godwe have sold our wool to Tcherepahin, and no one could wish to havedone better. . . . We have made a good bargain."At the first sight of his own people Yegorushka felt an overwhelmingdesire to complain. He did not listen to Father Christopher, butthought how to begin and what exactly to complain of. But FatherChristopher's voice, which seemed to him harsh and unpleasant,prevented him from concentrating his attention and confused histhoughts. He had not sat at the table five minutes before he gotup, went to the sofa and lay down."Well, well," said Father Christopher in surprise. "What about yourtea?"Still thinking what to complain of, Yegorushka leaned his headagainst the wall and broke into sobs."Well, well!" repeated Father Christopher, getting up and going tothe sofa. "Yegory, what is the matter with you? Why are you crying?""I'm . . . I'm ill," Yegorushka brought out."Ill?" said Father Christopher in amazement. "That's not the rightthing, my boy. . . . One mustn't be ill on a journey. Aie, aie,what are you thinking about, boy . . . eh?"He put his hand to Yegorushka's head, touched his cheek and said:"Yes, your head's feverish. . . . You must have caught cold or elsehave eaten something. . . . Pray to God.""Should we give him quinine? . . ." said Ivan Ivanitch, troubled."No; he ought to have something hot. . . . Yegory, have a littledrop of soup? Eh?""I . . . don't want any," said Yegorushka."Are you feeling chilly?""I was chilly before, but now . . . now I am hot. And I ache allover. . . ."Ivan Ivanitch went up to the sofa, touched Yegorushka on the head,cleared his throat with a perplexed air, and went back to the table."I tell you what, you undress and go to bed," said Father Christopher."What you want is sleep now."He helped Yegorushka to undress, gave him a pillow and covered himwith a quilt, and over that Ivan Ivanitch's great-coat. Then hewalked away on tiptoe and sat down to the table. Yegorushka shuthis eyes, and at once it seemed to him that he was not in the hotelroom, but on the highroad beside the camp fire. Emelyan waved hishands, and Dymov with red eyes lay on his stomach and looked mockinglyat Yegorushka."Beat him, beat him!" shouted Yegorushka."He is delirious," said Father Christopher in an undertone."It's a nuisance!" sighed Ivan Ivanitch."He must be rubbed with oil and vinegar. Please God, he will bebetter to-morrow."To be rid of bad dreams, Yegorushka opened his eyes and began lookingtowards the fire. Father Christopher and Ivan Ivanitch had nowfinished their tea and were talking in a whisper. The first wassmiling with delight, and evidently could not forget that he hadmade a good bargain over his wool; what delighted him was not somuch the actual profit he had made as the thought that on gettinghome he would gather round him his big family, wink slyly and gooff into a chuckle; at first he would deceive them all, and saythat he had sold the wool at a price below its value, then he wouldgive his son-in-law, Mihail, a fat pocket-book and say: "Well, takeit! that's the way to do business!" Kuzmitchov did not seem pleased;his face expressed, as before, a business-like reserve and anxiety."If I could have known that Tcherepahin would give such a price,"he said in a low voice, "I wouldn't have sold Makarov those fivetons at home. It is vexatious! But who could have told that theprice had gone up here?"A man in a white shirt cleared away the samovar and lighted thelittle lamp before the ikon in the corner. Father Christopherwhispered something in his ear; the man looked, made a serious facelike a conspirator, as though to say, "I understand," went out, andreturned a little while afterwards and put something under the sofa.Ivan Ivanitch made himself a bed on the floor, yawned several times,said his prayers lazily, and lay down."I think of going to the cathedral to-morrow," said Father Christopher."I know the sacristan there. I ought to go and see the bishop aftermass, but they say he is ill."He yawned and put out the lamp. Now there was no light in the roombut the little lamp before the ikon."They say he can't receive visitors," Father Christopher went on,undressing. "So I shall go away without seeing him."He took off his full coat, and Yegorushka saw Robinson Crusoereappear. Robinson stirred something in a saucer, went up toYegorushka and whispered:"Lomonosov, are you asleep? Sit up; I'm going to rub you with oiland vinegar. It's a good thing, only you must say a prayer."Yegorushka roused himself quickly and sat up. Father Christopherpulled down the boy's shirt, and shrinking and breathing jerkily,as though he were being tickled himself, began rubbing Yegorushka'schest."In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost," hewhispered, "lie with your back upwards--that's it. . . . You'llbe all right to-morrow, but don't do it again. . . . You are as hotas fire. I suppose you were on the road in the storm.""Yes.""You might well fall ill! In the name of the Father, the Son, andthe Holy Ghost, . . . you might well fall ill!"After rubbing Yegorushka, Father Christopher put on his shirt again,covered him, made the sign of the cross over him, and walked away.Then Yegorushka saw him saying his prayers. Probably the old manknew a great many prayers by heart, for he stood a long time beforethe ikon murmuring. After saying his prayers he made the sign ofthe cross over the window, the door, Yegorushka, and Ivan Ivanitch,lay down on the little sofa without a pillow, and covered himselfwith his full coat. A clock in the corridor struck ten. Yegorushkathought how long a time it would be before morning; feeling miserable,he pressed his forehead against the back of the sofa and left offtrying to get rid of the oppressive misty dreams. But morning camemuch sooner than he expected.It seemed to him that he had not been lying long with his headpressed to the back of the sofa, but when he opened his eyes slantingrays of sunlight were already shining on the floor through the twowindows of the little hotel room. Father Christopher and IvanIvanitch were not in the room. The room had been tidied; it wasbright, snug, and smelt of Father Christopher, who always smelt ofcypress and dried cornflowers (at home he used to make the holy-watersprinklers and decorations for the ikonstands out of cornflowers,and so he was saturated with the smell of them). Yegorushka lookedat the pillow, at the slanting sunbeams, at his boots, which hadbeen cleaned and were standing side by side near the sofa, andlaughed. It seemed strange to him that he was not on the bales ofwool, that everything was dry around him, and that there was nothunder and lightning on the ceiling.He jumped off the sofa and began dressing. He felt splendid; nothingwas left of his yesterday's illness but a slight weakness in hislegs and neck. So the vinegar and oil had done good. He rememberedthe steamer, the railway engine, and the broad river, which he haddimly seen the day before, and now he made haste to dress, to runto the quay and have a look at them. When he had washed and wasputting on his red shirt, the latch of the door clicked, and FatherChristopher appeared in the doorway, wearing his top-hat and a brownsilk cassock over his canvas coat and carrying his staff in hishand. Smiling and radiant (old men are always radiant when theycome back from church), he put a roll of holy bread and a parcelof some sort on the table, prayed before the ikon, and said:"God has sent us blessings--well, how are you?""Quite well now," answered Yegorushka, kissing his hand."Thank God. . . . I have come from mass. I've been to see a sacristanI know. He invited me to breakfast with him, but I didn't go. Idon't like visiting people too early, God bless them!"He took off his cassock, stroked himself on the chest, and withouthaste undid the parcel. Yegorushka saw a little tin of caviare, apiece of dry sturgeon, and a French loaf."See; I passed a fish-shop and brought this," said Father Christopher."There is no need to indulge in luxuries on an ordinary weekday;but I thought, I've an invalid at home, so it is excusable. And thecaviare is good, real sturgeon. . . ."The man in the white shirt brought in the samovar and a tray withtea-things."Eat some," said Father Christopher, spreading the caviare on aslice of bread and handing it to Yegorushka. "Eat now and enjoyyourself, but the time will soon come for you to be studying. Mindyou study with attention and application, so that good may come ofit. What you have to learn by heart, learn by heart, but when youhave to tell the inner sense in your own words, without regard tothe outer form, then say it in your own words. And try to masterall subjects. One man knows mathematics excellently, but has neverheard of Pyotr Mogila; another knows about Pyotr Mogila, but cannotexplain about the moon. But you study so as to understand everything.Study Latin, French, German, . . . geography, of course, history,theology, philosophy, mathematics, . . . and when you have masteredeverything, not with haste but with prayer and with zeal, then gointo the service. When you know everything it will be easy for youin any line of life. . . . You study and strive for the divineblessing, and God will show you what to be. Whether a doctor, ajudge or an engineer. . . ."Father Christopher spread a little caviare on a piece of bread, putit in his mouth and said:"The Apostle Paul says: 'Do not apply yourself to strange and diversestudies.' Of course, if it is black magic, unlawful arts, or callingup spirits from the other world, like Saul, or studying subjectsthat can be of no use to yourself or others, better not learn them.You must undertake only what God has blessed. Take example . . .the Holy Apostles spoke in all languages, so you study languages.Basil the Great studied mathematics and philosophy--so you studythem; St. Nestor wrote history--so you study and write history.Take example from the saints."Father Christopher sipped the tea from his saucer, wiped hismoustaches, and shook his head."Good!" he said. "I was educated in the old-fashioned way; I haveforgotten a great deal by now, but still I live differently fromother people. Indeed, there is no comparison. For instance, incompany at a dinner, or at an assembly, one says something in Latin,or makes some allusion from history or philosophy, and it pleasespeople, and it pleases me myself. . . . Or when the circuit courtcomes and one has to take the oath, all the other priests are shy,but I am quite at home with the judges, the prosecutors, and thelawyers. I talk intellectually, drink a cup of tea with them, laugh,ask them what I don't know, . . . and they like it. So that's howit is, my boy. Learning is light and ignorance is darkness. Study!It's hard, of course; nowadays study is expensive. . . . Your motheris a widow; she lives on her pension, but there, of course . . ."Father Christopher glanced apprehensively towards the door, andwent on in a whisper:"Ivan Ivanitch will assist. He won't desert you. He has no childrenof his own, and he will help you. Don't be uneasy."He looked grave, and whispered still more softly:"Only mind, Yegory, don't forget your mother and Ivan Ivanitch, Godpreserve you from it. The commandment bids you honour your mother,and Ivan Ivanitch is your benefactor and takes the place of a fatherto you. If you become learned, God forbid you should be impatientand scornful with people because they are not so clever as you,then woe, woe to you!"Father Christopher raised his hand and repeated in a thin voice:"Woe to you! Woe to you!"Father Christopher's tongue was loosened, and he was, as they say,warming to his subject; he would not have finished till dinnertimebut the door opened and Ivan Ivanitch walked in. He said good-morninghurriedly, sat down to the table, and began rapidly swallowing histea."Well, I have settled all our business," he said. "We might havegone home to-day, but we have still to think about Yegor. We mustarrange for him. My sister told me that Nastasya Petrovna, a friendof hers, lives somewhere here, so perhaps she will take him in asa boarder."He rummaged in his pocket-book, found a crumpled note and read:"'Little Lower Street: Nastasya Petrovna Toskunov, living in ahouse of her own.' We must go at once and try to find her. It's anuisance!"Soon after breakfast Ivan Ivanitch and Yegorushka left the inn."It's a nuisance," muttered his uncle. "You are sticking to me likea burr. You and your mother want education and gentlemanly breedingand I have nothing but worry with you both. . . ."When they crossed the yard, the waggons and the drivers were notthere. They had all gone off to the quay early in the morning. Ina far-off dark corner of the yard stood the chaise."Good-bye, chaise!" thought Yegorushka.At first they had to go a long way uphill by a broad street, thenthey had to cross a big marketplace; here Ivan Ivanitch asked apoliceman for Little Lower Street."I say," said the policeman, with a grin, "it's a long way off, outthat way towards the town grazing ground."They met several cabs but Ivan Ivanitch only permitted himself sucha weakness as taking a cab in exceptional cases and on great holidays.Yegorushka and he walked for a long while through paved streets,then along streets where there were only wooden planks at the sidesand no pavements, and in the end got to streets where there wereneither planks nor pavements. When their legs and their tongues hadbrought them to Little Lower Street they were both red in the face,and taking off their hats, wiped away the perspiration."Tell me, please," said Ivan Ivanitch, addressing an old man sittingon a little bench by a gate, "where is Nastasya Petrovna Toskunov'shouse?""There is no one called Toskunov here," said the old man, afterpondering a moment. "Perhaps it's Timoshenko you want.""No, Toskunov. . . .""Excuse me, there's no one called Toskunov. . . ."Ivan Ivanitch shrugged his shoulders and trudged on farther."You needn't look," the old man called after them. "I tell you thereisn't, and there isn't.""Listen, auntie," said Ivan Ivanitch, addressing an old woman whowas sitting at a corner with a tray of pears and sunflower seeds,"where is Nastasya Petrovna Toskunov's house?"The old woman looked at him with surprise and laughed."Why, Nastasya Petrovna live in her own house now!" she cried."Lord! it is eight years since she married her daughter and gaveup the house to her son-in-law! It's her son-in-law lives therenow."And her eyes expressed: "How is it you didn't know a simple thinglike that, you fools?""And where does she live now?" Ivan Ivanitch asked."Oh, Lord!" cried the old woman, flinging up her hands in surprise."She moved ever so long ago! It's eight years since she gave up herhouse to her son-in-law! Upon my word!"She probably expected Ivan Ivanitch to be surprised, too, and toexclaim: "You don't say so," but Ivan Ivanitch asked very calmly:"Where does she live now?"The old woman tucked up her sleeves and, stretching out her barearm to point, shouted in a shrill piercing voice:"Go straight on, straight on, straight on. You will pass a littlered house, then you will see a little alley on your left. Turn downthat little alley, and it will be the third gate on the right. . . ."Ivan Ivanitch and Yegorushka reached the little red house, turnedto the left down the little alley, and made for the third gate onthe right. On both sides of this very old grey gate there was agrey fence with big gaps in it. The first part of the fence wastilting forwards and threatened to fall, while on the left of thegate it sloped backwards towards the yard. The gate itself stoodupright and seemed to be still undecided which would suit it best--to fall forwards or backwards. Ivan Ivanitch opened the littlegate at the side, and he and Yegorushka saw a big yard overgrownwith weeds and burdocks. A hundred paces from the gate stood alittle house with a red roof and green shutters. A stout woman withher sleeves tucked up and her apron held out was standing in themiddle of the yard, scattering something on the ground and shoutingin a voice as shrill as that of the woman selling fruit:"Chick! . . . Chick! . . . Chick!"Behind her sat a red dog with pointed ears. Seeing the strangers,he ran to the little gate and broke into a tenor bark (all red dogshave a tenor bark)."Whom do you want?" asked the woman, putting up her hand to shadeher eyes from the sun."Good-morning!" Ivan Ivanitch shouted, too, waving off the red dogwith his stick. "Tell me, please, does Nastasya Petrovna Toskunovlive here?""Yes! But what do you want with her?""Perhaps you are Nastasya Petrovna?""Well, yes, I am!""Very pleased to see you. . . . You see, your old friend OlgaIvanovna Knyasev sends her love to you. This is her little son. AndI, perhaps you remember, am her brother Ivan Ivanitch. . . . Youare one of us from N. . . . You were born among us and marriedthere. . . ."A silence followed. The stout woman stared blankly at Ivan Ivanitch,as though not believing or not understanding him, then she flushedall over, and flung up her hands; the oats were scattered out ofher apron and tears spurted from her eyes."Olga Ivanovna!" she screamed, breathless with excitement. "My owndarling! Ah, holy saints, why am I standing here like a fool? Mypretty little angel. . . ."She embraced Yegorushka, wetted his face with her tears, and brokedown completely."Heavens!" she said, wringing her hands, "Olga's little boy! Howdelightful! He is his mother all over! The image of his mother! Butwhy are you standing in the yard? Come indoors."Crying, gasping for breath and talking as she went, she hurriedtowards the house. Her visitors trudged after her."The room has not been done yet," she said, ushering the visitorsinto a stuffy little drawing-room adorned with many ikons and potsof flowers. "Oh, Mother of God! Vassilisa, go and open the shuttersanyway! My little angel! My little beauty! I did not know thatOlitchka had a boy like that!"When she had calmed down and got over her first surprise IvanIvanitch asked to speak to her alone. Yegorushka went into anotherroom; there was a sewing-machine; in the window was a cage with astarling in it, and there were as many ikons and flowers as in thedrawing-room. Near the machine stood a little girl with a sunburntface and chubby cheeks like Tit's, and a clean cotton dress. Shestared at Yegorushka without blinking, and apparently felt veryawkward. Yegorushka looked at her and after a pause asked:"What's your name?"The little girl moved her lips, looked as if she were going to cry,and answered softly:"Atka. . . ."This meant Katka."He will live with you," Ivan Ivanitch was whispering in thedrawing-room, "if you will be so kind, and we will pay ten roublesa month for his keep. He is not a spoilt boy; he is quiet. . . .""I really don't know what to say, Ivan Ivanitch!" Nastasya Petrovnasighed tearfully. "Ten roubles a month is very good, but it is adreadful thing to take another person's child! He may fall ill orsomething. . . ."When Yegorushka was summoned back to the drawing-room Ivan Ivanitchwas standing with his hat in his hands, saying good-bye."Well, let him stay with you now, then," he said. "Good-bye! Youstay, Yegor!" he said, addressing his nephew. "Don't be troublesome;mind you obey Nastasya Petrovna. . . . Good-bye; I am coming againto-morrow."And he went away. Nastasya once more embraced Yegorushka, calledhim a little angel, and with a tear-stained face began preparingfor dinner. Three minutes later Yegorushka was sitting beside her,answering her endless questions and eating hot savoury cabbage soup.In the evening he sat again at the same table and, resting his headon his hand, listened to Nastasya Petrovna. Alternately laughingand crying, she talked of his mother's young days, her own marriage,her children. . . . A cricket chirruped in the stove, and there wasa faint humming from the burner of the lamp. Nastasya Petrovnatalked in a low voice, and was continually dropping her thimble inher excitement; and Katka her granddaughter, crawled under the tableafter it and each time sat a long while under the table, probablyexamining Yegorushka's feet; and Yegorushka listened, half dozingand looking at the old woman's face, her wart with hairs on it, andthe stains of tears, and he felt sad, very sad. He was put to sleepon a chest and told that if he were hungry in the night he must goout into the little passage and take some chicken, put there undera plate in the window.Next morning Ivan Ivanitch and Father Christopher came to saygood-bye. Nastasya Petrovna was delighted to see them, and was aboutto set the samovar; but Ivan Ivanitch, who was in a great hurry,waved his hands and said:"We have no time for tea! We are just setting off."Before parting they all sat down and were silent for a minute.Nastasya Petrovna heaved a deep sigh and looked towards the ikonwith tear-stained eyes."Well," began Ivan Ivanitch, getting up, "so you will stay. . . ."All at once the look of business-like reserve vanished from hisface; he flushed a little and said with a mournful smile:"Mind you work hard. . . . Don't forget your mother, and obeyNastasya Petrovna. . . . If you are diligent at school, Yegor, I'llstand by you."He took his purse out of his pocket, turned his back to Yegorushka,fumbled for a long time among the smaller coins, and, finding aten-kopeck piece, gave it to Yegorushka.Father Christopher, without haste, blessed Yegorushka."In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. . . .Study," he said. "Work hard, my lad. If I die, remember me in yourprayers. Here is a ten-kopeck piece from me, too. . . ."Yegorushka kissed his hand, and shed tears; something whispered inhis heart that he would never see the old man again."I have applied at the high school already," said Ivan Ivanitch ina voice as though there were a corpse in the room. "You will takehim for the entrance examination on the seventh of August. . . .Well, good-bye; God bless you, good-bye, Yegor!""You might at least have had a cup of tea," wailed Nastasya Petrovna.Through the tears that filled his eyes Yegorushka could not see hisuncle and Father Christopher go out. He rushed to the window, butthey were not in the yard, and the red dog, who had just beenbarking, was running back from the gate with the air of having donehis duty. When Yegorushka ran out of the gate Ivan Ivanitch andFather Christopher, the former waving his stick with the crook, thelatter his staff, were just turning the corner. Yegorushka feltthat with these people all that he had known till then had vanishedfrom him for ever. He sank helplessly on to the little bench, andwith bitter tears greeted the new unknown life that was beginningfor him now. . . .What would that life be like?End of Project Gutenberg's The Bishop and Other Stories, by Anton Chekhov*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BISHOP AND OTHER STORIES ******** This file should be named 13419.txt or 13419.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/3/4/1/13419/Produced by James RuskUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editionswill be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that noone owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States withoutpermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Little Old New YorkITHE RED SPLASH OF ROMANCEThe walls of the big living-room in the Arrowhead ranch house aretastefully enlivened here and there with artistic spoils of the owner,Mrs. Lysander John Pettengill. There are family portraits in crayon,photo-engravings of noble beasts clipped from the _Breeder's Gazette_,an etched cathedral or two, a stuffed and varnished trout of such sizethat no one would otherwise have believed in it, a print in threecolours of a St. Bernard dog with a marked facial resemblance to thelate William E. Gladstone, and a triumph of architectural perspectiverevealing two sides of the Pettengill block, corner of Fourth and Mainstreets, Red Gap, made vivacious by a bearded fop on horseback who doffshis silk hat to a couple of overdressed ladies with parasols in apassing victoria.And there is the photograph of the fat man. He is very large--both highand wide. He has filled the lens and now compels the eye. His broad facebeams a friendly interest. His moustache is a flourishing, uncurbed,riotous growth above his billowy chin.The checked coat, held recklessly aside by a hand on each hip, revealsan incredible expanse of waistcoat, the pattern of which raveshorribly. From pocket to pocket of this gaudy shield curves a watchchain of massive links--nearly a yard of it, one guesses.Often I have glanced at this noisy thing tacked to the wall, entrancedby the simple width of the man. Now on a late afternoon I loiteredbefore it while my hostess changed from riding breeches to the gown oflavender and lace in which she elects to drink tea after a day's hardwork along the valleys of the Arrowhead. And for the first time Iobserved a line of writing beneath the portrait, the writing of myhostess, a rough, downright, plain fashion of script: "Reading from leftto right--Mr. Ben Sutton, Popular Society Favourite of Nome, Alaska.""Reading from left to right!" Here was the intent facetious. And MaPettengill is never idly facetious. Always, as the advertisements say,"There's a reason!" And now, also for the first time, I noticed someprinted verses on a sheet of thickish yellow paper tacked to the wallclose beside the photograph--so close that I somehow divined an intimaterelationship between the two. With difficulty removing my gaze from thegentleman who should be read from left to right, I scanned these verses:    SONG OF THE OPEN ROAD    A child of the road--a gypsy I--      My path o'er the land and sea;    With the fire of youth I warm my nights      And my days are wild and free.    Then ho! for the wild, the open road!      Afar from the haunts of men.    The woods and the hills for my spirit untamed--      I'm away to mountain and glen.    If ever I tried to leave my hills      To abide in the cramped haunts of men,    The urge of the wild to her wayward child      Would drag me to freedom again.    I'm slave to the call of the open road;      In your cities I'd stifle and die.    I'm off to the hills in fancy I see--      On the breast of old earth I'll lie.    WILFRED LENNOX, the Hobo Poet,    On a Coast-to-Coast Walking Tour.    These Cards for sale.I briefly pondered the lyric. It told its own simple story and could atonce have been dismissed but for its divined and puzzling relationshipto the popular society favourite of Nome, Alaska. What could there be inthis?Mrs. Lysander John Pettengill bustled in upon my speculation, but asusual I was compelled to wait for the talk I wanted. For some momentsshe would be only the tired owner of the Arrowhead Ranch--in the teagown of a debutante and with too much powder on one side of hernose--and she must have at least one cup of tea so corrosive that theScotch whiskey she adds to it is but a merciful dilution. She now drankeagerly of the fearful brew, dulled the bite of it with smoke from ahurriedly built cigarette, and relaxed gratefully into one of thosechairs which are all that most of us remember William Morris for. Eventhen she must first murmur of the day's annoyances, provided this timeby officials of the United States Forest Reserve. In the beginning Imust always allow her a little to have her own way."The annual spring rumpus with them rangers," she wearily boomed. "Everyyear they tell me just where to turn my cattle out on the Reserve, andevery year I go ahead and turn 'em out where I want 'em turned out,which ain't the same place at all, and then I have to listen patientlyto their kicks and politely answer all letters from the higher-ups andwait for the official permit, which always comes--and it's wearing on abody. Darn it! They'd ought to know by this time I always get my ownway. If they wasn't such a decent bunch I'd have words with 'em, givingme the same trouble year after year, probably because I'm a weak,defenceless woman. However!"The lady rested largely, inert save for the hand that raised thecigarette automatically to her lips. My moment had come."What did Wilfred Lennox, the hobo poet, have to do with Mr. Ben Sutton,of Nome, Alaska?" I gently inquired."More than he wanted," replied the lady. Her glance warmed withmemories; she hovered musingly on the verge of recital. But thecigarette was half done and at its best. I allowed her another moment, amoment in which she laughed confidentially to herself, a little dry,throaty laugh. I knew that laugh. She would be marshalling certainevents in their just and diverting order. But they seemed to be many andof confusing values."Some said he not only wasn't a hobo but wasn't even a poet," shepresently murmured, and smoked again. Then: "That Ben Sutton, now, he'sa case. Comes from Alaska and don't like fresh eggs for breakfastbecause he says they ain't got any kick to 'em like Alaska eggs havealong in March, and he's got to have canned milk for his coffee. Say, Igot a three-quarters Jersey down in Red Gap gives milk so rich that thecream just naturally trembles into butter if you speak sharply to it oreven give it a cross look; not for Ben though. Had to send out forcanned milk that morning. I drew the line at hunting up case eggs forhim though. He had to put up with insipid fresh ones. And fat, that man!My lands! He travels a lot in the West when he does leave home, and hetells me it's the fear of his life he'll get wedged into one of themnarrow-gauge Pullmans some time and have to be chopped out. Well, as Iwas saying--" She paused."But you haven't begun," I protested. I sharply tapped the printedverses and the photograph reading from left to right. Now she becameanimated, speaking as she expertly rolled a fresh cigarette."Say, did you ever think what aggravating minxes women are after theybeen married a few years--after the wedding ring gets worn a little bitthin?"This was not only brutal; it seemed irrelevant."Wilfred Lennox--" I tried to insist, but she commandingly raised thenew cigarette at me."Yes, sir! Ever know one of 'em married for as long as ten years thatdidn't in her secret heart have a sort of contempt for her life partneras being a stuffy, plodding truck horse? Of course they keep a certaindull respect for him as a provider, but they can't see him as dashingand romantic any more; he ain't daring and adventurous. All he ever doesis go down and open up the store or push back the roll-top, and keepfrom getting run over on the street. One day's like another with him,never having any wild, lawless instincts or reckless moods that make aman fascinating--about the nearest he ever comes to adventure is when heopens the bills the first of the month. And she often seeing him withoutany collar on, and needing a shave mebbe, and cherishing her own secretromantic dreams, while like as not he's prosily figuring out how he'sgoing to make the next payment on the endowment policy."It's a hard, tiresome life women lead, chained to these here plodders.That's why rich widows generally pick out the dashing young devils theydo for their second, having buried the man that made it for 'em. Oh,they like him well enough, call him 'Father' real tenderly, and seethat he changes to the heavy flannels on time, but he don't ever thrillthem, and when they order three hundred and fifty dollars' worth of dudsfrom the Boston Cash Emporium and dress up like a foreign countess, theydon't do it for Father, they do it for the romantic guy in the magazineserial they're reading, the handsome, cynical adventurer that has suchan awful power over women. They know darned well they won't ever meethim; still it's just as well to be ready in case he ever should make RedGap--or wherever they live--and it's easy with the charge account there,and Father never fussing more than a little about the bills."Not that I blame 'em. We're all alike--innocent enough, with freakshere and there that ain't. Why, I remember about a thousand years ago Iwas reading a book called 'Lillian's Honour,' in which the rightful earldidn't act like an earl had ought to, but went travelling off over themoors with a passel of gypsies, with all the she-gypsies falling in lovewith him, and no wonder--he was that dashing. Well, I used to think whatmight happen if he should come along while Lysander John was out withthe beef round-up or something. I was well-meaning, understand, but atthat I'd ought to have been laid out with a pick-handle. Oh, the nicestof us got specks inside us--if ever we did cut loose the best one of uswould make the worst man of you look like nothing worse than a naughtylittle boy cutting up in Sunday-school. What holds us, of course--wealways dream of being took off our feet; of being carried off by mainforce against our wills while we snuggle up to the romantic brute andplead with him to spare us--and the most reckless of 'em don't often gettheir nerve up to that. Well, as I was saying--"But she was not saying. The thing moved too slowly. And still the womanpaltered with her poisoned tea and made cigarettes and mutteredinconsequently, as when she now broke out after a glance at thephotograph:"That Ben Sutton certainly runs amuck when he buys his vests. He musthave about fifty, and the quietest one in the lot would make a leopardskin look like a piker." Again her glance dreamed off to visions.I seated myself before her with some emphasis and said firmly: "Now,then!" It worked."Wilfred Lennox," she began, "calling himself the hobo poet, gets intoRed Gap one day and makes the rounds with that there piece of poetry yousee; pushes into stores and offices and hands the piece out, and like asnot they crowd a dime or two bits onto him and send him along. That'swhat I done. I was waiting in Dr. Percy Hailey Martingale's office for alittle painless dentistry, and I took Wilfred's poem and passed him atwo-bit piece, and Doc Martingale does the same, and Wilfred blew on tothe next office. A dashing and romantic figure he was, though kind offat and pasty for a man that was walking from coast to coast, but asmooth talker with beautiful features and about nine hundred dollars'worth of hair and a soft hat and one of these flowing neckties. Red itwas."So I looked over his piece of poetry--about the open road for hisuntamed spirit and him being stifled in the cramped haunts of men--andof course I get his number. All right about the urge of the wild to herwayward child, but here he was spending a lot of time in the crampedhaunts of men taking their small change away from 'em and not seeming tostifle one bit."Ain't this new style of tramp funny? Now instead of coming round to theback door and asking for a hand-out like any self-respecting tramp hadought to, they march up to the front door, and they're somebody with twoor three names that's walking round the world on a wager they made withone of the Vanderbilt boys or John D. Rockefeller. They've walkedthirty-eight hundred miles already and got the papers to prove it--aletter from the mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania, and the mayor ofDavenport, Iowa, a picture post card of themselves on the courthousesteps at Denver, and they've bet forty thousand dollars they could startout without a cent and come back in twenty-two months with money intheir pocket--and ain't it a good joke?--with everybody along the wayentering into the spirit of it and passing them quarters and such, andthank you very much for your two bits for the picture post card--andthey got another showing 'em in front of the Mormon Tabernacle at SaltLake City, if you'd like that, too--and thank you again--and now they'llbe off once more to the open road and the wild, free life. Not! Yes, twoor three good firm Nots. Having milked the town they'll be right down tothe dee-po with their silver changed to bills, waiting for No. 6 to comealong, and ho! for the open railroad and another town that will skinpretty. I guess I've seen eight or ten of them boys in the last fiveyears, with their letters from mayors."But this here Wilfred Lennox had a new graft. He was the first I'd giveup to for mere poetry. He didn't have a single letter from a mayor, noreven a picture card of himself standing with his hat off in front ofPike's Peak--nothing but poetry. But, as I said, he was there with atalk about pining for the open road and despising the cramped haunts ofmen, and he had appealing eyes and all this flowing hair and necktie. SoI says to myself: 'All right, Wilfred, you win!' and put my purse backin my bag and thought no more of it."Yet not so was it to be. Wilfred, working the best he could to make aliving doing nothing, pretty soon got to the office of Alonzo Price,Choice Improved Real Estate and Price's Addition. Lon was out for themoment, but who should be there waiting for him but his wife, Mrs.Henrietta Templeton Price, recognized leader of our literary andartistic set. Or I think they call it a 'group' or a 'coterie' orsomething. Setting at Lon's desk she was, toying petulantly with horridold pens and blotters, and probably bestowing glances of disrelish fromtime to time round the grimy office where her scrubby little husbandtoiled his days away in unromantic squalor."I got to tell you about Henrietta. She's one of them like I just saidthe harsh things about, with the secret cry in her heart for romance andadventure and other forbidden things and with a kindly contempt forpeaceful Alonzo. She admits to being thirty-six, so you can figure itout for yourself. Of course she gets her husband wrong at that, as womenso often do. Alonzo has probably the last pair of side whiskers outsideof a steel engraving and stands five feet two, weighing a hundred andtwenty-six pounds at the ring side, but he's game as a swordfish, and asfor being romantic in the true sense of the word--well, no one that everheard him sell a lot in Price's Addition--three miles and a half up onthe mesa, with only the smoke of the canning factory to tell a body theywas still near the busy haunts of men, that and a mile of concretesidewalk leading a life of complete idleness--I say no one that everlistened to Lon sell a lot up there, pointing out on a blue print theproposed site of the Carnegie Library, would accuse him of not beingromantic."But of course Henrietta never sees Lon's romance and he ain't alwayshad the greatest patience with hers--like the time she got up the ArtLoan Exhibit to get new books for the M.E. Sabbath-school library andgot Spud Mulkins of the El Adobe to lend 'em the big gold-framed oilpainting that hangs over his bar. Some of the other ladies objected tothis--the picture was a big pink hussy lying down beside theocean--but Henrietta says art for art's sake is pure to them that arepure, or something, and they're doing such things constantly in theEast; and I'm darned if Spud didn't have his oil painting down and themosquito netting ripped off it before Alonzo heard about it and put theNot-at-All on it. He wouldn't reason with Henrietta either. He just saidhis objection was that every man that saw it would put one foot upgroping for the brass railing, which would be undignified for aSabbath-school scheme, and that she'd better hunt out something withclothes on like Whistler's portrait of his mother, or, if she wanted thenude in art, to get the Horse Fair or something with animals."I tell you that to show you how they don't hit it off sometimes. ThenHenrietta sulks. Kind of pinched and hungry looking she is, drapes herblack hair down over one side of her high forehead, wears daringgowns--that's what she calls 'em anyway--and reads the most outrageouskinds of poetry out loud to them that will listen. Likes this OmarSomething stuff about your path being beset with pitfalls and gin fizzesand getting soused out under a tree with your girl."I'm just telling you so you'll get Henrietta when Wilfred Lennox dripsgracefully in with his piece of poetry in one hand. Of course she musthave looked long and nervously at Wilfred, then read his poetry, thenlooked again. There before her was Romance against a background ofAlonzo Price, who never had an adventurous or evil thought in his life,and wore rubbers! Oh, sure! He must have palsied her at once, this wild,free creature of the woods who couldn't stand the cramped haunts of men.And I have said that Wilfred was there with the wild, free words abouthimself, and the hat and tie and the waving brown hair that give him somuch trouble. Shucks! I don't blame the woman. It's only a few yearssince we been let out from under lock and key. Give us a little time toget our bearings, say I. Wilfred was just one big red splash before heryearning eyes; he blinded her. And he stood there telling how this herelife in the marts of trade would sure twist and blacken some of the veryfinest chords in his being. Something like that it must have been."Anyway, about a quarter to six a procession went up Fourth Street,consisting of Wilfred Lennox, Henrietta, and Alonzo. The latter wastripping along about three steps back of the other two and every once ina while he would stop for a minute and simply look puzzled. I saw him.It's really a great pity Lon insists on wearing a derby hat with hisside whiskers. To my mind the two never seem meant for each other."The procession went to the Price mansion up on Ophir Avenue. And thatevening Henrietta had in a few friends to listen to the poet recite hisverses and tell anecdotes about himself. About five or six ladies inthe parlour and their menfolks smoking out on the front porch. The mendidn't seem to fall for Wilfred's open-road stuff the way the ladiesdid. Wilfred was a good reciter and held the ladies with his voice andhis melting blue eyes with the long lashes, and Henrietta was envied forhaving nailed him. That is, the women envied her. The men sort ofslouched off down to the front gate and then went down to the TemperanceBilliard Parlour, where several of 'em got stewed. Most of 'em, like oldJudge Ballard, who come to the country in '62, and Jeff Tuttle, who'salways had more than he wanted of the open road, were very cold indeedto Wilfred's main proposition. It is probable that low mutterings mighthave been heard among 'em, especially after a travelling man that wasplaying pool said the hobo poet had come in on the Pullman of No. 6."But I must say that Alonzo didn't seem to mutter any, from all I couldhear. Pathetic, the way that little man will believe right up to thebitter end. He said that for a hobo Wilfred wrote very good poetry,better than most hobos could write, he thought, and that Henriettaalways knew what she was doing. So the evening come to a peaceful end,most of the men getting back for their wives and Alonzo showing up infair shape and plumb eager for the comfort of his guest. It was Alonzo'snotion that the guest would of course want to sleep out in the frontyard on the breast of old earth where he could look up at the prettystars and feel at home, and he was getting out a roll of blankets whenthe guest said he didn't want to make the least bit of trouble and forone night he'd manage to sleep inside four stifling walls in a regularbed, like common people do. So Lon bedded him down in the guest chamber,but opened up the four windows in it and propped the door wide open sothe poor fellow could have a breeze and not smother. He told thisdowntown the next morning, and he was beginning to look right puzzledindeed. He said the wayward child of Nature had got up after about halfan hour and shut all the windows and the door. Lon thought first he wasintending to commit suicide, but he didn't like to interfere. He wastelling Jeff Tuttle and me about it when we happened to pass his office."'And there's another funny thing,'" he says. 'This chap was telling usall the way up home last night that he never ate meat--simply fruits andnuts with a mug of spring water. He said eating the carcasses ofmurdered beasts was abhorrent to him. But when we got down to the tablehe consented to partake of the roast beef and he did so repeatedly. Weusually have cold meat for lunch the day after a rib roast, but therewill be something else to-day; and along with the meat he drank twobottles of beer, though with mutterings of disgust. He said spring waterin the hills was pure, but that water out of pipes was full of typhoidgerms. He admitted that there were times when the grosser appetitesassailed him. And they assailed him this morning, too. He said he mightbring himself to eat some chops, and he did it without scarcely astruggle. He ate six. He said living the nauseous artificial life evenfor one night brought back the hateful meat craving. I don't know. He isundeniably peculiar. And of course you've heard about Pettikin's affairfor this evening?'"We had. Just before leaving the house I had received Henrietta's cardinviting me to the country club that evening 'to meet Mr. WilfredLennox, Poet and Nature Lover, who will recite his original verses andgive a brief talk on "The World's Debt to Poetry."' And there you havethe whole trouble. Henrietta should have known better. But I've let outwhat women really are. I told Alonzo I would sure be among thosepresent, I said it sounded good. And then Alonzo pipes up about BenSutton coming to town on the eleven forty-two from the West. Ben makes atrip out of Alaska every summer and never fails to stop off a day or twowith Lon, they having been partners up North in '98."'Good old Ben will enjoy it, too,' says Alonzo; 'and, furthermore, Benwill straighten out one or two little things that have puzzled me aboutthis poet. He will understand his complex nature in a way that I confessI have been unequal to. What I mean is,' he says, 'there was talk when Ileft this morning of the poet consenting to take a class in poetry forseveral weeks in our thriving little city, and Henrietta was urging himto make our house his home. I have a sort of feeling that Ben will beable to make several suggestions of prime value. I have never known himto fail at making suggestions.'"Funny, the way the little man tried to put it over on us, letting on hewas just puzzled--not really bothered, as he plainly was. You knewHenrietta was still seeing the big red splash of Romance, behind whichthe figure of her husband was totally obscured. Jeff Tuttle saw thefacts, and he up and spoke in a very common way about what would quicklyhappen to any tramp that tried to camp in his house, poet or no poet,but that's neither here nor there. We left Alonzo looking cheerilyforward to Ben Sutton on the eleven forty-two, and I went on to do someerrands."In the course of these I discovered that others besides Henrietta hadfell hard for the poet of Nature. I met Mrs. Dr. Percy Hailey Martingaleand she just bubbles about him, she having been at the Prices' the nightbefore."'Isn't he a glorious thing!' she says; 'and how grateful we should befor the dazzling bit of colour he brings into our drab existence!' Sheis a good deal like that herself at times. And I met Beryl Mae Macomber,a well known young society girl of seventeen, and Beryl Mae says: 'He'sawfully good looking, but do you think he's sincere?' And even Mrs.Judge Ballard comes along and says: 'What a stimulus he should be to usin our dull lives! How he shows us the big, vital bits!' and her at thatvery minute going into Bullitt & Fleishacker's to buy shoes for hernine year old twin grandsons! And the Reverend Mrs. Wiley Knapp in atthe Racquet Store wanting to know if the poet didn't make me think ofsome wild, free creature of the woods--a deer or an antelope poised forinstant flight while for one moment he timidly overlooked man in hishideous commercialism. But, of course, she was a minister's wife. I saidhe made me feel just like that. I said so to all of 'em. What else couldI say? If I'd said what I thought there on the street I'd of beenpinched. So I beat it home in self-protection. I was sympathizing goodand hearty with Lon Price by that time and looking forward to Ben Suttonmyself. I had a notion Ben would see the right of it where these poordubs of husbands wouldn't--or wouldn't dast say it if they did."About five o'clock I took another run downtown for some things I'dforgot, with an eye out to see how Alonzo and Ben might be coming on.The fact is, seeing each other only once a year that way they're apt tokind of loosen up--if you know what I mean."No sign of 'em at first. Nothing but ladies young and old--even some ofus older ranching set--making final purchases of ribbons and such forthe sole benefit of Wilfred Lennox, and talking in a flushed mannerabout him whenever they met. Almost every darned one of 'em had made ita point to stroll past the Price mansion that afternoon where Wilfredwas setting out on the lawn, in a wicker chair with some bottles of beersurveying Nature with a look of lofty approval and chatting withHenrietta about the real things of life."Beryl Mae Macomber had traipsed past four times, changing her clothestwice with a different shade of ribbon across her forehead and all hercollege pins on, and at last she'd simply walked right in and asked ifshe hadn't left her tennis racquet there last Tuesday. She says to Mrs.Judge Ballard and Mrs. Martingale and me in the Cut-Rate Pharmacy, shesays: 'Oh, he's just awfully magnetic--but do you really think he'ssincere?' Then she bought an ounce of Breath of Orient perfume and kindof two-stepped out. These other ladies spoke very sharply about thefreedom Beryl Mae's aunt allowed her. Mrs. Martingale said the poet, itwas true, had a compelling personality, but what was our young girlscoming to? And if that child was hers--"So I left these two lady highbinders and went on into the retail sideof the Family Liquor Store to order up some cooking sherry, and thereover the partition from the bar side what do I hear but Alonzo Price andBen Sutton! Right off I could tell they'd been pinning a few on. Infact, Alonzo was calling the bartender Mister. You don't know about Lon,but when he calls the bartender Mister the ship has sailed. Ten minutesafter that he'll be crying over his operation. So I thought quick,remembering that we had now established a grillroom at the country club,consisting of a bar and three tables with bells on them, and aChinaman, and that if Alonzo and Ben Sutton come there at all they hadbetter come right--at least to start with. When I'd given my order Isent Louis Meyer in to tell the two gentlemen a lady wished to speak tothem outside."In a minute Ben comes out alone. He was awful glad to see me and I saidhow well he looked, and he did look well, sort of cordial andbulging--his forehead bulges and his eyes bulge and his moustache andhis chin, and he has cushions on his face. He beamed on me in a wide andhearty manner and explained that Alonzo refused to come out to meet alady until he knew who she was, because you got to be careful in a smalltown like this where every one talks. 'And besides,' says Ben, 'he'sjust broke down and begun to cry about his appendicitis that was threeyears ago. He's leaning his head on his arms down by the end of the barand sobbing bitterly over it. He seems to grieve about it as a personalloss. I've tried to cheer him up and told him it was probably all forthe best, but he says when it comes over him this way he simply can'tstand it. And what shall I do?'"Well, of course I seen the worst had happened with Alonzo. So I says toBen: 'You know there's a party to-night and if that man ain't seen to hewill certainly sink the ship. Now you get him out of that swamp and I'llthink of something.' 'I'll do it,' says Ben, turning sideways so hecould go through the doorway again. 'I'll do it,' he says, 'if I have touse force on the little scoundrel.'"And sure enough, in a minute he edged out again with Alonzo firmlyfastened to him in some way. Lon hadn't wanted to come and didn't wantto stay now, but he simply couldn't move. Say, that Ben Sutton wouldmake an awful grand anchor for a captive balloon. Alonzo wiped his eyesuntil he could see who I was. Then I rebuked him, reminding him of hissacred duties as a prominent citizen, a husband, and the secretary ofthe Red Gap Chamber of Commerce. 'Of course it's all right to take adrink now and then,' I says."Alonzo brightened at this. 'Good!' says he; 'now it's now and prettysoon it will be then. Let's go into a saloon or something like that!'"'You'll come with me,' I says firmly. And I marched 'em down to theUnited States Grill, where I ordered tea and toast for 'em. Ben wassensible enough, but Alonzo was horrified at the thought of tea. 'It'stea or nice cold water for yours,' I says, and that set him off again.'Water!' he sobs. 'Water! Water! Maybe you don't know that some dearcousins of mine have just lost their all in the Dayton flood--twentyyears' gathering went in a minute, just like that!' and he tried to snaphis fingers. All the same I got some hot tea into him and sent for EddiePierce to be out in front with his hack. While we was waiting for Eddieit occurs to Alonzo to telephone his wife. He come back very solemn andsays: 'I told her I wouldn't be home to dinner because I was hungry andthere probably wouldn't be enough meat, what with a vegetarian poet inthe house. I told her I should sink to the level of a brute in the nightlife of our gay little city. I said I was a wayward child of Naturemyself if you come right down to it.'"'Good for you,' I says, having got word that Eddie is outside with hishack. 'And now for the open road!' 'Fine!' says Alonzo. 'My spirit iscertainly feeling very untamed, like some poet's!' So I hustled 'em outand into the four wheeler. Then I give Eddie Pierce privateinstructions. 'Get 'em out into the hills about four miles,' I says,'out past the Catholic burying ground, then make an excuse that yourhack has broke down, and as soon as they set foot to the ground havethem skates of yours run away. Pay no attention whatever to theirpleadings or their profane threats, only yelling to 'em that you'll beback as soon as possible. But don't go back. They'll wait an hour or so,then walk. And they need to walk.'"'You said something there,' says Eddie, glancing back at 'em. BenSutton was trying to cheer Alonzo up by reminding him of the Christmasnight they went to sleep in the steam room of the Turkish bath at Nome,and the man forgot 'em and shut off the steam and they froze to thebenches and had to be chiselled off. And Eddie trotted off with hisload. You'd ought to seen the way the hack sagged down on Ben's side.And I felt that I had done a good work, so I hurried home to get a biteto eat and dress and make the party, which I still felt would be a goodparty even if the husband of our hostess was among the killed ormissing."I reached the clubhouse at eight o'clock of that beautiful Juneevening, to find the party already well assembled on the piazza and thefront steps or strolling about the lawn, about eight or ten of ourprominent society matrons and near as many husbands. And mebbe thosedames hadn't lingered before their mirrors for final touches! Mrs.Martingale had on all her rings and the jade bracelet and the art-craftnecklace with amethysts, and Mrs. Judge Ballard had done her hair a newway, and Beryl Mae Macomber, there with her aunt, not only had a newscarf with silver stars over her frail young shoulders and a band ofcherry coloured velvet across her forehead, but she was wearing thefirst ankle watch ever seen in Red Gap. I couldn't begin to tell you thefussy improvements them ladies had made in themselves--and all, mindyou, for the passing child of Nature who had never paid a bill for 'emin his life."Oh, it was a gay, careless throng with the mad light of pleasure in itseyes, and all of 'em milling round Wilfred Lennox, who was eating it up.Some bantered him roguishly and some spoke in chest tones of what wasthe real inner meaning of life after all. Henrietta Templeton Pricehovered near with the glad light of capture in her eyes. Silent butproud Henrietta was, careless but superior, reminding me of the hunterthat has his picture taken over in Africa with one negligent foot onthe head of a two-horned rhinoceros he's just killed."But again the husbands was kind of lurking in the background, bunchedup together. They seemed abashed by this strange frenzy of theirwomenfolks. How'd they know, the poor dubs, that a poet wasn't somethinga business man had ought to be polite and grovelling to? They affectedan easy manner, but it was poor work. Even Judge Ballard, who seems ninefeet tall in his Prince Albert, and usually looks quite dignified andhostile with his long dark face and his moustache and goatee--even thegood old judge was rattled after a brief and unhappy effort to hold abit of converse with the guest of honour. Him and Jeff Tuttle went tothe grillroom twice in ten minutes. The judge always takes his with adash of pepper sauce in it, but now it only seemed to make him moregloomy."Well, I was listening along, feeling elated that I'd put Alonzo and BenSutton out of the way and wondering when the show would begin--Beryl Maein her high, innocent voice had just said to the poet: 'But seriouslynow, are you sincere?' and I was getting some plenty of that, when upthe road in the dusk I seen Bush Jones driving a dray-load of furniture.I wondered where in time any family could be moving out that way. Ididn't know any houses beyond the club and I was pondering about this,idly as you might say, when Bush Jones pulls his team up right in frontof the clubhouse, and there on the load is the two I had tried to lose.In a big armchair beside a varnished centre table sits Ben Suttonreading something that I recognized as the yellow card with Wilfred'sverses on it. And across the dray from him on a red-plush sofa is AlonzoPrice singing 'My Wild Irish Rose' in a very noisy tenor."Well, sir, I could have basted that fool Bush Jones with one of his owndray stakes. That man's got an intellect just powerful enough to takefurniture from one house to another if the new address ain't too hardfor him to commit to memory. That's Bush Jones all right! He has themachinery for thinking, but it all glitters as new as the day it was putin. So he'd come a mile out of his way with these two riots--and peopleoff somewhere wondering where that last load of things was!"The ladies all affected to ignore this disgraceful spectacle, withHenrietta sinking her nails into her bloodless palms, but the men brokeout and cheered a little in a half-scared manner and some of 'em wentdown to help the newcomers climb out. Then Ben had words with Bush Jonesbecause he wanted him to wait there and take 'em back to town when theparty was over and Bush refused to wait. After suffering about twentyseconds in the throes of mental effort I reckon he discovered that hehad business to attend to or was hungry or something. Anyway, Ben paidhim some money finally and he drove off after calling out 'Good-night,all!' just as if nothing had happened."Alonzo and Ben Sutton joined the party without further formality. Theydidn't look so bad, either, so I saw my crooked work had done some good.Lon quit singing almost at once and walked good and his eyes didn'twabble, and he looked kind of desperate and respectable, and Ben wasfirst-class, except he was slightly oratorical and his collar had meltedthe way fat men's do. And it was funny to see how every husband therebucked up when Ben came forward, as if all they had wanted was some oneto make medicine for 'em before they begun the war dance. They moochedright up round Ben when he trampled a way into the flushed group aboutWilfred."'At last the well-known stranger!' says Ben cordially, seizing one ofWilfred's pale, beautiful hands. 'I've been hearing so much of you,wayward child of the open road that you are, and I've just been readingyour wonderful verses as I sat in my library. The woods and the hillsfor your spirit untamed and the fire of youth to warm yournights--that's the talk.' He paused and waved Wilfred's verses in a fat,freckled hand. Then he looked at him hard and peculiar and says: 'Whenyou going to pull some of it for us?'"Wilfred had looked slightly rattled from the beginning. Now he smiled,but only with his lips--he made it seem like a mere Swedish exercise orsomething, and the next second his face looked as if it had been sewedup for the winter."'Little starry-eyed gypsy, I say, when are you going to pull some ofthat open-road stuff?' says Ben again, all cordial and sinister."Wilfred gulped and tried to be jaunty. 'Oh, as to that, I'm here to-dayand there to-morrow,' he murmurs, and nervously fixes his necktie."'Oh, my, and isn't that nice!' says Ben heartily--'the urge of the wildto her wayward child'--I know you're a slave to it. And now you're goingto tell us all about the open road, and then you and I are going to havean intimate chat and I'll tell you about it--about some of the dearestlittle open roads you ever saw, right round in these parts. I've justcounted nine, all leading out of town to the cunningest mountains andglens that would make you write poetry hours at a time, with Nature'sglad fruits and nuts and a mug of spring water and some bottled beer anda ham and some rump steak--'"The stillness of that group had become darned painful, I want to tellyou. There was a horrid fear that Ben Sutton might go too far, even fora country club. Every woman was shuddering and smiling in a painfulmanner, and the men regarding Ben with glistening eyes. And Ben felt ithimself all at once. So he says: 'But I fear I am detaining you,' andlet go of the end of Wilfred's tie that he had been toying with in asomewhat firm manner. 'Let us be on with your part of the evening'sentertainment,' he says, 'but don't forget, gypsy wilding that you are,that you and I must have a chat about open roads the moment you havefinished. I know we are cramping you. By that time you will be feelingthe old, restless urge and you might take a road that wasn't open if Ididn't direct you.'"He patted Wilfred loudly on the back a couple of times and Wilfredducked the third pat and got out of the group, and the ladies all beganto flurry their voices about the lovely June evening but wouldn't it bepleasanter inside, and Henrietta tragically called from the doorway tocome at once, for God's sake, so they all went at once, with the menonly half trailing, and inside we could hear 'em fixing chairs round andputting out a table for the poet to stand by, and so forth."Alonzo, however, had not trailed. He was over on the steps holdingBeryl Mae Macomber by her new scarf and telling her how flowerlike herbeauty was. And old Judge Ballard was holding about half the men,including Ben Sutton, while he made a speech. I hung back to listen.'Sir,' he was saying to Ben, 'Secretary Seward some years sincepurchased your territory from Russia for seven million dollars despitethe protests of a clamorous and purblind opposition. How niggardly seemsthat purchase price at this moment! For Alaska has perfected you, sir,if it did not produce you. Gentlemen, I feel that we dealt unfairly byRussia. But that is in the dead past. It is not too late, however, totiptoe to the grillroom and offer a toast to our young sister of thesnows.'"There was subdued cheers and they tiptoed. Ben Sutton was telling thejudge that he felt highly complimented, but it was a mistake to ring inthat snow stuff on Alaska. She'd suffered from it too long. He was goingon to paint Alaska as something like Alabama--cooler nights, of course,but bracing. Alonzo still had Beryl Mae by the scarf, telling her howflowerlike her beauty was."I went into the big room, picking a chair over by the door so I couldkeep tabs on that grillroom. Only three or four of the meekest husbandshad come with us. And Wilfred started. I'll do him the justice to say hewas game. The ladies thought anything bordering on roughness was allover, but Wilfred didn't. When he'd try to get a far-away look in hiseyes while he was reciting his poetry he couldn't get it any fartheraway than the grillroom door. He was nervous but determined, for therehad been notice given of a silver offering for him. He recited theverses on the card and the ladies all thrilled up at once, includingBeryl Mae, who'd come in without her scarf. They just clenched theirhands and hung on Wilfred's wild, free words."And after the poetry he kind of lectured about how man had ought tobreak away from the vile cities and seek the solace of great MotherNature, where his bruised spirit could be healed and the veneer ofcivilization cast aside and the soul come into its own, and things likethat. And he went on to say that out in the open the perspective of lifeis broadened and one is a laughing philosopher as long as the blue skyis overhead and the green grass underfoot. 'To lie,' says he, 'withrelaxed muscles on the carpet of pine needles and look up through thegently swaying branches of majestic trees at the fleecy white clouds,dreaming away the hours far from the sordid activities of the marketplace, is one of the best nerve tonics in all the world.' It was anunfortunate phrase for Wilfred, because some of the husbands had tiptoedout of the grillroom to listen, and there was a hearty cheer at this,led by Jeff Tuttle. 'Sure! Some nerve tonic!' they called out, andlaughed coarsely. Then they rushed back to the grillroom withouttiptoeing."The disgraceful interruption was tactfully covered by Wilfred and hisaudience. He took a sip from the glass of water and went on to talkabout the world's debt to poetry. Then I sneaked out to the grillroommyself. By this time the Chinaman had got tangled up with the orders andwas putting out drinks every which way. And they was being takenwillingly. Judge Ballard and Ben Sutton was now planting cotton inAlaska and getting good crops every year, and Ben was also promising tosend the judge a lovely spotted fawnskin vest that an Indian had madefor him, but made too small--not having more than six or eight fawns, Ijudged. And Alonzo had got a second start. Still he wasn't so bad yet,with Beryl Mae's scarf over his arm, and talking of the unparalleledbeauties of Price's Addition to Red Gap, which he said he wouldn't tradeeven for the whole of Alaska if it was offered to him to-morrow--notthat Ben Sutton wasn't the whitest soul God ever made and he'd like tohear some one say different--and so on."I mixed in with 'em and took a friendly drink myself, with the aim ofsmoothing things down, but I saw it would be delicate work. About all Icould do was keep 'em reminded there was ladies present and it wasn't abarroom where anything could be rightly started. Doc Martingale'sfeelings was running high, too, account, I suppose, of certainfull-hearted things his wife had blurted out to him about the hypnoticeyes of this here Nature lover. He was quiet enough, but vicious, actinglike he'd love to do some dental work on the poet that might or mightnot be painless for all he cared a hoot. He was taking his own drinksall alone, like clockwork--moody but systematic."Then we hear chairs pushed round in the other room and the chink ofsilver to be offered to the poet, and Henrietta come out to give wordfor the refreshments to be served. She found Alonzo in the hallwaytelling Beryl Mae how flowerlike her beauty was and giving her the elk'stooth charm off his watch chain. Beryl Mae was giggling heartily untilshe caught Henrietta's eye--like a cobra's."The refreshments was handed round peaceful enough, with the ladiespressing sardine sandwiches and chocolate cake and cups of coffee on toWilfred and asking him interesting questions about his adventurous lifein the open. And the plans was all made for his class in poetry to beheld at Henrietta's house, where the lady subscribers for a few weekscould come into contact with the higher realities of life, at eightdollars for the course, and Wilfred was beginning to cheer up again,though still subject to dismay when one of the husbands would glare inat him from the hall, and especially when Ben Sutton would look in withhis bulging and expressive eyes and kind of bark at him."Then Ben Sutton come and stood in the doorway till he caught Wilfred'seye and beckoned to him. Wilfred pretended not to notice the first time,but Ben beckoned a little harder, so Wilfred excused himself to the sixor eight ladies and went out. It seemed to me he first looked quickround him to make sure there wasn't any other way out. I was standing inthe hall when Ben led him tenderly into the grillroom with two fingers."'Here is our well-known poet and _bon vivant_,' says Ben to Alonzo, whohad followed 'em in. So Alonzo bristles up to Wilfred and glares at himand says: 'All joking aside, is that one of my new shirts you're wearingor is it not?'"Wilfred gasped a couple times and says: 'Why, as to that, you see, themadam insisted--'"Alonzo shut him off. 'How dare you drag a lady's name into a barroombrawl?' says he."'Don't shoot in here,' says Ben. 'You'd scare the ladies.'"Wilfred went pasty, indeed, thinking his host was going to gun him."'Oh, very well, I won't then,' says Alonzo. 'I guess I can be agentleman when necessary. But all joking aside, I want to ask him this:Does he consider poetry to be an accomplishment or a vice?'"'I was going to put something like that to him myself, only I couldn'tthink of it,' says Doc Martingale, edging up and looking quiterestrained and nervous in the arms. I was afraid of the doc. I wasafraid he was going to blemish Wilfred a couple of times right there."'An accomplishment or a vice? Answer yes or no!' orders the judge in ahard voice."The poet looks round at 'em and attempts to laugh merrily, but he onlydoes it from the teeth out."'Laugh on, my proud beauty!' says Ben Sutton. Then he turns to thebunch. 'What we really ought to do,' he says, 'we ought to make abeliever of him right here and now.'"Even then, mind you, the husbands would have lost their nerve if Benhadn't took the lead. Ben didn't have to live with their wives so whatcared he? Wilfred Lennox sort of shuffled his feet and smiled a smile ofpure anxiety. He knew some way that this was nothing to cheer about."'I got it,' says Jeff Tuttle with the air of a thinker. 'We're crampingthe poor cuss here. What he wants is the open road.'"'What he really wants,' says Alonzo, 'is about six bottles of my pure,sparkling beer, but maybe he'll take the open road if we show him a goodone.'"'He wants the open road--show him a good one!' yells the other husbandsin chorus. It was kind of like a song."'I had meant to be on my way,' says Wilfred very cold and lofty."'You're here to-day and there to-morrow,' says Ben; 'but how can you bethere to-morrow if you don't start from here now?--for the way is longand lonely.'"'I was about to start,' says Wilfred, getting in a couple of stepstoward the door."''Tis better so,' says Ben. 'This is no place for a county recorder'sson, and there's a bully road out here open at both ends.'"They made way for the poet, and a sickening silence reigned. Even thewomen gathered about the door of the other room was silent. They knewthe thing had got out of their hands. The men closed in after Wilfred ashe reached the steps. He there took his soft hat out from under his coatwhere he'd cached it. He went cautiously down the steps. Beryl Mae brokethe silence."'Oh, Mr. Price,' says she, catching Alonzo by the sleeve, 'do you thinkhe's really sincere?'"'He is at this moment,' says Alonzo. 'He's behaving as sincerely asever I saw a man behave.' And just then at the foot of the steps Wilfredmade a tactical error. He started to run. The husbands and Ben Suttongave the long yell and went in pursuit. Wilfred would have left them allif he hadn't run into the tennis net. He come down like a sack of meal."'There!' says Ben Sutton. 'Now he's done it--broke his neck orsomething. That's the way with some men--they'll try anything to get alaugh.'"They went and picked the poet up. He was all right, only dazed."'But that's one of the roads that ain't open,' says Ben. 'And besides,you was going right toward the nasty old railroad that runs into thecramped haunts of men. You must have got turned round. Here'--he pointedout over the golf links--'it's off that way that Mother Nature awaitsher wayward child. Miles and miles of her--all open. Doesn't your gypsysoul hear the call? This way for the hills and glens, thou star-eyedwoodling!' and he gently led Wilfred off over the links, the rest of themen trailing after and making some word racket, believe me. They was allgood conversationalists at the moment. Doc Martingale was wanting thepoet to run into the tennis net again, just for fun, and Jeff Tuttlesays make him climb a tree like the monkeys do in their native glades,but Ben says just keep him away from the railroad, that's all. GoodMother Nature will attend to the rest."The wives by now was huddled round the side of the clubhouse, tooscared to talk much, just muttering incoherently and wringing theirhands, and Beryl Mae pipes up and says: 'Oh, perhaps I wronged himafter all; perhaps deep down in his heart he was sincere.'"The moon had come up now and we could see the mob with its victimstarting off toward the Canadian Rockies. Then all at once they began torun, and I knew Wilfred had made another dash for liberty. Pretty soonthey scattered out and seemed to be beating up the shrubbery down by thecreek. And after a bit some of 'em straggled back. They paid noattention to us ladies, but made for the grillroom."'We lost him in that brush beyond the fifth hole,' says Alonzo. 'Noneof us is any match for him on level ground, but we got some goodtrackers and we're guarding the line to keep him headed off from therailroad and into his beloved hills.'"'We should hurry back with refreshment for the faithful watchers,' saysJudge Ballard. 'The fellow will surely try to double back to therailroad.'"'Got to keep him away from the cramped haunts of business men,' saysAlonzo brightly."'I wish Clay, my faithful old hound, were still alive,' says the judgewistfully."'Say, I got a peach of a terrier down to the house right now,' saysJeff Tuttle, 'but he's only trained for bear--I never tried him onpoets.'"'He might tree him at that,' says Doc Martingale."'Percy,' cries his wife, 'have you forgotten your manhood?'"'Yes,' says Percy."'Darling,' calls Henrietta, 'will you listen to reason a moment?'"'No,' says Alonzo."'It's that creature from Alaska leading them on,' says Mrs. JudgeBallard--'that overdressed drunken rowdy!'"Ben Sutton looked right hurt at this. He buttoned his coat over hischecked vest and says: 'I take that unkindly, madam--calling meoverdressed. I selected this suiting with great care. It ain't nice tocall me overdressed. I feel it deeply.'"But they was off again before one thing could lead to another, takingbottles of hard liquor they had uncorked. 'The open road! The openroad!' they yelled as they went."Well, that's about all. Some of the wives begun to straggle off home,mostly in tears, and some hung round till later. I was one of these, notwishing to miss anything of an absorbing character. Edgar Tomlinson wentearly, too. Edgar writes 'The Lounger in the Lobby' column for the_Recorder_, and he'd come out to report the entertainment; but at oneo'clock he said it was a case for the sporting editor and he'd try toget him out before the kill."At different times one or two of the hunters would straggle back formore drink. They said the quarry was making a long detour round theirleft flank, trying his darndest to get to the railroad, but they hadhopes. And they scattered out. Ever and anon you would hear the longhowl of some lone drunkard that had got lost from the pack."About sunup they all found themselves at the railroad track about amile beyond the clubhouse, just at the head of Stender's grade. Therethey was voting to picket the track for a mile each way when along comethe four-thirty-two way freight. It had slowed up some making the grade,and while they watched it what should dart out from a bunch of scrub oakbut the active figure of Wilfred Lennox. He made one of them ironladders all right and was on top of a car when the train come by, butnone of 'em dast jump it because it had picked up speed again."They said Wilfred stood up and shook both fists at 'em and called 'emevery name he could lay his tongue to--using language so coarse you'dnever think it could have come from a poet's lips. They could see hishandsome face working violently long after they couldn't hear him. Justmy luck! I'm always missing something."So they come grouching back to the clubhouse and I took 'em home tobreakfast. When we got down to the table old Judge Ballard says: 'Whatmight have been an evening of rare enjoyment was converted into adetestable failure by that cur. I saw from the very beginning that hewas determined to spoil our fun.'"'The joke is sure on us,' says Ben Sutton, 'but I bear him no grudge.In fact, I did him an injustice. I knew he wasn't a poet, but I didn'tbelieve he was even a hobo till he jumped that freight.'"Alonzo was out in the hall telephoning Henrietta. We could hear hischeerful voice: 'No, Pettikins, no! It doesn't ache a bit. What's that?Of course I still do! You are the only woman that ever meant anything tome. What? What's that? Oh, I may have errant fancies now and again, likethe best of men--you know yourself how sensitive I am to a certain typeof flowerlike beauty--but it never touches my deeper nature. Yes,certainly, I shall be right up the very minute good old Benleaves--to-morrow or next day. What's that? Now, now! Don't do that!Just the minute he leaves--G'--by.'"And the little brute hung up on her!"IIMA PETTENGILL AND THE SONG OF SONGSThe hammock between the two jack pines at the back of the Arrowheadranch house had lured me to mid--afternoon slumber. The day was hot andthe morning had been toilsome--four miles of trout stream, rocky,difficult miles. And my hostess, Mrs. Lysander John Pettengill, hadridden off after luncheon to some remote fastness of her domain, leavingme and the place somnolent.In the shadowed coolness, aching gratefully in many joints, I hadplunged into the hammock's Lethe, swooning shamelessly to a benignoblivion. Dreamless it must long have been, for the shadows of ranchhouse, stable, hay barn, corral, and bunk house were long to the eastwhen next I observed them. But I fought to this wakefulness through oneof those dreams of a monstrous futility that sometimes madden us fromsleep. Through a fearsome gorge a stream wound and in it I hunted onecertain giant trout. Savagely it took the fly, but always the line brokewhen I struck; rather, it dissolved; there would be no resistance. Andthe giant fish mocked me each time, jeered and flouted me, camebrazenly to the surface and derided me with antics weirdly human.Then, as I persisted, it surprisingly became a musical trout. Itwhistled, it played a guitar, it sang. How pathetic our mildly amazedacceptance of these miracles in dreams! I was only the more determinedto snare a fish that could whistle and sing simultaneously, andaccompany itself on a stringed instrument, and was six feet in length.It was that by now and ever growing. It seemed only an attractivenovelty and I still believed a brown hackle would suffice. But then Ibecame aware that this trout, to its stringed accompaniment, everwhistled and sang one song with a desperate intentness. That song was"The Rosary." The fish had presumed too far. "This," I shrewdly toldmyself, "is almost certainly a dream." The soundless words were magic.Gorge and stream vanished, the versatile fish faded to blue sky showingthrough the green needles of a jack pine. It was a sane world again andstill, I thought, with the shadows of ranch house, stable, hay barn,corral, and bunk house going long to the east. I stretched in thehammock, I tingled with a lazy well-being. The world was still; but wasit--quite?On a bench over by the corral gate crouched Buck Devine, doing somethingneedful to a saddle. And as he wrought he whistled. He whistled "TheRosary" shrilly and with much feeling. Nor was the world still but forthis. From the bunk house came the mellow throbbing of a stringedinstrument, the guitar of Sandy Sawtelle, star rider of the Arrowhead,temporarily withdrawn from a career of sprightly endeavour by a sprainedankle and solacing his retirement with music. He was playing "TheRosary"--very badly indeed, but one knew only too well what he meant.The two performers were distant enough to be no affront to each other.The hammock, less happily, was midway between them.I sat up with groans. I hated to leave the hammock."The trout also sang it," I reminded myself. Followed the voice, a voicefrom the stable, the cracked, whining tenor of a very aged vassal of theArrowhead, one Jimmie Time. Jimmie, I gathered, was currying a horse ashe sang, for each bar of the ballad was measured by the double thud of acurrycomb against the side of a stall. Whistle, guitar, and voice nowattacked the thing in differing keys and at varying points. Jimmie mightbe said to prevail. There was a fatuous tenderness in his attack and thethudding currycomb gave it spirit. Nor did he slur any of the affectingwords; they clave the air with an unctuous precision:    The ow-wurs I spu-hend with thu-hee, dee-yur heart,          (The currycomb: Thud, thud!)    Are as a stru-hing of pur-rulls tuh me-e-e,          (The currycomb: Thud, thud!)Came a dramatic and equally soulful interpolation: "Whoa, dang you! Youwould, would you? Whoa-a-a, now!"Again the melody:    I count them o-vurr, ev-ry one apar-rut,    (Thud, thud!)    My ro-sah-ree--my ro-sah-ree!    (Thud, thud!)Buck Devine still mouthed his woful whistle and Sandy Sawtelle valiantlystrove for the true and just accord of his six strings. It was no placefor a passive soul. I parted swiftly from the hammock and made over thesun-scorched turf for the ranch house. There was shelter and surcease;doors and windows might be closed. The unctuous whine of Jimmie Timepursued me:    Each ow-wur a pur-rull, each pur-rull a prayer,    (Thud, thud!)    Tuh stu-hill a heart in absence wru-hung,    (Thud, thud!)As I reached the hospitable door of the living-room I observed Lew Wee,Chinese chef of the Arrowhead, engaged in cranking one of those deviceswith a musical intention which I have somewhere seen advertised. It isan important-looking device in a polished mahogany case, and I recall inthe advertisement I saw it was surrounded by a numerousenthralled-looking family in a costly drawing-room, while the ghost ofBeethoven simpered above it in ineffable benignancy. Something now toldme the worst, even as Lew Wee adjusted the needle to the revolving disk.I waited for no more than the opening orchestral strains. It is aleisurely rhythmed cacophony, and I had time to be almost beyond rangeere the voice took up a tale I was hearing too often in one day. Even soI distantly perceived it to be a fruity contralto voice with an expertsob.A hundred yards in front of the ranch house all was holy peace, peace inthe stilled air, peace dreaming along the neighbouring hills and lyinglike a benediction over the wide river-flat below me, through which thestream wove a shining course. I exulted in it, from the dangers passed.Then appeared Mrs. Lysander John Pettengill from the fringe ofcottonwoods, jolting a tired horse toward me over the flat."Come have some tea," she cordially boomed as she passed. I returneduncertainly. Tea? Yes. But--However, the door would be shut and theAsiatic probably diverted.As I came again to the rear of the ranch house Mrs. Pettengill, in khakiriding breeches, flannel shirt, and the hat of her trade, toweredbulkily as an admirable figure of wrath, one hand on her hip, onepoising a quirt viciously aloft. By the corral gate Buck Devine droopedcravenly above his damaged saddle; at the door of the bunk house SandySawtelle tottered precariously on one foot, his guitar under his arm, alook of guilty horror on his set face. By the stable door stood theincredibly withered Jimmie Time, shrinking a vast dismay."You hear me!" exploded the infuriated chatelaine, and I knew she wasrepeating the phrase."Ain't I got to mend this latigo?" protested Buck Devine piteously."You'll go up the gulch and beyond the dry fork and mend it, if youwhistle that tune again!"Sandy Sawtelle rumpled his pink hair to further disorder and found a fewweak words for his conscious guilt."Now, I wasn't aiming to harm anybody, what with with my game laig andshet up here like I am--""Well, my Lord! Can't you play a sensible tune then?"Jimmie Time hereupon behaved craftily. He lifted his head, showing theface of a boy who had somehow got to be seventy years old without evergetting to be more than a boy, and began to whistle softly andinnocently--an air of which hardly anything could be definitely saidexcept that it was not "The Rosary." It was very flagrantly not "TheRosary." His craft availed him not."Yes, and you, too!" thundered the lady. "You was the worst--you wassinging. Didn't I hear you? How many times I got to tell you? Firstthing you know, you little reprobate--"Jimmie Time cowered again. Visibly he took on unbelievable years."Yes, ma'am," he whispered."Yes, ma'am," meekly echoed the tottering instrumentalist."Yes, ma'am," muttered Buck Devine, "not knowing you was anywheresnear--""Makes no difference where I be--you hear me!"Although her back was toward me I felt her glare. The wretches winced.She came a dozen steps toward me, then turned swiftly to glare again.They shuddered, even though she spoke no word. Then she came on,muttering hotly, and together we approached the ranch house. A dozenfeet from the door she bounded ahead of me with a cry of baffled rage. Isaw why. Lew Wee, unrecking her approach, was cold-bloodedly committingan encore. She sped through the doorway, and I heard Lew Wee'sfrightened squeal as he sped through another. When I stood in the roomshe was putting violent hands to the throat of the thing."The hours I spend with th--" The throttled note expired in a verydreadful squawk of agony. It was as if foul murder had been done, anddone swiftly. The maddened woman faced me with the potentially evil diskclutched in her hands. In a voice that is a notable loss to our revivalsof Greek tragedy she declaimed:"Ain't it the limit?--and the last thing I done was to hide out thatrecord up behind the clock where he couldn't find it!"In a sudden new alarm and with three long steps she reached the door ofthe kitchen and flung it open. Through a window thus exposed we beheldthe offender. One so seldom thinks of the Chinese as athletes! Lew Weewas well down the flat toward the cottonwoods and still going strong."Ain't it the limit?" again demanded his employer. "Gosh all--excuse me,but they got me into such a state. Here I am panting like a tuckeredhound. And now I got to make the tea myself. He won't dare come backbefore suppertime."It seemed to be not yet an occasion for words from me. I tried for alook of intelligent sympathy. In the kitchen I heard her noisily fill ateakettle with water. She was not herself yet. She still muttered hotly.I moved to the magazine--littered table and affected to be taken withthe portrait of a smug--looking prize Holstein on the first page of the_Stock Breeder's Gazette_.The volcano presently seethed through the room and entered its ownapartment.Ten minutes later my hostess emerged with recovered aplomb. She haddonned a skirt and a flowered blouse, and dusted powder upon and abouther sunburned and rather blobby nose. Her crinkly gray hair had beendrawn to a knot at the back of her grenadier's head. Her widely set eyesgleamed with the smile of her broad and competent mouth."Tea in one minute," she promised more than audibly as she bustled intothe kitchen. It really came in five, and beside the tray she pleasantlyrelaxed. The cups were filled and a breach was made upon the cake shehad brought. The tea was advertising a sufficient strength, yet she nowraised the dynamics of her own portion."I'll just spill a hooker of this here Scotch into mine," she said, andthen, as she did even so: "My lands! Ain't I the cynical old Kate! Andsilly! Letting them boys upset me that way with that there fool song."She decanted a saucerful of the re-enforced tea and raised it to herpursed lips. "Looking at you!" she murmured cavernously and drank deep.She put the saucer back where nice persons leave theirs at all times."Say, it was hot over on that bench to-day. I was getting out that bunchof bull calves, and all the time here was old Safety First mumblinground--"This was rather promising, but I had resolved differently."That song," I insinuated. "Of course there are people--""You bet there are! I'm one of 'em, too! What that song's done tome--and to other innocent bystanders in the last couple weeks--"She sighed hugely, drank more of the fortified brew--nicely from the cupthis time--and fashioned a cigarette from materials at her hand.In the flame of a lighted match Mrs. Pettengill's eyes sparkled with akind of savage retrospection. She shrugged it off impatiently."I guess you thought I spoke a mite short when you asked about Nettie'swedding yesterday."It was true. She had turned the friendly inquiry with a rathermystifying abruptness. I murmured politely. She blew twin jets of smokefrom the widely separated corners of her generous mouth and thenshrewdly narrowed her gaze to some distant point of narration."Yes, sir, I says to her, 'Woman's place is the home.' And what youthink she come back with? That she was going to be a leader of the NewDawn. Yes, sir, just like that. Five feet one, a hundred and eightpounds in her winter clothes, a confirmed pickle eater--pretty enough,even if she is kind of peaked and spiritual looking--and going to leadthe New Dawn."Where'd she catch it? My fault, of course, sending her back East toschool and letting her visit the W.B. Hemingways, Mrs. H. being thewell-known clubwoman like the newspapers always print under her photo inevening dress. That's how she caught it all right."I hadn't realized it when she first got back, except she was pale andfar-away in the eyes and et pickles heavily at every meal--oh, mustard,dill, sour, sweet, anything that was pickles--and not enough meat andregular victuals. Gaunted she was, but I didn't suspect her mind wascontaminated none till I sprung Chester Timmins on her as a goodmarrying bet. You know Chet, son of old Dave that has the Lazy EightRanch over on Pipe Stone--a good, clean boy that'll have the ranch tohimself as soon as old Dave dies of meanness, and that can't be longnow. It was then she come out delirious about not being the pampered toyof any male--_male_, mind you! It seems when these hussies want to knockman nowadays they call him a male. And she rippled on about the freedomof her soul and her downtrod sisters and this here New Dawn."Well, sir, a baby could have pushed me flat with one finger. At first Ididn' know no better'n to argue with her, I was that affrighted. 'Why,Nettie Hosford,' I says, 'to think I've lived to hear my only sister'sonly child talking in shrieks like that! To think I should have to tellone of my own kin that women's place is the home. Look at me,' Isays--we was down in Red Gap at the time--'pretty soon I'll go up to theranch and what'll I do there?" I says."'Well, listen,' I says, 'to a few of the things I'll be doing: I'll bemarking, branding, and vaccinating the calves, I'll be classing andturning out the strong cattle on the range. I'll be having the coltsrid, breaking mules for haying, oiling and mending the team harness,cutting and hauling posts, tattooing the ears and registering thethoroughbred calves, putting in dams, cleaning ditches, irrigating theflats, setting out the vegetable garden, building fence, swinging newgates, overhauling the haying tools, receiving, marking, and brandingthe new two--year--old bulls, plowing and seeding grain for our workstock and hogs, breaking in new cooks and blacksmiths'--I was so mad Iwent on till I was winded. 'And that ain't half of it,' I says. 'Women'swork is never done; her place is in the home and she finds so much to doright there that she ain't getting any time to lead a New Dawn. I'llstart you easy,' I says; 'learn you to bake a batch of bread or do a tubof washing--something simple--and there's Chet Timmins, waiting to giveyou a glorious future as wife and mother and helpmeet.'"She just give me one look as cold as all arctics and says, 'It'srepellent'--that's all, just 'repellent.' I see I was up against it. Nogood talking. Sometimes it comes over me like a flash when not to talk.It does to some women. So I affected a light manner and pretended tolaugh it off, just as if I didn't see scandal threatening--think ofhaving it talked about that a niece of my own raising was a leader ofthe New Dawn!"'All right,' I says, 'only, of course, Chet Timmins is a good friendand neighbour of mine, even if he is a male, so I hope you won't mindhis dropping in now and again from time to time, just to say howdy andeat a meal.' And she flusters me again with her coolness."'No,' she says, 'I won't mind, but I know what you're counting on, andit won't do either of you any good. I'm above the appeal of a man's merepresence,' she says, 'for I've thrown off the age--long subjection; butI won't mind his coming. I shall delight to study him. They're allalike, and one specimen is as good as another for that. But neither ofyou need expect anything,' she says, 'for the wrongs of my sisters havearmoured me against the grossness of mere sex appeal.' Excuse me forgetting off such things, but I'm telling you how she talked."'Oh, shucks!' I says to myself profanely, for all at once I saw shewasn't talking her own real thoughts but stuff she'd picked up from thewell-known lady friends of Mrs. W.B. Hemingway. I was mad all right; butthe minute I get plumb sure mad I get wily. 'I was just trying you out,'I says. 'Of course you are right!' 'Of course I am,' says she, 'though Ihardly expected you to see it, you being so hardened a product of theancient ideal of slave marriage.'"At them words it was pretty hard for me to keep on being wily, but Ikept all right. I kept beautifully. I just laughed and said we'd haveChet Timmins up for supper, and she laughed and said it would beamusing."And it was, or it would have been if it hadn't been so sad anddisgusting. Chet, you see, had plumb crumpled the first time he ever seteyes on her, and he's never been able to uncrumple. He always choked upthe minute she'd come into the room, and that night he choked worse'never because the little devil started in to lead him on--aiming to showme how she could study a male, I reckon. He couldn't even ask for somemore of the creamed potatoes without choking up--with her all the timeusing her eyes on him, and telling him how a great rough man like himscared 'poor little me.' Chet's tan bleaches out a mite by the end ofwinter, but she kept his face exactly the shade of that new mahoganysideboard I got, and she told him several times that he ought to go seea throat specialist right off about that choking of his."And after supper I'm darned if she didn't lure him out onto the porchin the moonlight, and stand there sad looking and helpless, simplyegging him on, mind you, her in one of them little squashy white dressesthat she managed to brush against him--all in the way of cold study,mind you. Say, ain't we the lovely tame rattlesnakes when we want to be!And this big husky lummox of a Chester Timmins--him she'd called amale--what does he do but stand safely at a distance of four feet in thegrand romantic light of the full moon, and tell her vivaciously allabout the new saddle he's having made in Spokane. And even then he notonly chokes but he giggles. They do say a strong man in tears is aterrible sight. But a husky man giggling is worse--take it from one whohas suffered. And all the time I knew his heart was furnishing enoughactual power to run a feed chopper. So did she!"'The creature is so typical,' she says when the poor cuss had finallystumbled down the front steps. 'He's a real type.' Only she called it'teep,' having studied the French language among other things. 'He is ateep indeed!' she says."I had to admit myself that Chester wasn't any self-starter. I saw he'dhave to be cranked by an outsider if he was going to win a place of hisown in the New Dawn. And I kept thinking wily, and the next P.M. whenNettie and I was downtown I got my hunch. You know that music store onFourth Street across from the Boston Cash Emporium. It's kept by C.Wilbur Todd, and out in front in a glass case he had a mechanical banjothat was playing 'The Rosary' with variations when we come by. Westopped a minute to watch the machinery picking the strings and in aflash I says to myself, 'I got it! Eureka, California!' I says, 'it'scome to me!'"Of course that piece don't sound so awful tender when it's done on abanjo with variations, but I'd heard it done right and swell one timeand so I says, 'There's the song of songs to bring foolish males andfemales to their just mating sense.'"The speaker paused to drain her cup and to fashion another cigarette,her eyes dreaming upon far vistas."Ain't it fierce what music does to persons," she resumed. "Right off Iremembered the first time I'd heard that piece--in New York City fouryears ago, in a restaurant after the theatre one night, where I'd gonewith Mrs. W.B. Hemingway and her husband. A grand, gay place it was,with an orchestra. I picked at some untimely food and sipped ahighball--they wouldn't let a lady smoke there--and what interested mewas the folks that come in. Folks always do interest me somethingamazing. Strange ones like that, I mean, where you set and try tofigure out all about 'em, what kind of homes they got, and how they actwhen they ain't in a swell restaurant, and everything. Pretty soon comesa couple to the table next us and, say, they was just plain Mr. and Mrs.Mad. Both of 'em stall-fed. He was a large, shiny lad, with pink jowlsbarbered to death and wicked looking, like a well-known clubman orvillain. The lady was spectacular and cynical, with a cold, thin noseand eyes like a couple of glass marbles. Her hair was several shades offa legal yellow and she was dressed! She would have made handsome loot,believe me--aigrette, bracelets, rings, dog collar, gold-mesh bag,vanity case--Oh, you could see at a glance that she was one of themBroadway social favourites you read about. And both grouchy, like Isaid. He scowled till you knew he'd just love to beat a crippledstep-child to death, and she--well, her work wasn't so coarse; she kepther mad down better. She set there as nice and sweet as a pet scorpion."'A scrap,' I says to myself, 'and they've only half finished. She'sthreatened to quit and he, the cowardly dog, has dared her to.' Plainenough. The waiter knew it soon as I did when he come to take theirorder. Wouldn't speak to each other. Talked through him; fought it outto something different for each one. Couldn't even agree on the samekind of cocktail. Both slamming the waiter--before they fought the orderto a finish each had wanted to call the head waiter, only the other onestopped it."So I rubbered awhile, trying to figure out why such folks want tofinish up their fights in a restaurant, and then I forgot 'em, lookingat some other persons that come in. Then the orchestra started this songand I seen a lady was getting up in front to sing it. I admit the piecegot me. It got me good. Really, ain't it the gooey mess of heart-throbswhen you come right down to it? This lady singer was a good-lookingsad-faced contralto in a low-cut black dress--and how she did get thetears out of them low notes! Oh, I quit looking at people while herchest was oozing out that music. And it got others, too. I noticed lotsof 'em had stopped eating when I looked round, and there was so muchclapping she had to get up and do it all over again. And what you think?In the middle of the second time I look over to these fighters, anddarned if they ain't holding hands across the table; and more, she's gota kind of pitiful, crying smile on and he's crying right out--cryinginto his cold asparagus, plain as day."What more would you want to know about the powers of this here piece ofmusic? They both spoke like human beings to the scared waiter when hecome back, and the lad left a five-spot on the tray when he paid hischeck. Some song, yes?"And all this flashed back on me when Nettie and I stood there watchingthis cute little banjo. So I says to myself, 'Here, my morbid vestal,is where I put you sane; here's where I hurl an asphyxiating bomb intothe trenches of the New Dawn.' Out loud I only says, 'Let's go in andsee if Wilbur has got some new records.'"'Wilbur?' says she, and we went in. Nettie had not met Wilbur."I may as well tell you here and now that C. Wilbur Todd is a shrimp.Shrimp I have said and shrimp I always will say. He talks real brightlyin his way--he will speak words like an actor or something--but forbrains! Say, he always reminds me of the dumb friend of the greatdetective in the magazine stories, the one that goes along to the sceneof the crime to ask silly questions and make fool guesses about theguilty one, and never even suspects who done the murder, till thedetective tells on the last page when they're all together in thelibrary."Sure, that's Wilbur. It would be an ideal position for him. Instead ofwhich he runs this here music store, sells these jitney pianos andphonographs and truck like that. And serious! Honestly, if you seen himcoming down the street you'd say, 'There comes one of these heremusicians.' Wears long hair and a low collar and a flowing necktie andtalks about his technique. Yes, sir, about the technique of working amachinery piano. Gives free recitals in the store every second Saturdayafternoon, and to see him set down and pump with his feet, and pushlevers and pull handles, weaving himself back and forth, tossing hislong, silken locks back and looking dreamily off into the distance,you'd think he was a Paderewski. As a matter of fact, I've seenPaderewski play and he don't make a tenth of the fuss Wilbur does. Andafter this recital I was at one Saturday he comes up to some of usladies, mopping his pale brow, and he says, 'It does take it out of one!I'm always a nervous wreck after these little affairs of mine.' Wouldthat get you, or would it not?"So we go in the store and Wilbur looks up from a table he's setting atin the back end."'You find me studying some new manuscripts,' he says, pushing back theraven locks from his brow. Say, it was a weary gesture he done itwith--sort of languid and world-weary. And what you reckon he meant bystudying manuscripts? Why, he had one of these rolls of paper with themusic punched into it in holes, and he was studying that line that tellsyou when to play hard or soft and all like that. Honest, that was it!"'I always study these manuscripts of the masters conscientiously beforeI play them,' says he."Such is Wilbur. Such he will ever be. So I introduced him to Nettie andasked if he had this here song on a phonograph record. He had. He had iton two records. 'One by a barytone gentleman, and one by amezzo-soprano,' says Wilbur. I set myself back for both. He also had itwith variations on one of these punched rolls. He played that for us. Ittook him three minutes to get set right at the piano and to dust hisfingers with a white silk handkerchief which he wore up his sleeve. Andhe played with great expression and agony and bending exercises, everand anon tossing back his rebellious locks and fixing us with a look ofpained ecstasy. Of course it sounded better than the banjo, but you gotto have the voice with that song if you're meaning to do any crookedwork. Nettie was much taken with it even so, and Wilbur played itanother way. What he said was that it was another school ofinterpretation. It seemed to have its points with him, though hefavoured the first school, he said, because of a certain almost ruggedfidelity. He said the other school was marked by a tendency to idealism,and he pulled some of the handles to show how it was done. I'm merelytelling you how Wilbur talked."Nettie listened very serious. There was a new look in her eyes. 'Thatsong has got to her even on a machinery piano,' I says, 'but wait tillwe get the voice, with she and Chester out in the mischievousmoonlight.' Wasn't I the wily old hound! Nettie sort of lingered to hearWilbur, who was going good by this time. 'One must be the soul behindthe wood and wire,' he says; 'one rather feels just that, or one remainsmerely a brutal mechanic.'"'I understand,' says Nettie. 'How you must have studied!'"'Oh, studied!' says Wilbur, and tossed his mane back and laughed in alofty and suffering manner. Studied! He'd gone one year to a businesscollege in Seattle after he got out of high school!"'I understand,' says Nettie, looking all reverent and buffaloed."'It is the price one must pay for technique,' says Wilbur. 'And to-dayyou found me in the mood. I am not always in the mood.'"'I understand,' says Nettie."I'm just giving you an idea, understand. Then Wilbur says, 'I willbring these records up this evening if I may. The mezzo-soprano requiresa radically different adjustment from the barytone.' 'My God!' thinks I,'has he got technique on the phonograph, too!' But I says he must comeby all means, thinking he could tend the machine while Nettie andChester is out on the porch getting wise to each other."'There's another teep for you,' I says to Nettie when we got out of theplace. 'He certainly is marked by tendencies,' I says. I meant it for anasty slam at Wilbur's painful deficiencies as a human being, but shetook it as serious as Wilbur took himself--which is some!"'Ah, yes, the artist teep,' says she,'the most complex, the mostbaffling of all.'"That was a kind of a sickish jolt to me--the idea that something as lowin the animal kingdom as Wilbur could baffle anyone--but I thinks,'Shucks! Wait till he lines up alongside of a regular human man likeChet Timmins!'"I had Chet up to supper again. He still choked on words of onesyllable if Nettie so much as glanced at him, and turned all sorts ofpainful colours like a cheap rug. But I keep thinking the piece will fixthat all right."At eight o'clock Wilbur sifted in with his records and something elseflat and thin, done up in paper that I didn't notice much at the time.My dear heart, how serious he was! As serious as--well, I chanced to bepresent at the house of mourning when the barber come to shave old JudgeArmstead after he'd passed away--you know what I mean--kind of like himWilbur was, talking subdued and cat-footing round very solemn andprofessional. I thought he'd never get that machine going. He cleanedit, and he oiled it, and he had great trouble picking out the rightfibre needle, holding six or eight of 'em up to the light, doing secretthings to the machine's inwards, looking at us sharp as if we oughtn'tto be talking even then, and when she did move off I'm darned if hedidn't hang in a strained manner over that box, like he was the one thatwas doing it all and it wouldn't get the notes right if he took hisattention off."It was a first-class record, I'll say that. It was the malebarytone--one of them pleading voices that get all into you. It wasn'thalf over before I seen Nettie was strongly moved, as they say, only shewas staring at Wilbur, who by now was leading the orchestra with onegraceful arm and looking absorbed and sodden, like he done itunconsciously. Chester just set there with his mouth open, likesomething you see at one of these here aquariums."We moved round some when it was over, while Wilbur was picking out justthe right needle for the other record, and so I managed to cut that lumpof a Chester out of the bunch and hold him on the porch till I gotNettie out, too. Then I said 'Sh-h-h!' so they wouldn't move when Wilburlet the mezzo-soprano start. And they had to stay out there in thegolden moonlight with love's young dream and everything. The lady singerwas good, too. No use in talking, that song must have done a lot ofheart work right among our very best families. It had me going again soI plumb forgot my couple outside. I even forgot Wilbur, standing by thebox showing the lady how to sing."It come to the last--you know how it ends--'To kiss the cross,sweetheart, to kiss the cross!' There was a rich and silent moment and Isays, 'If that Chet Timmins hasn't shown himself to be a regular maleteep by this time--' And here come Chet's voice, choking as usual, 'Yes,paw switched to Durhams and Herefords over ten years ago--you seeHolsteins was too light; they don't carry the meat--' Honest! I'mtelling you what I heard. And yet when they come in I could see thatChester had had tears in his eyes from that song, so still I didn't givein, especially as Nettie herself looked very exalted, like she wasn't atthat minute giving two whoops in the bad place for the New Dawn.[Illustration: "CHESTER JUST SET THERE WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN, LIKESOMETHING YOU SEE AT ONE OF THESE HERE AQUARIUMS"]"Nettie made for Wilbur, who was pushing back his hair with a weak butgraceful sweep of the arm--it had got down before his face like aportiere--and I took Chet into a corner and tried to get some of thejust wrath of God into his heart; but, my lands! You'd have said hedidn't know there was such a thing as a girl in the whole KulancheValley. He didn't seem to hear me. He talked other matters."'Paw thinks,' he says, 'that he might manage to take them hundred andfifty bull calves off your hands.' 'Oh, indeed!' I says. 'And does hethink of buying 'em--as is often done in the cattle business--or is hemerely aiming to do me a favour?' I was that mad at the poor worm, buthe never knew. 'Why, now, paw says "You tell Maw Pettengill I might bewilling to take 'em off her hands at fifty dollars a head,"' he says. 'Ishould think he might be,' I says, 'but they ain't bothering my handsthe least little mite. I like to have 'em on my hands at anything lessthan sixty a head,' I says. 'Your pa,' I went on, 'is the man thatstarted this here safety-first cry. Others may claim the honour, but itbelongs solely to him.' 'He never said anything about that,' says poorChester. 'He just said you was going to be short of range this summer.''Be that all too true, as it may be,' I says, 'but I still got mybusiness faculties--' And I was going on some more, but just then I seenNettie and Wilbur was awful thick over something he'd unwrapped from theother package he'd brought. It was neither more nor less than a bigphoto of C. Wilbur Todd. Yes, sir, he'd brought her one."'I think the artist has caught a bit of the real just there, if youknow what I mean,' says Wilbur, laying a pale thumb across the upperpart of the horrible thing."'I understand,' says Nettie, 'the real you was expressing itself.'"'Perhaps,' concedes Wilbur kind of nobly. 'I dare say he caught me inone of my rarer moods. You don't think it too idealized?'"'Don't jest,' says she, very pretty and severe. And they both gazedspellbound."'Chester,' I says in low but venomous tones, 'you been hanging roundthat girl worse than Grant hung round Richmond, but you got to rememberthat Grant was more than a hanger. He made moves, Chester, moves! Do youget me?'"'About them calves,' says Chester, 'pa told me it's his honestopinion--'"Well, that was enough for once. I busted up that party sudden and firm."'It has meant much to me,' says Wilbur at parting."'I understand,' says Nettie."'When you come up to the ranch, Miss Nettie,' says Chester, 'you wantto ride over to the Lazy Eight, and see that there tame coyote I got. Itlicks your hand like a dog.'"But what could I do, more than what I had done? Nettie was looking atthe photograph when I shut the door on 'em. 'The soul behind the woodand wire,' she murmurs. I looked closer then and what do you reckon itwas? Just as true as I set here, it was Wilbur, leaning forward allnegligent and patronizing on a twelve-hundred-dollar grand piano, hishair well forward and his eyes masterful, like that there nobleinstrument was his bond slave. But wait! And underneath he'd writ a barof music with notes running up and down, and signed his name to it--notplain, mind you, though he can write a good business hand if he wantsto, but all scrawly like some one important, so you couldn't tell if itwas meant for Dutch or English. Could you beat that for nerve--in a day,in a million years?"'What's Wilbur writing that kind of music for?' I asks in a cold voice.'He don't know that kind. What he had ought to of written is a bunch ofthem hollow slats and squares like they punch in the only kind of musiche plays,' I says."'Hush!' says Nettie. 'It's that last divine phrase, "To kiss thecross!"'"I choked up myself then. And I went to bed and thought. And this iswhat I thought: When you think you got the winning hand, keep onraising. To call is to admit you got no faith in your judgment. Betterlay down than call. So I resolve not to say another word to the girlabout Chester, but simply to press the song in on her. Already it hadmade her act like a human person. Of course I didn't worry none aboutWilbur. The wisdom of the ages couldn't have done that. But I seen I hadgot to have a real first-class human voice in that song, like the one Ihad heard in New York City. They'll just have to clench, I think, whenthey hear a good A-number-one voice in it."Next day I look in on Wilbur and say, 'What about this concert andmusical entertainment the North Side set is talking about giving for thestarving Belgians?'"'The plans are maturing,' he says, 'but I'm getting up a Brahmsconcerto that I have promised to play--you know how terrificallydifficult Brahms is--so the date hasn't been set yet.'"'Well, set it and let's get to work,' I says. 'There'll be you, and theNorth Side Ladies' String Quartet, and Ed Bughalter with a bass solo,and Mrs. Dr. Percy Hailey Martingale with the "Jewel Song" from Faust,and I been thinking,' I says, 'that we had ought to get a goodprofessional lady concert singer down from Spokane.'"'I'm afraid the expenses would go over our receipts,' says Wilbur, andI can see him figuring that this concert will cost the Belgians moneyinstead of helping 'em; so right off I says, 'If you can get agood-looking, sad-faced contralto, with a low-cut black dress, that cansing "The Rosary" like it had ought to be sung, why, you can touch mefor that part of the evening's entertainment.'"Wilbur says I'm too good, not suspicioning I'm just being wily, so hesays he'll write up and fix it. And a couple days later he says the ladyprofessional is engaged, and it'll cost me fifty, and he shows me herpicture and the dress is all right, and she had a sad, powerful face,and the date is set and everything."Meantime, I keep them two records het up for the benefit of myreluctant couple: daytime for Nettie--she standing dreamy-eyed while itwas doing, showing she was coming more and more human, understand--andevenings for both of 'em, when Chester Timmins would call. And Chethimself about the third night begins to get a new look in his eyes, kindof absent and desperate, so I thinks this here lady professional willsimply goad him to a frenzy. Oh, we had some sad musical week beforethat concert! That was when this crazy Chink of mine got took by thesong. He don't know yet what it means, but it took him all right; he gotregular besotted with it, keeping the kitchen door open all the time, sohe wouldn't miss a single turn. It took his mind off his work, too. Talkabout the Yellow Peril! He got so locoed with that song one day, whatdoes he do but peel and cook up twelve dollars' worth of the PiedmontQueen dahlia bulbs I'd ordered for the front yard. Sure! Served 'em withcream sauce, and we et 'em, thinking they was some kind of a Chinesevegetable."But I was saying about this new look in Chester's eyes, kind of far-offand criminal, when that song was playing. And then something give me apause, as they say. Chet showed up one evening with his nails allmanicured; yes, sir, polished till you needed smoked glasses to look at'em. I knew all right where he'd been. I may as well tell you that HenryLehman was giving Red Gap a flash of form with his new barbershop--tiled floor, plate-glass front, exposed plumbing, and a manicuregirl from Seattle; yes, sir, just like in the great wicked cities. Ithad already turned some of our very best homes into domestic hells, andno wonder! Decent, God-fearing men, who'd led regular lives and hadwhiskers and grown children, setting down to a little spindle-leggedtable with this creature, dipping their clumsy old hands into a pinksaucedish of suds and then going brazenly back to their innocentfamilies with their nails glittering like piano keys. Oh, that youngdame was bound to be a social pet among the ladies of the town, yes--no?She was pretty and neat figured, with very careful hair, though itscolour had been tampered with unsuccessfully, and she wore little,blue-striped shirtwaists that fitted very close--you know--with lowcollars. It was said that she was a good conversationalist and wouldtalk in low, eager tones to them whose fingers she tooled."Still, I didn't think anything of Chester resorting to that sanitaryden of vice. All I think is that he's trying to pretty himself up forNettie and maybe show her he can be a man-about-town, like them she hasknown in Spokane and in Yonkers, New York, at the select home of Mrs.W.B. Hemingway and her husband. How little we think when we had oughtto be thinking our darndest! Me? I just went on playing them tworecords, the male barytone and the lady mezzo, and trying to curse thatChinaman into keeping the kitchen door shut on his cooking, with Wilburdropping in now and then so him and Nettie could look at his photo,which was propped up against a book on the centre table--one of themlarge three-dollar books that you get stuck with by an agent and neverread--and Nettie dropping into his store now and then to hear himpractise over difficult bits from his piece that he was going to renderat the musical entertainment for the Belgians, with him asking her ifshe thought he shaded the staccato passage a mite too heavy, or someguff like that."So here come the concert, with every seat sold and the hall drapedpretty with flags and cut flowers. Some of the boys was down from theranch, and you bet I made 'em all come across for tickets, and oldSafety First--Chet's father--I stuck him for a dollar one, though he hadan evil look in his eyes. That's how the boys got so crazy about thishere song. They brought that record back with 'em. And Buck Devine, thatI met on the street that very day of the concert, he give me anotherkind of a little jolt. He'd been gossiping round town, the vicious waymen do, and he says to me:"'That Chester lad is taking awful chances for a man that needs his twohands at his work. Of course if he was a foot-racer or something likethat, where he didn't need hands--' 'What's all this?' I asks. 'Why,'says Buck, 'he's had his nails rasped down to the quick till he almostscreams if they touch anything, and he goes back for more every singleday. It's a wonder they ain't mortified on him already; and say, itcosts him six bits a throw and, of course, he don't take no change froma dollar--he leaves the extra two bits for a tip. Gee! A dollar a dayfor keeping your nails tuned up--and I ain't sure he don't have 'em donetwice on Sundays. Mine ain't never had a file teched to 'em yet,' hesays. 'I see that,' I says. 'If any foul-minded person ever accuses youof it, you got abundant proofs of your innocence right there with you.As for Chester,' I says, 'he has an object.' 'He has,' says Buck. 'Notwhat you think,' I says. 'Very different from that. It's true,' Iconcedes, 'that he ought to take that money and go to some goodosteopath and have his head treated, but he's all right at that. Don'tyou set up nights worrying about it.' And I sent Buck slinking offshamefaced but unconvinced, I could see. But I wasn't a bit scared."Chet et supper with us the night of the concert and took Nettie and Ito the hall, and you bet I wedged them two close in next each other whenwe got to our seats. This was my star play. If they didn't fall for eachother now--Shucks! They had to. And I noticed they was more confidentialalready, with Nettie looking at him sometimes almost respectfully."Well, the concert went fine, with the hired lady professional singergiving us some operatic gems in various foreign languages in the firstpart, and Ed Bughalter singing "A King of the Desert Am I, Ha, Ha!" verybass--Ed always sounds to me like moving heavy furniture round thatain't got any casters under it--and Mrs. Dr. Percy Hailey Martingalewith the "Jewel Song" from Faust, that she learned in a musicalconservatory at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and "Coming Through the Rye"for an encore--holding the music rolled up in her hands, though the Lordknows she knew every word and note of it by heart--and the North SideLadies' String Quartet, and Wilbur Todd, of course, putting on more airsthan as if he was the only son of old man Piano himself, while heshifted the gears and pumped, and Nettie whispering that he always slepttwo hours before performing in public and took no nourishment but onecup of warm milk--just a bundle of nerves that way--and she sent him upa bunch of lilies tied with lavender ribbon while he was bowing andscraping, but I didn't pay no attention to that, for now it was coming."Yes, sir, the last thing was this here lady professional, getting upstern and kind of sweetish sad in her low-cut black dress to sing thesong of songs. I was awful excited for a party of my age, and I see theywas, too. Nettie nudged Chet and whispered, 'Don't you just love it?'And Chet actually says, 'I love it,' so no wonder I felt sure, when upto that time he'd hardly been able to say a word except about his pabeing willing to take them calves for almost nothing. Then I seen hiseyes glaze and point off across the hall, and darned if there wasn'tthis manicure party in a cheek little hat and tailored gown, settingwith Mrs. Henry Lehman and her husband. But still I felt all right,because him and Nettie was nudging each other intimately again whenProfessor Gluckstein started in on the accompaniment--I bet Wilburthinks the prof is awful old-fashioned, playing with his fingers thatway; I know they don't speak on the street."So this lady just floated into that piece with all the heart stopspulled out, and after one line I didn't begrudge her a cent of my fifty.I just set there and thrilled. I could feel Nettie and Chet thrilling,too, and I says, 'There's nothing to it--not from now on.'"The applause didn't bust loose till almost a minute after she'd kissedthe cross in that rich brown voice of hers, and even then my coupledidn't join in. Nettie set still, all frozen and star-eyed, and Chesterwas choking and sniffling awful emotionally. 'I've sure nailed the youngfools,' I thinks. And, of course, this lady had to sing it again, andnot half through was she when, sure enough, I glanced down sideways andChet's right hand and her left hand is squirming together till they looklike a bunch of eels. 'All over but the rice,' I says, and at that Ifelt so good and thrilled! I was thinking back to my own time when I wasjust husband-high, though that wasn't so little, Lysander John being ascant six foot three--and our wedding tour to the Centennial and thetrip to Niagara Falls--just soaking in old memories that bless and bindthat this lady singer was calling up--well, you could have had anythingfrom me right then when she kissed that cross a second time, justpouring her torn heart out. 'Worth every cent of that fifty,' I says."Then everybody was standing up and moving out--wiping their eyes a lotof 'em was--so I push on ahead quick, aiming to be more wily than everand leave my couple alone. They don't miss me, either. When I look back,darned if they ain't kind of shaking hands right there in the hall.'Quick work!' I says. 'You got to hand it to that song.' Even then Inoticed Nettie was looking back to where Wilbur was tripping down fromthe platform, and Chester had his eyes glazed over on this manicureparty. Still, they was gripping each other's hands right there beforefolks, and I think they're just a bit embarrassed. My old heart wentright on echoing that song as I pushed forward--not looking back again,I was that certain."And to show you the mushy state I was in, here is old Safety Firsthimself leering at me down by the door, with a clean shave and his otherclothes on, and he says all about how it was a grand evening's musicalentertainment and how much will the Belgians get in cold cash, anyway,and how about them hundred and fifty head of bull calves that he waswilling to take off my hands, and me, all mushed up by that song as Iam telling you, saying to him in a hearty manner, 'They're yours, Dave!Take 'em at your own price, old friend.' Honest, I said it just thatway, so you can see. 'Oh, I'll be stuck on 'em at fifty a head,' saysDave, 'but I knew you'd listen to reason, we being such old neighbours.''I ain't heard reason since that last song,' I says. I'm listening to myheart, and it's a grand pity yours never learned to talk.' 'Fifty ahead,' says the old robber."So, thus throwing away at least fifteen hundred dollars like it was amere bagatelle or something, I walk out into the romantic night and beatit for home, wanting to be in before my happy couple reached there, sothey'd feel free to linger over their parting. My, but I did feelresponsible and dangerous, directing human destinies so brashly the wayI had."There was a pause, eloquent with unworded emotions.Then "Human destinies, hell!" the lady at length intoned.Hereupon I amazingly saw that she believed her tale to be done. Ipermitted the silence to go a minute, perhaps, while she fingered thecigarette paper and loose tobacco."And of course, then," I hinted, as the twin jets of smoke were ratherviciously expelled."I should say so--'of course, then'--you got it. But I didn't get it fornear an hour yet. I set up to my bedroom window in the dark, waitingexcitedly, and pretty soon they slowly floated up to the front gate,talking in hushed tones and gurgles. 'Male and female created He them,'I says, flushed with triumph. The moon wasn't up yet, but you hadn't anytrouble making out they was such. He was acting outrageously like a maleand she was suffering it with the splendid courage which has longdistinguished our helpless sex. And there I set, warming my old heart init and expanding like one of them little squeezed-up sponges you see inthe drug-store window which swells up so astonishing when you put it inwater. I wasn't impatient for them to quit, oh, no! They seemed toclench and unclench and clench again, as if they had all the time in theworld--with me doing nothing but applaud silently."After spending about twenty years out there they loitered softly up thewalk and round to the side door where I'd left the light burning, and Islipped over to the side window, which was also open, and looked down onthe dim fond pair, and she finally opened the door softly and the lightshone out."Again Ma Pettengill paused, her elbows on the arms of her chair, hershoulders forward, her gray old head low between them. She drew a longbreath and rumbled fiercely:"And the mushy fool me, forcing that herd of calves on old Dave at thatscandalous price--after all, that's what really gaffed me the worst! Mystars! If I could have seen that degenerate old crook again thatnight--but of course a trade's a trade, and I'd said it. Ain't I the oldsilly!""The door opened and the light shone out--"I gently prompted.She erected herself in the chair, threw back her shoulders, and her widemouth curved and lifted at the corners with the humour that never longdeserts this woman."Yep! That light flooded out its golden rays on the reprehensible personof C. Wilbur Todd," she crisply announced. "And like they say in thestories, little remains to be told."I let out a kind of strangled yell, and Wilbur beat it right across mynew lawn, and I beat it downstairs. But that girl was like asleepwalker--not to be talked to, I mean, like you could talk topersons."'Aunty,' she says in creepy tones, 'I have brought myself to theultimate surrender. I know the chains are about me, already I feel theshackles, but I glory in them.' She kind of gasped and shivered inhorrible delight. 'I've kissed the cross at last,' she mutters."I was so weak I dropped into a chair and I just looked at her. At firstI couldn't speak, then I saw it was no good speaking. She was free,white, and twenty-one. So I never let on. I've had to take a jolt or twoin my time. I've learned how. But finally I did manage to ask how aboutChet Timmins."'I wronged dear Chester,' she says. 'I admit it freely. He has a heartof gold and a nature in a thousand. But, of course, there could never beanything between him and a nature like mine; our egos function ondifferent planes,' she says. 'Dear Chester came to see it, too. It'sonly in the last week we've come to understand each other. It was reallythat wonderful song that brought us to our mutual knowledge. It helpedus to understand our mutual depths better than all the ages of eternitycould have achieved.' On she goes with this mutual stuff, till you'dhave thought she was reading a composition or something. 'And dearChester is so radiant in his own new-found happiness,' she says. 'What!'I yells, for this was indeed some jolt."'He has come into his own,' she says. 'They have eloped to Spokane,though I promised to observe secrecy until the train had gone. A veryworthy creature I gather from what Chester tells me, a MissMacgillicuddy--'"'Not the manicure party?' I yells again."'I believe she has been a wage-earner,' says Nettie. 'And dear Chesteris so grateful about that song. It was her favourite song, too, and itseemed to bring them together, just as it opened my own soul to Wilbur.He says she sings the song very charmingly herself, and he thought itpreferable that they be wed in Spokane before his father objected. Andoh, aunty, I do see how blind I was to my destiny, and how kind you wereto me in my blindness--you who had led the fuller life as I shall leadit at Wilbur's side.'"'You beat it to your room,' I orders her, very savage and disorganized.For I had stood about all the jolts in one day that God had meant meto. And so they was married, Chester and his bride attending theceremony and Oscar Teetz' five-piece orchestra playing the--" Shebroke off, with a suddenly blazing glance at the disk, and seized itfrom the table rather purposefully. With a hand firmly at both edges shestared inscrutably at it a long moment."I hate to break the darned thing," she said musingly at last. "I guessI'll just lock it up. Maybe some time I'll be feeling the need to hearit again. I know I can still be had by it if all the circumstances isright."Still she stared at the thing curiously."Gee! It was hot getting them calves out to-day, and old Safety Firstmoaning about all over the place how he's being stuck with 'em, tillmore than once I come near forgetting I was a lady--and, oh, yes"--shebrightened--"I was going to tell you. After it was all over, Wilbur, thegallant young tone poet, comes gushing up to me and says, 'Now, aunty,always when you are in town you must drop round and break bread withus.' Aunty, mind you, right off the reel. 'Well,' I says, 'if I dropround to break any bread your wife bakes I'll be sure to bring ahammer.' I couldn't help it. He'll make a home for the girl all right,but he does something sinful to my nerves every time he opens his face.And then coming back here, where I looked for God's peace and quiet, andbeing made to hear that darned song every time I turned round!"I give orders plain enough, but say, it's like a brush fire--you neverknow when you got it stamped out."From the kitchen came the sound of a dropped armful of stove wood. Hardupon this, the unctuous whining tenor of Jimmie Time:    Oh-h-h mem-o-reez thu-hat blu-hess and bu-hurn!"You, Jimmie Time!" It is a voice meant for Greek tragedy and a theatreopen to the heavens. I could feel the terror of the aged vassal."Yes, ma'am!" The tone crawled abasingly. "I forgot myself."I was glad, and I dare say he had the wit to be, that he had not to facethe menace of her glare.IIITHE REAL PERUVIAN DOUGHNUTSThe affairs of Arrowhead Ranch are administered by its owner, Mrs.Lysander John Pettengill, through a score or so of hired experts. As atrout-fishing guest of the castle I found the retainers of thisexcellent feudalism interesting enough and generally explicable. Butstanding out among them, both as a spectacle and by reason of hispeculiar activities, is a shrunken little man whom I would hearaddressed as Jimmie Time. He alone piqued as well as interested. Therewas a tang to all the surmises he prompted in me.I have said he is a man; but wait! The years have had him, have scouredand rasped and withered him; yet his face is curiously but the face of aboy, his eyes but the fresh, inquiring, hurt eyes of a boy who has beenmisused for years threescore. Time has basely done all but age him. Somuch for the wastrel as Nature has left him. But Art has furthered thepiquant values of him as a spectacle.In dress, speech, and demeanour Jimmie seems to be of the West,Western--of the old, bad West of informal vendetta, when a man'sincrease of years might lie squarely on his quickness in the "draw";when he went abundantly armed by day and slept lightly atnight--trigger fingers instinctively crooked. Of course such days havevery definitely passed; wherefore the engaging puzzle of certainsurvivals in Jimmie Time--for I found him still a two-gun man. He worethem rather consciously sagging from his lean hips--almost pompously, itseemed. Nor did he appear properly unconscious of his remainingattire--of the broad-brimmed hat, its band of rattlesnake skin; of thefringed buckskin shirt, opening gallantly across his pinched throat; ofhis corduroy trousers, fitting bedraggled; of his beautiful beadedmoccasins.He was perfect in detail--and yet he at once struck me as being tooacutely aware of himself. Could this suspicion ensue, I wondered, fromthe circumstance that the light duties he discharged in and about theArrowhead Ranch house were of a semidomestic character; from a markedincongruity in the sight of him, full panoplied for homicide, bearingarmfuls of wood to the house; or, with his wicked hat pulled desperatelyover a scowling brow, and still with his flaunt of weapons, engaging asinkful of soiled dishes in the kitchen under the eyes of a mere unarmedChinaman who sat by and smoked an easy cigarette at him, scornful offirearms?There were times, to be sure, when Jimmie's behaviour was in nice accordwith his dreadful appearance--as when I chanced to observe him late thesecond afternoon of my arrival. Solitary in front of the bunk house, herapidly drew and snapped his side arms at an imaginary foe some pacesin front of him. They would be simultaneously withdrawn from theirholsters, fired from the hip and replaced, the performer snarlingviciously the while. The weapons were unloaded, but I inferred that thefoe crumpled each time.Then the old man varied the drama, vastly increasing the advantage ofthe foe and the peril of his own emergency by turning a careless back onthe scene. The carelessness was only seeming. Swiftly he wheeled, andeven as he did so twin volleys came from the hip. It was spirited--theweapons seemed to smoke; the smile of the marksman was evil andmasterly. Beyond all question the foe had crumpled again, despite histremendous advantage of approach.I drew gently near before the arms were again holstered and permittedthe full exposure of my admiration for this readiness of retort underdifficulties. The puissant one looked up at me with suspicion, hostileyet embarrassed. I stood admiring ingenuously, stubborn in myfascination. Slowly I won him. The coldness in his bright little eyeswarmed to awkward but friendly apology."A gun fighter lets hisself git stiff," he winningly began; "then, firstthing he knows, some fine day--crack! Like that! All his own fault, too,'cause he ain't kep' in trim." He jauntily twirled one of the heavyrevolvers on a forefinger. "Not me, though, pard! Keep m'self up andcomin', you bet! Ketch me not ready to fan the old forty-four! I guessnot! Some has thought they could. Oh, yes; plenty has thought theycould. Crack! Like that!" He wheeled, this time fatally intercepting thefoe as he treacherously crept round a corner of the bunk house. "Buryin'ground for you, mister! That's all--bury-in' ground!"The desperado replaced one of the weapons and patted the other withgrisly affection. In the excess of my admiration I made bold to reachfor it. He relinquished it to me with a mother's yearning. And all toolegible in the polished butt of the thing were notches! Nine sinisternotches I counted--not fresh notches, but emphatic, eloquent, chilling.I thrust the bloody record back on its gladdened owner."Never think it to look at me?" said he as our eyes hung above that grimbit of bookkeeping."Never!" I warmly admitted."Me--I always been one of them quiet, mild-mannered ones that youwouldn't think butter would melt in their mouth--jest up to a certainpoint. Lots of 'em fooled that way about me--jest up to a certain point,mind you--then, crack! Buryin' ground--that's all! Never go huntin'trouble--understand? But when it's put on me--say!"He lovingly replaced the weapon--with its mortuary statistics--doffedthe broad-brimmed hat with its snake-skin garniture, and placed aforefinger athwart an area of his shining scalp which is said by acertain pseudoscience to shield several of man's more spiritualattributes. The finger traced an ancient but still evil looking scar."One creased me there," he confessed--"a depity marshal--that time theyhad a reward out for me, dead or alive."I was for details."What did you do?"Jimmie Time stayed laconic."Left him there--that's all!"It was arid, yet somehow informing. It conveyed to me that a marshal hadbeen cleverly put to needing a new deputy."Burying ground?" I guessed."That's all!" He laughed venomously--a short, dry, restrained laugh."They give me a nickname," said he. "They called me Little Sure Shot. Nowonder they did! Ho! I should think they would of called me somethinglike that." He lifted his voice. "Hey! Boogles!"I had been conscious of a stooping figure in the adjacent vegetablegarden. It now became erect, a figure of no distinction--short, rounded,decked in carelessly worn garments of no elegance. It slouchedinquiringly toward us between rows of sprouted corn. Then I saw that thehead surmounting it was a noble head. It was uncovered, burnished to ahalf circle of grayish fringe; but it was shaped in the grand manner andwell borne, and the full face of it was beautified by features of a veryRoman perfection. It was the face of a judge of the Supreme Court orthe face of an ideal senator. His large grave eyes bathed us in afriendly regard; his full lips of an orator parted with leisurely andpromising unction. I awaited courtly phrases, richly rounded periods."A regular hell-cat--what he is!"Thus vocalized the able lips. Jimmie Time glowed modestly."Show him how I can shoot," said he.The amazing Boogies waddled--yet with dignity--to a point ten pacesdistant, drew a coin from the pocket of his dingy overalls, and spun itto the blue of heaven. Ere it fell the deadly weapon bore swiftly on itand snapped."Crack!" said the marksman grimly.His assistant recovered the coin, scrutinized it closely, rubbed a fatthumb over its supposedly dented surface, and again spun it. Thedesperado had turned his back. He drew as he wheeled, and again I wasgiven to understand that his aim had been faultless."Good Little Sure Shot!" declaimed Boogies fulsomely."Hold it in your hand oncet," directed Little Sure Shot. The intrepidassistant gallantly extended the half dollar at arm's length betweenthumb and finger and averted his statesman's face with practicedapprehension. "Crack!" said Little Sure Shot, and the coin seemed to bestruck from the unscathed hand. "Only nicked the aidge of it," said he,genially deprecating. "I don't like to take no chancet with the lad'smitt."It had indeed been a pretty display of sharpshooting--and noiseless."Had me nervous, you bet, first time he tried that," called Boogles."Didn't know his work then. Thought sure he'd wing me."Jimmie Time loftily ejected imaginary shells from his trusty firearm andseemed to expel smoke from its delicate interior. Boogies waddled hisapproach."Any time they back Little Sure Shot up against the wall they want toduck," said he warmly. "He has 'em hard to find in about a minute. Tellhim about that fresh depity marshal, Jimmie.""I already did," said Jimmie."Ain't he the hell-cat?" demanded Boogles, mopping a brow that DanielWebster would have observed with instant and perhaps envious respect."I been a holy terror in my time, all right, all right!" admitted thehero. "Never think it to look at me though. One o' the deceivin' kindtill I'm put upon; then--good-night!""Jest like that!" murmured Boogles."Buryin' ground--that's all." The lips of the bad man shut grimly onthis."Say," demanded Boogles, "on the level, ain't he the real Peruviandoughnuts? Don't he jest make 'em all hunt their--" The tribute wasunfinished."You ol' Jim! You ol' Jim Time!" Shrilly this came from Lew Wee, Chinesecook of the Arrowhead framed in the kitchen doorway of the ranch house.He brandished a scornful and commanding dish towel at the bad man, whoinstantly and almost cravenly cowered under the distant assault. Thegarment of his old bad past fell from him, leaving him as one exposed inthe market-place to the scornful towels of Chinamen. "You run, ol' JimTime! How you think catch 'um din' not have wood?""Now I was jest goin' to," mumbled Jimmie Time; and he amazingly slunkfrom the scene of his late triumphs toward the open front of awoodhouse.His insulter turned back to the kitchen with a final affronting flourishof the towel. The whisper of Boogles came hoarsely to me: "Some of thesedays Little Sure Shot'll put a dose o' cold lead through that Chink'sheart.""Is he really dangerous?" I demanded."Dangerous!" Boogles choked warmly on this. "Let me tell you, that oldboy is the real Peruvian doughnuts, and no mistake! Some day there won'tbe so many Chinks round this dump. No, sir-ee! That little cutthroat'llhave another notch in his gun."The situation did indeed seem to brim with the cheerfullest promise; yetsomething told me that Little Sure Shot was too good, too perfect.Something warned me that he suffered delusions of grandeur--that hefell, in fact, somewhat short of being the real doughnuts, either of aPeruvian or any other valued sort.Nor had many hours passed ere it befell emphatically even so. There hadbeen the evening meal, followed by an hour or so of the always pleasingand often instructive talk of my hostess, Mrs. Lysander John Pettengill,who has largely known life for sixty years and found it entertaining andgood. And we had parted at an early nine, both tired from the work andthe play that had respectively engaged us the day long.My candle had just been extinguished when three closely fired shotscracked the vast stillness of the night. Ensued vocal explosions of acurdling shrillness from the back of the house. One instantly knew themto be indignant and Chinese. Caucasian ears gathered this much. I lookedfrom an open window as the impassioned cries came nearer. The lucentmoon of the mountains flooded that side of the house, and starkly intoits light from round the nearest corner struggled Lew Wee, the Chinaman.He shone refulgent, being yet in the white or full-dress uniform of hiscalling.In one hand he held the best gun of Jimmie Time; in the other--thereseemed to be a well-gripped connection with the slack of a buckskinshirt--writhed the alleged real doughnuts of a possibly Peruviancharacter. The captor looked aloft and remained vocal, waving the gun,waving Jimmie Time, playing them together as cymbals, never looseningthem. It was fine. It filled the eye and appeased the deepest longingsof the ear.Then from a neighbouring window projected the heroic head and shouldersof my hostess, and there boomed into the already vivacious libretto apassionate barytone, or thereabout, of sterling timbre."What in the name of--"I leave it there. To do so is not only kind but necessary. The mostindulgent censor that ever guarded the columns of a print intended foryoung and old about the evening lamp would swiftly delete from thisinvocation, if not the name of Deity itself, at least the greater numberof the attributes with which she endowed it. A few were conventionalenough, but they served only to accentuate others that were too hastilyselected in the heat of this crisis. Enough to say that the ladyoverbore by sheer mass of tone production the strident soprano of LewWee, controlling it at length to a lucid disclosure of his grievance.From the doorway of his kitchen, inoffensively proffering a finalcigarette to the radiant night, he had been the target of three shotswith intent to kill. He submitted the weapon. He submitted the writhingassassin."I catch 'um!" he said effectively, and rested his case."Now--I aimed over his head." It was Jimmie Time alias Little Sure Shot,and he whimpered the words. "I jest went to play a sell on him."The voice of the judge boomed wrathfully on this:"You darned pestering mischief, you! Ain't I forbid you time and againever to load them guns? Where'd you get the ca'tridges?""Now--I found 'em," pleaded the bad man. "I did so; I found 'em.""Cooned 'em, you mean!" thundered the judge. "You cooned 'em from Buckor Sandy. Don't tell me, you young reprobate!""He all like bad man," submitted the prosecution. "I tell 'um catchstlovewood; he tell 'um me: 'You go to haitch!' I tell 'um: 'You ownselfgo to haitch! He say: 'I flan you my gun plitty soon!' He do.""I aimed over the coward's head," protested the defendant."Can happen!" sanely objected the prosecution."Ain't I told you what I'd do if you loaded them guns?" roared thejudge. "Gentle, limping, baldheaded--" [Deleted by censor.] "How manymore times I got to tell you? Now you know what you'll get. You'll getyour needings--that's what you'll get! All day to-morrow! You hear me?You'll wear 'em all day to-morrow! Put 'em on first thing in the morningand wear 'em till sundown. No hiding out, neither! Wear 'em where folkscan see what a bad boy you are. And swearing, too! I got to be 'shamedof you! Yes, sir! Everybody'll know how 'shamed I am to have a tough kidlike you on the place. I won't be able to hold my head up. You wear'em!""I--I--I aimed above--" Jimmie Time broke down. He was weeping bitterly.His captor released him with a final shake, and he brought a forearm tohis streaming eyes."You'll wear 'em all day to-morrow!" again thundered the judge as theculprit sobbed a stumbling way into obscurity."You'self go to haitch!" the unrelenting complainant called after him.The judge effected a rumbling withdrawal. The night was again calm. ThenI slept on the problem of the Arrowhead's two-gun bad man. It seemed nowpretty certain that the fatuous Boogles had grossly overpraised him. Imust question his being the real doughnuts of any sort--even themildest--much less the real Peruvian. But what was "'em" that indegrading punishment and to the public shame of the Arrowhead he mustwear on the morrow? What, indeed, could "'em" be?I woke, still pondering the mystery. Nor could I be enlightened duringmy breakfast, for this was solitary, my hostess being long abroad to farplaces of the Arrowhead, and the stolid mask of Lew Wee inviting noquestions.Breakfast over, I stationed myself in the bracing sunlight that warmedthe east porch and aimlessly overhauled a book of flies. To three thathad proved most popular in the neighbouring stream I did small bits ofmending, ever with a questing eye on adjacent outbuildings, where LittleSure Shot--_nee_ Time--might be expected to show himself, wearing "'em."A blank hour elapsed. I no longer affected occupation with the flies.Jimmie Time was irritating me. Had he not been specifically warned to"wear 'em" full shamefully in the public eye? Was not the public eyepresent, avid? Boogles I saw intermittently among beanpoles in thegarden. He appeared to putter, to have no care or system in his labour.And at moments I noticed he was dropping all pretense of this to standmotionless, staring intently at the shut door of the stable.Could his fallen idol be there, I wondered? Purposefully I also watchedthe door of the stable. Presently it opened slightly; then, with evidentinfinite caution, it was pushed outward until it hung half yawning. Apalpitant moment we gazed, Boogles and I. Then shot from the stablegloom an astounding figure in headlong flight. Its goal appeared to bethe bunk house fifty yards distant; but its course was devious, laidclearly with a view to securing such incidental brief shelter as wouldbe afforded by the corral wall, by a meagre clump of buck-brush, by awagon, by a stack of hay. Good time was made, however. The fugitivevanished into the bunk house and the door of that structure was slammedto. But now the small puzzle I had thought to solve had grown to be, inthat brief space--easily under eight seconds--a mystery of enormous, ofsheerly inhuman dimensions. For the swift and winged one had been alltoo plainly a correctly uniformed messenger boy of the Western UnionTelegraph Company--that blue uniform with metal buttons, with thecorded red at the trouser sides, the flat cap fronted by a badge ofnickel--unthinkable, yet there. And the speedy bearer of this scenicinvestiture had been the desperate, blood-letting, two-gun bad man ofthe Arrowhead.It was a complication not to be borne with any restraint. I hastened tostand before the shut door of the sanctuary. It slept in an unpromisingstillness. Invincibly reticent it seemed, even when the anguished faceof Jimmie Time, under that incredible cap with its nickeled badge,wavered an instant back of the grimy window--wavered and vanished withan effect of very stubborn finality. I would risk no defeat there. Ipassed resolutely on to Boogles, who now most diligently trained uptender young bean vines in the way they should go."Why does he hide in there?" I demanded in a loud, indignant voice. Iwas to have no nonsense about it.Boogles turned on me the slow, lofty, considering regard of a UnitedStates senator submitting to photography for publication in a press thathas no respect for private rights. He lacked but a few clothes and theportico of a capitol. Speech became immanent in him. One should not havebeen surprised to hear him utter decorative words meant for therejoicing and incitement of voters. Yet he only said--or started to say:"Little Sure Shot'll get that Chink yet! I tell you, now, that old boyis sure the real Peruvian--"This was absurdly too much. I then and there opened on Boogles, openedflooding gates of wrath and scorn on him--for him and for his idol ofclay who, I flatly told him, could not be the real doughnuts of anysort. As for his being the real Peruvian--Faugh!Often I had wished to test in speech the widely alleged merits of thisvocable. I found it do all that has been claimed for it. Its effect onBoogles was so withering that I used it repeatedly in the next threeminutes. I even faughed him twice in succession, which is very insultingand beneficial indeed, and has a pleasant feel on the lips."And now then," I said, "if you don't give me the truth of this matterhere and now, one of us two is going to be mighty sorry for it."In the early moments of my violence Boogles had protested weakly; thenhe began to quiver perilously. On this I soothed him, and at theprecisely right moment I cajoled. I lured him to the bench by the corralgate, and there I conferred costly cigarettes on him as man to man.Discreetly then I sounded for the origins of a certain bad man who had away--even though they might crease him--of leaving deputy marshals wherehe found them. Boogles smoked one of the cigarettes before he succumbed;but first:"Let me git my work," said he, and was off to the bunk house.I observed his part in an extended parley before the door was opened tohim. He came to me on the bench a moment later, bearing a ball ofscarlet yarn, a large crochet hook of bone, and something begun in thezephyr but as yet without form."I'm making the madam a red one for her birthday," he confided.He bent his statesman's head above the task and wrought with nimblefingers the while he talked. It was difficult, this talk of his,scattered, fragmentary; and his mind would go from it, his voice expireuntimely. He must be prompted, recalled, questioned. His hands workedwith a very certain skill, but in his narrative he dropped stitches.Made to pick these up, the result was still a droning monotony burdenedwith many irrelevancies. I am loath to transcribe his speech. It werebetter reported with an eye strictly to salience.You may see, then--and I hope with less difficulty than I had inseeing--Jimmie Time and Boogles on night duty at the front of the littleWestern Union Office off Park Row in the far city of New York. The lawof that city is tender to the human young. Night messenger boys must beadults. It is one of the preliminary shocks to the visitor--to ring forthe messenger boy of tradition and behold in his uniform a venerablegentleman with perhaps a flowing white beard. I still think Jimmie Timeand Boogles were beating the law--on a technicality. Of course Jimmiewas far descended into the vale of years, and even Boogles wasforty--but adults!It is three o'clock of a warm spring morning. The two legal adultsconverse in whispers, like bad boys kept after school. They whisper soas not to waken the manager, a blase, mature youth of twenty who sleepsexpertly in the big chair back of the railing. They whisper of theterrific hazards and the precarious rewards of their adventurouscalling. The hazards are nearly all provided by the youngsters who comeon the day watch--hardy ruffians of sixteen or so who not only "pick on"these two but, with sportive affectations, often rob them, when theychange from uniform to civilian attire, of any spoil the night may havebrought them. They are powerless against these aggressions. They can butwhisper their indignation.Boogles eyed the sleeping manager."I struck it fine to-night, Jimmie!" he whispered. Jimmie mutelyquestioned. "Got a whole case note. You know that guy over to thenewspaper office--the one that's such a tank drama--he had to send anote up to a girl in a show that he couldn't be there.""That tank drama? Sure, I know him. He kids me every time he's stewed.""He kids me, too, something fierce; and he give me the case note.""Them strong arms'll cop it on you when they get here," warned Jimmie."Took my collar off and hid her on the inside of it. Oh, I know tricks!""Chee! You're all to the Wall Street!""I got to look out for my stepmother, too. She'd crown me with a chairif she thought I held out on her. Beans me about every day just fornothing anyway.""Don't you stand for it!""Yah! All right for you to talk. You're the lucky guy. You're an orphan.S'pose you had a stepmother! I wish I was an orphan."Jimmie swelled with the pride of orphanship."Yes; I'd hate to have any parents knocking me round," he said. "But ifit ain't a stepmother then it's somebody else that beans you. A guy inthis burg is always getting knocked round by somebody.""Read some more of the novel," pleaded Boogles, to change thedistressing topic.Jimmie drew a tattered paper romance from the pocket of his faded coatand pushed the cap back from his seamed old forehead. It went backeasily, having been built for a larger head than his. He found the placehe had marked at the end of his previous half-hour with literature.Boogles leaned eagerly toward him. He loved being read to. Doing ithimself was too slow and painful:"'No,' said our hero in a clear, ringing voice; 'all your tainted goldwould not keep me here in the foul, crowded city. I must have the free,wild life of the plains, the canter after the Texas steers, and thefierce battles with my peers. For me the boundless, the glorious West!'""Chee! It must be something grand--that wild life!" interruptedBoogles. "That's the real stuff--the cowboy and trapper on themperaries, hunting bufflers and Injuns. I seen a film--"Jimmie Time frowned at this. He did not like interruptions. He firmlyresumed the tale:"With a gesture of disdain our hero waved aside the proffered gold ofthe scoundrelly millionaire and dashed down the stairway of the proudmansion to where his gallant steed, Midnight, was champing at thehitching post. At that moment--"Romance was snatched from the hands of Jimmie Time. The manager toweredabove him."Ain't I told you guys not to be taking up the company's time with themnovels?" he demanded. He sternly returned to his big chair behind therailing, where he no less sternly took up his own perusal of theconfiscated tale."The big stiff!" muttered Jimmie. "That's the third one he's copped onme this week. A kid in this choint ain't got no rights! I got a goodnotion to throw 'em down cold and go with the Postal people.""Never mind! I'll blow you to an ice cream after work," consoledBoogles."Ice cream!" Jimmie Time was contemptuous. "I want the free, wild lifeof the boundless peraries. I want b'ar steaks br'iled on the glowingcoals of the camp fire. I want to be Little Sure Shot, trapper, scout,and guide--""Next out!" yelled the manager. "Hustle now!"Jimmie Time was next out. He hustled sullenly.Boogles, alone, slept fitfully on his bench until the young thugs of theday watch straggled in. Then he achieved the change of his uniform tocivilian garments, with only the accustomed minor maltreatment at thehands of these tormentors. True, with sportive affectations--yet withdeadly intentness--they searched him for possible loot; but only hispockets. His dollar bill, folded inside his collar, went unfound. Withassumed jauntiness he strolled from the outlaws' den and safely reachedthe street.The gilding on the castellated towers of the tallest building in theworld dazzled his blinking, foolish eyes. That was a glorious summitwhich sang to the new sun, but no higher than his own elation at themoment. Had he not come off with his dollar? He found balm and a tenderstimulus in the morning air--an air for dreams and revolt. Boogles feltthis as thousands of others must have felt it who were yet tamelyissuing from subway caverns and the Brooklyn Bridge to be wage slaves.A block away from the office he encountered Jimmie Time, who seemed toawait him importantly. He seethed with excitement."I got one, too!" he called. "That tank drama he sent another noteuptown to a restaurant where a party was, and he give me a case note,too."He revealed it; and when Boogles withdrew his own treasure the two werelovingly compared and admired. Nothing in all the world can be so foulto the touch as the dollar bill that circulates in New York, but thesetwo were intrepidly fondled."I ain't going back to change," said Jimmie Time. "Them other kids wouldcop it on me.""Have some cigarettes," urged Boogies, and royally bought them--withgilded tips, in a beautiful casket."I had about enough of their helling," declared Jimmie, still glowingwith a fine desperation.They sought the William Street Tunnel under the Brooklyn Bridge. It wascool and dark there. One might smoke and take his ease. And plan! Theysprawled on the stone pavement and smoked largely."Chee! If we could get out West and do all them fine things!" musedBoogies."Let's!" said Jimmie Time."Huh!" Boogies gasped blankly at this."Let's beat it!""Chee!" said Boogies. He stared at this bolder spirit with startledadmiration."Me--I'm going," declared Jimmie Time stoutly, and waited.Boogies wavered a tremulous moment."I'm going with you," he managed at last.He blurted the words. They had to rush out to beat down his nativecaution with quick blows."Listen!" said Jimmie Time impressively. "We got money enough to start.Then we just strike out for the peraries.""Like the guy in the story!" Boogies glowed at the adept who before hisvery eyes was turning a beautiful dream into stark reality. He waspraying that his own courage to face it would endure."You hurry home," commanded Jimmie, "and cop an axe and all the grub youcan lay your hands on."Boogies fell from the heights as he had feared he would."Aw, chee!" he said sanely. "And s'pose me stepmother gets her lamps onme! Wouldn't she bean me? Sure she would!""Bind her and gag her," said Jimmie promptly. "What's one weak woman?""Yah! She's a hellion and you know it.""Listen!" said Jimmie sternly. "If you're going into the wild andlawless life of the peraries with me you got to learn to get things.Jesse James or Morgan's men could get me that axe and that grub, and notmake one-two-three of it.""Them guys had practice--and likely they never had to go against theirstepmothers.""Do I go alone, then?""Well, now--""Will you or won't you?"Boogies drew a fateful breath."I'll take a chance. You wait here. If I ain't back in one hour you'llknow I been murdered.""Good, my man!" said Jimmie Time with the air of an outlaw chief. "Beoff at once."Boogies was off. And Boogies was back in less than the hour with adelectable bulging meal sack. He was trembling but radiant."She seen me gitting away and she yelled her head off," he gasped; "butyou bet I never stopped. I just thought of Jesse James and GeneralGrant, and run like hell!""Good, my man!" said Jimmie Time; and then, with a sudden gleam of thepractical, he inventoried the commissary and quartermaster supplies inthe sack. He found them to be: One hatchet; one well-used boiledhambone; six greasy sugared crullers; four dill pickles; a bottle ofcatchup; two tomatoes all but obliterated in transit; two loaves ofbread; a flatiron.Jimmie cast the last item from him."Wh'd you bring that for?" he demanded."I don't know," confessed Boogies. "I just put it in. Mebbe I was afraidshe'd throw it at me when I was making my getaway. It'll be good forcracking nuts if we find any on the peraries. I bet they have nuts!""All right, then. You can carry it if you want to, pard."Jimmie thrust the bundle into Boogies' arms and valiantly led adesperate way to the North River. Boogies panted under his burden asthey dodged impatient taxicabs. So they came into the maze of docktraffic by way of Desbrosses Street. The eyes of both were lit byadventure. Jimmie pushed through the crowd on the wharf to a ticketoffice. A glimpse through a door of the huge shed had given himinspiration. No common ferryboats for them! He had seen the statelyriver steamer, _Robert Fulton_, gay with flags and bunting, awaiting thethrong of excursionists. He recklessly bought tickets. So far, so good.A momentous start had been made.At this very interesting point in his discourse to me, however, Boogiesbegan to miss explosions too frequently. From the disorderly jumble ofhis narrative to this moment I believe I have brought something like thetruth; I have caused the widely scattered parts to cohere. After this Icould make little of his maunderings.They were on the crowded boat and the boat steamed up the Hudson River;and they disembarked at a thriving Western town--which, I gather, wasYonkers--because Boogies feared his stepmother might trace him to thisboat, and because Jimmie Time became convinced that detectives were onhis track, wanting him for the embezzlement of a worn but stillpracticable uniform of the Western Union Telegraph Company. So it wasagreed that they should take to the trackless forest, where there areways of throwing one's pursuers off the scent; where they would travelby night, guided by the stars, and lay up by day, subsisting on springwater and a little pemmican--source undisclosed. They were not going tobe taken alive--that was understood.They hurried through the streets of this thriving Western town,ultimately boarding an electric car--with a shrewd eye out for thehellhounds of the law; and the car took them to the beginning of thefrontier, where they found the trackless forest. They reached the depthsof this forest after climbing a stone wall; and Jimmie Time said theWest looked good to him and that he could already smell the "b'ar steaksbr'iling."Plain enough still, perhaps; but immediately it seemed that a princesshad for some time been sharing this great adventure. She was a beautifulgolden-haired princess, though quite small, and had flowers in her hairand put some in the cap of Jimmie Time--behind the nickel badge--andsaid she would make him her court dwarf or jester or knight, orsomething; only the scout who was with her said this was rather sillyand that they had better be getting home or they knew very well whatwould happen to them. But when they got lost Jimmie Time looked at thisscout's rifle and said it was a first-class rifle, and would knock anIndian or a wild animal silly.And the scout smoked a cigarette and got sick by it, and cried somethingfierce; so they made a fire, and the princess didn't get sick when shesmoked hers, but told them a couple of bully stories, like reading in abook, and ate every one of the greasy sugared crullers, because she wasa genuine princess, and Boogies thought at this time that maybe theboundless West wasn't what it was cracked up to be; so, after they metthe madam, the madam said, well, if they was wanting to go out West theymight as well come along here; and they said all right--as long as theywas wanting to go out West anyway, why, they might as well come alongwith her as with anybody else.And that Chink would mighty soon find out if Little Sure Shot wasn't thereal Peruvian doughnuts, because that old murderer would sure have himhard to find, come sundown; still, he was glad he had come along withthe madam, because back there it wasn't any job for you, account ofgetting too fat for the uniform, with every one giving you the laughthat way--and they wouldn't get you a bigger one--.I left Boogies then, though he seemed not to know it. His needle workedswiftly on the red one he was making for the madam, and his aimless,random phrases seemed to flow as before; but I knew now where to applyfor the details that had been too many for his slender gift ofnarrative.At four that afternoon Mrs. Lysander John Pettengill, accompanied by oneBuck Devine, a valued retainer, rode into the yard and dismounted. Sheat once looked searchingly about her. Then she raised her voice, whichis a carrying voice even when not raised: "You, Jimmie Time!"Once was enough. The door of the bunk house swung slowly open and thedisgraced one appeared in all his shameful panoply. The cap was pulledwell down over a face hopelessly embittered. The shrunken little figuredrooped."None of that hiding out!" admonished his judge. "You keep standinground out here where decent folks can look at you and see what a badboy you are."With a glance she identified me as one of the decent she would haveedified. Jimmie Time muttered evilly in undertones and slouched forward,head down."Ain't he the hostile wretch?" called Buck Devine, who stood with thehorses. He spoke with a florid but false admiration.Jimmie Time, snarling, turned on him: "You go to--."I perceived that Lew Wee the night before had delicately indicated by amere initial letter a bad word that could fall trippingly from the lipsof Jimmie."Sure!" agreed Buck Devine cordially. "And say, take this here telegramup to the corner of Broadway and Harlem; and move lively now--don't youstop to read any of them nickel liberries."I saw what a gentleman should do. I turned my back on the piteous figureof Jimmie Time. I moved idly off, as if the spectacle of his ignominyhad never even briefly engaged me."Shoot up a good cook, will you?" said the lady grimly. "I'll give youyour needings." She followed me to the house.On the west porch, when she had exchanged the laced boots, khaki ridingbreeches, and army shirt for a most absurdly feminine house gown, we hadtea. Her nose was powdered, and her slippers were bronzed leather andmonstrous small. She mingled Scotch whiskey with the tea and drank herfirst cupful from a capacious saucer."That fresh bunch of campers!" she began. "What you reckon they did lastnight? Cut my wire fence in two places over on the west flat--yes,sir!--had a pair of wire clippers in the whip socket. What I didn't give'em! Say, ain't it a downright wonder I still retain my girlishlaughter?"But then, after she had refused my made cigarette for one of her owndeft handiwork, she spoke as I wished her to:"Yes; three years ago. Me visiting a week at the home of Mrs. W.B.Hemingway and her husband, just outside of Yonkers, back in York State.A very nice swell home, with a nice front yard and everything. And alsoMrs. W.B.'s sister and her little boy, visiting her from Albany, thesister's name being Mrs. L.H. Cummins, and the boy being nine years oldand named Rupert Cummins, Junior; and very junior he was for his age,too--I will say that. He was a perfectly handsome little boy; but youmight call him a blubberhead if you wanted to, him always being scaredsilly and pestered and rough-housed out of his senses by his little girlcousin, Margery Hemingway--Mrs. W.B.'s little girl, you understand--andher only seven, or two years younger than Junior, but leading him roundinto all kinds of musses till his own mother was that demoralized aftera couple of days she said if that Margery child was hers she'd have herput away in some good institution."Of course she only told that to me, not to Margery's mother. I don'tknow--mebbe she would of put her away, she was that frightened littleMargery would get Junior killed off in some horrible manner, like thetime she got him to see how high he dast jump out of the apple treefrom, or like the time she told him, one ironing day, that if he drank awhole bowlful of starch it would make him have whiskers like his pa infifteen minutes. Things like that--not fatal, mebbe, but wearing."Well, this day come a telegram about nine A.M. for Mrs. W.B., that heraunt, with money, is very sick in New Jersey, which is near Yonkers; soshe and Mrs. L.H. Cummins, her sister, must go to see about thisaunt--and would I stay and look after the two kids and not let them getpoisoned or killed or anything serious? And they might have to stayovernight, because the aunt was eccentric and often thought she wassick; but this time she might be right. She was worth all the way fromthree to four hundred thousand dollars."So I said I'd love to stay and look after the little ones. I wanted tostay. Shopping in New York City the day before, two bargain sales--onebeing hand-embroidered Swiss waists from two-ninety-eight upward--I feltas if a stampede of longhorns had caught me. Darned near bedfast I was!Say, talk about the pale, weak, nervous city woman with exhaustedvitality! See 'em in action first, say I. There was a corn-fed hussy ina plush bonnet with forget-me-nots, two hundred and thirty or forty onthe hoof, that exhausted my vitality all right--no holds barred, an armlike first-growth hick'ry across my windpipe, and me up against a solidpillar of structural ironwork! Once I was wrastled by a cinnamon bearthat had lately become a mother; but the poor old thing would have losther life with this dame after the hand-embroidereds. Gee! I was lame inplaces I'd lived fifty-eight years and never knew I had."So off went these ladies, with Mrs. L.H. Cummins giving me special andprivate warning to be sure and keep Junior well out of it in case littlemischievous Margery started anything that would be likely to kill her.And I looked forward to a quiet day on the lounge, where I could ache inpeace and read the 'Famous Crimes of History,' which the W.B.'s had intwelve volumes--you wouldn't have thought there was that many, wouldyou? I dressed soft, out of respect to my corpse, and picked out acorking volume of these here Crimes and lay on the big lounge by an openwindow where the breeze could soothe me and where I could keep tabs onthe little ones at their sports; and everything went as right as if Ihad been in some A-Number-One hospital where I had ought to of been."Lunchtime come before I knew it; and I had mine brought to my bed ofpain by the Swede on a tray, while the kids et theirs in an orderly anduproarious manner in the dining-room. Rupert, Junior, was dressed likeone of these boy scouts and had his air gun at the table with him, andlittle Margery was telling him there was, too, fairy princes all roundin different places; and she bet she could find one any day she wantedto. They seemed to be all safe enough, so I took up my Crimes again.Really, ain't history the limit?--the things they done in it and gotaway with--never even being arrested or fined or anything!"Pretty soon I could hear the merry prattle of the little ones again outin the side yard. Ain't it funny how they get the gambling spirit soyoung? I'd hear little Margery say: 'I bet you can't!' And Rupert,Junior, would say:' I bet I can, too!' And off they'd go ninety miles ona straight track: 'I bet you'd be afraid to!'--'I bet I wouldn'tbe!'--'I bet you'd run as fast!'--'I bet I never would!' Ever see suchnatural-born gamblers? And it's all about what Rupert, Junior, would doif he seen a big tiger in some woods--Rupert betting he'd shoot it dead,right between the eyes, and Margery taking the other end. She has by farthe best end of it, I think, it being at least a forty-to-one shot thatRupert, the boy scout, is talking high and wide. And I drop into theCrimes again at a good, murderous place with stilettos."I can't tell even now how it happened. All I know is that it was twoo'clock, and all at once it was five-thirty P.M. by a fussy gold clockover on the mantel with a gold young lady, wearing a spear, standing ontop of it. I woke up without ever suspicioning that I'd been asleep.Anyway, I think I'm feeling better, and I stretch, though careful,account of the dame in the plush bonnet with forget-me-nots; and I liethere thinking mebbe I'll enter the ring again to-morrow for some othertruck I was needing, and thinking how quiet and peaceful it is--howawful quiet! I got it then, all right. That quiet! If you'd known littleMargery better you'd know how sick that quiet made me all at once. Mygizzard or something turned clean over."I let out a yell for them kids right where I lay. Then I bounded to myfeet and run through the rooms downstairs yelling. No sign of 'em! Andout into the kitchen--and here was Tillie, the maid, and Yetta, thecook, both saying it's queer, but they ain't heard a sound of 'emeither, for near an hour. So I yelled out back to an old hick of agardener that's deef, and he comes running; but he don't know a thing onearth about the kids or anything else. Then I am sick! I send Tillie oneway along the street and the gardener the other way to find out if anyneighbours had seen 'em. Then in a minute this here Yetta, the cook,says: 'Why, now, Miss Margery was saying she'd go downtown to buy somecandy,' and Yetta says: 'You know, Miss Margery, your mother never 'etsyou have candy.' And Margery says: 'Well, she might change her mind anyminute--you can't tell; and it's best to have some on hand in case shedoes.' And she'd got some poker chips out of the box to buy the candywith--five blue chips she had, knowing they was nearly money anyway."And when Yetta seen it was only poker chips she knew the kid couldn'tbuy candy with 'em--not even in Yonkers; so she didn't think any moreabout it until it come over her--just like that--how quiet everythingwas. Oh, that Yetta would certainly be found bone clear to the centre ifher skull was ever drilled--the same stuff they slaughter the poorelephants for over in Africa--going so far away, with Yetta right thereto their hands, as you might say. And I'm getting sicker and sicker! I'dhave retained my calm mind, mind you, if they had been my own kids--butkids of others I'd been sacredly trusted with!"And then down the back stairs comes this here sandy-complected,horse-faced plumber that had been frittering away his time all day up ina bathroom over one little leak, and looking as sad and mournful as ifhe hadn't just won eight dollars, or whatever it was. He must have beenborn that way--not even being a plumber had cheered him up."'Blackhanders!'" he says right off, kind of brightening a little bit."I like to fainted for fair! He says they had lured the kids off withcandy and popcorn, and would hold 'em in a tenement house for tenthousand dollars, to be left on a certain spot at twelve P.M. He seemedto know a lot about their ways."'They got the Honourable Simon T. Griffenbaugh's youngest that way,'he says, 'only a month ago. Likely the same gang got these two.'"'How do you know?' I asks him."'Well,' he says, 'they's a gang of over two hundred of these I-talianBlackhanders working right now on a sewer job something about two milesup the road. That's how I know,' he says. 'That's plain enough, ain'tit? It's as plain as the back of my hand. What chance would them twodefenceless little children have with a gang of two hundredBlackhanders?'"But that looked foolish, even to me. 'Shucks!' I says. 'That don'tstand to reason.' But then I got another scare. 'How about water?' Isays. 'Any places round here they could fall into and get drownded?'"He'd looked glum again when I said two hundred Blackhanders didn'tsound reasonable; but he cheers up at this and says: 'Oh, yes; lots ofplaces they could drownd--cricks and rivers and lakes and ponds andtanks--any number of places they could fall into and never come upagain.' Say, he made that whole neighbourhood sound like Venice, Italy.You wondered how folks ever got round without gondolas or something.'One of Dr. George F. Maybury's two kids was nearly drownded lastTuesday--only the older one saved him; a wonder it was they didn't haveto drag the river and find 'em on the bottom locked in each other'sarms! And a boy by the name of Clifford Something, only the other day,playing down by the railroad tracks--'"I shut him off, you bet! I told him to get out quick and go to his homeif he had one."'I certainly hope I won't have to read anything horrible in to-morrow'spaper!' he says as he goes down the back stoop. 'Only last week they wasa nigger caught--'"I shut the door on him. Rattled good and plenty I was by then. Backcomes this silly old gardener--he'd gone with his hoe and was stillgripping it. The neighbours down that way hadn't seen the kids. Backcomes Tillie. One neighbour where she'd been had seen 'em climb on to astreet car--only it wasn't going downtown but into the country; and thisneighbour had said to herself that the boy would be likely to let someone have it in the eye with his gun, the careless way he was lugging it."Thank the Lord, that was a trace! I telephoned to the police and told'em all about it. And I telephoned for a motor car for me and got intosome clothes. Good and scared--yes! I caught sight of my face in thelooking-glass, and, my! but it was pasty--it looked like one of thesecheap apple pies you see in the window of a two-bit lunch place! Andwhile I'm waiting for this motor car, what should come but a telegramfrom Mr. W.B. himself saying that the aunt was worse and he would go toNew Jersey himself for the night! Some said this aunt was worth a gooddeal more than she was supposed to be. And I not knowing the name ofthis town in Jersey where they would all be!--it was East Something orWest Something, and hard to remember, and I'd forgot it."I called the police again and they said descriptions was being sentout, and that probably I'd better not worry, because they often hadcases like this. And I offered to bet them they hadn't a case sinceYonkers was first thought of that had meant so much spot cash to 'em asthis one would mean the minute I got a good grip on them kids. So thiscop said mebbe they had better worry a little, after all, and they'dsend out two cars of their own and scour the country, and try to findthe conductor of this street car that the neighbour woman had seen thekids get on to."I r'ared round that house till the auto come that I'd ordered. It waslate coming, naturally, and nearly dark when it got there; but wecovered a lot of miles while the daylight lasted, with the man lookingsharp out along the road, too, because he had three kids of his own thatwould do any living thing sometimes, though safe at home and asleep atthat minute, thank God!"It was moisting when we started, and pretty soon it clouded up and thedark came on, and I felt beat. We got fair locoed. We'd go down one roadand then back the same way. We stopped to ask everybody. Then we foundthe two autos sent out by the police. I told the cops again what wouldhappen to 'em from me the minute the kids was found--the kids or theirbodies. I was so despairing--what with that damned plumber andeverything! I'll bet he's the merry chatterbox in his own home. Thepolice said cheer up--nothing like that, with the country as safe as achurch. But we went over to this Blackhanders' construction camp, justthe same, to make sure, and none of the men was missing, the boss said,and no children had been seen; and anyway his men was ordinary decentwops and not Blackhanders--and blamed if about fifty of 'em didn't turnout to help look! Yes, sir, there they was--foreigners to the last manexcept the boss, who was Irish--and acting just like human beings."It was near ten o'clock now; so we went to a country saloon totelephone police headquarters, and they had found the car conductor, heremembering because he had threatened to put the boy scout off the carif he didn't quit pointing his gun straight at an old man with goldspectacles setting across the aisle. And finally they had got offthemselves about three miles down the road; he'd watched 'em climb overa stone wall and start up a hill into some woods that was there. And hewas Conductor Number Twenty-seven, if we wanted to know that."We beat it to that spot after I'd powdered my nose and we'd had a quickround of drinks. The policemen knew where it was. It wasn't moisting anymore--it was raining for fair; and we done some ground-and-loftyskidding before we got there. We found the stone wall all right and theslope leading up to the woods; but, my Lord, there was a good half mileof it! We strung out--four cops and my driver and me--hundreds of yardsapart and all yelling, so maybe the poor lost things would hear us."We made up to the woods without raising a sign; and, my lands, wasn'tit dark inside the woods! I worked forward, trying to keep straight fromtree to tree; but I stumbled and tore my clothes and sprained my wrist,and blacked one eye the prettiest you'd want to see--mighty near being ablubberhead myself, I was--it not being my kids, you understand. Oh, Ikept to it though! I'd have gone straight up the grand old state of NewYork into Lake Erie if something hadn't stopped me."It was a light off through the pine and oak trees, and down in a kindof little draw--not a lamplight but a fire blazing up. I yelled to bothsides toward the others. I can yell good when I'm put to it. Then Istarted for the light. I could make out figures round the fire. Mebbeit's a Blackhanders' camp, I think; so I didn't yell any more. Icat-footed. And in a minute I was up close and seen 'em--there in thedripping rain."Rupert, Junior, was asleep, leaned setting up against a tree, with amessenger boy's cap on. And Margery was asleep on a pile of leaves, withher cheek on one hand and something over her. And a fat man was asleepon his back, with his mouth open, making an awful fuss about it. And theonly one that wasn't asleep was a funny little old man setting againstanother tree. He had on the scout's campaign hat and he held the gunacross his chest in the crook of his arm. He hadn't any coat on. Then Isee his coat was what was over Margery; and I looked closer and it was amessenger boy's coat."I was more floored than ever when I took that in. I made a little move,and this funny old man must have heard me--he looked like one of themsilly little critters that play hob with Rip Van Winkle out on themountain before he goes to sleep. And he cocks his ears this way andthat; then he jumped to his feet, and I come forward where he could seeme. And darned if he didn't up with this here air gun of Rupert's, likea flash, and plunk me with a buckshot it carried--right on my sprainedwrist, too!"Say, I let out a yell, and I had him by the neck of his shirt in onegrab. I was still shaking him when the others come to. The fat man setup and rubbed his eyes and blinked. That's all he done. Rupert woke upthe same minute and begun to cry like a baby; and Margery woke up, butshe didn't cry. She took a good look at me and she says: 'You let himalone! He's my knight--he slays all the dragons. He's a good knight!'"There I was, still shaking the little old man--I'd forgot all abouthim. So I dropped him on the ground and reached for Margery; and I wasso afraid I was going to blubber like Rupert, the scout, that I let outsome words to keep from it. Yes, sir; I admit it."'Oh! Oh! Oh! Swearing!' says Rupert. I shall tell mother and Aunt Hildajust what you said!'"Mebby you can get Rupert's number from that. I did anyway. I stood upfrom Margery and cuffed him. He went on sobbing, but not without reason."'Margery Hemingway,' I says, 'how dare you!' And she looks up all cooland cunning, and says: 'Ho! I bet I know worse words than what you said!See if I don't.' So then I shut her off mighty quick. But still shedidn't cry. 'I s'pose I must go back home,' she says. 'And perhaps it isall for the best. I have a very beautiful home. Perhaps I should staythere oftener.'"I turned on the Blackhanders."'Did these brutes entice you away with candy?' I demanded. 'Was theyholding you here for ransom?'"'Huh! I should think not!' she says. 'They are a couple of 'fraid-cats.They were afraid as anything when we all got lost in these woods andwanted to keep on finding our way out. And I said I bet they were awfulcowards, and the fat one said of course he was; but this old one becamevery, very indignant and said he bet he wasn't any more of a coward thanI am, but we simply ought to go where there were more houses. And so Iconsented and we got lost worse than ever--about a hundred miles, Ithink--in this dense forest and we couldn't return to our beautifulhomes. And this one said he was a trapper, scout, and guide; so he builtthis lovely fire and I ate a lot of crullers the silly things hadbrought with them. And then this old one flung his robe over me becauseI was a princess, and it made me invisible to prowling wolves; andanyway he sat up to shoot them with his deadly rifle that he took awayfrom Cousin Rupert. And Cousin Rupert became very tearful indeed; so wetook his hat away, too, because it's a truly scout hat.'"'And she smoked a cigarette,' says Rupert, still sobbing."'He smoked one, too, and I mean to tell his mother,' says Margery.'It's something I think she ought to know.'"'It made me sick,' says Rupert. 'It was a poison cigarette; I nearlydied.'"'Mine never made me sick,' says Margery--'only it was kind of sting-yto the tongue and I swallowed smoke through my nose repeatedly. Andfirst, this old one wouldn't give us the cigarettes at all, until Ithreatened to cast a spell on him and turn him into a toad forever. Inever did that to any one, but I bet I could. And the fat one cried likeanything and begged me not to turn the old one into a toad, and the oldone said he didn't think I could in a thousand years, but he wouldn'ttake any chances in the Far West; so he gave us the cigarettes, andRupert only smoked half of his and then he acted in a very common way, Imust say. And this old one said we would have br'iled b'ar steaks forbreakfast. What is a br'iled b'ar steak? I'm hungry.'"Such was little angel-faced Margery. Does she promise to make lifeinteresting for those who love her, or does she not?"Well, that's all. Of course these cops when they come up said the twomen was desperate crooks wanted in every state in the Union; but I sworeI knew them both well and they was harmless; and I made it right with'em about the reward as soon as I got back to a check book. After thatthey'd have believed anything I said. And I sent something over to theBlackhanders that had turned out to help look, and something toConductor Number Twenty-seven. And the next day I squared myself withMrs. W.B. Hemingway and her husband, and Mrs. L.H. Cummins, when theycome back, the aunt not having been sick but only eccentric again."And them two poor homeless boys--they kind of got me, I admit, afterI'd questioned 'em awhile. So I coaxed 'em out here where they couldlead the wild, free life. Kind of sad and pathetic, almost, they was.The fat one I found was just a kind of natural-born one--a feeb youunderstand--and the old one had a scar that the doctor said explainedhim all right--you must have noticed it up over his temple. It's wherehis old man laid him out once, when he was a kid, with a stovelifter. Itseemed to stop his works."Yes; they're pretty good boys. Boogies was never bad but once, accountof two custard pies off the kitchen window sill. I threatened him withhis stepmother and he hid under the house for twenty-four hours. Theother one is pretty good, too. This is only the second time I had topunish him for fooling with live ca'tridges. There! It's sundown andhe's got on his Wild Wests again."Jimmie Time swaggered from the bunk house in his fearsome regalia. Underthe awed observation of Boogles he wheeled, drew, and shot from the hipone who had cravenly sought to attack him from the rear."My, but he's hostile!" murmured my hostess. "Ain't he just the hostilelittle wretch?"IVONCE A SCOTCHMAN, ALWAYSTerrific sound waves beat upon the Arrowhead ranch house this night. Atfive o'clock a hundred and twenty Hereford calves had been torn fromtheir anguished mothers for the first time and shut into a too adjacentfeeding pen. Mothers and offspring, kept a hundred yards apart by twostout fences, unceasingly bawled their grief, a noble chorus of yearningand despair. The calves projected a high, full-throated barytone, withhere and there a wailing tenor against the rumbling bass of their dams.And ever and again pealed distantly into the chorus the flute obbligatoof an emotional coyote down on the flat. There was never a diminuendo.The fortissimo had been steadily maintained for three hours and wouldendure the night long, perhaps for two other nights.At eight o'clock I sleepily wondered how I should sleep. And thuswondering, I marvelled at the indifference to the racket of my hostess,Mrs. Lysander John Pettengill. Through dinner and now as she read a SanFrancisco newspaper she had betrayed no consciousness of it. She readher paper and from time to time she chuckled."How do you like it?" I demanded, referring to the monstrous din."It's great," she said, plainly referring to something else. "One ofthem real upty-up weddings in high life, with orchestras and bowers oforchids and the bride a vision of loveliness--""I mean the noise.""What noise?" She put the paper aside and stared at me, listeningintently. I saw that she was honestly puzzled, even as the chorusswelled to unbelievable volume. I merely waved a hand. The coyote wasthen doing a most difficult tremolo high above the clamour."Oh, that!" said my enlightened hostess. "That's nothing; just a littlebunch of calves being weaned. We never notice that--and say, they gotthe groom's mother in here, too. Yes, sir, Ellabelle in all her tiarasand sunbursts and dog collars and diamond chest protectors--Mrs. AngusMcDonald, mother of groom, in a stunning creation! I bet they didn'tneed any flashlight when they took her, not with them stones all overher person. They could have took her in a coal cellar.""How do you expect to sleep with all that going on?" I insisted."All what? Oh, them calves. That's nothing! Angus says to her when theyfirst got money: 'Whatever you economize in, let it not be in diamonds!'He says nothing looks so poverty-stricken as a person that can onlyafford a few. Better wear none at all than just a mere handful, hesays. What do you think of that talk from a man named Angus McDonald?You'd think a Scotchman and his money was soon parted, but I heard himsay it from the heart out. And yet Ellabelle never does seem to get him.Only a year ago, when I was at this here rich place down from SanFrancisco where they got the new marble palace, there was a lovelyblow-up and Ellabelle says to me in her hysteria: 'Once a Scotchman,always a Scotchman!' Oh, she was hysteric all right! She was like what Iseen about one of the movie actresses, 'the empress of stormy emotion.'Of course she feels better now, after the wedding and all this newspaperguff. And it was a funny blow-up. I don't know as I blamed her at thetime."I now closed a window and a door upon the noisy September night. Ithelped a little. I went back to a chair nearer to this woman with earstrained in rejection. That helped more. I could hear her now, save inthe more passionate intervals of the chorus."All right, then. What was the funny blow-up?" She caught thesignificance of the closed door and window."But that's music," she insisted. "Why, I'd like to have a good recordof about two hundred of them white-faced beauties being weaned, so Icould play it on a phonograph when I'm off visiting--only it would makeme too homesick." She glanced at the closed door and window in a waythat I found sinister."I couldn't hear you," I suggested."Oh, all right!" She listened wistfully a moment to the now slightlydulled oratorio, then: "Yes, Angus McDonald is his name; but there aretwo kinds of Scotch, and Angus is the other kind. Of course he's one ofthe big millionaires now, with money enough to blind any kind of aScotchman, but he was the other kind even when he first come out to us,a good thirty years ago, without a cent. He's a kind of second or thirdcousin of mine by marriage or something--I never could quite work itout--and he'd learned his trade back in Ohio; but he felt that the Eastdidn't have any future to speak of, so he decided to come West. He was apainter and grainer and kalsominer and paperhanger, that kind ofthing--a good, quiet boy about twenty-five, not saying much, chunky andslow-moving but sure, with a round Scotch head and a snub nose, and oneheavy eyebrow that run clean across his face--not cut in two like mostare."He landed on the ranch and slowly looked things over and let on after afew days that he mebbe would be a cowboy on account of it taking himoutdoors more than kalsomining would. Lysander John was pretty busy, buthe said all right, and gave him a saddle and bridle and a pair of bullpants and warned him about a couple of cinch-binders that he mustn't tryto ride or they would murder him. And so one morning Angus asked alittle bronch-squeezer we had, named Everett Sloan, to pick him outsomething safe to ride, and Everett done so. Brought him up a nice oldrope horse that would have been as safe as a supreme-court judge, butthe canny Angus says: 'No, none of your tricks now! That beast has thevery devil in his eye, and you wish to sit by and laugh your fool headoff when he displaces me.' 'Is that so?' says Everett. 'I suspect you,'says Angus. 'I've read plentifully about the tricks of you cowlads.''Pick your own horse, then,' says Everett. 'I'd better,' says Angus, andpicks one over by the corral gate that was asleep standing up, with awisp of hay hanging out of his mouth like he'd been too tired to finisheating it. 'This steed is more to my eye,' says Angus. 'He's old andwithered and he has no evil ambitions. But maybe I can wake him up.''Maybe you can,' says Everett, 'but are you dead sure you want to?'Angus was dead sure. 'I shall thwart your murderous design,' says he. SoEverett with a stung look helped him saddle this one. He had his alibiall right, and besides, nothing ever did worry that buckaroo as long ashis fingers wasn't too cold to roll a cigarette."The beast was still asleep when Angus forked him. Without seeming towake up much he at once traded ends, poured Angus out of the saddle, andstacked him up in some mud that was providentially there--mud softenough to mire your shadow. Angus got promptly up, landed a strong kickin the ribs of the outlaw which had gone to sleep again before he lit,shook hands warmly with Everett and says: 'What does a man need with twotrades anyway? Good-bye!'"But when Lysander John hears about it he says Angus has just the rightstuff in him for a cowman. He says he has never known one yet that youcould tell anything to before he found it out for himself, and Angusmust sure have the makings of a good one, so he persuades him to stayround for a while, working at easy jobs that couldn't stack him up, andlater he sent him to Omaha with the bunch in charge of a trainload ofsteers."The trip back was when his romance begun. Angus had kept fancy-free upto that time, being willing enough but thoroughly cautious. Do youremember the eating-house at North Platte, Nebraska? The night trainfrom Omaha would reach there at breakfast time and you'd get out in thefrosty air, hungry as a confirmed dyspeptic, and rush into the big redbuilding past the man that was rapidly beating on a gong with one ofthese soft-ended bass-drum sticks. My, the good hot smells inside!Tables already loaded with ham and eggs and fried oysters and friedchicken and sausage and fried potatoes and steaks and hot biscuits andcorn bread and hot cakes and regular coffee--till you didn't know whichto begin on, and first thing you knew you had your plate loaded with toomany things--but how you did eat!--and yes, thank you, another cup ofcoffee, and please pass the sirup this way. And no worry about thetrain pulling out, because there the conductor is at that other tableand it can't go without him, so take your time--and about three more ofthem big fried oysters, the only good fried ones I ever had in theworld! To this day I get hungry thinking of that North Platte breakfast,and mad when I go into the dining-car as we pass there and try to getthe languid mulatto to show a little enthusiasm."Well, they had girls at that eating-house. Of course no one evernoticed 'em much, being too famished and busy. You only knew in ageneral way that females was passing the food along. But Angus actuallydid notice Ellabelle, though it must have been at the end of the meal,mebbe when she was pouring the third cup. Ellabelle was never rightpretty to my notion, but she had some figure and kind of a sad dignity,and her brown hair lacked the towers and minarets and golden domes thatthe other girls built with their own or theirs by right of purchase. Andshe seems to have noticed Angus from the very first. Angus saw that whenshe wasn't passing the fried chicken or the hot biscuits along, even forhalf a minute, she'd pick up a book from the window sill and glancestudiously at its pages. He saw the book was called 'Lucile.' And helooked her over some more--between mouthfuls, of course--theneat-fitting black dress revealing every line of her lithe young figure,like these magazine stories say, the starched white apron and the lookof sad dignity that had probably come of fresh drummers trying to teachher how to take a joke, and the smooth brown hair--he'd probably gotwise to the other kind back in the social centres of Ohio--and all atonce he saw there was something about her. He couldn't tell what it was,but he knew it was there. He heard one of the over-haired ones call herEllabelle, and he committed the name to memory."He also remembered the book she was reading. He come back with a copyhe'd bought at Spokane and kept it on his bureau. Not that he read itmuch. It was harder to get into than 'Peck's Bad Boy,' which was hisfavourite reading just then."Pretty soon another load of steers is ready--my sakes, what scrubbyrunts we sent off the range in them days compared to now!--and Anguspleads to go, so Lysander John makes a place for him and, coming back,here's Ellabelle handing the hot things along same as ever, with'Lucile' at hand for idle moments. This time Angus again made certainthere was something about her. He cross-examined her, I suppose, betweenthe last ham and eggs and the first hot cakes. Her folks was cornfarmers over in Iowa and she'd gone to high school and had meant to be ateacher, but took this job because with her it was anything to get outof Iowa, which she spoke of in a warm, harsh way."Angus nearly lost the train that time, making certain there wassomething about her. He told her to be sure and stay there till heshowed up again. He told me about her when he got back. 'There'ssomething about her,' he says. 'I suspect it's her eyes, though it mightbe something else.'"Me? I suspected there was something about her, too; only I thought itwas just that North Platte breakfast and his appetite. No meal can everbe like breakfast to them that's two-fisted, and Angus was. He'd thinkthere was something about any girl, I says to myself, seeing her throughthe romantic golden haze of them North Platte breakfast victuals. Ofcourse I didn't suggest any such base notion to Angus, knowing howlittle good it does to talk sense to a man when he thinks there'ssomething about a girl. He tried to read 'Lucile' again, but couldn'tseem to strike any funny parts."Next time he went to Omaha, a month later, he took his other suit andhis new boots. 'I shall fling caution to the winds and seal my fate,' hesays. 'There's something about her, and some depraved scoundrel mightfind it out.' 'All right, go ahead and seal,' I says. 'You can't expectus to be shipping steers every month just to give you twenty minuteswith a North Platte waiter girl.' 'Will she think me impetuous?' sayshe. 'Better that than have her think you ain't,' I warns him. 'Men havebeen turned down for ten million reasons, and being impetuous is aboutthe only one that was never numbered among them. It will be strangeo'clock when that happens.' 'She's different,' says Angus. 'Of course,'I says. 'We're all different. That's what makes us so much alike.' 'Youmight know,' says he doubtfully."He proved I did, on the trip back. He marched up to Ellabelle's end ofthe table in his other suit and his new boots and a startling necktiehe'd bought at a place near the stockyards in South Omaha, and proposedhonourable marriage to her, probably after the first bite of sausage andwhile she was setting his coffee down. 'And you've only twenty minutes,'he says, 'so hurry and pack your grip. We'll be wed when we get off thetrain.' 'You're too impetuous,' says Ellabelle, looking more than everas if there was something about her. 'There, I was afraid I'd be,' saysAngus, quitting on some steak and breaking out into scarlet rash. 'Whatdid you think I am?' demands Ellabelle. 'Did you think I would answeryour beck and call or your lightest nod as if I were your slave orsomething? Little you know me,' she says, tossing her head indignantly.'I apologize bitterly,' says Angus. 'The very idea is monstrous,' saysshe. 'Twenty minutes--and with all my packing! You will wait over tillthe four-thirty-two this afternoon,' she goes on, very stern andnervous, 'or all is over between us.' 'I'll wait as long as that foryou,' says Angus, going to the steak again. 'Are the other meals here asgood as breakfast?' 'There's one up the street,' says Ellabelle; 'aPresbyterian.' 'I would prefer a Presbyterian,' says Angus. 'Are thosefried oysters I see up there?'"That was about the way of it, I gathered later. Anyway, Angus broughther back, eating on the way a whole wicker suitcase full of lunch thatshe put up. And she seemed a good, capable girl, all right. She told methere was something about Angus. She'd seen that from the first. Evenso, she said, she hadn't let him sweep her off her feet like he hadmeant to, but had forced him to give her time to do her packing andconsider the grave step she was taking for better or worse, like everytrue, serious-minded woman ought to."Angus now said he couldn't afford to fritter away any more time in thecattle business, having a wife to support in the style she had beenaccustomed to, so he would go to work at his trade. He picked outWallace, just over in Idaho, as a young and growing town where he coulddo well. He rented a nice four-room cottage there, with an icebox out onthe back porch and a hammock in the front yard, and begun to paper andpaint and grain and kalsomine and made good money from the start.Ellabelle was a crackajack housekeeper and had plenty of time to lie outin the hammock and read 'Lucile' of afternoons."By and by Angus had some money saved up, and what should he do withbits of it now and then but grubstake old Snowstorm Hickey, who'd beenscratching mountainsides all his life and never found a thing and likelynever would--a grouchy old hardshell with white hair and whiskerswhirling about his head in such quantities that a body just naturallycalled him Snowstorm without thinking. It made him highly indignant,but he never would get the things cut. Well, and what does this oldsnow-scene-in-the-Alps do after about a year but mush along up the canonpast Mullan and find a high-grade proposition so rich it was scandalous!They didn't know how rich at first, of course, but Angus got assays andthey looked so good they must be a mistake, so they sunk a shaft anddrifted in a tunnel, and the assays got better, and people with moneywas pretty soon taking notice."One day Snowstorm come grouching down to Angus and tells about acapitalist that had brought two experts with him and nosed over theworkings for three days. Snowstorm was awful dejected. He had hated thecapitalist right off. 'He wears a gold watch chain and silk underclotheslike one of these fly city dames,' says Snowstorm, who was a knowing oldscoundrel, 'and he says his syndicate on the reports of these twothieving experts will pay twelve hundred for it and not a cent more.What do you think of that for nerve?'"'Is that all?' says Angus, working away at his job in the newInternational Hotel at Wallace. Graining a door in the dining-room hewas, with a ham rind and a stocking over one thumb nail, doing littlecurlicues in the brown wet paint to make it look like what the wood wasat first before it was painted at all. 'Well,' he says, 'I suspectedfrom the assays that we might get a bit more, but if he had expertswith him you better let him have it for twelve hundred. After all,twelve hundred dollars is a good bit of money.'"'Twelve hundred thousand,' says Snowstorm, still grouchy."'Oh,' says Angus. 'In that case don't let him have it. If the sharkoffers that it'll be worth more. I'll go into the mining business myselfas soon as I've done this door and the wainscoting and give them theirvarnish.'"He did so. He had the International finished in three more days, turneddown a job in the new bank building cold, and went into the miningbusiness just like he'd do anything else--slow and sure, yet impetuoushere and there. It wasn't a hard proposition, the stuff being therenearly from the grass roots, and the money soon come a-plenty. Snowstormnot only got things trimmed up but had 'em dyed black as a crow's wingand retired to a life of sinful ease in Spokane, eating bacon and beansand cocoanut custard pie three times a day till the doctors found outwhat a lot of expensive things he had the matter with him."Angus not only kept on the job but branched out into other mines thathe bought up, and pretty soon he quit counting his money. You know whatthat would mean to most of his race. It fazed him a mite at first. Hetried faithfully to act like a crazy fool with his money, experimentingwith revelry and champagne for breakfast, and buying up the Sans Soosydance hall every Saturday night for his friends and admirers. But hewasn't gaited to go on that track long. Even Ellabelle wasn't worriedthe least bit, and in fact she thought something of the kind was due hisposition. And she was busy herself buying the things that are champagneto a woman, only they're kept on the outside. That was when Angus toldher if she was going in for diamonds at all to get enough so she couldappear to be wasteful and contemptuous of them. Two thousand she givefor one little diamond circlet to pin her napkin up on her chest with.It was her own idea."Then Angus for a time complicated his amateur debauchery with fasthorses. He got him a pair of matched pacing stallions that would goanywhere, he said. And he frequently put them there when he had the mainchandelier lighted. In driving them over a watering-trough one night anaccident of some sort happened. Angus didn't come to till after his legwas set and the stitches in--eight in one place, six in another, and soon; I wonder why they're always so careful to count the stitches in aperson that way--and he wished to know if his new side-bar buggy wassafe and they told him it wasn't, and he wanted to know where his teamwas, but nobody knew that for three days, so he says to the doctors andEllabelle: 'Hereafter I suspect I shall take only soft drinks like beerand sherry. Champagne has a bonnier look but it's too enterprising. Imight get into trouble some time.' And he's done so to this day. Oh,I've seen him take a sip or two of champagne to some one's health, oras much Scotch whiskey in a tumbler of water as you could dribble from amedium-boilered fountain pen. But that's a high riot with him. He'll eatone of these corned peaches in brandy, and mebbe take a cream pitcher ofbeer on his oatmeal of a morning when his stomach don't feel just right,but he's never been a willing performer since that experiment inhurdling."When he could walk again him and Ellabelle moved to the InternationalHotel, where she wouldn't have to cook or split kindling and could makea brutal display of diamonds at every meal, and we went down to seethem. That was when Angus give Lysander John the scarfpin he'd sentclear to New York for--a big gold bull's head with ruby eyes and in itsmouth a nugget of platinum set with three diamonds. Of course LysanderJohn never dast wear it except when Angus was going to see it."Then along comes Angus, Junior, though poor Ellabelle thinks forseveral days that he's Elwin. We'd gone down so I could be with her."'Elwin is the name I have chosen for my son,' says she to Angus thethird day."'Not so,' says Angus, slumping down his one eyebrow clear across in afirm manner. 'You're too late. My son is already named. I named himAngus the night before he was born.'"'How could you do that when you didn't know the sex?' demands Ellabellewith a frightened air of triumph."'I did it, didn't I?' says Angus. 'Then why ask how I could?' And hecurved the eyebrow up one side and down the other in a fighting way."Ellabelle had been wedded wife of Angus long enough to know when theScotch curse was on him. 'Very well,' she says, though turning her faceto the wall. Angus straightened the eyebrow. 'Like we might have twonow, one of each kind,' says he quite soft, 'you'd name your daughter asyou liked, with perhaps no more than a bit of a suggestion from me, tobe taken or not by you, unless we'd contend amiably about it for alength of time till we had it settled right as it should be. But ason--my son--why, look at the chest on him already, projecting outwardlike a clock shelf--and you would name him--but no matter! I wasforehanded, thank God.' Oh, you saw plainly that in case a girl evercome along Ellabelle would have the privilege of naming it anything inthe world she wanted to that Angus thought suitable."So that was settled reasonably, and Angus went on showing what to dowith your mine instead of selling it to a shark, and the baby fatted up,being stall-fed, and Ellabelle got out into the world again, with moremoney than ever to spend, but fewer things to buy, because in Wallaceshe couldn't think of any more. Trust her, though! First theInternational Hotel wasn't good enough. Angus said they'd have amansion, the biggest in Wallace, only without slippery hardwood floors,because he felt brittle after his accident. Ellabelle says Wallaceitself ain't big enough for the mansion that ought to be a home to hisonly son. She was learning how to get to Angus without seeming to. Hethought there might be something in that, still he didn't like to trustthe child away from him, and he had to stick there for a while."So Ellabelle's health broke down. Yes, sir, she got to be a totalwreck. Of course the fool doctor in Wallace couldn't find it out. Shetried him and he told her she was strong as a horse and ought to bedoing a tub of washing that very minute. Which was no way to talk to thewife of a rich mining man, so he lost quite a piece of money by it.Ellabelle then went to Spokane and consulted a specialist. That's thedifference. You only see a doctor, but a specialist you consult. Thisone confirmed her fears about herself in a very gentlemanly way andreaped his reward on the spot. Ellabelle's came after she had convincedAngus that even if she did have such a good appetite it wasn't a normalone, but it was, in fact, one of her worst symptoms and threatened herwith a complete nervous breakdown. After about a year of this, whenAngus had horned his way into a few more mines--he said he might as wellhave a bunch of them since he couldn't be there on the spot anyway--theywent to New York City. Angus had never been there except to pass from aClyde liner to Jersey City, and they do say that when he heard therates, exclusive of board, at the one Ellabelle had picked out fromreading the papers, he timidly asked her if they hadn't ought to go tothe other hotel. She told him there wasn't any other--not for them. Shetold him further it was part of her mission to broaden his horizon, andshe firmly meant to do it if God would only vouchsafe her a remnant ofher once magnificent vitality."She didn't have to work so hard either. Angus begun to get a broaderhorizon in just a few days, corrupting every waiter he came in contactwith, and there was a report round the hotel the summer I was there thata hat-boy had actually tried to reason with him, thinking he was aforeigner making mistakes with his money by giving up a dollar billevery time for having his hat snatched from him. As a matter of fact,Angus can't believe to this day that dollar bills are money. He feelsapologetic when he gives 'em away. All the same I never believed thatreport about the hat-boy till someone explained to me that he wasn'tallowed to keep his loot, not only having clothes made special withoutpockets but being searched to the hide every night like them poorunfortunate Zulus that toil in the diamond mines of Africa. Of course Icould see then that this boy had become merely enraged like a wild-catat having a dollar crowded onto him for some one else every time a headwaiter grovelled Angus out of the restaurant."The novelty of that life wore off after about a year, even with sidetrips to resorts where the prices were sufficiently outrageous to charmEllabelle. She'd begun right off to broaden her own horizon. After onlyone week in New York she put her diamond napkin pincher to doing otherwork, and after six months she dressed about as well as them prominentsociety ladies that drift round the corridors of this hotel waiting forparties that never seem on time, and looking none too austere while theywait."So Ellabelle, having in the meantime taken up art and literature andgone to lectures where the professor would show sights and scenes inforeign lands with his magic lantern, begun to feel the call of the OldWorld. She'd got far beyond 'Lucile'--though 'Peck's Bad Boy' was stillthe favourite of Angus when he got time for any serious reading--- andwas coming to loathe the crudities of our so-called Americancivilization. So she said. She begun to let out to Angus that theywasn't doing right by the little one, bringing him up in a hole like NewYork City where he'd catch the American accent--though God knows whereshe ever noticed that danger there!--and it was only fair to the childto get him to England or Paris or some such place where he could havedecent advantages. I gather that Angus let out a holler at first so thatEllabelle had to consult another specialist and have little Angusconsult one, too. They both said: 'Certainly, don't delay another day ifyou value the child's life or your own,' and of course Angus had to givein. I reckon that was the last real fight he ever put up till the timeI'm going to tell you about."They went to England and bought a castle that had never known theprofane touch of a plumber, having been built in the time of the firstearl or something, and after that they had to get another castle inFrance, account of little Angus having a weak throat that Ellabelle gotanother gentlemanly specialist to find out about him; and so it went,with Ellabelle hovering on the very edge of a nervous breakdown, andtaking up art and literature at different spots where fashion gathered,going to Italy and India's coral strand to study the dead past, and soforth, and learning to address her inferiors in a refined and hostilemanner, with little Angus having a maid and a governess and somethingnew the matter with him every time Ellabelle felt the need of a change."At first Angus used to make two trips back every year, then he cut themdown to one, and at last he'd only come every two or three years, havinghis hirelings come to him instead. He'd branched out a lot, even at thatdistance, getting into copper and such, and being president of banks andtrusts here and there and equitable cooperative companies and all suchthings that help to keep the lower classes trimmed proper. For a wholelot of years I didn't see either of 'em. I sort of lost track of theoutfit, except as I'd see the name of Angus heading a new board ofdirectors after the reorganization, or renting the north half ofScotland for the sage-hen and coyote shooting, or whatever the game isthere. Of course it took genius to do this with Angus, and I've neverdenied that Ellabelle has it. I bet there wasn't a day in all them yearsthat Angus didn't believe himself to be a stubborn, domineering brute,riding roughshod over the poor little wreck of a woman. If he didn't itwasn't for want of his wife accusing him of it in so many words--andperhaps a few more."I guess she got to feeling so sure of herself she let her work coarsenup. Anyway, when little Angus come to be eighteen his pa shocked her oneday by saying he must go back home to some good college. 'You meanEngland,' says Ellabelle, they being at the time on some other foreigndomains."'I do not,' says Angus, 'nor Sweden nor Japan nor East Africa. I meanthe United States.' 'You're jesting,' says she. 'You wrong me cruelly,'says Angus. 'The lad's eighteen and threatening to be a foreigner.Should he stay here longer it would set in his blood.' 'Remember hisweak throat,' says Ellabelle. 'I did,' says Angus. 'To save you troubleI sent for a specialist to look him over. He says the lad has never aflaw in his throat. We'll go soon.'"Of course it was dirty work on the part of Angus, getting to thespecialist first, but she saw she had to take it. She knew it was likethe time they agreed on his name--she could see the Scotch blood leapingin his veins. So she gave in with never a mutter that Angus could hear.That's part of the genius of Ellabelle, knowing when she can and whenshe positively cannot, and making no foolish struggle in the latterevent."Back they come to New York and young Angus went to the swellest collegeEllabelle could learn about, and they had a town house and a countryhouse and Ellabelle prepared to dazzle New York society, having metfrayed ends of it in her years abroad. But she couldn't seem to put itover. Lots of male and female society foreigners that she'd met wouldcome and put up with her and linger on in the most friendly manner, butEllabelle never fools herself so very much. She knew she wasn't makingthe least dent in New York itself. She got uncomfortable there. I betshe had that feeling you get when you're riding your horse over softground and all at once he begins to bog down."Anyway, they come West after a year or so, where Angus had more dragand Ellabelle could feel more important. Not back to Wallace, of course.Ellabelle had forgotten the name of that town, and also they come over aroad that misses the thriving little town of North Platte by severalhundred miles. And pretty soon they got into this darned swell littlesuburb out from San Francisco, through knowing one of the old familiesthat had lived there man and boy for upward of four years. It's a townwhere I believe they won't let you get off the train unless you got avisitor's card and a valet."Here at last Ellabelle felt she might come into her own, for partiesseemed to recognize her true worth at once. Some of them indeed shecould buffalo right on the spot, for she hadn't lived in Europe and suchplaces all them years for nothing. So, camping in a miserable rentedshack that never cost a penny over seventy thousand dollars, with onlythirty-eight rooms and no proper space for the servants, they set towork building their present marble palace--there's inside and outsidepictures of it in a magazine somewhere round here--bigger than the stateinsane asylum and very tasty and expensive, with hand-painted ceilingsand pergolas and cafes and hot and cold water and everything."It was then I first see Ellabelle after all the years, and I want totell you she was impressive. She looked like the descendant of a longline of ancestry or something and she spoke as good as any reciter youever heard in a hall. Last time I had seen her she was still forgettingabout the r's--she'd say: 'Oh, there-urr you ah!' thus showing she wasat least half Iowa in breed--but nothing like that now. She could givethe English cards and spades and beat them at their own game. Her facelooked a little bit overmassaged and she was having trouble keeping herhips down, and wore a patent chin-squeezer nights, and her hair couldn'tbe trusted to itself long at a time; but she knew how to dress and she'dlearned decency in the use of the diamond except when it was reallyproper to break out all over with 'em. You'd look at her twice in anyshow ring. Ain't women the wonders! Gazing at Ellabelle when she hadeverything on, you'd never dream that she'd come up from the vilestdregs only a few years before--helping cook for the harvest hands inIowa, feeding Union Pacific passengers at twenty-two a month, orsplitting her own kindling at Wallace, Idaho, and dreaming about a newsilk dress for next year, or mebbe the year after if things went well."Men ain't that way. Angus had took no care of his figure, which was nowpouchy, his hair was gray, and he was either shedding or had beenreached, and he had lines of care and food in his face, and took nopains whatever with his accent--or with what he said, for that matter. Inever saw a man yet that could hide a disgraceful past like a woman can.They don't seem to have any pride. Most of 'em act like they don't carea hoot whether people find it out on 'em or not."Angus was always reckless that way, adding to his wife's burden ofanxiety. She'd got her own vile past well buried, but she never knewwhen his was going to stick its ugly head up out of its grave. He'd goalong all right for a while like one of the best set had ought to--thenZooey! We was out to dinner at another millionaire's one night--in thattown you're either a millionaire or drawing wages from one--and Angustalked along with his host for half an hour about the impossibility ofgetting a decent valet on this side of the water, Americans not knowingtheir place like the English do, till you'd have thought he was born toit, and then all at once he breaks out about the hardwood finish to thedining-room, and how the art of graining has perished and ought to berevived. 'And I wish I had a silver dollar,' he says, 'for every doorlike that one there that I've grained to resemble the natural wood socunningly you'd never guess it--hardly.'"At that his break didn't faze any one but Ellabelle. The host was anold train-robber who'd cut your throat for two bits--I'll bet hecouldn't play an honest game of solitaire--and he let out himself rightoff that he had once worked in a livery stable and was proud of it; butpoor Ellabelle, who'd been talking about the dear Countess of Comtessaor somebody, and the dukes and earls that was just one-two-three withher on the other side, she blushed up till it almost showed through thesecond coating. Angus was certainly poison ivy to her on occasion, andhe'd refuse to listen to reason when she called him down about it. He'ddo most of the things she asked him to about food and clothes and soforth--like the time he had the two gold teeth took out and replaced byreal porcelain nature fakers--but he never could understand why hewasn't free to chat about the days when he earned what money he had."It was this time that I first saw little Angus since he had changedfrom a governess to a governor--or whatever they call the he-teacher ofa millionaire's brat. He was home for the summer vacation. Naturally I'dbeen prejudiced against him not only by his mother's praise but by hisfather's steady coppering of the same. Judiciously comparing the two, Iwas led to expect a kind of cross between Little Lord Fauntleroy and thelate Sitting Bull, with the vices of each and the virtues of neither.Instead of which I found him a winsome whelp of six-foot or so withScotch eyes and his mother's nose and chin and a good, big, straightmouth, and full of the most engaging bedevilments for one and all. Hedidn't seem to be any brighter in his studies than a brute of that ageshould be, and though there was something easy and grand in his mannerthat his pa and ma never had, he wasn't really any more foreign thanwhat I be. Of course he spoke Eastern American instead of Western, butyou forgive him that after a few minutes when you see how nice henaturally meant to be. I admit we took to each other from the start.They often say I'm a good mixer, but it took no talent to get next tothat boy. I woke up the first night thinking I knew what old silly woulddo her darndest to adopt him if ever his poor pa and ma was to getbuttered over the right of way in some railroad accident."And yet I didn't see Angus, Junior, one bit the way either of hisparents saw him. Ellabelle seemed to look on him merely as a smartdresser and social know-it-all that would be a 98 cent credit to her inthe position of society queen for which the good God had always intendedher. And his father said he wasn't any good except to idle away his timeand spend money, and would come to a bad end by manslaughter in ahigh-powered car; or in the alcoholic ward of some hospital; that hewas, in fact, a mere helling scapegrace that would have been put in somegood detention home years before if he hadn't been born to a father thatwas all kinds of a so-and-so old Scotch fool. There you get Angus,_fills_, from three different slants, and I ain't saying there wasn'tjustification for the other two besides mine. The boy could act in acrowd of tea-drinking women with a finish that made his father look likesome one edging in to ask where they wanted the load of coal dumped. Butalso Angus, _peer_, was merely painting the lily, as they say, when he'dtell all the different kinds of Indian the boy was. That very summerbefore he went back to the educational centre where they teach sucharts, he helped wreck a road house a few miles up the line till itlooked like one of them pictures of what a Zeppelin does to a rare oldEnglish drug store in London. And a week later he lost a race with theLos Angeles flyer, account of not having as good a roadbed to run on asthe train had, and having to take too short a turn with his new car."I remember we three was wondering where he could be that night thetelephone rung from the place where kindly strangers had hauled him forfirst aid to the foolish. But it was the boy himself that was able totalk and tell his anxious parents to forget all about it. His fathertook the message and as soon as he got the sense of it he begun to gethopeful that the kid had broke at least one leg--thinking, he must havebeen, of the matched pacing stallions that once did himself such a goodturn without meaning to. His disappointment was pitiful as he turned tous after learning that he had lit on his head but only sustained a fewbruises and sprains and concussions, with the wall-paper scraped offhere and there."'Struck on his head, the only part of him that seems invulnerable,'says the fond father. 'What's that?' he yells, for the boy was talkingagain. He listened a minute, and it was right entertaining to watch hisface work as the words come along. It registered all the evil thatScotland has suffered from her oppressors since they first thought upthe name for it. Finally he begun to splutter back--it must have soundedfine at the other end--but he had to hang up, he was that emotional.After he got his face human again he says to us:"'Would either of you think now that you could guess at what might havebeen his dying speech? Would you guess it might be words of cheer to thebereaved mother that nursed him, or even a word of comfort to the idiotfather that never touched whipleather to his back while he was stillhusky enough to get by with it? Well, you'd guess wild. He's butinflamed with indignation over the state of the road where he passed outfor some minutes. He says it's a disgrace to any civilized community,and he means to make trouble about it with the county supervisor, whomust be a murderer at heart, and then he'll take it up to the supremecourt and see if we can't have roads in this country as good asNapoleon the First made them build in France, so a gentleman can speedup a bit over five miles an hour without breaking every bone in hisbody, to say nothing of totally ruining a car costing forty-eighthundred dollars of his good money, with the ink on the check for itscarce dry. He was going on to say that he had the race for the crossingas good as won and had just waved mockingly at the engineer of thedefeated train who was pretending to feel indifferent about it--but Ihung up on him. My strength was waning. Was he here this minute I makeno doubt I'd go to the mat with him, unequal as we are in prowess.' Hedribbled off into vicious mutterings of what he'd say to the boy if hewas to come to the door."Then dear Ellabelle pipes up: 'And doesn't the dear boy say who waswith him in this prank?'"Angus snorted horribly at the word 'prank,' just like he'd never hadone single advantage of foreign travel. 'He does indeed--one of thoseHammersmith twin louts was with him--the speckled devil with the lisp, Igather--and praise God his bones, at least, are broke in two places!'"Ellabelle's eyes shined up at this with real delight. 'How terrible!'she says, not looking it. 'That's Gerald Hammersmith, son of Mrs. St.John Hammersmith, leader of the most exclusive set here--oh, she's quitein the lead of everything that has class! And after this we must knoweach other far, far better than we have in the past. She has nevercalled up to this time. I must inquire after her poor boy directlyto-morrow comes.' That is Ellabelle. Trust her not to overlook a singlebet."Angus again snorted in a common way. 'St. John Hammersmith!' says he,steaming up, 'When he trammed ore for three-fifty a day and went to bedwith his clothes on any night he'd the price of a quart of gin-and-beermixed--liking to get his quick--his name was naked 'John' with never aSaint to it, which his widow tacked on a dozen years later. And speakingof names, Mrs. McDonald, I sorely regret you didn't name your own sonafter your first willful fancy. It was no good day for his father whenyou put my own name to him.'"But Ellabelle paid no attention whatever to this rough stuff, beingalready engaged in courting the Hammersmith dame for the good of hersocial importance. I make no doubt before the maid finished rubbing inthe complexion cream that night she had reduced this upstart to theranks and stepped into her place as leader of the most exclusive socialset between South San Francisco and old Henry Miller's ranch house atGilroy. Anyway, she kept talking to herself about it, almost over themangled remains of her own son, as you might say."A year later the new mansion was done, setting in the centre of sixtyacres of well-manicured land as flat as a floor and naturally calledHillcrest. Angus asked me down for another visit. There had been granddoings to open the new house, and Ellabelle felt she was on the way toruling things social with an iron hand if she was just careful anddidn't overbet her cards. Angus, not being ashamed of his scandalouspast, was really all that kept her nerves strung up. It seems he'd giveher trouble while the painters and decorators was at work, hanging round'em fascinated and telling 'em how he'd had to work ten hours a day inhis time and how he could grain a door till it looked exactly like thenatural wood, so they'd say it wasn't painted at all. And one day hebecome so inflamed with evil desire that Ellabelle, escorting a bunch ofthe real triple-platers through the mansion, found him with his coat offlearning how to rub down a hardwood panel with oil and pumice stone.Gee! Wouldn't I like to of been there! I suppose I got a lower nature aswell as the rest of us."After I'd been there a few days, along comes Angus, _fills_, out intothe world from college to make a name for himself. By ingenuity ornative brute force he had contrived to graduate. He was nice as ever andtold me he was going to look about a bit until he could decide what hisfield of endeavour should be. Apparently it was breaking his neck inoutdoor sports, including loop-the-loop in his new car on roads notmeant for it, and delighting Ellabelle because he was a fine social dragin her favour, and enraging his father by the same reasons. Ellabellewas especially thrilled by his making up to a girl that was daughter tothis here old train-robber I mentioned. It was looking like he mightform an alliance, as they say, with this old family which had livedquite a decent life since they actually got it. The girl looked to menice enough even for Angus, Junior, but his pa denounced her as ayellow-haired pest with none but frivolous aims in life, who wouldn'tknow whether a kitchen was a room in a house or a little woolly animalfrom Paraguay. We had some nice, friendly breakfasts, I believe not,whilst they discussed this poisonous topic, old Angus being only furtherembittered when it comes out that the train-robber is also dead setagainst this here alliance because his only daughter needs a decent,reputable man who would come home nights from some low mahogany den in abank building, and not a worthless young hound that couldn't make adollar of his own and had displayed no talent except for winning thenotice of head waiters and policemen. Old Angus says he knows wellenough his son can be arrested out of most crowds just on thatdescription alone, but who is this So-and-So old thug to be saying it inpublic?"And so it went, with Ellabelle living in high hopes and young Angusbusy inventing new ways to bump himself off, and old Angus getting moreand more seething--quiet enough outside, but so desperate inside that itwasn't any time at all till I saw he was just waiting for a good chanceto make some horrible Scotch exhibition of himself."Then comes the fatal polo doings, with young Angus playing on the sidethat won, and Ellabelle being set up higher than ever till she actuallybegins to snub people here and there at the game that look like they'dswallow it, and old Angus ashamed and proud and glaring round as if he'dlike to hear some one besides himself call his son a worthless younghound--if they wanted to start something."And the polo victory of course had to be celebrated by a banquet at thehotel, attended by all the players and their huskiest ruffian friends.They didn't have the ponies there, but I guess they would of if they'dthought of it. It must have been a good banquet, with vintages and songand that sort of thing--I believe they even tried to have food atfirst--and hearty indoor sports with the china and silver and chairsthat had been thoughtlessly provided and a couple of big mirrors thatlooked as if you could throw a catsup bottle clear through them, onlyyou couldn't, because it would stop there after merely breaking theglass, and spatter in a helpless way."And of course there was speeches. The best one, as far as I couldlearn, was made by the owner of the outraged premises at a latehour--when the party was breaking up--as you might put it. He said thebill would be about eighteen hundred dollars, as near as he could tellat first glance. He was greeted with hearty laughter and applause fromthe high-spirited young incendiaries and retired hastily through anunsuspected door to the pantry as they rushed for him. It was then theyfound out what to do with the rest of the catsup--and did it--so thewalls and ceiling wouldn't look so monotonous, and fixed the windows sothey would let out the foul tobacco smoke, and completed a largepainting of the Yosemite that hung on the wall, doing several things toit that hadn't occurred to the artist in his hurry, and performed aserious operation on the piano without the use of gas. The tables, Ibelieve, was left flat on their backs."Angus, _fills_, was fetched home in a car by a gang of his roguishyoung playmates. They stopped down on the stately drive under my windowand a quartet sung a pathetic song that run:    "Don't forget your parents,    Think all they done for you!"Then young Angus ascended the marble steps to the top one, bared hisagreeable head to the moonlight, and made them a nice speech. He saidthe campaign now in progress, fellow-citizens, marked the gravest crisisin the affairs of our grand old state that an intelligent constituencyhad ever been called upon to vote down, but that he felt they were onthe eve of a sweeping victory that would sweep the corrupt hell-houndsof a venal opposition into an ignominy from which they would never beswept by any base act of his while they honoured him with theirsuffrages, because his life was an open book and he challenged anyson-of-a-gun within sound of his voice to challenge this to his face ortake the consequences of being swept into oblivion by the high tide ofa people's indignation that would sweep everything before it on thethird day of November next, having been aroused in its might at lastfrom the debasing sloth into which the corrupt hell-hounds of a venalopposition had swept them, but a brighter day had dawned, which wouldsweep the onrushing hordes of petty chicanery to where they would gettheirs; and, as one who had heard the call of an oppressed people, hewould accept this fitting testimonial, not for its intrinsic worth butfor the spirit in which it was tendered. As for the nefarious tariff onwatch springs, sawed lumber, and indigo, he would defer his masterlydiscussion of these burning issues to a more fitting time because a manhad to get a little sleep now and then or he wasn't any good next day.In the meantime he thanked them one and all, and so, gentlemen,good-night."The audience cheered hoarsely and drove off. I guess the speech wouldhave been longer if a light hadn't showed in the east wing of the castlewhere Angus, _peer_, slept. And then all was peace and quiet till thestorm broke on a rocky coast next day. It didn't really break untilevening, but suspicious clouds no bigger than a man's hand might havebeen observed earlier. If young Angus took any breakfast that morning itwas done in the privacy of his apartment under the pitying glances of avalet or something. But here he was at lunch, blithe as ever, and fullof merry details about the late disaster. He spoke with much humourabout a wider use for tomato catsup than was ever encouraged by the oldschool of house decorators. Old Angus listened respectfully, taking onlya few bites of food but chewing them long and thoughtfully. Ellabellewas chiefly interested in the names of the hearty young vandals. She wasdelighted to learn that they was all of the right set, and her eyesglowed with pride. The eyes of Angus, _peer_, was now glowing with whatI could see was something else, though I couldn't make out just what itwas. He never once exploded like you'd of thought he was due to."Then come a note for the boy which the perfect-mannered Englishman thatwas tending us said was brought by a messenger. Young Angus glanced atthe page and broke out indignantly. 'The thieving old pirate!' he says.'Last night he thought it would be about eighteen hundred dollars, andthat sounded hysterical enough for the few little things we'd scratchedor mussed up. I told him he would doubtless feel better this morning,but in any event to send the bill to me and I would pay it.'"'Quite right of you,' says Ellabelle proudly."'And now the scoundrel sends me one for twenty-three hundred and odd.He's a robber, net!'"Old Angus said never a word, but chewed slowly, whilst various puzzlingexpressions chased themselves acrost his eloquent face. I couldn't makea thing out of any of them."'Never patronize the fellow again,' says Ellabelle warmly."'As to that,' says her son, 'he hinted something last night abouthaving me arrested if I ever tried to patronize him again, but thatisn't the point. He's robbing me now.'"'Oh, money!' says Ellabelle in a low tone of disgust and with a gesturelike she was rebuking her son for mentioning such a thing before theservant."'But I don't like to be taken advantage of,' says he, looking veryannoyed and grand. Then old Angus swallowed something he'd been chewingfor eight minutes and spoke up with an entirely new expression thatpuzzled me more than ever."'If you're sure you have the right of it, don't you submit to theoutrage.'"Angus, Junior, backed up a little bit at this, not knowing quite how totake the old man's mildness. 'Oh, of course the fellow might win out ifhe took it into court,' he says. 'Every one knows the courts are just amass of corruption.'"'True, I've heard gossip to that effect,' says his father. 'Yet theremust be some way to thwart the crook. I'm feeling strangely ingenious atthe moment.' He was very mild, and yet there was something sinister andScotch about him that the boy felt."'Of course I'd pay it out of my own money,' he remarks generously."'Even so, I hate to see you cheated,' says his father kindly. 'I hateto have you pay unjust extortions out of the mere pittance yourtight-fisted old father allows you.'"Young Angus said nothing to this, but blushed and cougheduncomfortably."'If you hurt that hotel anything like twenty-three hundred dollars'worth, it must be an interesting sight,' his father goes on brightly."'Oh, it was funny at the time,' says Angus boy, cheering up again."'Things often are,' says old Angus. 'I'll have a look.'"'At the bill?'"'No, at the wreck,' says he. The old boy was still quiet on theoutside, but was plainly under great excitement, for he now folded hisnapkin with care, a crime of which I knew Ellabelle had broken him thefirst week in New York, years before. I noticed their butler had thefine feeling to look steadily away at the wall during this obscenity.The offender then made a pleasant remark about the beauty of the day andleft the palatial apartment swiftly. Young Angus and his mother lookedat each other and strolled after him softly over rugs costing abouteighty thousand dollars. The husband and father was being driven off bya man he could trust in a car they had let him have for his own use.Later Ellabelle confides to me that she mistrusts old Angus iscontemplating some bit of his national deviltry. 'He had a strange lookon his face,' says she, 'and you know--once a Scotchman, always aScotchman! Oh, it would be pitiful if he did anything peculiarly Scotchjust at our most critical period here!' Then she felt of her face tosee if there was any nervous lines come into it, and there was, and shebeat it for the maid to have 'em rubbed out ere they set."Yet at dinner that night everything seemed fine, with old Angus asjovial as I'd ever seen him, and the meal come to a cheerful end and wewas having coffee in the Looey de Medisee saloon, I think it is, beforea word was said about this here injured hotel."'You were far too modest this morning, you sly dog!' says Angus,_peer_, at last, chuckling delightedly. 'You misled me grievously. Thatjob of wrecking shows genius of a quality that was all too rare in mytime. I suspect it's the college that does it. I shouldn't wonder now ifgoing through college is as good as a liberal education. I don't believemere uneducated house-wreckers could have done so pretty a job in twicethe time, and there's clever little touches they never would havethought of at all.'"'It did look thorough when we left,' says young Angus, not quiteknowing whether to laugh."'It's nothing short of sublime,' says his father proudly. 'I stood inthat deserted banquet hall, though it looks never a bit like one, withruin and desolation on every hand as far as the eye could reach. Itinspired such awe in the bereaved owner and me that we instinctivelyspoke in hushed whispers. I've had no such gripping sensation as thatsince I gazed upon the dead city of Pompeii. No longer can it be saidthat Europe possesses all the impressive ruins.'"Angus boy grinned cheerfully now, feeling that this tribute washeartfelt."'I suspect now,' goes on the old boy, 'that when the wreckage iscleared away we shall find the mangled bodies of several that perishedwhen the bolts descended from a clear sky upon the gay scene.'"'Perhaps under the tables,' says young Angus, chirking up still more atthis geniality. 'Two or three went down early and may still be there.'"'Yet twenty-three hundred for it is a monstrous outrage,' says the oldman, changing his voice just a mite. 'Too well I know the cost of suchrepairs. Fifteen hundred at most would make the place better thanever--and to think that you, struggling along to keep up appearances onthe little I give you, should be imposed upon by a crook thatundoubtedly has the law on his side! I could endure no thought of it, soI foiled him.'"'How?' says young Angus, kind of alarmed."Angus, _peer_, yawned and got up. 'It's a long story and would hardlyinterest you,' says he, moving over to the door. 'Besides, I must be tobed against the morrow, which will be a long, hard day for me.' Hisvoice had tightened up."'What have you done?' demands Ellabelle passionately."'Saved your son eight hundred dollars,' says Angus, 'or the equivalentof his own earnings for something like eight hundred years at currentprices for labour.'"'I've a right to know,' says Ellabelle through her teeth and stiffeningin her chair. Young Angus just set there with his mouth open."'So you have,' says old Angus, and he goes on as crisp as a bunch ofcelery: 'I told you I felt ingenious. I've kept this money in the familyby the simple device of taking the job. I've engaged two other paintersand decorators besides myself, a carpenter, an electrician, a glazier,and a few proletariats of minor talent for clearing away the wreckage. Ishall be on the job at eight. The loafers won't start at seven, as Iused to. Don't think I'd see any son of mine robbed before my very eyes.My new overalls are laid out and my valet has instructions to get meinto them at seven, though he persists in believing I'm to attend afancy-dress ball at some strangely fashionable hour. So I bid you allgood evening.'"Well, I guess that was the first time Ellabelle had really let go ofherself since she was four years old or thereabouts. Talk about theempress of stormy emotion! For ten minutes the room sounded like atorture chamber of the dark Middle Ages. But the doctor reached there atlast in a swift car, and him and the two maids managed to get her laidout all comfortable and moaning, though still with outbreaks about everytwenty minutes that I could hear clear over on my side of the house."And down below my window on the marble porch Angus, _fills_, waswalking swiftly up and down for about one hour. He made no speech likethe night before. He just walked and walked. The part that struck me wasthat neither of them had ever seemed to have the slightest notion ofpleading old Angus out of his mad folly. They both seemed to know theScotch when it did break out."At seven-thirty the next morning the old boy in overalls and jumper anda cap was driven to his job in a car as big as an apartment house. Thecurtains to Ellabelle's Looey Seez boudoir remained drawn, with hourlybulletins from the two Swiss maids that she was passing away in greatagony. Angus, Junior, was off early, too, in his snakiest car. A fewminutes later they got a telephone from him sixty miles away that hewould not be home to lunch. Old Angus had taken his own lunch with himin a tin pail he'd bought the day before, with a little cupola on topfor the cup to put the bottle of cold coffee in."It was a joyous home that day, if you don't care how you talk. All itneeded was a crepe necktie on the knob of the front door. That orneryold hound, Angus, got in from his work at six, spotty with paint andsmelling of oil and turpentine, but cheerful as a new father. He washedup, ridding himself of at least a third of the paint smell, looked in atEllabelle's door to say, 'What! Not feeling well, mamma? Now, that's toobad!' ate a hearty dinner with me, young Angus not having been heardfrom further, and fell asleep in a gold armchair at ten minutes pastnine."He was off again next morning. Ellabelle's health was still breakingdown, but young Angus sneaked in and partook of a meagre lunch with me.He was highly vexed with his pa. 'He's nothing but a scoundrelly oldliar,' he says to me, 'saying that he gives me but a pittance. He'salways given me a whale of an allowance. Why, actually, I've more thanonce had money left over at the end of the quarter. And now his talkabout saving money! I tell you he has some other reason than money forbreaking the mater's heart.' The boy looked very shrewd as he said this."That night at quitting time he was strangely down at the place with hisown car to fetch his father home. 'I'll trust you this once,' says theold man, getting in and looking more then ever like a dissolute workingman. On the way they passed this here yellow-haired daughter of the oldtrain-robber that there had been talk of the boy making a match with.She was driving her own car and looked neither to right nor left."'Not speaking?' says old Angus."'She didn't see us,' says the boy."'She's ashamed of your father,' says the old man."'She's not,' says the boy."'You know it,' says the old scoundrel."'I'll show her,' says his son."Well, we had another cheerful evening, with Ellabelle sending word toold Angus that she wanted me to have the necklace of brilliants with thesapphire pendant, and the two faithful maids was to get suitablekeepsakes out of the rest of her jewels, and would her son always wearthe seal ring with her hair in it that she had given him when he wastwenty? And the old devil started in to tell how much he could havesaved by taking charge of the work in his own house, and how a union mannowadays would do just enough to keep within the law, and so on; but hegot to yawning his head off and retired at nine, complaining that hisvalet that morning had cleaned and pressed his overalls. Young Anguslooked very shrewd at me and again says: 'The old liar! He has someother reason than money. He can't fool me.'"I kind of gathered from both of them the truth of what happened thenext day. Young Angus himself showed up at the job about nine A.M., witha bundle under his arm. 'Where's the old man?' his father heard himdemand of the carpenter, he usually speaking of old Angus as thegovernor."'Here,' says he from the top of a stepladder in the entry which lookedas if a glacier had passed through it."'Could you put me to work?' says the boy."'Don't get me to shaking with laughter up here,' says the old brute.'Can't you see I'd be in peril of falling off?'"Young Angus undoes his bundle and reveals overalls and a jumper whichhe gets into quickly. 'What do I do first?' says he."His father went on kalsomining and took never a look at him more. 'Thetime has largely passed here,' says he, 'for men that haven't learned todo something, but you might take some of the burnt umber there and workit well into a big gob of that putty till it's brown enough to match thewoodwork. Should you display the least talent for that we may see laterif you've any knack with a putty knife.'"The new hand had brought no lunch with him, but his father spared him afew scraps from his own, and they all swigged beer from a pail of itthey sent out for. So the scandal was now complete in all its details.The palatial dining-room that night, being a copy of a good church orsomething from ancient Italy, smelled like a paint shop indeed--andsounded like one through dinner. 'That woodwork will be fit tosecond-coat first thing in the morning,' says old Angus. 'I'll have itsandpapered in no time,' says the boy. 'Your sandpapering ain't bad,'says the other, 'though you have next to no skill with a brush.' 'Ithought I was pretty good with that flat one though.' 'Oh, fair; justfair! First-coating needs little finesse. There! I forgot to order morerubbing varnish. Maybe the men will think of it.' And so on till theyboth yawned themselves off to their Scotch Renaysence apartments.Ellabelle had not yet learned the worst. It seemed to be felt that shehad a right to perish without suffering the added ignominy of knowingher son was acting like a common wage slave."They was both on the job next day. Of course the disgraceful affair hadby now penetrated to the remotest outlying marble shack. Several malemillionaires this day appeared on the scene to josh Angus, _peer_, andAngus, _fills_, as they toiled at their degrading tasks. Not muchattention was paid to 'em, it appears, not even to the old train-robberwho come to jest and remained to cross-examine Angus about how much hewas really going to clear on the job, seriously now. Anything like thatwas bound to fascinate the old crook."And next day, close to quitting time, what happens but this here robberchieftain's petted daughter coming in and hanging round and begging tobe let to help because it was such jolly fun. I believe she did get holdof a square of sandpaper with which she daintily tried to remove somefresh varnish that should have been let strictly alone; and when theyboth ordered her out in a frenzy of rage, what does she do but wait for'em with her car which she made them enter and drove them to their abodelike they belonged to the better class of people that one would care toknow. The two fools was both kind of excited about this that night."The next day she breezes in again and tries to get them to knock off anhour early so she can take them to the country club for tea, but theyrefuse this, so she makes little putty statues of them both and drove afew nails where they would do no good and upset a bucket of paste andleaned a two-hundred-dollar lace thing against a varnished wall to thedetriment of both, and fell off a stepladder. Old Angus caught her andboxed her ears soundly. And again she drove them through the avenues ofa colony of fine old families with money a little bit older, by a fewdays, and up the drive to their own door."Ellabelle was peeking between the plush curtains on this occasion, forsome heartless busybody during the day had told her that her son andhusband was both renegades now. And strangely enough, she begun to getback her strength from that very moment--seeing that exclusive andwell-known young debby-tant consorting in public with the reprobates.I'm darned if she didn't have the genius after that to treat the wholething as a practical joke, especially when she finds out that none ofthem exclusives had had it long enough to look down on anothermillionaire merely for pinching a penny now and then. Old Angus as amatter of fact had become just a little more important than she had everbeen and could have snubbed any one he wanted to. The only single one inthe whole place that throwed him down was his own English valet. He wasfound helpless drunk in a greenhouse the third day, having ruined ninethousand dollars' worth of orchids he'd gone to sleep amongst, and heresigned his position with bitter dignity the moment he recoveredconsciousness."Moreover, young Angus and this girl clenched without furtheropposition. Her train-robber father said the boy must have something inhim even if he didn't look it, and old Angus said he still believed thegirl to be nothing but a yellow-haired soubrette; but what should weexpect of a woman, after all?"The night the job was finished we had the jolliest dinner of my visit,with a whole gang of exclusive-setters at the groaning board, includingthis girl and her folks, and champagne, of which Angus, _peer_, consumednear one of the cut-glass vases full."I caught him with young Angus in the deserted library later, while therest was one-stepping in the Henry Quatter ballroom or dance hall. Theold man had his arms pretty well upon the boy's shoulders. Yes, sir, hewas almost actually hugging him. The boy fled to this gilded cafe wherethe rest was, and old Angus, with his eyes shining very queer, he grabsme by the arm and says, 'Once when he was very small--though unusuallylarge for his age of three, mind you--he had a way of scratching my facesomething painful with his little nails, and all in laughing play, youknow. I tried to warn him, but he couldn't understand, of course; so,not knowing how else to instruct him, I scratched back one day, laughingmyself like he was, but sinking my nails right fierce into the back ofhis little fat neck. He relaxed the tension in his own fingers. He washurt, for the tears started, but he never cried. He just looked puzzledand kept on laughing, being bright to see I could play the game, too.Only he saw it wasn't so good a game as he'd thought. I wonder whatmade me think of that, now! I don't know. Come--from yonder doorway wecan see him as he dances.'"And Ellabelle was saying gently to one and all, with her merry peal oflaughter, 'Ah, yes--once a Scotchman, always--'"My land! It's ten o'clock. Don't them little white-faced beauties makethe music! Honestly I'd like to have a cot out in the corral. We miss alot of it in here."VNON PLUSH ULTRASunday and a driving rain had combined to keep Ma Pettengill within theArrowhead ranch house. Neither could have done this alone. The rainwould merely have added a slicker to her business costume of khakiriding breeches, laced boots, and flannel shirt as she rode abroad;while a clement Sabbath would have seen her "resting," as she would putit, in and round the various outbuildings, feeding-pens, blacksmithshop, harness-room, branding-chute, or what not, issuing orders toattentive henchmen from time to time; diagnosing the gray mule'sbarbed-wire cut; compounding a tonic for Adolph, the big milk-strainDurham bull, who has been ailing; wishing to be told why in somethingthe water hadn't been turned into that south ditch; and, like acompetent general, disposing her forces and munitions for the campaignof the coming week. But Sunday--and a wildly rainy Sunday--had housedher utterly.Being one who can idle with no grace whatever she was engaged in whatshe called putting the place to rights. This meant taking out thecontents of bureau drawers and wardrobes and putting them back again,massing the litter on the big table in the living-room into an involvedgeometry of neat piles that would endure for all of an hour,straightening pictures on the walls, eliminating the home-circles ofspiders long unmolested, loudly calling upon Lew Wee, the Chinaman, whoaffrightedly fled farther and farther after each call, and ever andagain booming pained surmises through the house as to what fearful stateit would get to be in if she didn't fight it to a clean finish once in adog's age.The woman dumped a wastebasket of varied rubbish into the open fire,leaned a broom against the mantel, readjusted the towel that protectedher gray hair from the dust--hair on week days exposed with never aqualm to all manner of dust--cursed all Chinamen on land or sea with anespecial and piquant blight invoked upon the one now in hiding, thentook from the back of a chair where she had hung it the moment before ariding skirt come to feebleness and decrepitude. She held it up beforecritical eyes as one scanning the morning paper for headlines ofsignificance."Ruined!" she murmured. Even her murmur must have reached Lew Wee, howremote soever his isle of safety. "Worn one time and all ruined up!That's what happens for trying to get something for nothing. You'd thinkwomen would learn. You would if you didn't know a few. Hetty Daggett,her that was Hetty Tipton, orders this by catalogue, No. 3456 orsomething, from the mail-order house in Chicago. I was down in Red Gapwhen it come. 'Isn't it simply wonderful what you can get for threethirty-eight!' says she with gleaming eyes, laying this thing out beforeme. 'I don't see how they can ever do it for the money.' She found outthe next day when she rode up here in it with me and Mr. BurchellDaggett, her husband. Nothing but ruin! Seams all busted, sleazy clothwore through. But Hetty just looks it over cheerfully and says: 'Oh,well, what can you expect for three thirty-eight?' Is that like a womanor is it like something science has not yet discovered?"That Hetty child is sure one woman. This skirt would never have heldtogether to ride back in, so she goes down as far as the narrow gauge inthe wagon with Buck Devine, wearing a charming afternoon frock of paleblue charmeuse rather than get into a pair of my khakis and ride backwith her own lawful-wedded husband; yes, sir; married to him safe asanything, but wouldn't forget her womanhood. Only once did she ever comenear it. I saved her then because she hadn't snared Mr. Burchell Daggettyet, and of course a girl has to be a little careful. And she took mycounsels so much to heart she's been careful ever since. 'Why, I shouldsimply die of mortification if my dear mate were to witness me inthose,' says she when I'm telling her to take a chance for once and getinto these here riding pants of mine because it would be uncomfortablegoing down in that wagon. 'But what is my comfort compared to dearBurchell's peace of mind?' says she."Ain't we the goods, though, when we do once learn a thing? Of coursemost of us don't have to learn stuff like this. Born in us. I shouldn'twonder if they was something in the talk of this man Shaw or Shavian--Isee the name spelled both ways in the papers. I can't read his piecesmyself because he rasps me, being not only a smarty but a vegetarian. Idon't know. I might stand one or the other purebred, but the cross seemsto bring out the worst strain in both. I once got a line on his beliefsand customs though--like it appears he don't believe anything ought tobe done for its own sake but only for some good purpose. It was one dayI got caught at a meeting of the Onward and Upward Club in Red Gap andMrs. Alonzo Price read a paper about his meaning. I hope she didn'twrong him. I hope she was justified in all she said he really means inhis secret heart. No one ought to talk that way about any one if theyain't got the goods on 'em. One thing I might have listened to with somepatience if the man et steaks and talked more like some one you'd careto have in your own home. In fact, I listened to it anyway. Maybe hetook it from some book he read--about woman and her true nature.According to Henrietta Templeton Price, as near as I could get her, thisShaw or Shavian believes that women is merely a flock of men-hawkscircling above the herd till they see a nice fat little lamb of a man,then one fell swoop and all is over but the screams of the victim dyingout horribly. They bear him off to their nest in a blasted pine and pickthe meat from his bones at leisure. Of course that ain't the way ladieswas spoken of in the Aunt Patty Little Helper Series I got out of thePresbyterian Sabbath-school library back in Fredonia, New York, when Iwas thirteen--and yet--and yet--as they say on the stage in these playsof high or English life."It sounded promising enough, and the dust had now settled so that Icould dimly make out the noble lines of my hostess. I begged for more."Well, go on--Mrs. Burchell Daggett once nearly forgot her womanhood.Certainly, go on, if it's anything that would be told outside of asmoking-car."The lady grinned."Many of us has forgot our womanhood in the dear, dead past," sheconfessed. "Me? Sure! Where's that photo album. Where did I put thatalbum anyway? That's the way in this house. Get things straightened uponce, you can't find a single one you want. Look where I put it now!"She demolished an obelisk of books on the table, one she had latelyconstructed with some pains, and brought the album that had been itspedestal. "Get me there, do you?"It was the photograph of a handsome young woman in the voluminous ridingskirt of years gone by, before the side-saddle became extinct. She helda crop and wore an astoundingly plumed bonnet. Despite the offensivedisguise, one saw provocation for the course adopted by the lateLysander John Pettengill at about that period."Very well--now get me here, after I'd been on the ranch only a month."It was the same young woman in the not too foppish garb of a cowboy. Inwide-brimmed hat, flannel shirt, woolly chaps, quirt in hand, shebestrode a horse that looked capable and daring."Yes, sir, I hadn't been here only a month when I forgot my womanhoodlike that. Gee! How good it felt to get into 'em and banish thatsideshow tent of a skirt. I'd never known a free moment before and Iblessed Lysander John for putting me up to it. Then, proud as Punch,what do I do but send one of these photos back to dear old AuntWaitstill, in Fredonia, thinking she would rejoice at the wild, freelife I was now leading in the Far West. And what do I get for it but atear-spotted letter of eighteen pages, with a side-kick from her pastor,the Reverend Abner Hemingway, saying he wishes to indorse every word ofSister Baxter's appeal to me--asking why do I parade myself shamelesslyin this garb of a fallen woman, and can nothing be said to recall me tothe true nobility that must still be in my nature but which I amforgetting in these licentious habiliments, and so on! The picture hadbeen burned after giving the Reverend his own horrified flash of it, andthey would both pray daily that I might get up out of this degradationand be once more a good, true woman that some pure little child wouldnot be ashamed to call the sacred name of mother."Such was Aunt Waitstill--what names them poor old girls had to standfor! I had another aunt named Obedience, only she proved to be a regularcinch-binder. Her name was never mentioned in the family after she sliddown a rainspout one night and eloped to marry a depraved scoundrel whodrove through there on a red wagon with tinware inside that he wouldtrade for old rags. I'm just telling you how times have changed in spiteof the best efforts of a sanctified ministry. I cried over that letterat first. Then I showed it to Lysander John, who said 'Oh, hell!' beinga man of few words, so I felt better and went right on forgetting mywomanhood in that shameless garb of a so-and-so--though where aunty hadgot her ideas of such I never could make out--and it got to be so much amatter of course and I had so many things to think of besides mywomanhood that I plumb forgot the whole thing until this social upheavalin Red Gap a few years ago."I got to tell you that the wild and lawless West, in all mattersrelating to proper dress for ladies, is the most conservative andhidebound section of our great land of the free and home of thebrave--if you can get by with it. Out here the women see by the Sundaypapers that it's being wore that way publicly in New York and no onearrested for it, but they don't hardly believe it at that, and theywouldn't show themselves in one, not if you begged them to on yourbended knees, and what is society coming to anyway? You might as welldress like one of them barefooted dancers, only calling 'em barefootedmust be meant like sarcasm--and they'd die before they'd let a daughterof theirs make a show of herself like that for odious beasts of men toleer at, and so on--until a couple years later Mrs. Henrietta TempletonPrice gets a regular one and wears it down Main Street, and nothingobjectionable happens; so then they all hustle to get one--not quite soextreme, of course, but after all, why not, since only the evil-mindedcould criticise? Pretty soon they're all wearing it exactly like NewYork did two years ago, with mebbe the limit raised a bit here and thereby some one who makes her own. But again they're saying that the latestone New York is wearing is so bad that it must be confined to a certainclass of women, even if they do get taken from left to right at AsburyPark and Newport and other colonies of wealth and fashion, because thevilest dregs can go there if they have the price, which they often do."Red Gap is like that. With me out here on the ranch it didn't matterwhat I wore because it was mostly only men that saw me; but I can wellremember the social upheaval when our smartest young matrons andwell-known society belles flung modesty to the chinook wind and took todivided skirts for horseback riding. My, the brazen hussies! It ain't somany years ago. Up to that time any female over the age of nine caughtriding a horse cross-saddle would have lost her character good andquick. And these pioneers lost any of theirs that wasn't cemented goodand hard with proved respectability. I remember hearing Jeff Tuttle tellwhat he'd do to any of his womenfolks that so far forgot the sacrednames of home and mother. It was startling enough, but Jeff somehownever done it. And if he was to hear Addie or one of the girls talkingabout a side-saddle to-day he'd think she was nutty or mebbe wanting onefor the state museum. So it goes with us. My hunch is that so it willever go."The years passed, and that thrill of viciousness at wearing dividedskirts in public got all rubbed off--that thrill that every last one ofus adores to feel if only it don't get her talked about--too much--byevil-minded gossips. Then comes this here next upheaval over ridingpants for ladies--or them that set themselves up to be such. Of coursewe'd long known that the things were worn in New York and even in suchmodern Babylons as Spokane and Seattle; but no woman in Red Gap had everforgot she had a position to keep up, until summer before last, when wesaw just how low one of our sex could fall, right out on the publicstreet."She was the wife of a botanist from some Eastern college and him andher rode a good bit and dressed just alike in khaki things. My, theinfamies that was intimated about that poor creature! She was bony andhad plainly seen forty, very severe-featured, with scraggly hair and asharp nose and spectacles, and looked as if she had never had a momentof the most innocent pleasure in all her life; but them riding pantsfixed her good in the minds of our lady porch-knockers. And the men justas bad, though they could hardly bear to look twice at her, she was thatdiscouraging to the eye; they agreed with their wives that she must beone of that sort."But things seem to pile up all at once in our town. That very summerthe fashion magazines was handed round with pages turned down at themore daring spots where ladies were shown in such things. It wasn't feltthat they were anything for the little ones to see. But still, afterall, wasn't it sensible, now really, when you come right down to it? andas a matter of fact isn't a modest woman modest in anything?--it isn'twhat she wears but how she conducts herself in public, or don't youthink so, Mrs. Ballard?--and you might as well be dead as out of style,and would Lehman, the Square Tailor, be able to make up anything likethat one there?--but no, because how would he get your measure?--andsurely no modest woman could give him hers even if she did take itherself--anyway, you'd be insulted by all the street rowdies as you rodeby, to say nothing of being ogled by men without a particle of finenessin their natures--but there's always something to be said on both sides,and it's time woman came into her own, anyway, if she is ever to beanything but man's toy for his idle moments--still it would never do togo to extremes in a narrow little town like this with every one justlooking for an excuse to talk--but it would be different if all the bestpeople got together and agreed to do it, only most of them wouldprobably back out at the last moment and that smarty on the _Recorder_would try to be funny about it--now that one with the long coat doesn'tlook so terrible, does it? or do you think so?--of course it's almostthe same as a skirt except when you climb on or something--a woman hasto think of those things--wouldn't Daisy Estelle look rather stunning inthat?--she has just the figure for it. Here's this No. 9872 with theNorfolk jacket in this mail-order catalogue--do you think that looks tootheatrical, or don't you? Of course for some figures, but I've alwaysbeen able to wear--And so forth, for a month or so."Late in the fall Henrietta Templeton Price done it. You may not knowwhat that meant to Alonzo Price, Choice Villa Sites and Price's Additionto Red Gap. Alonzo is this kind: I met him the day Gussie Himebaugh hadher accident when the mules she was driving to the mowing machine runaway out on Himebaugh's east forty. Alonzo had took Doc Maybury out andpasses me coming back. 'How bad was she hurt?' I asks. The poor thinglooks down greatly embarrassed and mumbles: 'She has broken a limb.''Leg or arm?' I blurts out, forgetting all delicacy. You'd think I hadhim pinned down, wouldn't you? Not Lon, though. 'A lower limb,' says he,coughing and looking away."You see how men are till we put a spike collar and chain on 'em. WhenHenrietta declared herself Alonzo read the riot act and declared maritallaw. But there was Henrietta with the collar and chain and pretty soonLon was saying: 'You're quite right, Pettikins, and you ought to havethe thanks of the community for showing our ladies how to dressrationally on horseback. It's not only sensible and safe but it'smodest--a plain pair of riding breeches, no coquetry, no frills, nothingbut stern utility--of course I agree.'"'I hoped you would, darling,' says Henrietta. She went to MissGunslaugh and had her make the costume, being one who rarely does thingsby halves. It was of blue velvet corduroy, with a fetching little bolerojacket, and the things themselves were fitted, if you know what I mean.And stern utility! That suit with its rosettes and bows and frogs andbraid had about the same stern utility as those pretty little tin tongsthat come on top of a box of candy--ever see anybody use one of those?When Henrietta got dressed for her first ride and had put on the CubanPink Face Balm she looked like one of the gypsy chorus in the BohemianGirl opera."Alonzo gulped several times in rapid succession when he saw her, butthe little man never starts anything he don't aim to finish, and it wastoo late to start it then. Henrietta brazened her way through MainStreet and out to the country club and back, and next day she put themon again so Otto Hirsch, of the E-light Studio, could come up and takeher standing by the horse out in front of the Price mansion. Then theywas laid away until the Grand Annual Masquerade Ball of the Order of theEastern Star, which is a kind of hen Masons, when she again gave us aflash of what New York society ladies was riding their horse in. As amatter of fact, Henrietta hates a horse like a rattlesnake, but she haddone her pioneer work for once and all."Every one was now laughing and sneering at the old-fashioned dividedskirt with which woman had endangered her life on a horse, and wonderinghow they had endured the clumsy things so long; and come spring all theprominent young society buds and younger matrons of the most exclusiveset who could stay on a horse at all was getting theirs ready for theapproaching season, Red Gap being like London in having its gayestseason in the summer, when people can get out more. Even Mis' JudgeBallard fell for it, though hers was made of severe black with a longcoat. She looked exactly like that Methodist minister, the old one, thatwe had three years ago."Most of the younger set used the mail-order catalogue, their figuresstill permitting it. And maybe there wasn't a lot of trying on behinddrawn blinds pretty soon, and delighted giggles and innocent girlishwonderings about whether the lowest type of man really ogles as muchunder certain circumstances as he's said to. And the minute the roadsgot good the telephone of Pierce's Livery, Feed, and Sale Stable waskept on the ring. Then the social upheaval was on. Of course any of 'emlooked quiet after Henrietta's costume, for none of the girls but BerylMae Macomber, a prominent young society bud, aged seventeen, had doneanything like that. But it was the idea of the thing."A certain element on the South Side made a lot of talk and stirredthings up and wrote letters to the president of the Civic Purity League,who was Mis' Judge Ballard herself, asking where this unspeakabledisrobing business was going to end and calling her attention to thefate that befell Sodom and Gomorrah. But Mis' Ballard she's mixed onnames and gets the idea these parties mean Samson and Delilah instead ofa couple of twin cities, like St. Paul and Minneapolis, and she writesback saying what have these Bible characters got to do with a ladyriding on horseback--in trousers, it is true, but with a coat fallingmodestly to the knee on each side, and certain people had better be alittle more fussy about things that really matter in life before theybegin to talk. She knew who she was hitting at all right, too. TrustMis' Ballard!"It was found that there was almost the expected amount of ogling fromsidewalk loafers, at first. As Daisy Estelle Maybury said, it seemed asif a girl couldn't show herself on the public thoroughfare without beingsubjected to insult. Poor Daisy Estelle! She had been a very popularyoung society belle, and was considered one of the most attractive girlsin Red Gap until this happened. No one had ever suspected it of her inthe least degree up to that time. Of course it was too late after shewas once seen off her horse. Them that didn't see was told in fulldetail by them that did. Most of the others was luckier. Beryl MaeMacomber in her sport shirt and trouserettes complained constantly aboutthe odious wretches along Main Street and Fourth, where the post officewas. She couldn't stop even twenty minutes in front of the post office,minding her own business and waiting for some one she knew to come alongand get her mail for her, without having dozens of men stop and ogleher. That, of course, was during the first two weeks after she took togoing for the mail, though the eternal feminine in Beryl Mae probablythought the insulting glances was going to keep up forever."I watched the poor child one day along in the third week, waiting therein front of the post office after the four o'clock mail, and no onehardly ogled her at all except some rude children out from school. Whatmade it more pitiful, leaning right there against the post office frontwas Jack Shiels, Sammie Hamilton, and little old Elmer Cox, Red Gap'sthree town rowdies that ain't done a stroke of work since the canningfactory closed down the fall before, creatures that by rights shouldhave been leering at the poor child In all her striking beauty. But, no;the brutes stand there looking at nothing much until Jack Shiels staresa minute at this horse Beryl Mae is on and pipes up: 'Why, say, Ithought Pierce let that little bay runt go to the guy that was in hereafter polo ponies last Thursday. I sure did.' And Sam Hamilton wakes upand says: 'No, sir; not this one. He got rid of a little mare that hadshoulders like this, but she was a roan with kind of mule ears and onefroze off.' And little old Elmer Cox, ignoring this defenceless younggirl with his impudent eyes, he says: 'Yes, Sam's right for once. Piercetried to let this one go, too, but ain't you took a look at his hocks!'Then along comes Dean Duke, the ratty old foreman in Pierce's stable,and he don't ogle a bit, either, like you'd expect one of his debasedcalibre to, but just stops and talks this horse over with 'em and saysyes, it was his bad hocks that lost the sale, and he tells 'em how hehad told Pierce just what to do to get him shaped up for a quick sale,but Pierce wouldn't listen to him, thinking he knew it all himself; andthere the four stood and gassed about this horse without even seeingBeryl Mae, let alone leering at her. I bet she was close to sheddingtears of girlish mortification as she rode off without ever waiting forthe mail. Things was getting to a pretty pass. If low creatures lost toall decent instincts, like these four, wouldn't ogle a girl when she wasout for it, what could be expected of the better element of the town?Still, of course, now and then one or the other of the girls would havea bit of luck to tell of."Well, now we come to the crookedest bit of work I ever been guilty of,though first telling you about Mr. Burchell Daggett, an Eastern societyman from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that had come to Red Gap that spring to beassistant cashier in the First National, through his uncle having stockin the thing. He was a very pleasant kind of youngish gentleman, aboutthirty-four, I reckon, with dark, parted whiskers and gold eyeglassesand very good habits. He took his place among our very best people rightoff, teaching the Bible class in the M.E. Sabbath-school and belongingto the Chamber of Commerce and the City Beautiful Association, of whichhe was made vice-president, and being prominent at all functions held inour best homes. He wasn't at all one of them that lead a double life bystopping in at the Family Liquor Store for a gin fizz or two after workhours, or going downtown after supper to play Kelly pool at theTemperance Billiard Parlours and drink steam beer, or getting in withthe bunch that gathers in the back room of the Owl Cigar Store of anevening and tells these here suggestive stories. Not that he washide-bound. If he felt the need for a shot of something he'd go into theUnited States Grill and have a glass of sherry and bitters brought tohim at a table and eat a cracker with it, and he'd take in every show,even the Dizzy Belles of Gotham Big Blonde Beauty Show. He was refinedand even moral in the best sense of the word, but still human."Our prominent young society buds took the keenest notice of him atonce, as would naturally happen, he being a society bachelor of meansand by long odds the best catch in Red Gap since old Potter Knapp, ofthe Loan and Trust Company, had broke his period of mourning for histhird wife by marrying Myrtle Wade that waited on table at theOccidental Hotel, with the black band still on his left coat sleeve.It's no exaggeration to say that Mr. Burchell Daggett became the mostsought-after social favourite among Reg Gap's hoot mondy in less than aweek after he unpacked his trunk. But it was very soon discovered by thebright-eyed little gangsters of the best circles that he wasn't going tobe an easy one to disable. Naturally when a man has fought 'em off tohis age he has learned much of woodcraft and the hunter's cunning wiles,and this one had sure developed timber sense. He beat 'em at their owngame for three months by the simple old device of not playing anyfavourite for one single minute, and very, very seldom getting alonewith one where the foul stroke can be dealt by the frailest hand withmuscular precision. If he took Daisy Estelle Maybury to the chicken piesupper to get a new carpet for the Presbyterian parsonage, he'd up andtake Beryl Mae and her aunt, or Gussie Himebaugh, or Luella Stultz, tothe lawn feet at Judge Ballard's for new uniforms for the band boys. Atthe Bazaar of All Nations he bought as many chances of one girl as hedid of another, and if he hadn't any more luck than a rabbit and wonsomething--a hanging lamp or a celluloid manicure set in a plush-linedbox--he'd simply put it up to be raffled off again for the good of thecause. And none of that moonlight loitering along shaded streets forhim, where the dirk is so often drove stealthily between a man's ribs,and him thinking all the time he's only indulging in a little playfulnonsense. Often as not he'd take two girls at once, where all could bemerry without danger of anything happening."It was no time at all till this was found out on him. It was seen thatunder a pleasing exterior, looking all too easy to overcome by any girlin her right mind, he had powers of resistance and evasion that was likesteel. Of course this only stirred the proud beauties on to renewed andcrookeder efforts. Every darned one of 'em felt that her innocent younggirlhood was challenged, and would she let it go at that? Not so. Mylands! What snares and deadfalls was set for this wise old timber wolfthat didn't look it, with his smiling ways and seemingly carelessresponse to merry banter, and so forth!"And of course every one of these shrinking little scoundrels thought atonce of her new riding costume, so no time at all was lost in organizingthe North Side Riding and Sports Club, which Mr. Burchell Daggett gladlyjoined, having, as he said, an eye for a horse and liking to get outafter banking hours to where all Nature seems to smile and you can letyour mount out a bit over the firm, smooth road. Them that had held offuntil now, on account of the gossip and leering, hurried up and got intoline with No. 9872 in the mail-order catalogue, or went to MissGunslaugh, who by this time had a female wax dummy in her window in aneat brown suit and puttees, with a coat just opening and one footadvanced carelessly, with gauntlets and a riding crop, and a fetchinglittle cap over the wind-blown hair and the clear, wonderful blue eyes.Oh, you can bet every last girl of the bunch was seeing herself sendback picture postals to her rivals telling what a royal time they washaving at Palm or Rockaway Beach or some place, and seeing the engravedcards--'Mr. and Mrs. Burchell Daggett, at Home After the Tenth, OphirAvenue, Red Gap, Wash.'"Ain't we good when you really get us, if you ever do--because somedon't. Many, indeed! I reckon there never was a woman yet outside of afeeb' home that didn't believe she could be an A. No. 1 siren if she onlyhad the nerve to dress the part; never one that didn't just ache to swaymen to her lightest whim, and believe she could--not for any evilpurpose, mind you, but just to show her power. Think of the tenderhearts that must have shuddered over the damage they could and actuallymight do in one of them French bathing suits like you are said towitness in Paris and Atlantic City and other sinks of iniquity. And herewas these well-known society favourites wrought up by this legibleparty, as the French say, till each one was ready to go just as far asthe Civic Purity League would let her in order to sweep him off his feetin one mad moment. Quite right, too. It all depends on what the objectis, don't it; and wasn't theirs honourable matrimony with anestablishment and a lawn in front of it with a couple of cast-ironmoose, mebbe?"And amid all this quaint girlish enterprise and secret infamy was theproblem of Hetty Tipton. Hetty had been a friend and a problem of minefor seven years, or ever since she come back from normal to teach in thethird-grade grammar school; a fine, clean, honest, true-blue girl, mebbenot as pretty you'd say at first as some others, but you like her betterafter you look a few times more, and with not the slightest nonsenseabout her. That last was Hetty's one curse. I ask you, what chance has agirl got with no nonsense about her? Hetty won my sympathy right at thestart by this infirmity of hers, which was easily detected, and forseven years I'd been trying to cure her of it, but no use. Oh, she wasalways took out regular enough and well liked, but the gilded youth ofRed Gap never fought for her smiles. They'd take her to parties anddances, turn and turn about, but they always respected her, which is thegreatest blight a man can put on one of us, if you know what I mean.Every man at a party was always careful to dance a decent number oftimes with Hetty and see that she got back to her seat; and wasn't itwarm in here this evening, yes, it was; and wouldn't she have a glass ofthe punch--No, thank you--then he'd gallop off to have some fun with amere shallow-pated fool that had known how from the cradle. It wasalways a puzzle to me, because Hetty dressed a lot better than most ofthem, knowing what to wear and how, and could take a joke if it comeslow, and laid herself out to be amiable to one and all. I kind of thinkit must be something about her mentality. Maybe it is too mental. Ican't put her to you any plainer than to say that every single girl intown, young and old, just loved her, and not one of them up to this timehad ever said an unkind or feminine thing about her. I guess you knowwhat that would mean of any woman."Hetty was now coming twenty-nine--we never spoke of this, but I couldcount back--and it's my firm belief that no man had ever proposedmarriage or anything else on earth to her. Wilbur Todd had onceendeavoured to hold her hand out on the porch at a country-club danceand she had repulsed him in all kindness but firmly. She told him shecouldn't bring herself to permit a familiarity of that sort except tothe man who would one day lead her to the altar, which is something Ibelieve she got from writing to a magazine about a young girl'sperplexities. And here, in spite of her record, this poor thing haddared to raise her eyes to none other than this Mr. Burchell Daggett.There was something kind of grand and despairing about the impudence ofit when you remember these here trained efficiency experts she wascompeting with. Yet so it was. She would drop in on me after school fora cup of tea and tell me frankly how distinguished his manner was andwhat shapely features he had and what fine eyes, and how there was acertain note in his voice at times, and had I ever noticed that onestubborn lock of hair that stuck out back of his left ear? Of coursethat last item settled it. When they notice that lock of hair you knowthe ship has struck the reef and all hands are perishing."And it seemed that the cuss had not only shown her more than a littleattention at evening functions but had escorted her to the midspringproduction of 'Hamlet' by the Red Gap Amateur Theatrical and DramaticSociety. True, he had conducted himself like a perfect gentleman everyminute they was alone together, even when they had to go home in EddiePierce's hack because it was raining when the show let out--but would I,or would I not, suspect from all this that he was in the least degreethinking of her in a way that--you know!"Poor child of twenty-eight, with her hungry eyes and flushed face whileshe was showing down her hand to me! I seen the scoundrel's play atonce. Hetty was the one safe bet for him in Red Gap's social whirl. Hewas wise, all right--this Mr. D. He'd known in a second he could trusthimself alone with that girl and be as safe as a babe in its mother'sarms. Of course I couldn't say this to Hetty. I just said he was a manthat seemed to know his own mind very clearly, whatever it was, andHetty blushed some more and said that something within her responded toa certain note in his voice. We let it go at that."So I think and ponder about poor Hetty, trying to invent someconspiracy that would fix it right, because she was the ideal mate foran assistant cashier that had a certain position to keep up. For thatmatter she was good enough for any man. Then I hear she has joined theriding club, and an all day's ride has been planned for the nextSaturday up to Stender's Spring, with a basket lunch and a romantic rideback by moonlight. Of course, I don't believe in any of thisspiritualist stuff, but you can't tell me there ain't something in it,mind-reading or something, with the hunches you get when parties is insome grave danger."Stella Ballard it was tells me about the picnic, calling me in as Ipassed their house to show me her natty new riding togs that had justcome from the mail-order house. She called from back of a curtain, andwhen I got into the parlour she had them on, pleased as all get-out.Pretty they was, too--riding breeches and puttees and a man's flannelshirt and a neat-fitting Norfolk jacket, and Stella being a fine,upstanding figure."'They may cause considerable talk,' says she, smoothing down one legwhere it wrinkled a bit, 'but really I think they look perfectlystunning on me, and wasn't it lucky they fit me so beautifully? They'recalled the Non Plush Ultra.'"'The what?' I says."'The Non Plush Ultra,' she answers. 'That's the name of them sewed inthe band.'"'What's that mean?' I wanted to know."'Why,' says Stella, 'that's Latin or Greek, I forget which, and itmeans they're the best, I believe. Oh, let me see! Why, it means nothingbeyond, or something like that; the farthest you can go, I think. Oneforgets all that sort of thing after leaving high school.'"'Well,' I says, 'they fit fine, and it's the only modest rig for awoman to ride a horse in, but they certainly are non plush, all right.That thin goods will never wear long against saddle leather, take myword for it.'"But of course this made no impression on Stella--she was standing onthe centre table by now, so she could lamp herself in the glass over themantel--and then she tells me about the excursion for Saturday and howMr. Burchell Daggett is enthused about it, him being a superb horsemanhimself, and, if I know what she means, don't I think she carriesherself in the saddle almost better than any girl in her set, and won'ther style show better than ever in this duck of a costume, and she mustget her tan shoes polished, and do I think Mr. Daggett really meantanything when he said he'd expect her some day to return the masonic pinshe had lifted off his vest the other night at the dance, and so on."It was while she was babbling this stuff that I get the strange hunchthat Hetty Tipton is in grave danger and I ought to run to her; itseemed almost I could hear her calling on me to save her from somehorrible fate. So I tell Stella yes, she's by far the finest rider inthe whole Kulanche Valley, and she ought to get anything she wants withthat suit on, and then I beat it quick over to the Ezra Button housewhere Hetty boards."You can laugh all you want to, but that hunch of mine was the God'struth. Hetty was in the gravest danger she'd faced since one time inearly infancy when she got give morphine for quinine. What made it morehorrible, she hadn't the least notion of her danger. Quite the contrary."'Thank the stars I've come in time!' I gasps as I rushes in on her, forthere's the poor girl before her mirror in a pair of these same NonPlush Ultras and looking as pleased with herself as if she had somereason to be."'Back into your skirts quick!' I says. 'I'm a strong woman and allthat, but still I can be affected more than you'd think.'"Poor Hetty stutters and turns red and her chin begins to quiver, so Igentled her down and tried to explain, though seeing quick that I musttell her everything but the truth. I reckon nothing in this world canlook funnier than a woman wearing them things that had never ought tofor one reason or another. There was more reasons than that in Hetty'scase. Dignity was the first safe bet I could think of with her, so Itried that."'I know all you would say,' says the poor thing in answer, 'but isn'tit true that men rather like one to be--oh, well, you know--just theleast bit daring?'"'Truest thing in the world,' I says, 'but bless your heart, did yoususpicion riding breeches was daring on a woman? Not so. A girl wearing'em can't be any more daring after the first quick shock is overthan--well, you read the magazines, don't you? You've seen thosepictures of family life in darkest Africa that the explorers and monkeyhunters bring home, where the wives, mothers, and sweethearts, God bless'em! wear only what the scorching climate demands. Didn't it strike youthat one of them women without anything on would have a hard time if shetried to be daring--or did it? No woman can be daring without the properclothes for it,' I says firmly, 'and as for you, I tell you plain, getinto the most daring and immodest thing that was ever invented forwoman--which is the well-known skirt.'"'Oh, Ma Pettengill,' cries the poor thing, 'I never meant anythinghorrid and primitive when I said daring. As a matter of fact, I thinkthese are quite modest to the intelligent eye.'"'Just what I'm trying to tell you,' I says. 'Exactly that; they'remodest to any eye whatever. But here you are embarked on a difficultenterprise, with a band of flinty-hearted cutthroats trying to beat youto it, and, my dear child, you have a staunch nature and a heart ofgold, but you simply can't afford to be modest.'"'I don't understand,' says she, looking at herself in the glass again."'Trust me, anyway,' I implores. 'Let others wear their Non PlushUltras which are No. 9872'--she tries to correct my pronunciation, but Iwouldn't stop for that. 'Never mind how it's pronounced,' I says,'because I know well the meaning of it in a foreign language. It meansthe limit, and it's a very desirable limit for many, but for you,' Isays plainly, 'it's different. Your Non Plush Ultra will have to be aneat, ankle-length riding skirt. You got one, haven't you?'"'I have,' says she, 'a very pretty one of tan corduroy, almost new, butI had looked forward to these, and I don't see yet--'"Then I thought of another way I might get to her without blurting outthe truth. 'Listen, Hetty,' I says, 'and remember not only that I'm yourfriend but that I know a heap more about this fool world than you do.I've had bitter experiences, and one of them got me at the time I firstbegun to wear riding pants myself, which must have been about the timeyou was beginning to bite dents into your silver mug that Aunt Carolinesent. I was a handsome young hellion, I don't mind telling you, and theylooked well on me, and when Lysander John urged me to be brave and wear'em outside I was afraid all the men within a day's ride was going tosneak round to stare at me. My! I was so embarrassed, also with thatsame feeling you got in your heart this minute that it was taking anunfair advantage of any man--you know! I felt like I was using all thepower of my young beauty for unworthy ends."'Well, do you know what I got when I first rode out on the ranch? Igot just about the once-over from every brute there, and that was all.If one of them ranch hands had ever ogled me a second time I'd haveknown it all right, but I never caught one of the scoundrels at it.First I said: "Now, ain't that fine and chivalrous?" Then I got wise. Itwasn't none of this here boasted Western chivalry, but just plain lackof interest. I admit it made me mad at first. Any man on the place wasonly too glad to look me over when I had regular clothes on, but dressme like Lysander John and they didn't look at me any oftener than theydid him. Not as often, of course, because as a plain human being andman's equal I wasn't near as interesting as he was.'"'But then, too,' says Hetty, who had only been about half listening tomy lecture, 'I thought it might be striking a blow at the same time forthe freedom of woman.'"Well, you know how that freedom-of-the-sex talk always gets me going. Iwas mad enough for a minute to spank her just as she stood there in themNon Plush Ultras she was so proud of. And I did let out some high talk.Mrs. Dutton told her afterward she thought sure we was having words."'Freedom from skirts,' I says, 'is the last thing your sex wants.Skirts is the final refuge of immodesty, to which women will cling likegrim death. They will do any possible thing to a skirt--slit it, thinit, shorten it, hike it up one side--people are setting up nights rightnow thinking up some new thing to do to it--but women won't give it upand dress modestly as men do because it's the only unfair drag they gotleft with the men. I see one of our offended sex is daily asking rightout in a newspaper: "Are women people?" I'd just like to whisper to herthat no one yet knows."'If they'll quit their skirts, dress as decently as a man does so theywon't have any but a legitimate pull with him, we'd have a chance tofind out if they're good for anything else. As a matter of fact, theydon't want to be people and dress modestly and wear hats you couldn'tpay over eight dollars for. I believe there was one once, but the poorthing never got any notice from either sex after she became--a people,as you might say.'"Well, I was going on to get off a few more things I'd got madded up to,but I caught the look in poor Hetty's face, and it would have melted astone. Poor child! There she was, wanting a certain man and willing towear or not wear anything on earth that would nail him, and not knowingwhat would do it, and complicating her ignorance with meaninglessworries about modesty and daringness and the freedom of her poor sex,that ain't ever even deuce-low with one woman in a million."And right then, watching her distress, all at once I get my biginspiration--it just flooded me like the sun coming up. I don't know ifI'm like other folks, but things do come to me that way. And not onlywas it a great truth, but it got me out of the hole of having to tellHetty certain truths about herself that these Non Plush Ultras made alltoo glaring."'Listen,' I says: 'You believe I'm your friend, don't you? And youbelieve anything I tell you is from the heart out and will probably havea grain of sense in it. Well, here is an inspired thought: Women won'tever dress modestly like men do because men don't want 'em to. I neversaw a man yet that did if he'd tell the truth, and so this here darkcity stranger won't be any exception. Now, then, what do we see onSaturday next? Why, we see this here gay throng sally forth forStender's Spring, the youth and beauty of Red Gap, including Mr. D.,with his nice refined odour of Russia leather and bank bills of largesize--from fifties up--that haven't been handled much. The crowd is ofall sexes, technically, like you might say; a lot of nice, sweet girlsalong but dressed to be mere jolly young roughnecks, and just asinteresting to the said stranger as the regular boys that will bepresent--hardly more so. And now, as for poor little meek you--you willlook wild and Western, understand me, but feminine; exactly like thecoloured cigarette picture that says under it "Rocky Mountain Cow Girl."You will be in your pretty tan skirt--be sure to have it pressed--and ablue-striped sport bloose that I just saw in the La Mode window, andyou'll get some other rough Western stuff there, too: a blue silkneckerchief and a natty little cow-girl sombrero--the La Mode is showinga good one called the La Parisienne for four fifty-eight--and thedaintiest pair of tan kid gauntlets you can find, and don't forget apair of tan silk stockings--'"'They won't show in my riding boots,' says Hetty, looking as if she wascoming to life a little."'Tush for the great, coarse, commonsense riding boots,' I says firmly;'you will wear precisely that neat little pair of almost new tan pumpswith the yellow bows that you're standing in now. Do you get me?'"'But that would be too dainty and absurd,' says Hetty."'Exactly!' I says, shutting my mouth hard."'Why, I almost believe I do get you,' says she, looking religiously upinto the future like that lady saint playing the organ in the picture."'Another thing,' I says: 'You are deathly afraid of a horse and washardly ever on one but once when you were a teeny girl, but you do lovethe open life, so you just nerved yourself up to come.'"'I believe I see more clearly than ever,' says Hetty. She grew up on aranch, knows more about a horse than the horse himself does, and wouldbe a top rider most places, with the cheap help we get nowadays that canhardly set a saddle."'Also from time to time,' I goes on, 'you want to ask this Mr. D.little, timid, silly questions that will just tickle him to death andmake him feel superior. Ask him to tell you which legs of a horse thechaps go on, and other things like that; ask him if the sash that holdsthe horrid old saddle on isn't so tight it's hurting your horse. Afterthe lunch is et, go over to the horse all alone and stroke his nose andcall him a dear and be found by the gent when he follows you over tryingto feed the noble animal a hard-boiled egg and a couple of pickles orsomething. Take my word for it, he'll be over all right and have ahearty laugh at your confusion, and begin to wonder what it is aboutyou."'How about falling off and spraining my ankle on the way back?' demandsthe awakening vestal with a gleam in her eye."'No good,' I says; 'pretty enough for a minute, but it would maketrouble if you kept up the bluff, and if there's one thing a man hatesmore than another it's to have a woman round that makes any trouble.'"'You have me started on a strange new train of thought,' says Hetty."'I think it's a good one,' I tells her, 'but remember there are risks.For one thing, you know how popular you have always been with all thegirls. Well, after this day none of 'em will hardly speak to you becauseof your low-lifed, deceitful game, and the things they'll say ofyou--such things as only woman can say of woman!'"'I shall not count the cost,' says she firmly. 'And now I must hurrydown for that sport bloose--blue-striped, you said?'"'Something on that order,' I says, 'that fits only too well. You cando almost anything you want to with your neck and arms, but rememberstrictly--a skirt is your one and only Non Plush Ultra.'"So I went home all flushed and eager, thinking joyously how littlemen--the poor dubs--ever suspect how it's put over on 'em, and the nextday, which was Friday, I thought of a few more underhand things shecould do. So when she run in to see me that afternoon, the excitement ofthe chase in her eye, she wanted I should go along on this picnic. Isays yes, I will, being that excited myself and wanting to see really ifI was a double-faced genius or wasn't I? Henrietta Price couldn't go onaccount of being still lame from her ride of a week ago, so I could goas chaperone, and anyway I knew the dear girls would all be glad to haveme because I would look so different from them--like a genial old ranchforeman going out on rodeo--and the boys was always glad to see me alonganyway. 'I'll be there,' I says to Hetty. 'And here--don't forget at alltimes to-morrow to carry this little real lace handkerchief I'm givingyou.'"I was at the meeting-place next morning at nine. None of the othergirls was on time, of course, but that was just as well, because AggieTuttle had got her father to come down to the sale yard to pack a mulewith the hampers of lunch. Jeff Tuttle is a good packer all right, buttoo inflamed in the case of a mule, which he hates. They always know upand down that street when he's packing one; ladies drag their childrenby as fast as they can. But Jeff had the hitch all throwed before any ofthe girls showed up, and all began in a lovely manner, the crowd ofabout fifteen getting off not more than an hour late; Mr. Burchell inthe lead and a bevy of these jolly young rascals in their Non PlushUltras riding herd on him."Every girl cast cordial glances of pity at poor Hetty when she showedup in her neat skirt and silly tan pumps with the ridiculous silkstockings and the close-fitting blue-striped thing, free at the neck,and her pretty hair all neated under the La Parisienne cow-girl hat. Oh,they felt kinder than ever before to poor old Hetty when they saw her aslittle daring as that, cheering her with a hearty uproar, slapping theirNon Plush Ultras with their caps or gloves, and then gigglingconfidentially to one another. Hetty accepted their applause with whatthey call a pretty show of confusion and gored her horse with her heelon the off side so it looked as if the vicious brute was running awayand she might fall off any minute, but somehow she didn't, and got himsoothed with frightened words and by taking the hidden heel out of hisslats--though not until Mr. D. had noticed her good and then lookedagain once or twice."And so the party moved on for an hour or two, with the roguish youngroughnecks cutting up merrily at all times, pretending to be cowboyscoming to town on pay day, swinging their hats, giving the long yell,and doing roughriding to cut each other away from the side of Mr. D.every now and then, with a noisy laugh of good nature to hide thepoisoned dagger. Daisy Estelle Maybury is an awful good rider, too, andgot next to the hero about every time she wanted to. Poor thing, if sheonly knew that once she gets off a horse in 'em it makes all thedifference in the world."The dark city stranger seemed to enjoy it fine, all this noise andcutting up and cowboy antics like they was just a lot of high-spiritedyoung men together, but I never weakened in my faith for one minute.'Laugh on, my proud beauties,' I says, 'but a time will come, just assure as you look and act like a passel of healthy boys.' And you bet itdid."We hadn't got halfway to Stender's Spring till Mr. D. got off totighten his cinch, and then he sort of drifted back to where Hetty and Iwas. I dropped back still farther to where a good chaperone ought to beand he rode in beside Hetty. The trail was too narrow then for the restto come back after their prey, so they had to carry on the rough workamong themselves."Hetty acted perfect. She had a pensive, withdrawn look--'aloof,' Iguess the word is--like she was too tender a flower, too fine for thisrough stuff, and had ought to be in the home that minute telling a fairystory to the little ones gathered at her decently clad knee. I don'tknow how she done it, but she put that impression over. And she tellsMr. D. that in spite of her quiet, studious tastes she had resolved tocome on this picnic because she loves Nature oh! so dearly, the birdsand the wild flowers and the great rugged trees that have their messagefor man if he will but listen with an understanding heart--didn't Mr. D.think so, or did he? But not too much of this dear old Nature stuff,which can be easy overdone with a healthy man; just enough to show therewas hidden depths in her nature that every one couldn't find."Then on to silly questions about does a horse lie down when it goes tosleep each night after its hard day's labour, and isn't her horse's sashtoo tight, and what a pretty fetlock he has, so long and thick andbrown--Oh, do you call that the mane? How absurd of poor little me! Mr.Daggett knows just everything, doesn't he? He's perfectly terrifying.And where in the world did he ever learn to ride so stunningly, like oneof those dare-devils in a Wild West entertainment? If her own naughty,naughty horse tries to throw her on the ground again where he can biteher she'll just have Mr. D. ride the nassy ole sing and teach him bettermanners, so she will. There now! He must have heard that--just see himmove his funny ears--don't tell her that horses can't understand thingsthat are said. And, seriously now, where did Mr. D. ever get his superbathletic training, because, oh! how all too rare it is to see abrain-worker of strong mentality and a splendid athlete in one and thesame man. Oh, how pathetically she had wished and wished to be a man andtake her place out in the world fighting its battles, instead of poorlittle me who could never be anything but a homebody to worship thegreat, strong, red-blooded men who did the fighting and carried on greatindustries--not even an athletic girl like those dear things upahead--and this horse is bobbing up and down like that on purpose, justto make poor little me giddy, and so forth. Holding her bridle reindaintily she was with the lace handkerchief I'd give her that cost metwelve fifty."Mr. D. took it all like a real man. He said her ignorance of a horsewas adorable and laughed heartily at it. And he smiled in a deeplymodest and masterful way and said 'But, really, that's nothing--nothingat all, I assure you,' when she said about how he was a corkingathlete--and then kept still to see if she was going on to say moreabout it. But she didn't, having the God-given wisdom to leave himwanting. And then he would be laughing again at her poor-little-me horsetalk."I never had a minute's doubt after that, for it was the eyes of onefascinated to a finish that he turned back on me half an hour later ashe says: 'Really, Mrs. Pettengill, our Miss Hester is feminine to herfinger tips, is she not?' 'She is, she is,' I answers. 'If you only knewthe trouble I had with the chit about that horrible old riding skirt ofhers when all her girl friends are wearing a sensible costume!' Hettyblushed good and proper at this, not knowing how indecent I mightbecome, and Mr. D. caught her at it. Aggie Tuttle and Stella Ballard atthis minute is pretending to be shooting up a town with the couple ofrevolvers they'd brought along in their cunning little holsters. Mr. D.turns his glazed eyes to me once more. 'The real womanly woman,' says hein a hushed voice, 'is God's best gift to man.' Just like that."'Landed!' I says to myself. 'Throw him up on the bank and light afire.'"And mebbe you think this tet-a-tet had not been noticed by the merrythrong up front. Not so. The shouting and songs had died a naturaldeath, and the last three miles of that trail was covered in a gloomysilence, except for the low voices of Hetty and the male she had soneatly pronged. I could see puzzled glances cast back at them and catchmutterings of bewilderment where the trail would turn on itself. But thepoor young things didn't yet realize that their prey was hanging backthere for reasons over which he hadn't any control. They thought, ofcourse, he was just being polite or something."When we got to the picnic place, though, they soon saw that all was notwell. There was some resumption of the merrymaking as they dismountedand the girls put one stirrup over the saddle-horn and eased the cinchlike the boys did, and proud of their knowledge, but the glances theynow shot at Hetty wasn't bewildered any more. They was glances of purefright. Hetty, in the first place, had to be lifted off her horse, andMr. D. done it in a masterly way to show her what a mere feather shewas in his giant's grasp. Then with her feet on the ground she reeled amite, so he had to support her. She grasped his great strong arm firmlyand says: 'It's nothing--I shall be right presently--leave me please, goand help those other girls.' They had some low, heated language abouthis leaving her at such a crisis, with her gripping his arm till I betit showed for an hour. But finally they broke and he loosened herhorse's sash, as she kept quaintly calling it, and she recoveredcompletely and said it had been but a moment's giddiness anyway, andwhat strength he had in those arms, and yet could use it so gently, andhe said she was a brave, game little woman, and the picnic was served toone and all, with looks of hearty suspicion and rage now being shot atHetty from every other girl there."And now I see that my hunch has been even better than I thought. Notonly does the star male hover about Hetty, cutely perched on a fallenlog with her dainty, gleaming ankles crossed, and looking so fresh andnifty and feminine, but I'm darned if three or four of the other malesdon't catch the contagion of her woman's presence and hang round her,too, fetching her food of every kind there, feeding her spoonfuls ofAggie Tuttle's plum preserves, and all like that, one comical thingafter another. Yes, sir; here was Mac Gordon and Riley Hardin andCharlie Dickman and Roth Hyde, men about town of the younger dancingset, that had knowed Hetty for years and hardly ever looked ather--here they was paying attentions to her now like she was some prizebeauty, come down from Spokane for over Sunday, to say nothing ofMr. D., who hardly ever left her side except to get her another sardinesandwich or a paper cup of coffee. It was then I see the scientificexplanation of it, like these high-school professors always say thatscience is at the bottom of everything. The science of this here wasthat they was all devoting themselves to Hetty for the simple reasonthat she was the one and only woman there present."Of course these girls in their modest Non Plush Ultras didn't get thescientific secret of this fact. They was still too obsessed with theidea that they ought to be ogled on account of them by any male beast inhis right senses. But they knew they'd got in wrong somehow. By thistime they was kind of bunching together and telling each other things inlow tones, while not seeming to look at Hetty and her dupes, at whichall would giggle in the most venemous manner. Daisy Estelle left thebunch once and made a coy bid for the notice of Mr. D. by snatching hiscap and running merrily off with it about six feet. If there was any onein the world--except Hetty--could make a man hate the idea of ridingpants for women, she was it. I could see the cold, flinty look come intohis eyes as he turned away from her to Hetty with the pitcher oflemonade. And then Beryl Mae Macomber, she gets over close enough forMr. D. to hear it, and says conditions is made very inharmonious at homefor a girl of her temperament, and she's just liable any minute to chuckeverything and either take up literary work or go into the movies, shedon't know which and don't care--all kind of desperate so Mr. D. willfeel alarmed about a beautiful young thing like that out in the worldalone and unprotected and at the mercy of every designing scoundrel. ButI don't think Mr. D. hears a word of it, he's so intently listening toHetty who says here in this beautiful mountain glade where all is peacehow one can't scarcely believe that there is any evil in the worldanywhere, and what a difference it does make when one comes to see lifetruly. Then she crossed and recrossed her silken ankles, slightlyadjusted her daring tan skirt, and raised her eyes wistfully to thetreetops, and I bet there wasn't a man there didn't feel that shebelonged in the home circle with the little ones gathered about, telling'em an awfully exciting story about the naughty, naughty, bad littlewhite kitten and the ball of mamma's yarn."Yes, sir; Hetty was as much of a revelation to me in one way as shewould of been to that party in another if I hadn't saved her from it.She must have had the correct female instinct all these years, only noone had ever started her before on a track where there was no otherentries. With those other girls dressed like she was Hetty would of beenleaning over some one's shoulder to fork up her own sandwiches, and noone taking hardly any notice whether she'd had some of the hot coffee orwhether she hadn't. And the looks she got throughout the afternoon! Say,I wouldn't of trusted that girl at the edge of a cliff with a singlepair of those No. 9872's anywhere near."After the lunch things was packed up there was faint attempts at funand frolic with songs and chorus--Riley Hardin has a magnificent bassvoice at times and Mac Gordon and Charlie Dickman and Roth Hyde wouldn'tbe so bad if they'd let these Turkish cigarettes alone--and the boys gottogether and sung some of their good old business-college songs, withthe girls coming in while they murdered Hetty with their beautiful eyes.But Hetty and Mr. D. sort of withdrew from the noisy enjoyment andtalked about the serious aspects of life and how one could get alongalmost any place if only they had their favourite authors. And Mr. D.says doesn't she sing at all, and she says, Oh! in a way; that her voicehas a certain parlour charm, she has been told, and she sings at--youcan't really call it singing--two or three of the old Scotch songs ofhomely sentiment like the Scotch seem to get into their songs as noother nation can, or doesn't he think so, and he does, indeed. And he'sreading a wonderful new novel in which there is much of Nature with itslessons for each of us, but in which love conquers all at the end, andthe girl in it reminds him strongly of her, and perhaps she'll be goodenough to sing for him--just for him alone in the dusk--if he bringsthis book up to-morrow night so he can show her some good places in it."At first she is sure she has a horrid old engagement for to-morrownight and is so sorry, but another time, perhaps--Ain't it a marvel thecrooked tricks that girl had learned in one day! And then she remembersthat her engagement is for Tuesday night--what could she have beenthinking of!--and come by all means--only too charmed--and how rarelynowadays does one meet one on one's own level of culture, or perhapsthat is too awful a word to use--so hackneyed--but anyway he knows whatshe means, or doesn't he? He does."Pretty soon she gets up and goes over to her horse, picking her waydaintily in the silly little tan pumps, and seems to be offering thebeast something. The stricken man follows her the second he can withoutbeing too raw about it, and there is the adorably feminine thing with abig dill pickle, two deviled eggs, and a half of one of these Camelbertcheeses for her horse. Mr. D. has a good masterly laugh at her idea ofhorse fodder and calls her 'But, my dear child!' and she looks prettilyoffended and offers this chuck to the horse and he gulps it all down andnoses round for more of the same. It was an old horse named Croppy thatshe'd known from childhood and would eat anything on earth. She rode himup here once and he nabbed a bar of laundry soap off the back porch andchewed the whole thing down with tears of ecstasy in his eyes andfrothing at the mouth like a mad dog. Well, so Hetty gives mister man alook of dainty superiority as she flicks crumbs from her white fingerswith my real lace handkerchief, and he stops his hearty laughter andjust stares, and she says what nonsense to think the poor horses don'tlike food as well as any one. Them little moments have their effect on aman in a certain condition. He knew there probably wasn't another horsein the world would touch that truck, but he couldn't help feeling astrange new respect for her in addition to that glorious masculineprotection she'd had him wallowing in all day."The ride home, at least on the part of the Non Plush Ultra cut-ups, waslike they had laid a loved one to final rest out there on the lonemountainside. The handsome stranger and Hetty brought up the rear,conversing eagerly about themselves and other serious topics. I believehe give her to understand that he'd been pretty wild at one time in hislife and wasn't any too darned well over it yet, but that some goodwomanly woman who would study his ways could still take him and make aman of him; and her answering that she knew he must have suffered beyondhuman endurance in that horrible conflict with his lower nature. He saidhe had."Of course the rabid young hoydens up ahead made a feeble effort now andthen to carry it off lightly, and from time to time sang 'My Bonnie LiesOver the Ocean,' or 'Merrily We Roll Along,' with the high, squeakytenor of Roth Hyde sounding above the others very pretty in themoonlight, but it was poor work as far as these enraged vestals wasconcerned. If I'd been Hetty and had got a strange box of candy throughthe mail the next week, directed in a disguised woman's hand, I'd ofrushed right off to the police with it, not waiting for any analysis.And she, poor thing, would get so frightened at bad spots, with thefierce old horse bobbing about so dangerous, that she just has to beheld on. And once she wrenched her ankle against a horrid old tree onthe trail--she hadn't been able to resist a little one--and bit herunder lip as the spasm of pain passed over her refined features. But shewas all right in a minute and begged Mr. D. not to think of bathing itin cold water because it was nothing--nothing at all, really now--and hewould embarrass her frightfully if he said one more word about it. AndMr. D. again remarked that she was feminine to her finger tips, a brave,game little woman, one of the gamest he ever knew. And pretty soon--whatwas she thinking about now? Why, she was merely wondering if horsesthink in the true sense of the word or only have animal instinct, as itis called. And wasn't she a strange, puzzling creature to be thinking ondeep subjects like that at such a time! Yes, she had been calledpuzzling as a child, but she didn't like it one bit. She wanted to belike other girls, if he knew what she meant. He seemed to."They took Hetty home first on account of her poor little ankle andsung 'Good Night, Ladies,' at the gate. And so ended a day that waswreck and ruin for most of our sex there present."And to show you what a good, deep, scientific cause I had discovered,the next night at Hetty's who shows up one by one but these four menabout town, each with a pound of mixed from the Bon Ton Handy Kitchen,and there they're all setting at the feet of Hetty, as it were, in hernew light summer gown with the blue bows, when Mr. D. blows in with atwo-pound box and the novel in which love conquered all. So excited shewas when she tells me about it next day. The luck of that girl! Butafter all it wasn't luck, because she'd laid her foundations the daybefore, hadn't she? Always look a little bit back of anything that seemsto be luck, say I."And Hetty with shining eyes entertained one and all with the wit andsparkle a woman can show only when there's four or five men at her atonce--it's the only time we ever rise to our best. But she got a chancefor a few words alone with Mr. D., who took his hat finally when he seesthe other four was going to set him out; enough words to confide to himhow she loathed this continual social racket to which she was constantlysubjected, with never a let-up so one could get to one's books and toone's real thoughts. But perhaps he would venture up again some timenext week or the week after--not getting coarse in her work, understand,even with him flopping around there out on the bank--and he give her onelong, meaning look and said why not to-morrow night, and she carelesslysaid that would be charming, she was sure--she didn't think of anyengagement at this minute--and it was ever so nice of him to think ofpoor little me."Then she went back and gave the social evening of their life to themfour boys that had stayed. She said she couldn't thank them enough forcoming this evening--which is probably the only time she had told thetruth in thirty-six hours--and they all made merry. Roth Hyde sang'Sally in Our Alley' so good on the high notes that the Duttons was allout in the hall listening; and Riley Hardin singing 'Down, Diver, Down,'Neath the Deep Blue Waves!' and Mac Gordon singing his everlastingGerman songs in their native language, and Charlie Dickman singing a newsentimental one called 'Ain't There at Least One Gentleman Here?' abouta fair young lady dancer being insulted in a gilded cafe in some largecity; and one and all voted it was a jolly evening and said how aboutcoming back to-morrow night, but Hetty said no, it was her one eveningfor study and she couldn't be bothered with them, which was a plain,downright so-and-so and well she knew it, because that girl's study wasover for good and all."Well, why string it out? I've give you the facts. And my lands! Willyou look at that clock now? Here's the morning gone and this room stilllooking like the inside of a sheep-herder's wagon! Oh, yes, and whenHetty was up here this time that she wouldn't wear my riding pantsdown, she says. 'Not only that, but I'm scrupulously careful in allways. Why, I never even allow dear Burchell to observe me in one ofthose lace boudoir caps that so many women cover up their hair with whenit's their best feature but they won't take time to do it.'"Now was that spoken like a wise woman or like the two-horned GalumpsisCaladensis of East India, whose habits are little known to man? My Lord!Won't I ever learn to stop? Where did I put that dusting cloth?"VICOUSIN EGBERT INTERVENES"It takes all kinds of foreigners to make a world," said MaPettengill--irrelevantly I thought, because the remark seemed to beinspired merely by the announcement of Sandy Sawtelle that the muleJerry's hip had been laid open by a kick from the mule Alice, and thatthe bearer of the news had found fourteen stitches needed to mend therent.Sandy brought his news to the owner of the Arrowhead as she relaxed inmy company on the west veranda of the ranch house and scented the goldendusk with burning tobacco of an inferior but popular brand. I listenedbut idly to the minute details of the catastrophe, discovering moreentertainment in the solemn wake of light a dulled sun was leaving as itslipped over the sagging rim of Arrowhead Pass. And yet, through myabsorption with the shadows that now played far off among the foldedhills, there did come sharply the impression that this Sawtelle personwas dwelling too insistently upon the precise number of stitchesrequired by the breach in Jerry's hide."Fourteen--yes, ma'am; fourteen stitches. That there Alice mule sureneeds handling. Fourteen regular ones. I'd certainly show her where tohead in at, like now she was my personal property. Me, I'd abuse hershamefully. Only eleven I took last time in poor old Jerry; and here nowit's plumb fourteen--yes, ma'am; fourteen good ones. Say, you getfourteen of them stitches in your hide, and I bet--thought, at first, Icould make twelve do, but it takes full fourteen, with old Jerry nearlytearing the chute down while I was taking these fourteen--"I began to see numbers black against that glowing panorama in the west.A monstrous 14 repeated itself stubbornly along the gorgeous reach ofit."Yes, ma'am--fourteen; you can go out right now and count 'em yourself.And like mebbe I'll have to go down to town to-morrow for some more ofthat King of Pain Liniment, on account of Lazarus and Bryan getting goodand lamed in this same mix-up, and me letting fall the last bottle wehad on the place and busting her wide open--""Don't you bother to bust any more!" broke in his employer in a tonethat I found crisp with warning. "There's a whole new case of King ofPain in the storeroom.""Huh!" exclaimed the surgeon, ably conveying disappointment thereby."And like now if I did go down I could get the new parts for that theremower--""That's something for me to worry about exclusively. I'll begin when wegot something to mow." There was finished coldness in this."Huh!" The primitive vocable now conveyed a lively resentment, butthere was the pleading of a patient sufferer in what followed. "And likeat the same time, having to make the trip anyway for these here suppliesand things, I could stop just a minute at Doc Martingale's and have thisold tooth of mine took out, that's been achin' like a knife stuck in mefur the last fourteen--well, fur about a week now--achin' night andday--no sleep at all now fur seven, eight nights; so painful I getregular delirious, let me tell you. And, of course, all wore out the wayI am, I won't be any good on the place till my agony's relieved. Why,what with me suffering so horrible, I just wouldn't hardly know my ownname sometimes if you was to come up and ask me!"The woman's tone became more than ever repellent."Never you mind about not knowing your own name. I got it on the payroll, and it'll still be there to-morrow if you're helping Buck get outthe rest of them fence posts like I told you. If you happen to get stuckfor your name when I ain't round, and the inquiring parties won't wait,just ask the Chinaman; he never forgets anything he's learned once. OrI'll write it out on a card, so you can show it to anybody who rides upand wants to know it in a hurry!""Huh!"The powers of this brief utterance had not yet been exhausted. It nowconveyed despair. With bowed head the speaker dully turned and withdrewfrom our presence. As he went I distinctly heard him mutter:"Huh! Four-teen! Four-teen! And seven! And twenty-eight!""Say, there!" his callous employer called after him. "Why don't you getBoogles to embroider that name of yours on the front of your shirt? He'dadore to do it. And you can still read, can't you, in the midst of youragonies?"There was no response to this taunt. The suffering one faded slowly downthe path to the bunk house and was lost in its blackness. A light shoneout and presently came sombre chords from a guitar, followed by thevoice of Sandy in gloomy song: "There's a broken heart for every lighton Broadway--"I was not a little pained to discover this unsuspected vein of crueltyin a woman I had long admired. And the woman merely became irrelevantwith her apothegm about foreigners. I ignored it."What about that sufferer down there in the bunk house?" I demanded."Didn't you ever have toothache?""No; neither did Sandy Sawtelle. He ain't a sufferer; he's just a liar.""Why?""So I'll let him go to town and play the number of them stitches on thewheel. Sure! He'd run a horse to death getting there, make for the backroom of the Turf Club Saloon, where they run games whenever the townain't lidded too tight, and play roulette till either him or the gamehad to close down. Yes, sir; he'd string his bets along on fourteen andseven and twenty-eight and thirty-five, and if he didn't make a killinghe'd believe all his life that the wheel was crooked. Stitches in amule's hide is his bug. He could stitch up any horse on the place andnever have the least hunch; but let it be a mule--Say! Down there rightnow he's thinking about the thousand dollars or so I'm keeping him outof. I judge from his song that he'd figured on a trip East to New YorkCity or Denver. At that, I don't know as I blame him. Yes, sir; that'swhat reminded me of foreigners and bazaars and vice, and so on--and poorEgbert Floud."My hostess drew about her impressive shoulders a blanket of Indian weavethat dulled the splendours of the western sky, and rolled a slendercigarette from the tobacco and papers at her side. By the ensuing flameof a match I saw that her eyes gleamed with the light of pure narration."Foreigners, bazaars, vice, and Egbert Floud?" I murmured, wishing theseto be related more plausibly one to another."I'm coming to it," said the lady; and, after two sustaining inhalationsfrom the new cigarette, forthwith she did:       *       *       *       *       *It was late last winter, while I was still in Red Gap. The talk wentround that we'd ought to have another something for the Belgians. We'dhad a concert, the proceeds of which run up into two figures after allexpenses was paid; but it was felt something more could bedone--something in the nature of a bazaar, where all could get together.The Mes-dames Henrietta Templeton Price and Judge Ballard were appointeda committee to do some advance scouting.That was where Egbert Floud come in, though after it was all over anyone could see that he was more to be pitied than censured. Thesewell-known leaders consulted him among others, and Cousin Egbert saysright off that, sure, he'll help 'em get up something if they'll agreeto spend a third of the loot for tobacco for the poor soldiers, becausea Belgian or any one else don't worry so much about going hungry if theycan have a smoke from time to time, and he's been reading about wheretobacco is sorely needed in the trenches. He felt strong about it,because one time out on the trail he lost all his own and had to smokepoplar bark or something for two weeks, nearly burning his flues out.The two Mes-dames agreed to this, knowing from their menfolk thattobacco is one of the great human needs, both in war and in peace, andknowing that Cousin Egbert will be sure to donate handsomely himself, healways having been the easiest mark in town; so they said they was muchobliged for his timely suggestion and would he think up some novelfeature for the bazaar; and he said he would if he could, and they wenton to other men of influence.Henrietta's husband, when he heard the money wouldn't all be spent formere food, said he'd put up a choice lot in Price's Addition to beraffled off--a lot that would at some future date be worth five thousanddollars of anybody's money, and that was all right; and some of themerchants come through liberal with articles of use and adornment to betook chances on.Even old Proctor Knapp, the richest man in town, actually give upsomething after they pestered him for an hour. He owns the People'sTraction Company and he turned over a dollar's worth of street-cartickets to be raffled for, though saying he regarded gambling as a veryobjectionable and uncertain vice, and a person shouldn't go intoanything without being sure they was dead certain to make something outof it, war or no war, he knowing all about it. Why wouldn't he, havingstarted life as a poor, ragged boy and working his way up to whereparties that know him is always very careful indeed when they do anybusiness with him?Some of the ladies they consulted was hostile about the tobacco end ofit. Mrs. Tracy Bangs said that no victim of the weed could keep up hismentality, and that she, for one, would rather see her Tracy lying inhis casket than smoking vile tobacco that would destroy his intellectand make him a loathsome object in the home. She said she knew perfectlywell that if the countries at war had picked their soldiers fromnon-smokers it would have been all over in just a few days--and didn'tthat show you that the tobacco demon was as bad as the rum demon?Mrs. Leonard Wales was not only bitter about tobacco but about any helpat all. She said our hard storms of that winter had been caused by thegeneral hatred in Europe which created evil waves of malignity; so let'em shoot each other till they got sense enough to dwell together inlove and amity--only we shouldn't prolong the war by sending 'em soupand cigarettes, and so on. Her idea seemed to be that if Red Gap wouldjust stand firm in the matter the war would die a natural death. Still,if a bazaar was really going to be held, she would consent to pose in atableau if they insisted on it, and mebbe she could thus inject into theevil atmosphere of Europe some of the peace and good will that sets theUnited States apart from other nations.Trust Cora Wales not to overlook a bet like that. She's a tall,sandy-haired party, with very extravagant contours, and the thing sheloves best on earth is to get under a pasteboard crown, with gilt starson it, and drape herself in the flag of her country, with one fat armbare, while Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and the restis gathered about and looking up to her for protection. Mebbe she don'tlook so bad as the Goddess of Liberty on a float in the middle of one ofour wide streets when the Chamber of Commerce is giving a Greater RedGap pageant; but take her in a hall, where you set close up to theplatform, and she looks more like our boasted liberty has degeneratedinto license, or something like that. Anyway, the committee had topromise her she could do something in her flag and crown and talcumpowder, because they knew she'd knock the show if they didn't.This reminded 'em they had to have a program of entertainment; so theygot me on the committee with the other Mes-dames to think up things, mealways being an easy mark. I find out right off that we're a lot offoreigners and you got to be darned careful not to hurt anybody'sfeelings. Little Bertha Lehman's pa would let her be a state--Coloradoor Nebraska, or something--but he wouldn't let her sing unless it wouldbe a German song in the original; and Hobbs, the English baker, said hisTillie would have to sing "Britannia Rules the Waves," or nothing; andtwo or three others said what they would and wouldn't do, and it lookedlike Red Gap itself was going to be dug up into trenches. I had to getlittle Magnesia Waterman, daughter of the coons that work in the U.S.Grill, to do the main singing. She seemed to be about the only Americanchild soprano we had. She sings right well for a kid, mostly these sadsongs about heaven; but we picked out a good live one for her thatseemed to be neutral.It was delicate work, let me tell you, turning down folks that wanted tosing patriotic songs or recite war poetry that would be sure to startsomething, with Professor Gluckstein wishing to get up and tell how thecowardly British had left the crew of a German submarine to perish aftershooting it up when it was only trying to sink their cruiser by fairand lawful methods; and Henry Lehman wanting to read a piece from aGerman newspaper about how the United States was a nation of vilemoney-grubbers that would sell ammunition to the enemy just because theyhad the ships to take it away, and wouldn't sell a dollar's worth to theFatherland, showing we had been bought up by British gold--and so on.But I kept neutral. I even turned down an Englishman named Ruggles, thatkeeps the U.S. Grill and is well thought of, though he swore that all hewould do was to get off a few comical riddles, and such. He'd just got anew one that goes: "Why is an elephant like a corkscrew? Because there'sa 'b' in both." I didn't see it at first, till he explained with heartylaughter--because there's a "b" in both--the word "both." See? Of coursethere's no sense to it. He admitted there wasn't, but said it was ajolly wheeze just the same. I might have took a chance with him, but hewent on to say that he'd sent this wheeze to the brave lads in thetrenches, along with a lot of cigars and tobacco, and had got aboutfifty postcards from 'em saying it was the funniest thing they'd heardsince the war begun. And in a minute more he was explaining, with muchfeeling, just what low-down nation it was that started the war--it notbeing England, by any means--and I saw he wasn't to be trusted on hisfeet.So I smoothed him down till he promised to donate all the lemonade forAggie Tuttle, who was to be Rebekkah at the Well; and I smoothed HenryLehman till he said he'd let his folks come and buy chances on things,even if the country was getting overrun by foreigners, with an Italianbarber shop just opened in the same block with his sanitary shavingparlour; though--thank goodness--the Italian hadn't had much to do yetbut play on a mandolin. And I smoothed Professor Gluckstein down till heagreed to furnish the music for us and let the war take care of itself.The Prof's a good old scout when he ain't got his war bonnet on. He wasdarned near crying into his meerschaum pipe with a carved fat lady on itwhen I got through telling him about the poor soldiers in the wet andcold without a thing to smoke. He says: "You're right, madam; with JakeFrost in the trenches and no tobacco, all men should be brothers undertheir hides." And I got that printed in the _Recorder_ for a slogan, andother foreigners come into line; and things looked pretty good.Also, I got Doc Sulloway, who happened to be in town, to promise he'dcome and tell some funny anecdotes. He ain't a regular doctor--he justtook it up; a guy with long black curls and a big moustache and a bighat and diamond pin, that goes round selling Indian Snake Oil off awagon. Doc said he'd have his musician, Ed Bemis, come, too. He said Edwas known far and wide as the world's challenge cornetist. I says allright, if he'll play something neutral; and Doc says he'll play "Listento the Mocking Bird," with variations, and play it so swell you'llthink you're perched right up in the treetops listening to Nature's ownfeathered songsters.That about made up my show, including, of course, the Spanish dance byBeryl Mae Macomber. Red Gap always expects that and Beryl Mae neverdisappoints 'em--makes no difference what the occasion is. Mebbe it's anEvening with Shakespeare, or the Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers, or thatOratorio by Elijah somebody, but Beryl Mae is right there with hergirlish young beauty and her tambourine. You see, I didn't want it along show--just enough to make the two-bits admission seem a littleshort of robbery. Our real graft, of course, was to be where the youngsociety debutantes and heiresses in charge of the booths would wheedlemoney out of the dazed throng for chances on the junk that would bedonated.[Illustration: "ALL SUNNED UP LIKE A MAN THAT KNOWS THE WORLD IS HISOYSTER AND EVERY MONTH'S GOT AN 'R' IN IT"]Well, about three days before the show I went up to Masonic Hall to seeabout the stage decorations, and I was waiting while some one went downto the Turf Exchange to get the key off Tim Mahoney, the janitor--Timhad lately had to do janitor work for a B'nai B'rith lodge that washolding meetings there, and it had made him gloomy and dissolute--and,while I was waiting, who should come tripping along but Egbert Floud,all sunned up like a man that knows the world is his oyster and everymonth's got an "r" in it. Usually he's a kind of sad, meek coot, lookingneglected and put upon; but now he was actually giggling to himselfas he come up the stairs two at a time."Well, Old-Timer, what has took the droop out of your face?" I ask him."Why," he says, twinkling all over the place, "I'm aiming to keep it asecret, but I don't mind hinting to an old friend that my part of theevening's entertainment is going to be so good it'll make the whole showtop-heavy. Them ladies said they'd rely on me to think up somethingnovel, and I said I would if I could, and I did--that's all. I'd seenenough of these shows where you ladies pike along with pincushions andfancy lemonade and infants' wear--and mebbe a red plush chair, with goldlegs, that plays 'Alice, Where Art Thou?' when a person sets down onit--with little girls speaking a few pieces about the flowers and lambs,and so on, and cleaning up about eleven-twenty-nine on the evening'srevel--or it would be that, only you find you forgot to pay the GoldenRule Cash Store for the red-and-blue bunting, and they're howling fortheir money like a wild-cat. Yes, sir; that's been the way of it withwoman at the helium. I wouldn't wish to be a Belgian at all underpresent circumstances; but if I did have to be one I'd hate to think myregular meals was depending on any crooked work you ladies has done upto date.""You'd cheer me strangely," I says, "only I been a diligent reader ofhistory, and somehow I can't just recall your name being connected upwith any cataclysms of finance. I don't remember you ever starting oneof these here panics--or stopping one, for that matter. I did hear thatyou'd had your pocket picked down to the San Francisco Fair."I was prodding him along, understand, so he'd flare up and tell me whathis secret enterprise was that would make women's operations look sillyand feminine. I seen his eyes kind of glisten when I said this about himbeing touched."That's right," he says. "Some lad nicked me for my roll and my returnticket, and my gold watch and chain, and my horseshoe scarfpin with thediamonds in it.""You stood a lot of pawing over," I says, "for a man that's the keenfinancial genius you tell about being. This lad must of been a new handat it. Likely he'd took lessons from a correspondence school. At least,with you standing tied and blinded that way, a good professional onewould have tried for your gold tooth--or, anyway, your collar button. Isee your secret though," I go on as sarcastically as possible: "You gotthe lad's address and you're going to have him here Saturday night toglide among the throng and ply his evil trade. Am I right or wrong?""You are not," he says. "I never thought of that. But I won't say youain't warm in your guess. Yes, you certainly are warm, because what I'mgoing to do is just as dastardly, without being so darned illegal,except to an extent."Well, it was very exasperating, but that was all I could get out ofhim. When I ask for details he just clams up."But, mark my words," says the old smarty, "I'll show you it takesbrains in addition to woman's wiles and artwork to make a decentclean-up in this little one-cylinder town.""If you just had a little more self-confidence," I says, "you might ofgone to the top; lack of faith in yourself is all that's kept you back.Too bad!""All right for you to kid me," he says; "but I'd be almost willing togive you two dollars for every dollar that goes out of this hallSaturday night."Well, it was kind of pathetic and disgusting the way this poor old dubwas leaning on his certainty; so I let him alone and went on about mywork, thinking mebbe he really had framed up something crooked thatwould bring at least a few dollars to the cause.Every time I met him for the next three days after that he'd be sopuffed up, like a toad, with importance and low remarks about womanthat, at last, I just ignored him, pretending I hadn't the leastcuriosity about his evil secret. It hurt his feelings when I quitpestering him about it, but he'd been outraging mine right along; so wesplit even.He'd had a good-sized room just down the hall turned over to him, and alot of stuff of some kind carried in there in the night, and menworking, with the door locked all the time; so I and the other ladieswent calmly on about our own business, decorating the main hall withthe flags of all nations, fixing up the platform and the booths verypretty, and giving Mr. Smarty Egbert Floud nothing but haughty glancesabout his hidden novelty. Even when his men was hammering away in thereat their work he'd have something hung over the keyhole--as insulting tous as only a man can be.Saturday night come and we had a good crowd. Cousin Egbert was after methe minute I got my things off to come and see his dastardly secret; butI had my revenge. I told him I had no curiosity about it and was goingto be awful busy with my show, but I'd try as a personal favour to givehim a look over before I went home. Yes, sir; I just turned him downwith one superior look, and got my curtains slid back on Mrs. LeonardWales, dressed up like a superdreadnought in a naval parade andsurrounded by every little girl in town that had a white dress. Theywasn't states this time, but Columbia's Choicest Heritage, with a secondline on the program saying, "Future Buds and Debutantes From Society'sHome Galleries." It was a line we found under some babies' photos on thesociety page of a great newspaper printed in New York City. ProfessorGluckstein and his son Rudolph played the "Star-Spangled Banner" on thepiano and fiddle during this feature.Then little Magnesia Waterman, dressed to represent the Queen of Sheba,come forward and sung the song we'd picked out for her, with the peoplejoining in the chorus:    We're for you, Woodrow Wilson,      One Hundred Million Strong!    We put you in the White House      And we know you can't do wrong.It was very successful, barring hisses from all the Germans and Englishpresent; but they was soon hushed up. Then Doc Sulloway come out andtold some funny anecdotes about two Irishmen named Pat and Mike, latelylanded in this country and looking for work, and imitated two cats in abackyard, and drawing a glass of soda water, and sawing a plank in two;and winding up with the announcement that he had donated a dozen bottlesof the great Indian Snake Oil Remedy for man and beast that had beenimparted to him in secret by old Rumpatunk, the celebrated medicine man,who is supposed to have had it from the Great Spirit; and Ed Bemis, theWorld's Challenge Cornetist, entertained one and all; and Beryl Mae doneher Spanish dance that I'd last seen her give at the Queen EstherCantata in the M.E. Church. And that was the end of the show; justenough to start 'em buying things at the booths.At least, we thought it would be. But what does a lot of the crowd do,after looking round a little, but drift out into the hall and down tothis room where Cousin Egbert had his foul enterprise, whatever it was.I didn't know yet, having held aloof, as you might say, owing to the oldhound's offensive manner. But I had heard three or four parties kind ofgasping to each other, had they seen what that Egbert Floud was doing inthe other room?--with looks of horror and delight on their faces. Thatmade me feel more superior than ever to the old smarty; so I didn't gonear the place yet, but herded people back to the raffles wherever Icould.The first thing was Lon Price's corner lot, for which a hundred chanceshad been sold. Lon had a blueprint showing the very lot; also a pictureof a choice dwelling or bungalow, like the one he has painted on thedrop curtain of Knapp's Opera House, under the line, "Price's Additionto Red Gap; Big Lots, Little Payments." It's a very fancy house withporches and bay windows and towers and front steps, and everything,painted blue and green and yellow; and a blond lady in a purple gown,with two golden-haired tots at her side, is waving good-bye to a tall,handsome man with brown whiskers as he hurries out to the waiting streetcar--though the car line ain't built out there yet by any means.However, Lon got up and said it was a Paradise on earth, a Heaven ofHomes; that in future he would sell lots there to any native Belgian ata 20 per cent. discount; and he hoped the lucky winner of this lot wouldat once erect a handsome and commodious mansion on it, such as theartist had here depicted; and it would be only nine blocks from theswell little Carnegie Library when that, also, had been built, theplans for it now being in his office safe.Quite a few of the crowd had stayed for this, and they cheered Lon andvoted that little Magnesia Waterman was honest enough to draw thenumbers out of a hat. They was then drawn and read by Lon in an excitingsilence--except for Mrs. Leonard Wales, who was breathing heavily andtalking to herself after each number. She and Leonard had took a chancefor a dollar and everybody there knew it by now. She was dead sure theywould get the lot. She kept telling people so, right and left. She saidthey was bound to get it if the drawing was honest. As near as I couldmake out, she'd been taking a course of lessons from a professor inChicago about how to control your destiny by the psychic force thatdwells within you. It seems all you got to do is to will things to comeyour way and they have to come. No way out of it. You step on this herepsychic gas and get what you ask for."I already see our little home," says Mrs. Wales in a hoarse whisper. "Isee it objectively. It is mine. I claim it out of the boundlessall-good. I have put myself in the correct mental attitude of reception;I am holding to the perfect All. My own will come to me."And so on, till parties round her begun to get nervous. Yes, sir; shekept this stuff going in low, tense tones till she had every one inhearing buffaloed; they was ready to give her the lot right there andtear up their own tickets. She was like a crapshooter when he keepscalling to the dice: "Come, seven--come on, come on!" All right for thepsychics, but that's what she reminded me of.And in just another minute everybody there thought she'd cheated bytaking these here lessons that she got from Chicago for twelve dollars;for you can believe it or not but her number won the lot. Yes, sir;thirty-three took the deed and Lon filled in her name on it right there.Many a cold look was shot at her as she rushed over to embrace herhusband, a big lump of a man that's all right as far up as his Adam'sapple, and has been clerking in the Owl Cigar Store ever since he canremember. He tells her she is certainly a wonder and she calls him asilly boy; says it's just a power she has developed throughconcentration, and now she must claim from the all-good a dear littlehome of seven rooms and bath, to be built on this lot; and she knows itwill come if she goes into the silence and demands it. Say! People withany valuables on 'em begun to edge off, not knowing just how thisstrange power of hers might work.Then I look round and see the other booths ain't creating near theexcitement they had ought to be, only a few here and there takingtwo-bit chances on things if Mrs. Wales ain't going in on 'em, too;several of the most attractive booths was plumb deserted, with the girlsin charge looking mad or chagrined, as you might say. So I remember thishidden evil of Egbert Floud's and that the crowd has gone there; andwhile I'm deciding to give in and gratify my morbid curiosity, herecomes Cousin Egbert himself, romping along in his dinner-jacket suit andtan shoes, like a wild mustang."What was I telling you?" he demands. "Didn't I tell you the rest ofthis show was going to die standing up? Yes, sir; she's going to passout on her feet." And he waved a sneering arm round at the desertedbooths. "What does parties want of this truck when they can come down tomy joint and get real entertainment for their money? Why, they'rebreaking their ankles now to get in there!"It sure looked like he was right for once in his life; so I says:"What is it you've done?""Simple enough," says he, "to a thinking man. It comes to me like aflash or inspiration, or something, from being down to that fair in SanFrancisco, California. Yes, sir; they had a deadfall there, with everykind of vice rampant that has ever been legalized any place, and severalkinds that ain't ever been; they done everything, from strong-arm workto short changing, and they was getting by with it by reason of callingit Ye Olde Tyme Mining Camp of '49, or something poetical like that.That was where I got nicked for my roll, in addition to about fifty Ilost at a crooked wheel. I think the workers was mostly ex-convicts, andnot so darned ex- at that. Anyway, their stuff got too raw even for themanagers of an exposition, so they had to close down in spite of theirname. That's where I get my idee when these ladies said think upsomething novel and pleasing. Just come and see how I'm taking it off of'em." And, with that, he grabs me by the arm and rushes me down to thisjoint of his.At the side of the doorway he had two signs stuck up. One says, Ye OldeTyme Saloone; and the other says, Ye Olde Tyme Gambling Denne. You couldof pushed me over with one finger when I looked in. He'd drew the crowd,all right. I knew then that Aggie Tuttle might just as well close downher Rebekkah-at-the-Well dive, and that no one was going to take anymore chances on pincushions and tidies and knitted bed slippers.About a third of the crowd was edged up to the bar and keeping LouisMeyer and his father busy with drink orders, and the other two-thirdswas huddled round a roulette layout across the room. They was wedged inso tight I couldn't see the table, but I could hear the little ballclick when it slowed up, and the rattle of chips, and squeals from themthat won, and hoarse mutters from the losers.Cousin Egbert rubbed his hands and giggled, waiting for me to bedeck himwith floral tributes."I suppose you got a crooked wheel," I says."Shucks, no!" says he. "I did think of it, but I'd of had to send out oftown for one and they're a lot of trouble to put in, what with theelectric wiring and all; and besides, the straightest roulette wheelever made is crooked enough for any man of decent instincts. I don'tbegrudge 'em a little excitement for their money. I got these old barfixings out of the Spilmer place that was being tore down, and we'recharging two bits a drink for whatever, and that'll be a help; and itlooks to me like you ladies would of thought you needed a man's brain inthese shows long before this. Come on in and have a shot. I'll buy."So we squeezed in and had one. It was an old-time saloon, allright--that is, fairly old; about 1889, with a brass foot rail, and backof the bar a stuffed eagle and a cash register. A gang of ladies wastaking claret lemonades and saying how delightfully Bohemian it all was;and Miss Metta Bigler, that gives lessons in oil painting and burntwood, said it brought back very forcibly to her the Lat
