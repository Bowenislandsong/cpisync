up, creeping stealthilyTo breathe upon his clay-cold face--but all too cold was he,Too cold for you to warm, south-wind, since cold at heart was she!Sweet morning peeped above the hill, above the hill to findThe shattered, useless, godlike thing the night had left behind--Wept the sweet morn her crystal tears that love should prove unkind!Christmas in HeavenHOW hushed they were in Heaven that night,  How lightly all the angels went,How dumb the singing spheres beneath  Their many-candled tent!How silent all the drifting throng  Of earth-freed spirits, strangely tornBy dim and half-remembered pain  And joy but newly born!The Glory in the Highest flamed  With awful, unremembered ray--But quiet as the falling dew  Was He who went away.So swift He went, His passing left  A low, bright door in Heaven ajar--With God it was a covenant,  To man it seemed a star.I Whispered to the BobolinkI WHISPERED to the bobolink:  "Sweet singer of the field,Teach me a song to reach a heart  In maiden armor steeled."  "If there be such a song," sang he,  "No bird can tell its mystery."I bent above the sweetest rose,  A deeper sweet to stir--"O Rose," I begged, "what charm will wake  The deep, sweet heart of her?"  "Alas, poor lover," sighed the rose,  "The charm you seek no flower knows."I wandered by the midnight lake  Where heaven lay confessed"Tell me," I cried, "what draws the stars  To lie upon your breast?"  The silence woke to soft reply  "When Heaven stoops--demand not why!""Alas, sweet maid, love's potent charm  I cannot beg or buy,I cannot wrest it from the wind  Or steal it from the sky--"  Breathless, I caught her whisper low,  "I love you--why, I do not know!"YouSLANTING rain and a sky of gray,Drifting mist and a wind astray,The leaden end of a leaden dayAnd you--away!Light in the west! The sky's pale domeGemmed with a star; a scented gloamOf bursting buds and rain-wet loamAnd you--at home!The MotherLAST night he lay within my arm,  So small, so warm--a mystery  To which God only held the key--But mine to keep from fear and harm!Ah! He was all my own, last night,  With soft, persuasive, baby eyes,  So wondering and yet so wise,And hands that held my finger tight.Why was it that he could not stay--Too rare a gift? Yet who could hold  A treasure with securer holdThan I, to whom love taught the way?As with a flood of golden light  The first sun tipped earth's golden rim  So all my world grew bright with himAnd with his going fell the night--O God, is there an angel arm  More strong, more tender than the rest?  Lay Thou my baby on his breastTo keep him safe from fear and harm!The VassalWIND of the North, O far, wild wind  Born of a far, lone sea--When suns are soft and breezes kind  Why are you kin to me?Uncounted years above the sea,  Rock-fortressed from its rage,The fishermen, your fathers, kept  A barren heritage--Grim as the sea they forced to pay  The sea-toll of their wage.And lo! The fate which made you hers  And gave you of her bestAnd set you in a sunny place,  Down-sloping to the West,Forgot to change your fisher's heart  Serf to the sea's unrest!Wind of the North! O bitter wind,  I hear the wild seas fret--In the dim spaces of the mind  They claim me vassal yet!The TroubadourTHE wind blows salt from off the sea  And sweet from where the land lies green;I travel down the great highway  That runs so straight and white between--I watch the sea-wind strain the sheet,The land-wind toss the yellow wheat!Song is my mistress, fickle she,  Yet dear beyond all dearth of speech;Child of the winds of land and sea  She charms me with the charm of each--Full soft and sweet she sings and thenShe sings wild songs for sailor-men!No staff I carry in my hand,  No pack I carry on my back,No foot of earth I call my own,  For castle or for cot I lack--I travel fast, I travel slow,And where my mistress bids I go!My gems, the pearl upon the leaf  At mystic hour of the morn;My gold, the gold that rims the sea  A moment ere the day is born;And on my breezy couch o' nightsThe stars shine down--my taper lights!Happy am I that sing of love,  Yet from the thrall of love am free;Happy am I that sing of pain  And quick forget what pain may be!I sing of death--and lo! To meLife is supremest ecstacy!Indian SummerI HAVE strayed from silent places,Where the days are dreaming always;And fair summer lies a-dying,Roses withered on her breast.I have stolen all her beauty,All her softness, all her sweetness;In her robe of folden sunshine  I am drest.I will breathe a mist about meLest you see my face too clearly,Lest you follow me too boldlyI will silence every song.Through the haze and through the silenceYou will know that I am passing;When you break the spell that holds you,  I am gone!The UnchangedIF we could salvage BabylonFrom times's grim heap of dust and bones;If we could charm cool waters backTo sing against her thirsty stones;If, on a day,We two should strayDown some long, Babylonian way--Perhaps the strangest sight of allWould be the street boys playing ball.If through Pompeii's agelong nightA yellow sun again might shine,And little, sea-born breezes liftThe hair of lovers sipping wine,If, in some fair,Dim temple there,We watched Pompeii come to prayer--Not the strange altar would surpriseBut strangeness of familiar eyes!Ay, should our magic straightly wakeAtlantis from her sea-rocked sleepAnd we on some ProcessionalLook down where dancing maidens leap,If one flushed maidBeside us stayedTo tie more firm her loosened braid--Would not the shaking wonder beTo find her just like you and me?IndifferenceA BIRD, a wild-flower and a tree--I care for them, not they for me.I see all heaven in a pool--But the frog there takes me for a fool.To this dead thrush a tear I gave--All Spring shall sing above my grave,And naught I spend my heart uponKnow lack or loss that I am gone--A bird, a wild-flower and a tree,I cherish them; they suffer me!Last ThingsTHERE is no one to do it for me,  But I know what I shall doWhen the last dawn breaks o'er me  And the last night is through.I shall set in pleasant order  The little books I knew,With flowers on the window ledge  In a shallow bowl of blue.I'll leave the out door swinging,  (As it might swing for you)And on the clean swept door-sill  Wild roses I shall strew--So when pale Death comes trailing  Her branch of sodden rueShe'll gather up my gay content  And know contentment too!Callous CupidCUPID does not care for sighsDoes not care for lover's weeping!Fair One, dry your pretty eyes,Cupid does not care for sighs,Laugh with him if you are wise,Steel the heart he has in keeping;Cupid does not care for sighsDoes not care for lover's weeping!The MeetingSHE flitted by me on the stair--A moment since I knew not of her.A look, a smile--she passed! but whereShe flitted by me on the stairJoy cradled exquisite despair;For who am I that I should love her?She flitted by me on the stair--A moment since I knew not of her!The PiperI'VE heard the pipes of PanSomewhere, just beyond,--Over the edge of dawn, I think,Where the clouds hang soft on the world's dim brink,Where the red suns rise and the blue stars sink,I heard the pipes of Pan!Hush! what you heard was the wind,The feet of the wind through the leaves,Or the sigh of the waking night as it stirred.Or a bird's note afar,Or the deep breath of June,Or the fall of a star,Or the shimmering skirts of the sea-slipping tideIn the wake of the wandering moon!Nay! 'twas the pipes of Pan!Somewhere--just beyond--My soul awoke with a rapturous sigh(Would I wake my soul for a night bird's cry?)I heard the winds of the worlds sweep byTo follow the pipes of Pan!Stay! 'twas a voice that you heard,A voice that you love, in the wood,The vibrating note of a half spoken word--For the great Pan is slain,Of his pipings we know not one magical strain,They have fled down the years of a world that was youngOh, ages and ages ago!Nay, 'twas the pipes of Pan!Somewhere--just beyond--Far as a star, yet piercing sweet,A passionate, poignant, rhythmic beat--Till my mad blood raced with my racing feetTo follow the piper--Pan!WanderlustTHE highways and the byways, the kind sky folding all,And never a care to drag me back and never a voice to call;Only the call of the long, white road to the far horizon's wall.The glad seas and the mad seas, the seas on a night in June,And never a hand to beckon back from the path of the new-lit moon;Never a night that lasts too long or a dawn that breaks too soon!The shrill breeze and the hill breeze, the sea breeze, fierce and bold,And never a breeze that gives the lie to a tale that a breeze has told;Always the tale of the strange and new in the countries strange and old.The lone trail and the known trail, the trail you must take on trust,And never a trail without a grave where a wanderer's bones are thrust--Never a look or a turning back till the dust shall claim the dust!GoldWHEN life wakened in the Spring  All the world was gold and green!Sunlight lay on everything,Sailing cloud and soaring wing,  Emerald banks where snow had been,  Drifts of daffodils between.When Life's pulse beat strong and high  Shone the world in gold and blue!Canopied with turquoise skySummer passed superbly by,  Bluest midnight cupped the dew  Golden morn might sparkle through!Now that life would rest again  Soft she lies in gold and brown,Brown the fields and gold the grain,Brown the little pools of rain,  Gold the leaves that falter down  To brown pavements in the town.The MaterialistMY soul has left its tent of clay  And seeks from star to star,'Mid flaming worlds that are to be,  And fruitful worlds that are,The Voice which spake and said "Live on!"  (When Death said, "You may die")And sent my spirit wandering  The stairway of the sky.Still must I seek what on the earth   I sought as fruitlessly--The world I knew, the heaven I scorned  Lost in infinity:Alone, and on the ageless breath  Of cosmic whirlwinds spun,I hurtle through the outer dark  Toward some fantastic sun!--O God! how happy is the leaf,  A sweet and soulless thing,Dying to live but in the green  Of yet another Spring--These heights, these depths, these flaming worlds,  This stairway of the skyI'd give, had no Voice said "Live on!"  When Death said, "You may die."Tir Nan OgTHE breeze blows out from the land and it seeks the sea,  O and O! that my sail were set and away--Fast and free on its wings would my sailing be  To the west: to the Tir Nan Og, where the blessed stay!The darkness stirs, it awakes, it outspreads its arms,  O and O! and the birds in their nests are still,The red-browed hill bleats low with the lamb's alarms,  And a sound of singing comes from the slipping rill.My soul is awake alone, all alone in the earth,  O and O! and around is the lonely night.As with the sun, would my soul go forth to its birth--  O'er the darkling sea, to the west--to the light, to the light!Do they say, "Be content with the land of the Innis Fail,  O and O! there is friendship here, there is song."But they smile to your face, when you turn they stammer and rail  And the song of the singer has tears and is over long!A call comes out of the west and it calls a name,  O and O! it is soft, it is far, it is low--Sweet, so sweet that it touches my soul with a flame  That burns the heart from my breast with the wish to go!(Translated from the Celtic.)The Little Man in Green'TWAS a little man in green,  And he sat upon a stone;  And he sat there all alone,Whispering."One and two," so whispered he.  ('Twas an ancient man and hoar)  "One and two," and then no more--Never, "Three".Hawthorn trees were quick with May--  "Sir," said I, "Good-day to you"!  But he counted. "One and two"In strange way.Fool I was--oh, fool was I  (Who should know the ways of them!)  That I touched his cloak's green hem,Passing by.I was fey with spring and mirth--  Speaking him without a thought--  Now is joy a thing forgotOn the earth.Ere the sweet thorn-buds were through,  Wife and child doom-stricken lay,  Cold as winter, white as spray--"One and two!"Now I seek eternally  That grim Counter of the fen,  Praying he may count again--Counting, "Three".* In the bad chance of a meeting with the "Little People" themortal is cautioned not to speak to them nor to touch, but to passby quickly with averted eye.--Old tale.The EnchantressI FEAR Eileen, the wild Eileen--  The eyes she lifts to mine,That laugh and laugh and never tell  The half that they divine!She draws me to her lonely cot  Ayont the Tulloch Hill;And, laughing, draws me to her door  And, laughing, holds me still.I bless myself and bless myself,  But in the holy sign,There seems to be no heart of love,  To still the pain in mine.The morning, bright above the moor,  Is bright no more for me--A weary bit of burning pain  Is where my heart should be!For since the wild, sweet laugh of her  Has drawn me to her snare,The only sunlight in the world  Is shining from her hair.Yet well I know, ah, well I know  Why 'tis so sweet and wild--She slept beneath a faery thorn,  She is a faery child!And so I leave my mother lone,  No meal to fill the pot,And follow, follow wild Eileen.  If so I will or not.I fear to meet her in the glen,  Or seek her by the shore;I fear to lift her cabin's latch,  But--should she come no more!--O Eileen Og, O wild Eileen,  My heart is wracked with fearLest you should meet your faery kin,  And, laughing, leave me here!The BansheeTHE Banshee cries on the rising wind  "O-hoho, O hoho-o-o!"The dead to free and the quick to bind--(Close fast the shutter and draw the blind!)  "O-hoho, O hoho-o-o!"Why are you paler my dearest dear?  "O-hoho, O hoho-o-o!"'Tis but the wind in the elm tree near--(Acushla, hush! lest the Banshee hear!)  "O-hoho, O hoho-o-o!"See, how the crackling fire up-springs,  "O-hoho, O hoho-o-o!"Up and up on its flame-red wings;Hark, how the cheerful kettle sings!  "O-hoho, O hoho-o-o!"Core of my heart! How cold your lips!  "O-hoho, O hoho-o-o!"White as the spray the wild wind whips,Still as your icy finger tips!  "O-hoho, O hoho-o-o!"On the rising wind the Banshee cries--  "O-hoho, O hoho-o-o!"I kiss your hair. I kiss your eyes--The kettle is dumb; the red flame dies!  "Ochone! Ochone! Ochone!"The WitchHER hair was gold and warm it lay  Upon the pallor of her brow;Her eyes were deep, aye, deep and gray--  And in their depths he drowned his vow.She wandered where the sands were wet,  Weaving the sea-weed for a crown,And there at eve a monk she met--  A holy monk in cowl and gown.She held him with her witch's stare  (A sweet, child-look--it witched him well!)Upon his lip she froze the prayer,  And in his ear she breathed a spell.He babbled ever of her name  And of her brow that gleamed like dawn,And of her lips--a lovely shame  No holy man should think upon.They hunted her along the sea,  "Witch, Witch!" they cried and hissed their hate--Her hair unbound fell to her knee  And made a glory where she sate.Her song she hushed and, wonder-eyed,  She gazed upon their bell and book;The zealous priests were fain to hide  Lest they be holden by her look.Most innocent she seemed to be  ("The Devil's sly!" the fathers say)Her eyes were dreaming eyes that see  Things strange and fair and far away.They stood her in the judgment hall.  "Confess," they cried, "the blasting spellThat holds yon crazed monk in thrall?"  "Good sirs," she said, "he loved me well."They haled her to a witch's doom,  They matched her shining hair with flame--But ever through the cloister's gloom  The mad monk babbles of her name!And, when the red sun droppeth down  And wet sand gleameth ghostily,Men see her weave a sea-weed crown  Between the twilight and the sea.Fairy SingingSHE was my love and the pulse of my heart;Lovely she was as the flowers that startStraight to the sun from the earth's tender breast,Sweet as the wind blowing out of the west--Elana, Elana, my strong one, my white one,Soft be the wind blowing over your rest!  She crept to my side  In the cold mist of morning.  "O wirra" she cried,  "'Tis farewell now, mavourneen!  When the crescent moon hung  Like a scythe in the sky,  I heard in the silence  The Little Folks cry.  "'Twas like a low sighing,  A sobbing, a singing;  It came from the west,  Where the low moon was swinging:  'Elana, Elana'  Was all of their crying.  Mavrone! I must go--  To refuse them, I dare not.  Alone I must go;  They have called and they care not--  Naught do they care that they call me apart  From the warmth and the light and the love of your heart.  Hark! How their singing  Comes winging, comes winging,  Through your close arms, beloved,  Straight to my heart!"White grew her face as the thorn's tender bloom,White as the mist from the valley of doom!Swift was her going--her head on my breastDrooped like a flower that winter has pressed--Elana, Elana! My strong one, my white one!Empty the arms that your beauty had blessed.Killed in ActionMY father lived his three-score years; my son lived twenty-two;One looked long back on work well done, and one had all to do--Yet which the better served his world, I know not, nor do you!Life taught my father all her lore till he grew wise and gray,She did but whisper to my son before she turned away--Yet which her deepest secret held only they two might say.Peace brought my father restful days, with love and fame for wage;War gave my son an unmarked grave and an unwritten page--Who shall declare which gift conveyed the greater heritage?Spring Came InSPRING came in with a red-wing's feather  And yellow clumps of the wild marshmallow--O happy bird, can you tell me whetherIn distant France they have April weather?  And little pools that are sunny and shallow?My soul is awake and my pulse is racing--  My heart is aware that the birds are mating--Oh, my heart's like a cloud that the wind is chasingO'er the earth's green blur with its silver tracing  To that sad France where there's someone waiting!O Spring! begone with your too-sweet clover  And all your bees with honey to carry--Come again when the war is over,Come, dear Spring, when you bring my lover!  Yet come no more, should he tarry . . . tarry!From the TrenchesOH, to be in Canada now that Spring is merry,  Happy apple blossoms gay against the smiling green;Here the lilac's purple plume and here the pink of cherry,  Hillsides just a drift of bloom with clover in between!Oh, to be in Canada! there's a road that rambles  Through a leafing maple-wood and up a windy hill,Velvet pussy-willows press soft hands amid the brambles  Fringing round a sky-filled pool where cattle drink their fill.Oh, to be in Canada! there's a farmhouse hidden  Where the hollow meets the hill and Spring's first footsteps show--Not a drop of honey there to any bee forbidden,  Not a cherry on a tree but all the robins know!Oh, to be in Canada, now that Spring is calling  Sweet, so sweet it breaks the heart to let its sweetness through,Oh, to breast the windy hill while yet the dew is falling--  Waking all the meadow-larks to carol in the blue!Smile upon us, Canada! None shall fail who love you  While they hold a memory of your fields where flowers are--High the task to keep unstained the skies that bend above you,  Proud the life that shields you from the flaming wind of war!The ReasonsTHEY sat before a dugoutIn the unfamiliar quiet of silenced guns.And one said:"Now that it's overWhat about a bit of truth?Let us say why we came to fight--No frills--You first, old Fire-eater!"--One with a whimsical face spoke freely;"I?--I sought some stir,Some urge in living,Some sense in dying.I sought a mountain topWith a view!""And the answer?""I have seen others findWhat I sought."    .  .  .  .  .  .  ."I don't know that it's anyone's businessWhy I came,"(Another spoke as if unwillingly),"A girl laughed, I think--Funny?--Yes, funny as hell!"--    .  .  .  .  .  .  .His neighbor said,"I was a business man,No sentiment,Nothing of that kind,--But the band playedAnd, suddenly, I sawMy country,A woman, with hands outstretched,Her back to the wall--""U--um," they nodded,"She's got a pull,That old lady."    .  .  .  .  .  .  ."As for me," the speaker was abrupt,"I was afraid!I saw pictures,I heard things--I couldn't sleepFor the Beast that was abroad--Fear!That's what brought me!"    .  .  .  .  .  .  .They sat silent for a momentIn the sun.Then an older man said briefly,"We were all afraid . . . . .. . . But what of hate?Did no one come because of hate?"    .  .  .  .  .  .  ."Yes--I"--They looked at this manCuriously,But he added nothing,And no one questioned.    .  .  .  .  .  .  .A fresh-faced boy spoke modestly;"Our family are all Army people--So, of course--And it's all over now.We got through.But it was a near thing--What?"To-DayTO-DAY is a roomWith windows upon one sideAnd upon the otherA door--Through the windows we may lookBut cannot pass;Through the door we must passBut cannot look,And there are no windowsUpon that side.MemoryA YEAR is a thiefWho comes in the guise of a friendSaying, "Let us travel together,We have much to give each other.See, I hold back nothing--For what is givingBetween friends?"Yet when the year departsHe takes his gifts with him--"Oh, Robber!" we cry,Aghast and weeping,"Nay," he replies, "I did but lend.Still, for your weeping, I will leave you something.It is not the real thingBut you may keep it always."DreamI SEE a spiritYoung and eager,Beautiful, too, I think,(Although I cannot see it clearly)It is, by right of its own being,One with all lovely, youthful things;And they, its age-old kindred,Welcome itSaying, "Come, you too are one of us!"  .  .  .  .  .  .  .This spirit is my own happy ghost--But I, myself,--alas!PerhapsTHERE was a man, once, and a womanWhose love was so entireThat an angel, watching them,Said wistfully, "Would I were no angelBut a mortal,Loving so, and so beloved!". . . . Yet, when these two mated,A muddied drop, from some forgotten vial of ancestry,Brought them a child whose mind was dark;Who lived--and never called them by their names . . .. . . . They tended herFor twenty years.Only when she diedDid they weep, whispering,"Why?"The years could find no answer,Though they went questioningUntil the end.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .Still wonderingThey wandered out into the other country . . . .It was lonely there,Being parted from familiar things,And there was no one to answer questions,But, suddenly,(As a wind blows or a swallow flies against the sun)Came a young girl--eager!She ran to them,Calling dear names,(Names that would open heaven)"Who are you?" they entreated, trembling . . . .But they knew!--Had they not dreamed her soFor twenty years?GlamourTHE knowledge of loveIs like sudden sun upon a river--The slipping waterIs instantly opaque and glorious.No longer can we look into itCounting the pebbles,Watching the ribboned water-reeds,Or searching idlyFor that something which we lost(A ring with gems)It is all glamour, now!We turn away, shading our eyes.FriendshipI THOUGHT of friendshipAs a golden ring,Round as the worldYet fitted to my finger;I thought of friendshipAs a path in springWhere there are flowersAnd the footsteps linger;I thought of friendshipAs a globe of light,Yellow before the doorway of my life,A flame diffusedYet potent against night;I thought--but thought itself in ruin liesSince, yesterday, you passed with lowered eyes!The Returned ManTHEY thought that he would come backQuieter,Less boyish,But still a hero with tales to tell.So, when there were no tales,Only blank silences--When he lay for hoursStaring through leafing branchesAnd forgot themUtterly--They tried to arouse him, saying:"The war is over."But when he turned on themHis shadowed eyesThey stammered--Knowing that they lied!Epitaph(For the unknown soldier buried in Westminster Abbey.)YOU who died fightingFor me and my little children;You who are a millionYet are but one,I lay upon your graveA rose and a tear--The tear is the world's sorrow,The rose is your joy.For One Who Went in SpringSHE did not go, as others do,  With backward look and beckoning;  With no farewell for anythingShe passed the open doorway through.The little things she left behind  Lie where they fell from hands content--  Fame a forgotten incidentAnd life a season out of mind.The spring will find her footstep gone,  But spring is kind to vanished things,  Camas and buttercups she bringsWith green that tears have brightened on.And we, who walked with her last year  While April in the lilacs stirred,  Will turn with sudden look or word--Forgetting that she is not here.End of Project Gutenberg's Fires of Driftwood, by Isabel Ecclestone Mackay*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FIRES OF DRIFTWOOD ******** This file should be named 12475.txt or 12475.zip *****This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/2/4/7/12475/Produced by Andrew Sly.

MARBLE                     CHICAGO              BROWNE & HOWELL COMPANY                       1913FRANCIS FISHER BROWNE_1843-1913_The present revision of "The Every-day Life of Abraham Lincoln" was thelast literary labor of its author. He had long wished to undertake thework, and had talked much of it for several years past. But favorablearrangements for the book's republication were not completed until abouta year ago. Then, though by no means recovered from an attack ofpneumonia late in the previous winter, he took up the task of revisionand recasting with something of his old-time energy. It was a farheavier task than he had anticipated, but he gave it practically hisundivided attention until within three or four weeks of his death. Onlywhen the last pages of manuscript had been despatched to the printer didhe yield to the overwhelming physical suffering that had been upon himfor a long time past. His death occurred at Santa Barbara, California,on May 11.Francis Fisher Browne was born at South Halifax, Vermont, on December 1,1843. His parentage, on both sides, was of the purest New England stock.Early in his childhood, the family moved to Western Massachusetts, wherethe boy went to school and learned the printing trade in his father'snewspaper office at Chicopee. As a lad of eighteen, he left the highschool in answer to the government's call for volunteers, serving for ayear with the 46th Massachusetts Regiment in North Carolina and with theArmy of the Potomac. When the regiment was discharged, in 1863, hedecided to take up the study of law. Removing to Rochester, N.Y., heentered a law office in that city; and a year or two later began a briefcourse in the law department of the University of Michigan. He wasunable to continue in college, however, and returned to Rochester tofollow his trade.Immediately after his marriage, in 1867, he came to Chicago, with thedefinite intention of engaging in literary work. Here he becameassociated with "The Western Monthly," which, with the fullerestablishment of his control, he rechristened "The Lakeside Monthly."The best writers throughout the West were gradually enlisted ascontributors; and it was not long before the magazine was generallyrecognized as the most creditable and promising periodical west of theAtlantic seaboard. But along with this increasing prestige came a seriesof extraneous setbacks and calamities, culminating in a completephysical breakdown of its editor and owner, which made the magazine'ssuspension imperative.[Illustration: FRANCIS F. BROWNE]The six years immediately following, from 1874 to 1880, were largelyspent in a search for health. During part of this time, however, Mr.Browne acted as literary editor of "The Alliance," and as specialeditorial writer for some of the leading Chicago newspapers. But hismind was preoccupied with plans for a new periodical--this time ajournal of literary criticism, modeled somewhat after such Englishpublications as "The Athenaeum" and "The Academy." In the furtherance ofthis bold conception he was able to interest the publishing firm ofJansen, McClurg & Co.; and under their imprint, in May, 1880, appearedthe first issue of THE DIAL, "a monthly review and index of currentliterature." At about the same time he became literary adviser to thepublishing department of the house, and for twelve years thereaftertoiled unremittingly at his double task-work. In 1892, negotiations werecompleted whereby he acquired Messrs. McClurg & Co.'s interest in theperiodical. It was enlarged in scope, and made a semi-monthly; and fromthat time until his death it appeared uninterruptedly under his guidanceand his control.Besides his writings in THE DIAL and other periodicals, Mr. Browne isthe author of a small volume of poems, "Volunteer Grain" (1895). He alsocompiled and edited several anthologies,--"Bugle Echoes," a collectionof Civil War poems (1886); "Golden Poems by British and AmericanAuthors" (1881); "The Golden Treasury of Poetry and Prose" (1883); andseven volumes of "Laurel-Crowned Verse" (1891-2). He was one of thesmall group of men who, in 1874, founded the Chicago Literary Club; andfor a number of years past he has been an honorary member of thatorganization, as well as of the Caxton Club (Chicago) and the TwilightClub (Pasadena, Cal.). During the summer of 1893 he served as Chairmanof the Committee on the Congress of Authors of the World's CongressAuxiliary of the Columbian Exposition.THE PUBLISHERSPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITIONThe original edition of this book was published about twenty years afterLincoln's death at the close of the Civil War. At that time many of themen who had taken a prominent part in the affairs, military and civil,of that heroic period, many who had known Lincoln and had come inpersonal contact with him during the war or in his earlier years, werestill living. It was a vivid conception of the value of the personalrecollections of these men, gathered and recorded before it was toolate, that led to the preparation of this book. It was intended to be,and in effect it was, largely an anecdotal Life of Lincoln built ofmaterial gathered from men still living who had known him personally.The task was begun none too soon. Of the hundreds who responded to therequests for contributions of their memories of Lincoln there were fewwhose lives extended very far into the second quarter-century after hisdeath, and few indeed survive after the lapse of nearly fiftyyears,--though in several instances the author has been so fortunate asto get valuable material directly from persons still living (1913). Ofthe more than five hundred friends and contemporaries of Lincoln to whomcredit for material is given in the original edition, scarcely a dozenare living at the date of this second edition. Therefore, the value ofthese reminiscences increases with time. They were gathered largely atfirst hand. They can never be replaced, nor can they ever be very muchextended.This book brings Lincoln the man, not Lincoln the tradition, very nearto us. Browning asked, "And did you once see Shelley plain? And did hestop and speak to you?" The men whose narratives make up a large part ofthis book all saw Lincoln plain, and here tell us what he spoke to them,and how he looked and seemed while saying it. The great events ofLincoln's life, and impressions of his character, are given in theactual words of those who knew him--his friends, neighbors, and dailyassociates--rather than condensed and remolded into other form. Whilethese utterances are in some cases rude and unstudied, they have often apower of delineation and a graphic force that more than compensate forany lack of literary quality.In a work prepared on such a plan as this, some repetitions areunavoidable; nor are they undesirable. An event or incident narrated bydifferent observers is thereby brought out with greater fulness ofdetail; and phases of Lincoln's many-sided character are revealed moreclearly by the varied impressions of numerous witnesses whose accountsthus correct or verify each other. Some inconsistencies andcontradictions are inevitable,--but these relate usually to minormatters, seldom or never to the great essentials of Lincoln's life andpersonality. The author's desire is to present material from which thereader may form an opinion of Lincoln, rather than to present opinionsand judgments of his own.Lincoln literature has increased amazingly in the past twenty-fiveyears. Mention of the principal biographies in existence at the time ofthe original edition was included in the Preface. Since then there haveappeared, among the more formal biographies, the comprehensive andauthoritative work by Nicolay and Hay, the subsequent work by Miss IdaTarbell, and that by Herndon and Weik, besides many more or lessfragmentary publications. Some additions, but not many, have been madeto the present edition from these sources. The recently-published Diaryof Gideon Welles, one of the most valuable commentaries on the Civil Warperiod now available, has provided some material of exceptional interestconcerning Lincoln's relations with the members of his Cabinet.In re-writing the present work, it has been compressed into abouttwo-thirds of its former compass, to render it more popular both in formand in price, and to give it in some places a greater measure ofcoherency and continuity as an outline narrative of the Civil War. Butits chief appeal to the interest of its readers will remainsubstantially what it was in the beginning, as set forth in its title,"The Every-day Life of Abraham Lincoln, by Those Who Knew Him."F.F.B.SANTA BARBARA, CAL., _April, 1913._PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITIONThis book aims to give a view, clearer and more complete than has beengiven before, of the personality of Abraham Lincoln. A life so full ofincident and a character so many-sided as his can be understood onlywith the lapse of time. A sense of the exhaustless interest of that lifeand character, and the inadequacy of the ordinarily constructedbiography to portray his many-sidedness, suggested the preparation of awork upon the novel plan here represented. Begun several years ago, theundertaking proved of such magnitude that its completion has beendelayed beyond the anticipated time. The extensive correspondence, theexploration of available sources of information in the books, pamphlets,magazines, and newspapers of a quarter of a century, and in the scrapsand papers of historical collections, became an almost interminabletask. The examination and sifting of this mass of material, itsverification amidst often conflicting testimony, and its final moldinginto shape, involved time and labor that can be estimated only by thosewho have had similar experience.To the many who have kindly furnished original contributions, to otherswho have aided the work by valuable suggestions and information, toearlier biographies of Lincoln--those of Raymond, Holland, Barrett,Lamon, Carpenter, and (the best and latest of all) that of Hon. I.N.Arnold--hearty acknowledgment is made. Much that was offered could notbe used. In the choice of material, from whatever source, the purposehas been to avoid mere opinions and eulogies of Lincoln and to giveabundantly those actual experiences, incidents, anecdotes, andreminiscences which reveal the phases of his unique and strikingpersonality.It scarcely need be pointed out that this work does not attempt to givea connected history of the Civil War, but only to sketch briefly thoseepisodes with which Lincoln is personally identified and of which someknowledge is essential to an understanding of his acts and character.Others are brought into prominence only as they are associated with thechief actor in the great drama. Many of them are disappearing,--fadinginto the smoky and lurid background. But that colossal central figure,playing one of the grandest roles ever set upon the stage of human life,becomes more impressive as the scenes recede.F.F.B.CHICAGO, _October, 1886._CONTENTSCHAPTER I

Gladstone to England--wasin our country the birth-year of him who wears the most distinguishedname that has yet been written on the pages of American history--ABRAHAMLINCOLN. In a rude cabin in a clearing, in the wilds of that sectionwhich was once the hunting-ground and later the battle-field of theCherokees and other war-like tribes, and which the Indians themselveshad named Kentucky because it was "dark and bloody ground," the greatWar President of the United States, after whose name History has writtenthe word "Emancipator," first saw the light. Born and nurtured inpenury, inured to hardship, coarse food, and scanty clothing,--the storyof his youth is full of pathos. Small wonder that when asked in hislater years to tell something of his early life, he replied by quoting aline from Gray's Elegy:     "The short and simple annals of the poor."Lincoln's ancestry has been traced with tolerable certainty through fivegenerations to Samuel Lincoln of Norfolk County, England. Not manyyears after the landing of the "Mayflower" at Plymouth--perhaps in theyear 1638--Samuel Lincoln's son Mordecai had emigrated to Hingham,Massachusetts. Perhaps because he was a Quaker, a then persecuted sect,he did not remain long at Hingham, but came westward as far as BerksCounty, Pennsylvania. His son, John Lincoln, went southward fromPennsylvania and settled in Rockingham County, Virginia. Later, in 1782,while the last events of the American Revolution were in progress,Abraham Lincoln, son of John and grandfather of President Lincoln, movedinto Kentucky and took up a tract of government land in Mercer County.In the Field Book of Daniel Boone, the Kentucky pioneer, (now inpossession of the Wisconsin Historical Society), appears the followingnote of purchase:     "Abraham Lincoln enters five hundred acres of land on a Treasury     warrant on the south side of Licking Creek or River, in Kentucky."At this time Kentucky was included within the limits and jurisdiction ofVirginia. In 1775 Daniel Boone had built a fort at Boonesborough, on theKentucky river, and it was not far from this site that Abraham Lincoln,President Lincoln's grandfather, located his claim and put up a rude loghut for the shelter of his family. The pioneers of Kentucky clearedsmall spaces and erected their humble dwellings. They had to contend notonly with the wild forces of nature, and to defend themselves from thebeasts of the forest,--more to be feared than either were the hostileIndians. The settlers were filled with terror of these stealthy foes. Athome and abroad they kept their guns ready for instant use both nightand day. Many a hard battle was fought between the Indian and thepioneer. Many an unguarded woodsman was shot down without warning whilebusy about his necessary work. Among these was Abraham Lincoln. Thestory of his death is related by Mr. I.N. Arnold. "Thomas Lincoln waswith his father in the field when the savages suddenly fell upon them.Mordecai and Josiah, his elder brothers, were near by in the forest.Mordecai, startled by a shot, saw his father fall, and running to thecabin seized the loaded rifle, rushed to one of the loop-holes cutthrough the logs of the cabin, and saw the Indian who had fired. He hadjust caught the boy, Thomas, and was running toward the forest. Pointingthe rifle through the logs and aiming at a medal on the breast of theIndian, Mordecai fired. The Indian fell, and springing to his feet theboy ran to the open arms of his mother at the cabin door. MeanwhileJosiah, who had run to the fort for aid, returned with a party ofsettlers. The bodies of Abraham Lincoln and the Indian who had beenkilled were brought in. From this time forth Mordecai Lincoln was themortal enemy of the Indian, and it is said that he sacrificed many inrevenge for the murder of his father."In the presence of such dangers Thomas Lincoln spent his boyhood. He wasborn in 1778, and could not have been much more than four years old onthat fatal day when in one swift moment his father lay dead beside himand vengeance had been exacted by his resolute boy brother. It was suchexperiences as these that made of the pioneers the sturdy men they were.They acquired habits of heroism. Their sinews became wiry; their nervesturned to steel. Their senses became sharpened. They grew alert, steady,prompt and deft in every emergency.Of Mordecai Lincoln, the boy who had exhibited such coolness and daringon the day of his father's death, many stories are told after he reachedmanhood. "He was naturally a man of considerable genius," says one whoknew him. "He was a man of great drollery. It would almost make youlaugh to look at him. I never saw but one other man who excited in methe same disposition to laugh, and that was Artemus Ward. Abe Lincolnhad a very high opinion of his uncle, and on one occasion remarked thatUncle Mord had run off with all the talents of the family."Thomas Lincoln was twenty-eight years old before he sought a wife. Hischoice fell upon a young woman of twenty-three whose name was NancyHanks. Like her husband, she was of English descent. Like his, herparents had followed in the path of emigration from Virginia toKentucky. The couple were married by the Rev. Jesse Head, a Methodistminister located at Springfield, Washington County, Kentucky. They livedfor a time in Elizabethtown, but after the birth of their first child,Sarah, they removed to Rock Spring farm, on Nolin Creek, in Hardin(afterward LaRue) County. In this desolate spot, a strange and unlikelyplace for the birth of one destined to play so memorable a part in thehistory of the world, on the twelfth day of February, 1809, AbrahamLincoln the President was born.Of all the gross injustice ever done to the memory of woman, that whichhas been accorded to Nancy Hanks is the greatest. The story which cast ashadow upon her parentage, and on that of her illustrious son as well,should be sternly relegated to the oblivion whence it came. Mr. HenryWatterson, in his brilliant address on Lincoln, refers to him as "thatstrange, incomparable man, _of whose parentage we neither know norcare_." In some localities, particularly in Kentucky and South Carolina,the rumor is definite and persistent that the President was not the sonof Thomas Lincoln, the illiterate and thriftless, but of one ColonelHardin for whom Hardin County was named; that Nancy Hanks was herselfthe victim of unlegalized motherhood, the natural daughter of anaristocratic, wealthy, and well-educated Virginia planter, and that thisaccounted for many of her son's characteristics. The story has longsince been disproved. Efforts to verify it brought forth the fact thatit sprang into being in the early days of the Civil War and wasevidently a fabrication born of the bitter spirit of the hour.It was not from his father, however, that Lincoln inherited any of hisremarkable traits. The dark coarse hair, the gray eyes, sallowcomplexion, and brawny strength, which were his, constituted his soleinheritance on the paternal side. But Nancy Hanks was gentle andrefined, and would have adorned any station in life. She was beautifulin youth, with dark hair, regular features, and soft sparkling hazeleyes. She was unusually intelligent, and read all the books she couldobtain. Says Mr. Arnold: "She was a woman of deep religious feeling, ofthe most exemplary character, and most tenderly and affectionatelydevoted to her family. Her home indicated a love of beauty exceptionalin the wild settlement in which she lived, and judging from her earlydeath it is probable that she was of a physique less hardy than that ofthose among whom she lived. Hers was a strong, self-reliant spirit,which commanded the love and respect of the rugged people among whom shedwelt."The tender and reverent spirit of Abraham Lincoln, and the pensivemelancholy of his disposition, he no doubt inherited from his mother.Amid the toil and struggle of her busy life she found time not only toteach him to read and write but to impress upon him ineffaceably thatlove of truth and justice, that perfect integrity and reverence for God,for which he was noted all his life. Lincoln always looked upon hismother with unspeakable affection, and never ceased to cherish thememory of her life and teaching.A spirit of restlessness, a love of adventure, a longing for new scenes,and possibly the hope of improving his condition, led Thomas Lincoln toabandon the Rock Spring farm, in the fall of 1816, and begin life overagain in the wilds of southern Indiana. The way thither lay throughunbroken country and was beset with difficulties. Often the travellerswere obliged to cut their road as they went. With the resolution ofpioneers, however, they began the journey. At the end of several daysthey had gone but eighteen miles. Abraham Lincoln was then but sevenyears old, but was already accustomed to the use of axe and gun. He lenta willing hand, and bore his share in the labor and fatigue connectedwith the difficult journey. In after years he said that he had neverpassed through a more trying experience than when he went fromThompson's Ferry to Spencer County, Indiana. On arriving, a shanty forimmediate use was hastily erected. Three sides were enclosed, the fourthremaining open. This served as a home for several months, when a morecomfortable cabin was built. On the eighteenth of October, 1817, ThomasLincoln entered a quarter-section of government land eighteen milesnorth of the Ohio river and about a mile and a half from the presentvillage of Gentryville. About a year later they were followed by thefamily of Thomas and Betsy Sparrow, relatives of Mrs. Lincoln andold-time neighbors on the Rock Spring farm in Kentucky. Dennis Hanks, amember of the Sparrow household and cousin of Abraham Lincoln, camealso. He has furnished some recollections of the President's boyhoodwhich are well worth recording. "Uncle Dennis," as he was familiarlycalled, was himself a striking character, a man of original manners andracy conversation. A sketch of him as he appeared to an observer in hislater days is thus given: "Uncle Dennis is a typical Kentuckian, born inHardin County in 1799. His face is sun-bronzed and ploughed with thefurrows of time, but he has a resolute mouth, a firm grip of the jaws,and a broad forehead above a pair of piercing eyes. The eyes seem out ofplace in the weary, faded face, but they glow and flash like two diamondsparks set in ridges of dull gold. The face is a serious one, but theplay of light in the eyes, unquenchable by time, betrays a nature ofsunshine and elate with life. A glance at the profile shows a facestrikingly Lincoln-like,--prominent cheek bones, temple, nose, and chin;but best of all is that twinkling drollery in the eye that flashed inthe White House during the dark days of the Civil War."Uncle Dennis's recollections go back to the birth of Abraham Lincoln. Touse his own words: "I rikkilect I run all the way, over two miles, tosee Nancy Hanks's boy baby. Her name was Nancy Hanks before she marriedThomas Lincoln. 'Twas common for connections to gather in them days tosee new babies. I held the wee one a minute. I was ten years old, and ittickled me to hold the pulpy, red little Lincoln. The family moved toIndiana," he went on, "when Abe was about nine. Mr. Lincoln moved first,and built a camp of brush in Spencer County. We came a year later, andhe had then a cabin. So he gave us the shanty. Abe killed a turkey theday we got there, and couldn't get through tellin' about it. The namewas pronounced Linkhorn by the folks then. We was all uneducated. Aftera spell we learnt better. I was the only boy in the place all themyears, and Abe and me was always together."Dennis Hanks claims to have taught his young cousin to read, write, andcipher. "He knew his letters pretty wellish, but no more. His mother hadtaught him. If ever there was a good woman on earth, she was one,--atrue Christian of the Baptist church. But she died soon after wearrived, and Abe was left without a teacher. His father couldn't read aword. The boy had only about one quarter of schooling, hardly that. Ithen set in to help him. I didn't know much, but I did the best I could.Sometimes he would write with a piece of charcoal or the p'int of aburnt stick on the fence or floor. We got a little paper at the countrytown, and I made some ink out of blackberry briar-root and a littlecopperas in it. It was black, but the copperas ate the paper after awhile. I made Abe's first pen out of a turkey-buzzard feather. We had nogeese them days. After he learned to write his name he was scrawlin' iteverywhere. Sometimes he would write it in the white sand down by thecrick bank and leave it there till the waves would blot it out. Hedidn't take to books in the beginnin'. We had to hire him at first, butafter he got a taste on't it was the old story--we had to pull the sow'sears to get her to the trough, and then pull her tail to get her away.He read a great deal, and had a wonderful memory--wonderful. Neverforgot anything."Lincoln's first reading book was Webster's Speller. "When I got himthrough that," said Uncle Dennis, "I had only a copy of the IndianaStatutes. Then Abe got hold of a book. I can't rikkilect the name. Ittold a yarn about a feller, a nigger or suthin', that sailed a flatboatup to a rock, and the rock was magnetized and drawed all the nails out,and he got a duckin' or drowned or suthin',--I forget now. [It was the"Arabian Nights."] Abe would lay on the floor with a chair under hishead and laugh over them stories by the hour. I told him they was likelylies from beginnin' to end, but he learned to read right well in them. Iborrowed for him the Life of Washington and the Speeches of Henry Clay.They had a powerful influence on him. He told me afterwards in the WhiteHouse he wanted to live like Washington. His speeches show it, too. Butthe other book did the most amazin' work. Abe was a Democrat, like hisfather and all of us, when he began to read it. When he closed it he wasa Whig, heart and soul, and he went on step by step till he becameleader of the Republicans."These reminiscences of Dennis Hanks give the clearest and undoubtedlythe most accurate glimpse of Lincoln's youth. He says further, referringto the boy's unusual physical strength: "My, how he would chop! His axewould flash and bite into a sugar-tree or sycamore, and down it wouldcome. If you heard him fellin' trees in a clearin' you would say therewas three men at work, the way the trees fell. Abe was never sassy orquarrelsome. I've seen him walk into a crowd of sawin' rowdies and tellsome droll yarn and bust them all up. It was the same after he got to bea lawyer. All eyes was on him whenever he riz. There was _suthin'peculiarsome_ about him. I moved from Indiana to Illinois when Abe did.I bought a little improvement near him, six miles from Decatur. Here thefamous rails were split that were carried round in the campaign. Theywere called _his_ rails, but you never can tell. I split some of 'em. Hewas a master hand at maulin' rails. I heard him say in a speech once,'If I didn't make these I made many just as good.' Then the crowdyelled."One of his playmates has furnished much that is of interest in regard tothe reputation which Lincoln left behind him in the neighborhood wherehe passed his boyhood and much of his youth. This witness says:"Whenever the court was in session he was a frequent attendant. John A.Breckenridge was the foremost lawyer in the community, and was famed asan advocate in criminal cases. Lincoln was sure to be present when hespoke. Doing the chores in the morning, he would walk to Booneville, thecounty seat of Warwick County, seventeen miles away, then home in timeto do the chores at night, repeating this day after day. The lawyer sooncame to know him. Years afterwards, when Lincoln was President, avenerable gentleman one day entered his office in the White House, andstanding before him said: 'Mr. President, you don't know me.' Mr.Lincoln eyed him sharply for a moment, and then quickly replied with asmile, 'Yes I do. You are John A. Breckenridge. I used to walkthirty-four miles a day to hear you plead law in Booneville, andlistening to your speeches at the bar first inspired me with thedetermination to be a lawyer.'"Lincoln's love for his gentle mother, and his grief over her untimelydeath, is a touching story. Attacked by a fatal disease, the life ofNancy Hanks wasted slowly away. Day after day her son sat by her bedreading to her such portions of the Bible as she desired to hear. Atintervals she talked to him, urging him to walk in the paths of honor,goodness, and truth. At last she found rest, and her son gave way togrief that could not be controlled. In an opening in the timber, a shortdistance from the cabin, sympathizing friends and neighbors laid herbody away and offered sincere prayers above her grave. The simpleservice did not seem to the son adequate tribute to the memory of thebeloved mother whose loss he so sorely felt, but no minister could beprocured at the time to preach a funeral sermon. In the spring, however,Abraham Lincoln, then a lad of ten, wrote to Elder Elkin, who had livednear them in Kentucky, begging that he would come and preach a sermonabove his mother's grave, and adding that by granting this request hewould confer a lasting favor upon his father, his sister, and himself.Although it involved a journey of more than a hundred miles onhorseback, the good man cheerfully complied. Once more the neighbors andfriends gathered about the grave of Nancy Hanks, and her son foundcomfort in their sympathy and their presence. The spot where Lincoln'smother lies is now enclosed within a high iron fence. At the head of thegrave a white stone, simple, unaffected, and in keeping with thesurroundings, has been placed. It bears the following inscription:    NANCY HANKS LINCOLN,    MOTHER OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN,    DIED OCTOBER 5, A.D. 1818.    AGED THIRTY-FIVE YEARS.    _Erected by a friend of her martyred son_.Lincoln always held the memory of his mother in the deepest reverenceand affection. Says Dr. J.G. Holland: "Long after her sensitive heartand weary hands had crumbled into dust, and had climbed to life again inforest flowers, he said to a friend, with tears in his eyes, 'All that Iam or ever hope to be I owe to my sainted mother.'"The vacant place of wife and mother was sadly felt in the Lincoln cabin,but before the year 1819 had closed it was filled by a woman who noblyperformed the duties of her trying position. Thomas Lincoln had knownMrs. Sarah Johnston when both were young and living in Elizabethtown,Kentucky. They had married in the same year; and now, being alikebereaved, he persuaded her to unite their broken households into one.By this union, a son and two daughters, John, Sarah, and Matilda, wereadded to the Lincoln family. All dwelt together in perfect harmony, themother showing no difference in the treatment of her own children andthe two now committed to her charge. She exhibited a special fondnessfor the little Abraham, whose precocious talents and enduring qualitiesshe was quick to apprehend. Though he never forgot the "angel mother"sleeping on the forest-covered hill-top, the boy rewarded with aprofound and lasting affection the devoted care of her who proved afaithful friend and helper during the rest of his childhood and youth.In her later life the step-mother spoke of him always with the tenderestfeeling. On one occasion she said: "He never gave me a cross word orlook, and never refused, in fact or appearance, to do anything Irequested of him."The child had enjoyed a little irregular schooling while living inKentucky, getting what instruction was possible of one Zachariah Birney,a Catholic, who taught for a time close by his father's house. He alsoattended, as convenience permitted, a school kept by Caleb Hazel, nearlyfour miles away, walking the distance back and forth with his sister.Soon after coming under the care of his step-mother, the lad wasafforded some similar opportunities for learning. His first master inIndiana was Azel Dorsey. The sort of education dispensed by him, and thecircumstances under which it was given, are described by Mr. Ward H.Lamon, at one time Lincoln's law-partner at Springfield, Illinois. "AzelDorsey presided in a small house near the Little Pigeon Creekmeeting-house, a mile and a half from the Lincoln cabin. It was built ofunhewn logs, and had holes for windows, in which greased paper servedfor glass. The roof was just high enough for a man to stand erect. Herethe boy was taught reading, writing, and ciphering. They spelt inclasses, and 'trapped' up and down. These juvenile contests were veryexciting to the participants, and it is said by the survivors that Abewas even then the equal, if not the superior, of any scholar in hisclass. The next teacher was Andrew Crawford. Mrs. Gentry says he beganteaching in the neighborhood in the winter of 1822-3. Crawford 'keptschool' in the same little school-house which had been the scene ofDorsey's labors, and the windows were still adorned with the greasedleaves of old copybooks that had come down from Dorsey's time. Abe wasnow in his fifteenth year, and began to exhibit symptoms of gallantrytoward the other sex. He was growing at a tremendous rate, and two yearslater attained his full height of six feet and four inches. He wore lowshoes, buckskin breeches, linsey-woolsey shirt, and a cap made of theskin of a 'possum or a coon. The breeches clung close to his thighs andlegs, and failed by a large space to meet the tops of his shoes. Hewould always come to school thus, good-humoredly and laughing. He wasalways in good health, never sick, had an excellent constitution andtook care of it."Crawford taught "manners"--a feature of backwoods education to whichDorsey had not aspired. Crawford had doubtless introduced it as arefinement which would put to shame the humble efforts of hispredecessor. One of the scholars was required to retire, and then tore-enter the room as a polite gentleman is supposed to enter adrawing-room. He was received at the door by another scholar andconducted from bench to bench until he had been introduced to all theyoung ladies and gentlemen in the room. Lincoln went through the ordealcountless times. If he took a serious view of the performance it musthave put him to exquisite torture, for he was conscious that he was nota perfect type of manly beauty. If, however, it struck him as at allfunny, it must have filled him with unspeakable mirth to be thus gravelyled about, angular and gawky, under the eyes of the precise Crawford, tobe introduced to the boys and girls of his acquaintance.While in Crawford's school the lad wrote his first compositions. Theexercise was not required by the teacher, but, as Nat Grigsby has said,"he took it up on his own account." At first he wrote only shortsentences against cruelty to animals, but at last came forward with aregular composition on the subject. He was annoyed and pained by theconduct of the boys who were in the habit of catching terrapins andputting coals of fire on their backs. "He would chide us," says Grigsby,"tell us it was wrong, and would write against it."One who has had the privilege of looking over some of the boyishpossessions of Lincoln says: "Among the most touching relics which I sawwas an old copy-book in which, at the age of fourteen, Lincoln hadtaught himself to write and cipher. Scratched in his boyish hand on thefirst page were these lines:    _Abraham Lincoln    his hand and pen.    he will be good but    god knows When_"The boy's thirst for learning was not to be satisfied with the meagreknowledge furnished in the miserable schools he was able to attend atlong intervals. His step-mother says: "He read diligently. He readeverything he could lay his hands on, and when he came across a passagethat struck him he would write it down on boards, if he had no paper,and keep it until he had got paper. Then he would copy it, look at it,commit it to memory, and repeat it. He kept a scrap-book into which hecopied everything which particularly pleased him." Mr. Arnold furtherstates: "There were no libraries and but few books in the backsettlements in which Lincoln lived. If by chance he heard of a book thathe had not read he would walk miles to borrow it. Among other volumesborrowed from Crawford was Weems's Life of Washington. He read it withgreat earnestness. He took it to bed with him in the loft and read tillhis 'nubbin' of candle burned out. Then he placed the book between thelogs of the cabin, that it might be near as soon as it was light enoughin the morning to read. In the night a heavy rain came up and he awoketo find his book wet through and through. Drying it as well as he could,he went to Crawford and told him of the mishap. As he had no money topay for the injured book, he offered to work out the value of it.Crawford fixed the price at three days' work, and the future Presidentpulled corn for three days, thus becoming owner of the coveted volume."In addition to this, he was fortunate enough to get hold of AEsop'sFables, Pilgrim's Progress, and the lives of Benjamin Franklin and HenryClay. He made these books his own by conning them over and over, copyingthe more impressive portions until they were firmly fixed in his memory.Commenting upon the value of this sort of mental training, Dr. Hollandwisely remarks: "Those who have witnessed the dissipating effect of manybooks upon the minds of modern children do not find it hard to believethat Abraham Lincoln's poverty of books was the wealth of his life. Thefew he had did much to perfect the teaching which his mother had begun,and to form a character which for quaint simplicity, earnestness,truthfulness, and purity, has never been surpassed among the historicpersonages of the world."It may well have been that Lincoln's lack of books and the means oflearning threw him upon his own resources and led him into those modesof thought, of quaint and apt  and logical reasoning, sopeculiar to him. At any rate, it is certain that books can no more makea character like Lincoln than they can make a poet like Shakespeare.    "By books may Learning sometimes befall,    But Wisdom never by books at all,"--a saying peculiarly true of a man such as Lincoln.A testimonial to the influence of this early reading upon his childishmind was given by Lincoln himself many years afterwards. While on hisway to Washington to assume the duties of the Presidency he passedthrough Trenton, New Jersey, and in a speech made in the Senate Chamberat that place he said: "May I be pardoned if, upon this occasion, Imention that away back in my childhood, in the earliest days of my beingable to read, I got hold of a small book--such a one as few of theyounger members have seen, Weems's Life of Washington. I remember allthe accounts there given of the battle-fields and struggles for theliberties of the country; and none fixed themselves upon my imaginationso deeply as the struggle here at Trenton. The crossing of the river,the contest with the Hessians, the great hardships endured at that time,all fixed themselves in my memory more than any single Revolutionaryevent; and you all know, for you have all been boys, how these earlyimpressions last longer than any others. I recollect thinking then, boyeven though I was, that there must have been something more than commonthat these men struggled for. I am exceedingly anxious that that thingwhich they struggled for, that something even more than NationalIndependence, that something that held out a great promise to all thepeople of the world for all time to come, I am exceedingly anxious thatthis Union, the Constitution, and the liberties of the people, shall beperpetuated in accordance with the original idea for which that strugglewas made."Another incident in regard to the ruined volume which Lincoln hadborrowed from Crawford is related by Mr. Lamon. "For a long time," hesays, "there was one person in the neighborhood for whom Lincoln felt adecided dislike, and that was Josiah Crawford, who had made him pullfodder for three days to pay for Weems's Washington. On that score hewas hurt and mad, and declared he would have revenge. But being a poorboy, a fact of which Crawford had already taken shameful advantage whenhe extorted three days' labor, Abe was glad to get work anywhere, andfrequently hired out to his old adversary. His first business inCrawford's employ was daubing the cabin, which was built of unhewn logswith the bark on. In the loft of this house, thus finished by his ownhands, he slept for many weeks at a time. He spent his evenings as hedid at home,--writing on wooden shovels or boards with 'a coal, or keel,from the branch.' This family was rich in the possession of severalbooks, which Abe read through time and again, according to his usualcustom. One of the books was the 'Kentucky Preceptor,' from which Mrs.Crawford insists that he 'learned his school orations, speeches, andpieces to write.' She tells us also that 'Abe was a sensitive lad, nevercoming where he was not wanted'; that he always lifted his hat, andbowed, when he made his appearance; and that 'he was tender and kind,'like his sister, who was at the same time her maid-of-all-work. His paywas twenty-five cents a day; 'and when he missed time, he would notcharge for it.' This latter remark of Mrs. Crawford reveals the factthat her husband was in the habit of docking Abe on his miserable wageswhenever he happened to lose a few minutes from steady work. The timecame, however, when Lincoln got his revenge for all this pettybrutality. Crawford was as ugly as he was surly. His nose was amonstrosity--long and crooked, with a huge mis-shapen stub at the end,surmounted by a host of pimples, and the whole as blue as the usualstate of Mr. Crawford's spirits. Upon this member Abe levelled hisattacks, in rhyme, song, and chronicle; and though he could not reducethe nose he gave it a fame as wide as to the Wabash and the Ohio. It isnot improbable that he learned the art of making the doggerel rhymes inwhich he celebrated Crawford's nose from the study of Crawford's own'Kentucky Preceptor.'"Lincoln's sister Sarah was warmly attached to him, but was taken fromhis companionship at an early age. It is said that her face somewhatresembled his, that in repose it had the gravity which they bothinherited from their mother, but it was capable of being lighted almostinto beauty by one of her brother's ridiculous stories or sallies ofhumor. She was a modest, plain, industrious girl, and was rememberedkindly by all who knew her. She was married to Aaron Grigsby ateighteen, and died a year later. Like her brother, she occasionallyworked at the houses of the neighbors. She lies buried, not with hermother, but in the yard of the old Pigeon Creek meeting-house.A story which belongs to this period was told by Lincoln himself to Mr.Seward and a few friends one evening in the Executive Mansion atWashington. The President said: "Seward, you never heard, did you, how Iearned my first dollar?" "No," rejoined Mr. Seward. "Well," continuedMr. Lincoln, "I belonged, you know, to what they call down South the'scrubs.' We had succeeded in raising, chiefly by my labor, sufficientproduce, as I thought, to justify me in taking it down the river tosell. After much persuasion, I got the consent of mother to go, andconstructed a little flatboat, large enough to take a barrel or two ofthings that we had gathered, with myself and the bundle, down to theSouthern market. A steamer was coming down the river. We have, you know,no wharves on the Western streams; and the custom was, if passengerswere at any of the landings, for them to go out in a boat, the steamerstopping and taking them on board. I was contemplating my new flatboat,and wondering whether I could make it stronger or improve it in any way,when two men came down to the shore in carriages with trunks. Looking atthe different boats, they singled out mine and asked, 'Who owns this?' Ianswered somewhat modestly, 'I do.' 'Will you take us and our trunks tothe steamer?' asked one of them. 'Certainly,' said I. I was glad to havethe chance of earning something. I supposed that each of them would giveme two or three bits. The trunks were put on my flatboat, the passengersseated themselves on the trunks, and I sculled them out to the steamer.They got on board, and I lifted up their heavy trunks and put them onthe deck. The steamer was about to put on steam again, when I called outto them that they had forgotten to pay me. Each man took from his pocketa silver half-dollar and threw it into the bottom of my boat. I couldscarcely believe my eyes. Gentlemen, you may think it a little thing,and in these days it seems to me a trifle; but it was a great event inmy life. I could scarcely credit that I, a poor boy, had earned a dollarin less than a day,--that by honest work I had earned a dollar. Theworld seemed wider and fairer to me. I was a more hopeful and confidentbeing from that time."Notwithstanding the limitations of every kind which hemmed in the lifeof young Lincoln, he had an instinctive feeling, born perhaps of hiseager ambition, that he should one day attain an exalted position. Thefirst betrayal of this premonition is thus related by Mr. Arnold:"Lincoln attended court at Booneville, to witness a murder trial, atwhich one of the Breckenridges from Kentucky made a very eloquent speechfor the defense. The boy was carried away with admiration, and was soenthusiastic that, although a perfect stranger, he could not resistexpressing his admiration to Breckenridge. He wanted to be a lawyer. Hewent home, dreamed of courts, and got up mock trials, at which he woulddefend imaginary prisoners. Several of his companions at this period ofhis life, as well as those who knew him after he went to Illinois,declare that he was often heard to say, not in joke, but seriously, asif he were deeply impressed rather than elated with the idea: 'I shallsome day be President of the United States.' It is stated by many ofLincoln's old friends that he often said while still an obscure man,'Some day I shall be President.' He undoubtedly had for years somepresentiment of this."At seventeen Lincoln wrote a clear, neat, legible hand, was quick atfigures and able to solve easily any arithmetical problem not goingbeyond the "Rule of Three." Mr. Arnold, noting these facts, says: "Ihave in my possession a few pages from his manuscript 'Book of Examplesin Arithmetic' One of these is dated March 1, 1826, and headed'Discount,' and then follows, in his careful handwriting: 'A definitionof Discount,' 'Rules for its computation,' 'Proofs and VariousExamples,' worked out in figures, etc.; then 'Interest on money' istreated in the same way, all in his own handwriting. I doubt whether itwould be easy to find among scholars of our common or high schools, orany school of boys of the age of seventeen, a better written specimen ofthis sort of work, or a better knowledge of figures than is indicated bythis book of Lincoln's, written at the age of seventeen."In March, 1828, Lincoln went to work for old Mr. Gentry, the founder ofGentryville. "Early the next month the old gentleman furnished his sonAllen with a boat and a cargo of bacon and other produce with which hewas to go to New Orleans unless the stock should be sooner disposed of.Abe, having been found faithful and efficient, was employed to accompanythe young man. He was paid eight dollars per month, and ate and slept onboard." The entire business of the trip was placed in Abraham's hands.The fact tells its own story touching the young man's reputation forcapacity and integrity. He had never made the trip, knew nothing of thejourney, was unaccustomed to business transactions, had never been muchupon the river, but his tact and ability and honesty were so far trustedthat the trader was willing to risk the cargo in his care. The delightwith which the youth swung loose from the shore upon his clumsy craft,with the prospect of a ride of eighteen hundred miles before him, and avision of the great world of which he had read and thought so much, maybe imagined. At this time he had become a very tall and powerful youngman. He had reached the height of six feet and four inches, a length oftrunk and limb remarkable even among the tall race of pioneers to whichhe belonged.Just before the river expedition, Lincoln had walked with a young girldown to the river to show her his flatboat. She relates a circumstanceof the evening which is full of significance. "We were sitting on thebanks of the Ohio, or rather on the boat he had made. I said to Abe thatthe sun was going down. He said to me, 'That's not so; it don't reallygo down; it seems so. The earth turns from west to east and therevolution of the earth carries us under; we do the sinking, as you callit. The sun, as to us, is comparatively still; the sun's sinking is onlyan appearance.' I replied, 'Abe, what a fool you are!' I know now that Iwas the fool, not Lincoln. I am now thoroughly satisfied that he knewthe general laws of astronomy and the movements of the heavenly bodies.He was better read then than the world knows or is likely to knowexactly. No man could talk to me as he did that night unless he hadknown something of geography as well as astronomy. He often commented ortalked to me about what he had read,--seemed to read it out of the bookas he went along. He was the learned boy among us unlearned folks. Hetook great pains to explain; could do it so simply. He was diffident,too."But another change was about to come into the life of Abraham Lincoln.In 1830 his father set forth once more on the trail of the emigrant. Hehad become dissatisfied with his location in southern Indiana, andhearing favorable reports of the prairie lands of Illinois hoped forbetter fortunes there. He parted with his farm and prepared for thejourney to Macon County, Illinois. Abraham visited the neighbors andbade them goodbye; but on the morning selected for their departure, whenit came time to start, he was missing. He was found weeping at hismother's grave, whither he had gone as soon as it was light. The thoughtof leaving her behind filled him with unspeakable anguish. The householdgoods were loaded, the oxen yoked, the family got into the coveredwagon, and Lincoln took his place by the oxen to drive. One of theneighbors has said of this incident: "Well do I remember the day theLincolns left for Illinois. Little did I think that I was looking at aboy who would one day be President of the United States!"An interesting personal sketch of Thomas Lincoln is given by Mr. GeorgeB. Balch, who was for many years a resident of Lerna, Coles County,Illinois. Among other things he says: "Thomas Lincoln, father of thegreat President, was called Uncle Tommy by his friends and Old TomLincoln by other people. His property consisted of an old horse, a pairof oxen and a few sheep--seven or eight head. My father bought two ofthe sheep, they being the first we owned after settling in Illinois.Thomas Lincoln was a large, bulky man, six feet tall and weighing abouttwo hundred pounds. He was large-boned, coarse-featured, had a largeblunt nose, florid complexion, light sandy hair and whiskers. He wasslow in speech and slow in gait. His whole appearance denoted a man ofsmall intellect and less ambition. It is generally supposed that he wasa farmer; and such he was, if one who tilled so little land by suchprimitive modes could be so called. He never planted more than a fewacres, and instead of gathering and hauling his crop in a wagon heusually carried it in baskets or large trays. He was uneducated,illiterate, content with living from hand to mouth. His death occurredon the fifteenth day of January, 1851. He was buried in a neighboringcountry graveyard, about a mile north of Janesville, Coles County. Therewas nothing to mark the place of his burial until February, 1861, whenAbraham Lincoln paid a last visit to his grave just before he leftSpringfield for Washington. On a piece of oak board he cut the lettersT.L. and placed it at the head of the grave. It was carried away by somerelic-hunter, and the place remained as before, with nothing to mark it,until the spring of 1876. Then the writer, fearing that the grave ofLincoln's father would become entirely unknown, succeeded in awakeningpublic opinion on the subject. Soon afterward a marble shaft twelve feethigh was erected, bearing on its western face this inscription:    THOMAS LINCOLN    FATHER OF    THE MARTYRED PRESIDENT.    BORN    JAN. 6th, 1778    DIED    JAN. 15th, 1851.    LINCOLN."And now," concluded Mr. Balch, "I have given all that can be known ofThomas Lincoln. I have written impartially and with a strict regard tofacts which can be substantiated by many of the old settlers in thiscounty. Thomas Lincoln was a harmless and honest man. Beyond this, onewill search in vain for any ancestral clue to the greatness of AbrahamLincoln."After reaching the new home in Illinois, young Lincoln worked with hisfather until things were in shape for comfortable living. He helped tobuild the log cabin, break up the new land and fence it in, splittingthe rails with his own hands. It was these very rails over which so muchsentiment was expended years afterward at an important epoch inLincoln's political career. During the sitting of the State Conventionat Decatur, a banner attached to two of these rails and bearing anappropriate inscription was brought into the assemblage and formallypresented to that body amid a scene of unparalleled enthusiasm. Afterthat they were in demand in every State of the Union in which free laborwas honored. They were borne in processions by the people, and hailed byhundreds of thousands as a symbol of triumph and a glorious vindicationof freedom and of the right and dignity of labor. These, however, werenot the first rails made by Lincoln. He was a practiced hand at thebusiness. As a memento of his pioneer accomplishment he preserved inlater years a cane made from a rail which he had split on his father'sfarm.The next important record of Lincoln's career connects him with Mr.Denton Offutt. The circumstances which brought him into this relationare thus narrated by Mr. J.H. Barrett: "While there was snow on theground, at the close of the year 1830, or early in 1831, a man came tothat part of Macon County where young Lincoln was living, in pursuit ofhands to aid him in a flatboat voyage down the Mississippi. The fact wasknown that the youth had once made such a trip, and his services weresought for this occasion. As one who had his own subsistence to earn,with no capital but his hands, he accepted the proposition made him.Perhaps there was something of his inherited and acquired fondness forexciting adventure impelling him to this decision. With him were alsoemployed his former fellow-laborer, John Hanks, and a son of hisstep-mother named John Johnston. In the spring of 1831 Lincoln set outto fulfil his engagement. The floods had so swollen the streams that theSangamon country was a vast sea before him. His first entrance into thatcounty was over these wide-spread waters in a canoe. The time had cometo join his employer on his journey to New Orleans, but the latter hadbeen disappointed by another person on whom he relied to furnish him aboat on the Illinois river. Accordingly all hands set to work, andthemselves built a boat on that river, for their purposes. This done,they set out on their long trip, making a successful voyage to NewOrleans and back."Mr. Herndon says: "Mr. Lincoln came into Sangamon County down the NorthFork of the Sangamon river, in a frail canoe, in the spring of 1831. Ican see from where I write the identical place where he cut the timbersfor his flatboat, which he built at a little village called SangamonTown, seven miles northwest of Springfield. Here he had it loaded withcorn, wheat, bacon, and other provisions destined for New Orleans, atwhich place he landed in the month of May, 1831. He returned home inJune of that year, and finally settled in another little village calledNew Salem, on the high bluffs of the Sangamon river, then in SangamonCounty and now in Menard County, and about twenty miles northwest ofSpringfield."The practical and ingenious character of Lincoln's mind is shown in theact that several years after his river experience he invented andpatented a device for overcoming some of the difficulties in thenavigation of western rivers with which this trip had made himfamiliar. The following interesting account of this invention is given:"Occupying an ordinary and commonplace position in one of the show-casesin the large hall of the Patent Office is one little model which in agesto come will be prized as one of the most curious and most sacred relicsin that vast museum of unique and priceless things. This is a plain andsimple model of a steamboat roughly fashioned in wood by the hand ofAbraham Lincoln. It bears date 1849, when the inventor was known simplyas a successful lawyer and rising politician of Central Illinois.Neither his practice nor his politics took up so much of his time as toprevent him from giving some attention to contrivances which he hopedmight be of benefit to the world and of profit to himself. The design ofthis invention is suggestive of one phase of Abraham Lincoln's earlylife, when he went up and down the Mississippi as a flatboatman andbecame familiar with some of the dangers and inconveniences attendingthe navigation of the western rivers. It is an attempt to make it aneasy matter to transport vessels over shoals and snags and 'sawyers.'The main idea is that of an apparatus resembling a noiseless bellowsplaced on each side of the hull of the craft just below the water lineand worked by an odd but not complicated system of ropes, valves, andpulleys. When the keel of the vessel grates against the sand orobstruction these bellows are to be filled with air, and thus buoyed upthe ship is expected to float lightly and gayly over the shoal whichwould otherwise have proved a serious interruption to her voyage. Themodel, which is about eighteen or twenty inches long and has theappearance of having been whittled with a knife out of a shingle and acigar-box, is built without any elaboration or ornament or any extraapparatus beyond that necessary to show the operation of buoying thesteamer over the obstructions. It is carved as one might imagine aretired railsplitter would whittle, strongly but not smoothly, andevidently made with a view solely to convey to the minds of the patentauthorities, by the simplest possible means, an idea of the purpose andplan of the invention. The label on the steamer's deck informs us thatthe patent was obtained; but we do not learn that the navigation of thewestern rivers was revolutionized by this quaint conception. The modestlittle model has reposed here for many years, and the inventor has foundit his task to guide the ship of state over shoals more perilous andobstructions more obstinate than any prophet dreamed of when AbrahamLincoln wrote his bold autograph across the prow of his miniaturesteamer."At the conclusion of his trip to New Orleans, Lincoln's employer, Mr.Offutt, entered into mercantile trade at New Salem, a settlement on theSangamon river, in Menard County, two miles from Petersburg, the countyseat. He opened a store of the class usually to be found in such smalltowns, and also set up a flouring-mill. In the late expedition down theMississippi Mr. Offutt had learned Lincoln's valuable qualities, and wasanxious to secure his help in his new enterprise. Says Mr. Barrett: "Forwant of other immediate employment, and in the same spirit which hadheretofore actuated him, Abraham Lincoln entered upon the duties of aclerk, having an eye to both branches of his employer's business. Thisconnection continued for nearly a year, all duties of his position beingfaithfully performed." It was to this year's humble but honorableservice of young Lincoln that Mr. Douglas tauntingly alluded in one ofhis speeches during the canvass of 1858 as 'keeping a groggery.'While engaged in the duties of Offutt's store Lincoln began the study ofEnglish grammar. There was not a text-book to be obtained in theneighborhood; but hearing that there was a copy of Kirkham's Grammar inthe possession of a person seven or eight miles distant he walked tohis house and succeeded in borrowing it. L.M. Green, a lawyer ofPetersburg, in Menard County, says that every time he visited New Salemat this period Lincoln took him out upon a hill and asked him to explainsome point in Kirkham that had given him trouble. After having masteredthe book he remarked to a friend that if that was what they called ascience he thought he could "subdue another." Mr. Green says thatLincoln's talk at this time showed that he was beginning to think of agreat life and a great destiny. Lincoln said to him on one occasion thatall his family seemed to have good sense but somehow none had everbecome distinguished. He thought perhaps he might become so. He hadtalked, he said, with men who had the reputation of being great men, buthe could not see that they differed much from others. During this yearhe was also much engaged with debating clubs, often walking six or sevenmiles to attend them. One of these clubs held its meetings at an oldstore-house in New Salem, and the first speech young Lincoln ever madewas made there. He used to call the exercising "practicing polemics." Asthese clubs were composed principally of men of no education whatever,some of their "polemics" are remembered as the most laughable of farces.Lincoln's favorite newspaper at this time was the "Louisville Journal."He received it regularly by mail, and paid for it during a number ofyears when he had not money enough to dress decently. He liked itspolitics, and was particularly delighted with its wit and humor, ofwhich he had the keenest appreciation.At this era Lincoln was as famous for his skill in athletic sports as hewas for his love of books. Mr. Offutt, who had a strong regard for him,according to Mr. Arnold, "often declared that his clerk, or salesman,knew more than any man in the United States, and that he could out-run,whip, or throw any man in the county. These boasts came to the ears ofthe 'Clary Grove Boys,' a set of rude, roystering, good-naturedfellows, who lived in and around Clary's Grove, a settlement near NewSalem. Their leader was Jack Armstrong, a great square-built fellow,strong as an ox, who was believed by his followers to be able to whipany man on the Sangamon river. The issue was thus made between Lincolnand Armstrong as to which was the better man, and although Lincoln triedto avoid such contests, nothing but an actual trial of strength wouldsatisfy their partisans. They met and wrestled for some time without anydecided advantage on either side. Finally Armstrong resorted to somefoul play, which roused Lincoln's indignation. Putting forth his wholestrength, he seized the great bully by the neck and holding him at arm'slength shook him like a boy. The Clary Grove Boys were ready to pitch inon behalf of their champion; and as they were the greater part of thelookers-on, a general onslaught upon Lincoln seemed imminent. Lincolnbacked up against Offutt's store and calmly awaited the attack; but hiscoolness and courage made such an impression upon Armstrong that hestepped forward, grasped Lincoln's hand and shook it heartily, saying:'Boys, Abe Lincoln is the best fellow that ever broke into thissettlement. He shall be one of us.' From that day forth Armstrong wasLincoln's friend and most willing servitor. His hand, his table, hispurse, his vote, and that of the Clary Grove Boys as well, belonged toLincoln. The latter's popularity among them was unbounded. They saw thathe would play fair. He could stop a fight and quell a disturbance amongthese rude neighbors when all others failed."Under whatever circumstances Lincoln was forced into a fight, the endcould be confidently predicted. He was sure to thrash his opponent andgain the latter's friendship afterwards by a generous use of victory.Innumerable instances could be cited in proof of this statement. It isrelated that "One day while showing goods to two or three women inOffutt's store, a bully came in and began to talk in an offensivemanner, using much profanity and evidently wishing to provoke a quarrel.Lincoln leaned over the counter and begged him, as ladies were present,not to indulge in such talk. The bully retorted that the opportunity hadcome for which he had long sought, and he would like to see the man whocould hinder him from saying anything he might choose to say. Lincoln,still cool, told him that if he would wait until the ladies retired hewould hear what he had to say and give him any satisfaction he desired.As soon as the women were gone the man became furious. Lincoln heard hisboasts and his abuse for a time, and finding that he was not to be putoff without a fight, said, 'Well, if you must be whipped, I suppose Imay as well whip you as any other man.' This was just what the bully hadbeen seeking, he said; so out of doors they went. Lincoln made shortwork of him. He threw him upon the ground, and held him there as if hehad been a child, and gathering some 'smart-weed' which grew upon thespot he rubbed it into his face and eyes until the fellow bellowed withpain. Lincoln did all this without a particle of anger, and when the jobwas finished went immediately for water, washed his victim's face anddid everything he could to alleviate his distress. The upshot of thematter was that the man became his life-long friend and was a better manfrom that day."The chief repute of a sturdy frontiersman is built upon his deeds ofprowess, and the fame of the great, rough, strong-limbed, kind-heartedTitan was spread over all the country around. Says Mr. Lamon: "On oneoccasion while he was clerking for Offutt a stranger came into the storeand soon disclosed the fact that his name was Smoot. Abe was behind thecounter at the moment, but hearing the name he sprang over andintroduced himself. Abe had often heard of Smoot and Smoot had oftenheard of Abe. They had been as anxious to meet as ever two celebritieswere, but hitherto they had never been able to manage it. 'Smoot,' saidLincoln, after a steady survey of his person, 'I am very muchdisappointed in you; I expected to see an old Probst of a fellow.'(Probst, it appears, was the most hideous specimen of humanity in allthat country). 'Yes,' replied Smoot, 'and I am equally disappointed, forI expected to see a good-looking man when I saw you.' A few neatcompliments like the foregoing laid the foundation of a lasting intimacybetween the two men, and in his present distress Lincoln knew no one whowould be more likely than Smoot to respond favorably to an applicationfor money." After he was elected to the Legislature, says Mr. Smoot, "hecame to my house one day in company with Hugh Armstrong. Says he,'Smoot, did you vote for me?' I told him I did. 'Well,' says he, 'youmust loan me money to buy suitable clothing, for I want to make a decentappearance in the Legislature.' I then loaned him two hundred dollars,which he returned to me according to promise."Lincoln's old friend W.G. Greene relates that while he was a student atthe Illinois College at Jacksonville he became acquainted with RichardYates, then also a student. One summer while Yates was his guest duringthe vacation, Greene took him up to Salem and made him acquainted withLincoln. They found the latter flat on his back on a cellar door readinga newspaper. Greene introduced the two, and thus began the acquaintancebetween the future War-Governor of Illinois and the future President.Lincoln was from boyhood an adept at expedients for avoiding anyunpleasant predicament, and one of his modes of getting rid oftroublesome friends, as well as troublesome enemies, was by telling astory. He began these tactics early in life, and he grew to bewonderfully adept in them. If a man broached a subject which he did notwish to discuss, he told a story which changed the direction of theconversation. If he was called upon to answer a question, he answered itby telling a story. He had a story for everything; something hadoccurred at some place where he used to live that illustrated everypossible phase of every possible subject with which he might haveconnection. He acquired the habit of story-telling naturally, as welearn from the following statement: "At home, with his step-mother andthe children, he was the most agreeable fellow in the world. He wasalways ready to do everything for everybody. When he was not doing somespecial act of kindness, he told stories or 'cracked jokes.' He was asfull of his yarns in Indiana as ever he was in Illinois. Dennis Hankswas a clever hand at the same business, and so was old Tom Lincoln." Itwas while Lincoln was salesman for Offutt that he acquired the_sobriquet_ of "Honest Abe." Says Mr. Arnold: "Of many incidentsillustrating his integrity, one or two may be mentioned. One evening hefound his cash overran a little, and he discovered that in making changefor his last customer, an old woman who had come in a little beforesundown, he had made a mistake, not having given her quite enough.Although the amount was small, a few cents, he took the money,immediately walked to her house, and corrected the error. At anothertime, on his arrival at the store in the morning, he found on the scalesa weight which he remembered having used just before closing, but whichwas not the one he had intended to use. He had sold a parcel of tea, andin the hurry had placed the wrong weight on the scales, so that thepurchaser had a few ounces less of tea than had been paid for. Heimmediately sent the quantity required to make up the deficiency. Theseand many similar incidents are told regarding his scrupulous honesty inthe most trifling matters. It was for such things as these that peoplegave him the name which clung to him as long as he lived."It was in the summer of 1831 that Abraham Lincoln performed his firstofficial act. Minter Graham, the school-teacher, tells the story. "Onthe day of the election, in the month of August, Abe was seen loiteringabout the polling place. It was but a few days after his arrival in NewSalem. They were 'short of a clerk' at the polls; and, after castingabout in vain for some one competent to fill the office, it occurred toone of the judges that perhaps the tall stranger possessed the needfulqualifications. He thereupon accosted him, and asked if he could write.He replied, 'Yes, a little.' 'Will you act as clerk of the electionto-day?' said the judge. 'I will try,' returned Abe, 'and do the best Ican, if you so request.'" He did try accordingly, and, in the languageof the schoolmaster, "performed the duties with great facility,firmness, honesty, and impartiality. I clerked with him," says Mr.Graham, "on the same day and at the same polls. The election books arenow in the city of Springfield, where they can be seen and inspected anyday."That the foregoing anecdotes bearing on the early life of AbrahamLincoln are approximately correct is borne out by Lincoln himself. Atthe urgent request of Hon. Jesse W. Fell, of Bloomington, Illinois,Lincoln wrote a sketch of himself to be used during the campaign of1860. In a note which accompanied the sketch he said: "Herewith is alittle sketch, as you requested. There is not much to it, for thereason, I suppose, that there is not much of me. If anything be made outof it I wish it to be modest and not to go beyond the material." Theletter is as follows:     I was born Feb. 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. My parents     were both born in Virginia, of undistinguishable families--second     families, perhaps I should say. My mother, who died in my tenth     year, was of a family of the name of Hanks, some of whom now reside     in Adams, and others in Macon Counties, Illinois. My paternal     grandfather, Abraham Lincoln, emigrated from Rockingham County,     Virginia, to Kentucky, about 1781 or '2, where, a year or two     later, he was killed by Indians, not in battle, but by stealth,     when he was laboring to open a farm in the forest. His ancestors,     who were Quakers, went to Virginia from Berks County, Pennsylvania.     An effort to identify them with the New England family of the same     name, ended in nothing more than a similarity of Christian names in     both families, such as Enoch, Levi, Mordecai, Solomon, Abraham, and     the like.     My father, at the death of his father, was but six years of age,     and he grew up literally without education. He removed from     Kentucky to what is now Spencer County, Indiana, in my eighth year.     We reached our new home about the time the State came into the     Union. It was a wild region, with many bears and other wild animals     still in the woods. There I grew up. There were some schools, so     called, but no qualification was ever required of a teacher beyond     'readin', writin' and cipherin'' to the Rule of Three. If a     straggler, supposed to understand Latin, happened to sojourn in the     neighborhood, he was looked upon as a wizard. There was absolutely     nothing to excite ambition for education. Of course when I came of     age I did not know much. Still, somehow, I could read, write, and     cipher to the Rule of Three, but that was all. I have not been to     school since. The little advance I now have upon this store of     education, I have picked up from time to time under the pressure of     necessity.     I was raised to farm work, which I continued till I was twenty-two.     At twenty-one I came to Illinois, and passed the first year in     Macon County. Then I got to New Salem, at that time in Sangamon,     now in Menard County, where I remained a year as a sort of clerk in     a store. Then came the Black Hawk War, and I was elected a Captain     of Volunteers--a success which gave me more pleasure than any I     have had since. I went through the campaign, was elated, ran for     the Legislature the same year (1832), and was beaten--the only time     I have ever been beaten by the people. The next, and three     succeeding biennial elections, I was elected to the Legislature. I     was not a candidate afterwards. During this legislative period I     had studied law, and removed to Springfield to practice it. In     1846 I was once elected to the Lower House of Congress, but was not     a candidate for re-election. From 1849 to 1854, both inclusive,     practiced law more assiduously than ever before. Always a Whig in     politics, and generally on the Whig electoral tickets, making     active canvasses. I was losing interest in politics, when the     repeal of the Missouri Compromise aroused me again. What I have     done since then is pretty well known.     If any personal description of me is thought desirable, it may be     said, I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh,     weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark     complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes. No other marks     or brands recollected.     Yours very truly,     A. LINCOLN.CHAPTER II     A Turn in Affairs--The Black Hawk War--A Remarkable Military     Manoeuvre--Lincoln Protects an Indian--Lincoln and     Stuart--Lincoln's Military Record--Nominated for the     Legislature--Lincoln a Merchant--Postmaster at New Salem--Lincoln     Studies Law--Elected to the Legislature--Personal     Characteristics--Lincoln's Love for Anne Rutledge--Close of     Lincoln's Youth.The spring of 1832 brought a new turn in Lincoln's career. The year hadbeen one of great advancement in many respects. He had made new andvaluable acquaintances, read many books, mastered the grammar of his owntongue, won a multitude of friends. Those who could appreciateintelligence and character respected him, and those whose highest ideasof a man related to his physical prowess were devoted to him. Everyonetrusted him. He was judge, arbitrator, referee, authority in alldisputes, games, and matches whether of man-flesh or horse-flesh. He wasthe peacemaker in all quarrels. He was everybody's friend--thebest-natured, most sensible, best-informed, most modest, unassuming,kindest, gentlest, roughest, strongest, best young fellow in all NewSalem or the region about. But Mr. Offutt's trading enterprises endeddisastrously in the year 1832. The store was closed, the mill was shutdown, and Lincoln was out of business.At the very moment, however, that he found himself adrift Illinois wasfilled with excitement over the Black Hawk War. The centre of alarm wasin the Rock Valley, in the northern part of the State, which had beenformerly the home of the Sac tribe of Indians. Discontented with theirlife on the reservation west of the Mississippi, to which they had beenremoved, the Sacs, with several other tribes, resolved to recover theirold hunting-grounds. The warlike chief, Black Hawk, was at the head ofthe revolt, and his march toward the Rock river was signalized by anumber of massacres. Governor Reynolds of Illinois issued a proclamationcalling for volunteers to aid the regular troops in the emergency.Lincoln was one of the first to answer the call, the brave "Clary GroveBoys" also coming promptly to the rescue. "The volunteers gathered,"writes Mr. Arnold, "at Rushville, in Schuyler County, at which placethey were to be organized, and elected officers. Lincoln was a candidatefor the place of captain, and in opposition to him was one WilliamKirkpatrick. The mode of election was novel. By agreement, eachcandidate walked off to some distance and took position by himself. Themen were then to form, and those who voted for Kirkpatrick were to rangeon a line with their candidate. When the lines were formed, Lincoln'swas three times as long as that of Kirkpatrick, and so Lincoln wasdeclared elected. Speaking of this affair when President, he said thathe was more gratified with this his first success than with any otherelection of his life. Neither Lincoln nor his company was in anyengagement during the campaign, but there was plenty of hardships andfatigue, and some incidents occurred to illustrate his courage and powerover men."Many years afterward--in fact, while Lincoln was President--he referredto those early scenes in a way that illustrates his wonderful memory andhis power of recalling the minutest incidents of his past life. Meetingan old Illinois friend, he naturally fell to talking of Illinois, andrelated several stories of his early life in that region. Particularlyhe remembered his share in the Black Hawk War. He referred to his partof the campaign lightly, and said that he saw but very little fighting.But he remembered coming on a camp of white scouts one morning just asthe sun was rising. The Indians had surprised the camp and killed andscalped every man. "I remember just how those men looked," said Lincoln,"as we rode up the little hill where their camp was. The red light ofthe morning sun was streaming upon them as they lay, heads toward us, onthe ground, and every man had a round red spot on the top of his head,about as big as a dollar, where the redskins had taken his scalp. It wasfrightful, but it was grotesque, and the red sunlight seemed to painteverything all over." Lincoln paused as if recalling the vivid picture,and added, somewhat irrelevantly, "I remember that one man had buckskinbreeches on."Lincoln also told a good story of his first experience in drilling rawtroops during the Black Hawk War. He was crossing a field with a frontof twenty men when he came to a gate through which it was necessary topass. In describing the incident he said: "I could not, for the life ofme, remember the proper word of command for getting my company_endwise_, so that it could pass through the gate. So, as we came nearthe gate, I shouted, 'Halt! this company is dismissed for two minutes,when it will fall in again on the other side of the gate.'" Themanoeuvre was successfully executed.During this campaign an incident occurred which well serves to showLincoln's keen sense of justice, his great common sense, and hisresoluteness when aroused. One day there came to the camp an old Indian,footsore and hungry. He was provided with a letter of safe-conduct fromGeneral Cass; but there was a feeling of great irritation against theIndians, and the men objected strongly to receiving him. They pronouncedhim a spy and his passport a forgery, and were rushing upon thedefenseless Indian to kill him, when the tall figure of their captain,Lincoln, suddenly appeared between them and their victim. His men hadnever seen him so aroused, and they cowed before him. "Men," said he,"this must not be done! He must not be killed by us!" His voice andmanner produced an effect on the mob. They paused, listened, fell back,and sullenly obeyed him, although there were still some murmurs ofdisappointed rage. At length one man, probably thinking he spoke for thecrowd, cried out: "This is cowardly on your part, Lincoln!" Lincoln onlygazed with contempt on the men who would have murdered one unarmedIndian but who quailed before his single hand. "If any man thinks I am acoward," said he, "let him test it." "Lincoln," was the reply, "you arelarger and heavier than any of us." "That you can guard against,"responded the captain. "Choose your weapons!" The insubordination ended,and the word "coward" was never associated with Lincoln's name again. Heafterward said that at this time he felt that his life and characterwere both at stake, and would probably have been lost had he not at thesupreme moment forgotten the officer and asserted the man. His men couldhardly have been called soldiers. They were merely armed citizens, witha military organization in name only. Had he ordered them under arresthe would have created a serious mutiny; and to have them tried andpunished would have been impossible.It was while Lincoln was a militia captain that he made the acquaintanceof a man who was destined to have an important influence on his life.This was Major John T. Stuart, afterwards his law-partner. Stuart wasalready a lawyer by profession. During the Black Hawk War he commandedone of the Sangamon County companies, and was soon afterward electedmajor of a spy battalion formed from some of these companies. He had thebest of opportunities at this time to observe the merits of CaptainLincoln, and testifies that the latter was exceedingly popular among thesoldiers on account of his excellent care of the men in his command, hisnever-failing good nature, and his ability to tell more stories andbetter ones than any man in the service. He was popular also among thesehardy men on account of his great physical strength. For several yearsafter the Black Hawk War Lincoln retained his military title and wasusually addressed as "Captain Lincoln." But this in time wasdiscontinued. Stuart's title of "Major," on the contrary, adhered to himthrough life. He was best known as "Major Stuart" down to the time ofhis death, which occurred early in the winter of 1886.The time for which Captain Lincoln's company enlisted soon ran by, butthe trouble with the Indians not being ended Governor Reynolds calledfor a second body of volunteers. Lincoln again responded, and wasenrolled as a private in the independent company commanded by ElijahIles of Springfield. A note of this occurrence, made in 1868 by CaptainIles, contains the following statement: "The term of Governor Reynolds'sfirst call being about to expire, he made a second call, and the firstlevy was disbanded. I was elected a captain of one of the companies. Wewere mustered into service on the 29th of May, 1832, at the mouth of Foxriver, now Ottawa, by Lieutenant Robert Anderson, Assistant InspectorGeneral in the United States Army."One day during the Black Hawk War there were in the camp on Rock riverfour men afterward famed in the history of the country. It was whileLincoln was a member of the company under command of Captain Iles. Thesemen were Lieutenant Colonel Zachary Taylor, Lieutenant Jefferson Davis,Lieutenant Robert Anderson, and Private Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln andAnderson did not meet again until 1861, after the latter had evacuatedFort Sumter. Major Anderson then visited Washington and called at theWhite House to pay his respects to the President. After having expressedhis thanks to Anderson for his conduct in South Carolina, Lincoln said,"Major, do you remember ever meeting me before?" "No, Mr. President, Ido not remember having had the pleasure before," said Anderson. "Well,"said Lincoln, "my memory is better than yours. You mustered me into theservice of the United States in 1832 at Dixon's Ferry, during the BlackHawk War."Lincoln displayed the same courage and fidelity in performing the dutiesof a soldier that had marked his conduct in all other relations of life.Father Dixon, the guide who was attached to Captain Iles's company ofmounted rangers, remarks that in their marches when scouts were sentforward to examine thickets and ravines in which it was thought theenemy might be lurking it often became necessary for many of the men todismount and attend to their riding gear. Whenever Lincoln was detailedfor such service, however, his saddle was always in order.During the contest between General Lewis Cass and General Zachary Taylorfor the Presidency, in the year 1848, Lincoln made a speech in Congressin which he referred to his services in the Black Hawk War withcharacteristic humor:"By the way, Mr. Speaker," he said, "did you know that I am a militaryhero? Yes, sir. In the days of the Black Hawk War I fought, bled, andcame away. Speaking of General Cass's career reminds me of my own. I wasnot at Stillman's defeat, but I was about as near it as Cass was toHull's surrender, and, like him, I saw the place very soon afterwards.It is quite certain that I did not break my sword, for I had none tobreak. But I bent my musket pretty badly on one occasion. If Cass brokehis sword the idea is that he broke it in desperation. I bent my musketby accident. If General Cass went ahead of me in picking whortleberries,I guess I surpassed him in charges upon the wild onions. If he saw anylive fighting Indians, it is more than I did, but I had a good manybloody struggles with the mosquitos, and although I never fainted fromloss of blood I can truly say that I was often very hungry. Mr. Speaker,if I should ever conclude to doff whatever our Democratic friends maysuppose there is in me of black-cockade Federalism, and thereupon theyshall take me up as their candidate for the Presidency, I protest theyshall not make fun of me as they have of General Cass by attempting towrite me into a military hero."Lincoln's popularity among his comrades in the field was so great thatat the close of his military service, which had lasted three months, hewas nominated as a candidate for the State Legislature. "His firstappearance on the stump in the course of the canvass was at Pappsville,about eleven miles west of Springfield, upon the occasion of a publicsale. The sale over, speech-making was about to begin, when Lincolnobserved some strong symptoms of inattention in his audience which hadtaken that particular moment to engage in a a general fight. Lincoln sawthat one of his friends was suffering more than he liked, and steppinginto the crowd he shouldered them sternly away from his man until he meta fellow who refused to fall back. Him he seized by the nape of the neckand the seat of his breeches, and tossed him 'ten or twelve feeteasily.' After this episode--as characteristic of him as of thetimes--he mounted the platform and delivered with awkward modesty thefollowing speech: 'Gentlemen and Fellow-Citizens, I presume you all knowwho I am. I am humble Abraham Lincoln. I have been solicited by myfriends to become a candidate for the Legislature. My politics are shortand sweet, like the old woman's dance. I am in favor of a national bank.I am in favor of the internal-improvement system and a high protectivetariff. These are my sentiments and political principles. If elected Ishall be thankful. If not, it will be all the same.'"Lincoln's friend, Mr. A.Y. Ellis, who was with him during a part ofthis campaign, says: "He wore a mixed-jeans coat, claw-hammer style,short in the sleeves and bobtail,--in fact, it was so short in the tailthat he could not sit down on it,--flax and tow linen pantaloons, and astraw hat. I think he wore a vest, but I do not remember how it looked.He wore pot-metal boots. I went with him on one of his electioneeringtrips to Island Grove, and he made a speech which pleased his partyfriends very well, although some of the Jackson men tried to make sportof it. He told several good anecdotes in the speech, and applied themvery well, I thought."The election took place in August, and although Lincoln was defeated hereceived two hundred and seventy-seven out of the two hundred andeighty-four votes cast in his precincts. He was so little known outsideof New Salem that the chances of election were hopelessly against him,yet the extraordinary evidence of favor shown by the vote of hisfellow-townsmen was a flattering success in the midst of defeat. Hisfailure to be elected, however, left him once more without occupation.He was without means, and felt the necessity of undertaking somebusiness that would provide him an income, however small. It seems thatat this time he considered seriously learning the blacksmith's trade,but while entertaining the idea an event occurred which opened the wayin another direction. The particulars of this event are given by Mr.W.G. Greene. "A man named Reuben Radford," says Mr. Greene, "was thekeeper of a small store in the village of New Salem. A friend told himto look out for the 'Clary Grove boys' or they would smash him up. Hesaid he was not afraid. He was a great big fellow. But his friend said,'They don't come alone. If one can't whip you, two or three can, andthey'll do it.' One day he left his store in charge of his brother, withinjunctions that if the 'Clary Grove boys' came he must not let themhave more than two drinks apiece. All the stores in those days keptliquor to sell and had a corner for drinking. The store was nicelyfitted up, and had many things in glass jars nicely labelled. The 'ClaryGrove boys' came, and took two drinks each. The clerk refused them anymore as politely as he could. Then they went behind the counter andhelped themselves. They got roaring drunk and went to work smashingeverything in the store. The fragments on the floor were an inch deep.They left and went off on their horses whooping and yelling. Comingacross some herds of cattle, they took the bells from their necks,fastened them to the tails of the leaders, and chased them over thecountry yelling like mad. Radford heard them, and, mounting his horse,rode in hot haste to the store. I had been sent that morning with gristto the mill, and had to pass the store. I saw Radford ride up, his horsea lather of foam. He dismounted, and looked in upon the wreck throughthe open door He was aghast at the sight, and said, 'I'll sell out thisthing to the first man that comes along.' I rode up and said, 'I'll giveyou four hundred dollars for it.' 'Done!' said he. 'But,' I said, 'Ihave no money. I must have time.' 'How much?' 'Six months.' 'Agreed.' Hedrew up a note for four hundred dollars at six months, and I signed it.I began to think I was stuck. Then the boys came in, and among them wasLincoln. 'Cheer up, Billy,' he said. 'It's a good thing. We'll take aninventory.' 'No more inventories for me,' said I, not knowing what hemeant. He explained that we should take an account of stock to see howmuch was left. We found that it amounted to about twelve hundreddollars. Lincoln and Berry consulted over it, and offered me two hundredand fifty dollars for my bargain. I accepted, stipulating that theyshould assume my notes. Berry was a wild fellow--a gambler. He had afine horse, with a splendid saddle and bridle. He turned over the horseas part pay. Lincoln let Berry run the store, and it soon ran out. Ihad to pay the note. Lincoln said he would pay it some day and did, withinterest." This ended Lincoln's brief career as a country merchant.Many of the anecdotes in the foregoing pages touch upon Lincoln'sambition to fit himself for a public speaker. Even at this early day thesettlers in New Salem were infected with the general desire to join inthe march toward intellectual improvement. To aid in this object, theyhad established a club entitled the New Salem Literary Society. Beforethis association, the studious Lincoln was invited to speak. Mr. R.B.Rutledge, the brother of Anne Rutledge, says of the event: "About theyear 1832 or 1833, Mr. Lincoln made his first effort at public speaking.A debating club, of which James Rutledge was president, was organizedand held regular meetings. As Lincoln arose to speak, his tall formtowered above the little assembly. Both hands were thrust down deep inthe pockets of his pantaloons. A perceptible smile at once lit up thefaces of the audience, for all anticipated the relation of some humorousstory. But he opened up the discussion in splendid style, to theinfinite astonishment of his friends. As he warmed with his subject, hishands would forsake his pockets and enforce his ideas by awkwardgestures, but would very soon seek their easy resting-places. He pursuedthe question with reason and argument so pithy and forcible that allwere amazed. The president, after the meeting, remarked to his wife thatthere was more in Abe's head than wit and fun; that he was already afine speaker; that all he lacked was culture to enable him to reach thehigh destiny which he knew was in store for him."On the 7th of May, 1833, Lincoln was appointed postmaster at New Salemby President Jackson. The duties of the position were light, there beingonly a weekly mail, and the remuneration was correspondingly small."The office was too insignificant to be considered politically, and itwas given to the young man because everybody liked him, and because hewas the only man willing to take it who could make out the returns. Hewas exceedingly pleased with the appointment, because it gave him achance to read every newspaper that was taken in the vicinity. He hadnever been able to get half the newspapers he wanted, and the officegave him the prospect of a constant feast. Not wishing to be tied to theoffice, as it yielded him no revenue that would reward him for theconfinement, he made a post-office of his hat. Whenever he went out, theletters were placed in his hat. When an anxious looker for a letter metthe postmaster he found also the post-office, and the public official,taking off his hat, looked over and delivered the mail wherever thepublic might find him. He kept the office until it was discontinued, orwas removed to Petersburg."A small balance due the government remained in the hands of Lincoln atthe discontinuance of the office. Time passed on, and he had removed toSpringfield and was practicing law, having his place of business in Dr.Henry's office. Meanwhile his struggle with poverty was unabated, and hehad often been obliged to borrow money from his friends to purchase thebarest necessities. It was at this juncture that the agent of the UnitedStates called for a settlement of his post-office accounts. Theinterview took place in the presence of Dr. Henry who thus describes it:"I did not believe he had the money on hand to meet the draft, and I wasabout to call him aside and loan him the money, when he asked the agentto be seated a moment. He went over to his trunk at his boarding-houseand returned with an old blue sock with a quantity of silver and coppercoin tied up in it. Untying the sock, he poured the contents on thetable and proceeded to count the coin, which consisted of such silverand copper pieces as the country people were then in the habit of usingin paying postage. On counting it up, there was found the exact amountof the draft to a cent, and in the identical coin which had beenreceived. He never, under any circumstances, used trust funds."When Lincoln was about twenty-three years of age, some time in 1832, hebegan studying law, using an old copy of Blackstone's Commentaries whichhe had bought at auction in Springfield. This work was soon mastered,and then the young man looked about him for more. His friend of theBlack Hawk War, Major John T. Stuart, had a considerable law library forthose days, and to him Lincoln applied in his extremity. The library wasplaced at his disposal, and thenceforth he was engrossed in theacquisition of its contents. But the books were in Springfield, wheretheir owner resided; and New Salem was some fourteen miles distant. Thisproved no obstacle in the way of Lincoln, who made nothing of the walkback and forth in the pursuit of his purpose. Mr. Stuart's partner, Mr.H.C. Dummer, who took note of the youth in his frequent visits to theoffice, describes him as "an uncouth looking lad, who did not say much,but what he did say he said straight and sharp." "He used to read law,"says Henry McHenry, "barefooted, seated in the shade of a tree justopposite Berry's grocery, and would grind around with the shade,occasionally varying his attitude by lying flat on his back and puttinghis feet up the tree," a situation which might have been unfavorable tomental application in the case of a man with shorter extremities. "Thefirst time I ever saw Abe with a law-book in his hand," says SquireGodbey, "he was sitting astride Jake Bates's woodpile in New Salem. SaysI, 'Abe, what are you studying?' 'Law,' says Abe. 'Good God Almighty!'responded I." It was too much for Godbey; he could not suppress theexclamation of surprise at seeing such a figure acquiring learning insuch an odd situation. Mr. Arnold states that Lincoln made a practiceof reading in his walks between Springfield and New Salem; and sointense was his application and so absorbed was he in his study that hewould pass his best friends without observing them, and some people saidthat Lincoln was going crazy with hard study.He soon began to make a practical application of his legal knowledge. Hebought an old form-book and began to draw up contracts, deeds, leases,mortgages, and all sorts of legal instruments for his neighbors. He alsobegan to exercise his forensic ability in trying small cases beforejustices of the peace and juries, and soon acquired a local reputationas a speaker, which gave him considerable practice. But he was able inthis way to earn scarcely money enough for his maintenance. To add tohis means, he took up the study of surveying, and soon became, likeWashington, a skilful and accurate surveyor. John Calhoun, anintelligent and courteous gentleman, was at that time surveyor of thecounty of Sangamon. He became interested in Lincoln and appointed himhis deputy. His work was so accurate and the settlers had suchconfidence in him that he was much sought after to survey, fix, and markthe boundaries of farms, and to plot and lay off the town of Petersburg.His accuracy must have been attained with some difficulty, for when hebegan to survey his chain was a grape-vine. He did not speculate in theland he surveyed. Had he done so the rapid advance in the value of realestate would have made it easy for him to make good investments. But hewas not in the least like one of his own appointees when President,--asurveyor-general of a Western territory, who bought up much of the bestland, and to whom the President said, "I am told, sir, you are _monarchof all you survey_."The nomination of Lincoln for the State Legislature on his return fromthe Black Hawk War was premature. The people of New Salem voted for himalmost to a man, but his acquaintance had not then extended into thesurrounding district far enough to insure his election. In the campaignof 1834 the choice of a candidate again fell upon him, and this timethere was a prospect of success. Lincoln entered into the contest withearnestness, and used every legitimate means to secure a victory. Mr.Herndon relates the following incident of this campaign: "Lincoln cameto my house, near Island Grove, during harvest. There were some thirtymen in the field. He had his dinner, and then went out into the fieldwhere the men were at work. I introduced him, and the boys said theywould not vote for a man unless he could 'make a hand.' 'Well, boys,' hesaid, 'if that is all that is needed I am sure of your votes.' He tookhold of the cradle and led the way all around with perfect ease. Theboys were satisfied. I don't think he lost a vote in that crowd. Thenext day there was speaking at Berlin. He went from my house with Dr.Barnett, who had asked me who this man Lincoln was. I told him he was acandidate for the Legislature. He laughed and said, 'Can't the partyraise better material than that?' I said, 'Go to-morrow and hear himbefore you pass judgment.' When he came back I said, 'Doctor, what haveyou to say now?' 'Why, sir,' he said, 'he is a perfect _take-in_. Heknows more than all the rest of them put together.'"The result of the election was that Lincoln was chosen to represent theSangamon district. When the Legislature convened at the opening session,he was in his place in the lower house; but he bore himself quietly inhis new position. He had much to learn in his novel situation as one ofthe lawmakers of the State, and as a co-worker with an assemblycomprising the most talented and prominent men gathered from all partsof Illinois. He was keenly watchful of the proceedings of the House,weighing every measure with scrutinizing sagacity, but except in theannouncement of his vote his voice was seldom heard. At the previoussession, Mr. G.S. Hubbard, afterwards a well-known citizen of Chicago,had exerted himself to procure the passage of an act for theconstruction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal. His effort wasdefeated; but he continued, as a lobbyist, to push the measure duringseveral winters, until it was finally adopted. Lincoln lent himefficient aid in the accomplishment of his object. "Indeed," remarks Mr.Hubbard, "I very much doubt if the bill could have passed as easily asit did without his valuable help." "We were thrown much together,"continues Mr. Hubbard, "our intimacy increasing. I never had a friend towhom I was more warmly attached. His character was almost faultless;possessing a warm and generous heart, genial, affable, honest, courteousto his opponents, persevering, industrious in research, never losingsight of the principal point under discussion, aptly illustrating by hisstories which were always brought into good effect. He was free frompolitical trickery or denunciation of the personal character of hisopponents. In debate he was firm and collected. 'With malice towardnone, with charity for all,' he won the confidence of the public, evenhis political opponents."Of all the stories of Lincoln's boyhood and youth, the most profoundlytouching is that of his love for Anne Rutledge. The existence of thisromance was brief, but it is believed by many that it was the memory ofit which threw over Lincoln that indescribable melancholy which seemedto shadow his whole life. The Rutledges from whom Anne was descendedwere an eminent family of the Carolinas. She was about nineteen yearsold when Lincoln knew her first. It was shortly after the Black HawkWar. She was a winsome girl, with fair hair and blue eyes, and Lincoln'sheart was captivated by her sweet face and gentle manners. So attractivea girl was not, of course, without suitors, and Anne had been wooed byone James McNeill, a young man who had come to New Salem soon after thefounding of the town. He had been more than ordinarily successful, andhad bought a large farm a few miles north of the village. He wasunmarried--at least he so represented himself--and paid devotedattention to Anne. They were engaged, although both had acquiesced inthe wishes of Anne's parents that they should not be married until shewas older.About this time Lincoln appeared in New Salem and went to board at theRutledge tavern. Here he saw Anne, and was much in her company. Duringthe next year McNeill became restless and discontented. He said it wasbecause he wanted to see his people. So he decided to go East on avisit. He sold out his interests in New Salem--an act not at allnecessary if he were going only on a visit, and which in the light ofafter events had much significance--telling Anne that it was his hope tobring his father and mother back with him and establish them upon hisfarm. "This done," he said, "we will be married." He then set out on hisjourney.It was late in the summer before Anne heard from him. He explained thathe had been taken ill with chills and fever on the way, and had beenlong delayed in getting home. But the long wait had been a great strainupon Anne. Lincoln, meanwhile, had become the postmaster in New Salem,and it was to him that Anne came to inquire for letters. He watched heranxiety with sympathy, and in a way became her confidant. His tenderheart, which never could resist suffering, was deeply touched at sightof her distress. Finally McNeill's letters ceased altogether; and thenAnne confided to Lincoln something which McNeill had told her before heleft, and which until now she had kept secret,--namely, that his namewas not McNeill but McNamar. He had explained to her that he had madethis change because his father had failed in business and that as hisoldest son it was his duty to retrieve the family fortunes. So he hadchanged his name, and come West, hoping to return in a few years to hisfamily a rich man. All this Anne had believed, and had not repeateduntil now.All New Salem joined in declaring McNamar an impostor and his story afabrication. "Who knew how many wives he had?" they said. With oneaccord Anne's friends denounced him; and although his story turned outafterward to be not altogether false, it is small wonder that Anneherself at last came to believe that either he was dead or had ceased tolove her.While matters were in this state, Lincoln ventured to show his love forAnne. It was a long time before she would listen; but, convinced at lastthat her former lover had deserted her, she promised, in the spring of1835, to become his wife. But Lincoln had nothing on which to support afamily,--in fact, could hardly support himself. Besides, Anne wasanxious to go to school another year. So it was decided that she shouldspend the winter in an academy in Jacksonville, while Lincoln devotedhimself to the study of the law. Then, when she should return fromschool, he would be a member of the bar and they could be married.A happy spring and summer followed. All their friends took an interestin the lovers, and their prospects seemed bright. But Anne's healthbegan to fail. She could not rid herself of her haunting memories. Therewas a possibility that she had wronged McNamar. What if he should loveher still, and should return and find her wedded to another? Had shewronged both men? In her thoughts was perpetual conflict. The old lovestill persisted. Her conscience troubled her. She doubted, and wasmorbidly melancholy. All this wore upon her; she fell ill. At last hercondition became grave, then hopeless. Lincoln was sent for. Anne's lasthour was passed alone with him. She died at sunset, August 25, 1835. Anold neighbor who saw Lincoln just after his parting with the dying girlsays: "There were signs of the most terrible distress in his face. Hisgrief became frantic. He lost all self-control, even the consciousnessof his own identity; and his closest friends in New Salem pronounced himinsane, crazy, mad. They watched him with especial vigilance on dark andstormy days. At such times he raved piteously, often saying, 'I cannever be reconciled to having the snow fall and the rain beat upon hergrave.'" His old friend, Bowlin Greene, alone seemed possessed of thepower to quiet him. He took him to his own home and kept him for severalweeks, an object of undisguised solicitude. At last it seemed safe topermit him to return to his old haunts. Greene urged him to go back tothe law; and he did so, but he was never the same man again. He wasthin, haggard, and careworn. He was as one who had been at the brink ofthe grave. A long time afterward, when the grass had for nearly thirtyyears grown over the grave of Anne Rutledge, Lincoln was one dayintroduced to a man named Rutledge in the White House. He looked at hima moment, then grasped his hand and said with deep feeling: "I love thename of Rutledge to this day. Anne was a lovely girl. She was natural,well-educated. She would have made a good, loving wife. I did honestlyand truly love her, and I think often, often of her now." Mr. Herndonhas said that the love and the death of this young girl shatteredLincoln's purposes and tendencies. "He threw off his infinite sorrowonly by leaping wildly into the political arena. He needed whip and spurto save him from despair."The period of Abraham Lincoln's boyhood and youth had closed when hestood by the grave of Anne Rutledge. He had long been a man in stature.He was now a man in years; yet the rough path he had been forced totravel had made his progress toward maturity painfully slow. In spiteof his low birth, of his dire poverty, of the rudeness and illiteracy ofhis associates, of the absence of refinement in his surroundings, of hisscanty means of education, of his homely figure and awkward manners, ofhis coarse fare and shabby dress, he dared to believe there was anexalted career in store for him. He hewed out the foundations for itwith indomitable spirit. It was to be grounded on manly virtues. Itseems as though the boy felt the consecration of a high destiny from thevery dawn of his intelligence, and it set him apart, secure amid thetemptations and safe from the vices that corrupt many men. In the roughgarb of the backwoodsman he preserved the instincts of a gentleman. Hewas the companion of bullies and boors. He shared their work and theirsports, but he never stooped to their vulgarity. He very seldom drankwith them, and they never heard him speak an oath. He could throw thestoutest in a wrestling match, and was ready, when brought to it, towhip any insolent braggart who made cruel use of his strength. He neverflinched from hardship or danger, yet his heart was as soft and tenderas a woman's. The great gentle giant had a feeling of sympathy for everyliving creature. He was not ashamed to rock a cradle, or to carry a pailof water or an armful of wood to spare a tired woman's arms. Thoughdestitute of worldly goods, he was rich in friends. All the people ofhis acquaintance knew they could count on his doing the right thingalways, so far as he was able. Hence they trusted and loved him; and thetitle of "Honest Abe," which he bore through life, was a seal ofknighthood rarer and prouder than any king or queen could confer withthe sword. Abraham Lincoln was one of nature's noblemen. He showedhimself a hero in every circumstance of his boyhood and youth. Theelements of greatness were visible even then. The boy who was true toduty, patient in privation, modest in merit, kind to every form ofdistress, determined to rise by wresting opportunities from thegrudging hand of fate, was sure to make a man distinguished among hisfellows,--a man noted among the great men of the world, as the boy hadbeen among his neighbors in the wilds of Spencer County and New Salem.The site of the town where Lincoln spent the last three years of theperiod covered in this portion of his biography is now a desolate waste.A gentleman who visited the spot during the summer of 1885 thusdescribes the mournful scene: "From the hill where I sit, under theshade of three trees whose branches make one, I look out over theSangamon river and its banks covered apparently with primeval forests.Around are fields overgrown with weeds and stunted oaks. It was a townof ten or twelve years only. It began in 1824 and ended in 1836. Yet inthat time it had a history which the world will not let die as long asit venerates the memory of the noble liberator and martyr President,Abraham Lincoln."CHAPTER III     Lincoln's Beginning as a Lawyer--His Early Taste for     Politics--Lincoln and the Lightning-Rod Man--Not an     Aristocrat--Reply to Dr. Early--A Manly Letter--Again in the     Illinois Legislature--The "Long Nine"--Lincoln on His Way to the     Capital--His Ambition in 1836--First Meeting with Douglas--Removal     of the Illinois Capital--One of Lincoln's Early     Speeches--Pro-Slavery Sentiment in Illinois--Lincoln's Opposition     to Slavery--Contest with General Ewing--Lincoln Lays out a     Town--The Title "Honest Abe."Abraham Lincoln's career as a lawyer covered a period of a quarter of acentury, beginning about 1834 or '35, and ending with his election tothe Presidency, in November, 1860. When he began his professional lifehe was an obscure and unpromising youth of twenty-five, with but littlelearning and fewer accomplishments, and without advantages of socialinfluence or wealthy friends. Step by step, with patient industry andunflinching determination, he climbed the ladder of professionaladvancement until he stood among the foremost lawyers of the West. Hehad, indeed, won a national reputation; and when he laid aside his lawbooks, a mature man of fifty, it was to enter upon the great honors andresponsibilities of the Presidency of the American Republic.Lincoln was devoted to his profession, and his success in it was earnedby hard and constant application. But his natural taste for politics ledhim to take a full share in the activities of political life. He hadalready served a term in the Illinois Legislature (1834-35), and so wellsatisfied were his constituents that they renominated him for thesucceeding term. In the canvass which followed he distinguished himselfas a stump-speaker; showing, by his tact and ability, by the skill andingenuity with which he met his opponents in debate, by his shrewdnessin attack and readiness in retort, how much he had profited by thetraining of the previous years.An incident illustrating his ready wit and his keen insight into humannature occurred early in this campaign, at Springfield, where a publicdiscussion was held between the opposing candidates. An interestingversion of this incident is given by Mr. Arnold: "There lived at thistime in the most pretentious house in Springfield a prominent citizennamed George Forquer. He had been long in public life, had been aleading Whig--the party to which Lincoln belonged--but had lately goneover to the Democrats, and had received from the Democraticadministration an appointment to the lucrative post of Register of theLand Office at Springfield. Upon his handsome new house he had latelyplaced a lightning-rod, the first one ever put up in Sangamon County. AsLincoln was riding into town with his friends, they passed the finehouse of Forquer, and observed the novelty of the lightning-rod,discussing the manner in which it protected the house from being struckby lightning. In this discussion there were seven Whig and sevenDemocratic candidates for the lower branch of the Legislature; and afterseveral had spoken it fell to Lincoln to close the arguments. This hedid with great ability. Forquer, though not a candidate, then asked tobe heard for the Democrats in reply to Lincoln. He was a good speakerand well-known throughout the county. His special task that day was toattack and ridicule the young man from Salem. Turning to Lincoln, whostood within a few feet of him, he said: 'This young man must be takendown, and I am truly sorry that the task devolves upon me.' He thenproceeded, in a very overbearing way, and with an assumption of greatsuperiority, to attack Lincoln and his speech. Lincoln stood calm, buthis flashing eye and pale cheek showed his indignation. As soon asForquer had closed he took the stand and first answered his opponent'sarguments fully and triumphantly. So impressive were his words andmanner that a hearer believes that he can remember to this day, andrepeat, some of the expressions. Among other things, he said: 'Thegentleman commenced his speech by saying that this _young_ man--alludingto me--must be taken down. I am not so young in years as I am in thetricks and trades of a politician; but,' said he, pointing to Forquer,'live long or die young, I would rather die now, than, like thegentleman, change my politics for a three thousand dollar office, andthen feel obliged to erect a lightning-rod over my house to protect aguilty conscience from the vengeance of an offended God!'""It is difficult to-day," says Mr. Arnold, "to appreciate the effect onthe old settlers, of this figure. This lightning-rod was the first whichmost of those present had ever seen. They had slept all their lives intheir cabins in conscious security. Here was a man who seemed, to thesesimple-minded people, to be afraid to sleep in his own house withoutspecial and extraordinary protection from Almighty God. These oldsettlers thought nothing but the consciousness of guilt, the stings of aguilty conscience, could account for such timidity. Forquer and hislightning-rod were talked over in every settlement from Sangamon to theIllinois and the Wabash. Whenever he rose to speak thereafter, theysaid, 'There is the man who dare not sleep in his own house without alightning-rod to keep off the vengeance of the Almighty.'"Another amusing incident of the same campaign, and one which illustratesLincoln's love of a practical joke, is given as follows: "Among theDemocrats stumping the county at this time was one Dick Taylor, a mostpompous person, who was always arrayed in the richest attire--ruffledshirts, seals, etc., besides a rich embroidered vest. Notwithstandingthis array, he made great pretentions of being one of the 'hard-handedyeomanry,' and ridiculed with much sarcasm the 'rag barons' and'manufacturing lords' of the Whig party. One day, when he wasparticularly aggravating in a speech of this kind, Lincoln decided on alittle sport, and sidling up to Taylor suddenly threw open the latter'scoat, showing to the astonished spectators a glittering mass of ruffledshirt, gold watch, and glittering jewels. The crowd shouteduproariously. Lincoln said: 'While he [Colonel Taylor] was making thesecharges against the Whigs over the country, riding in fine carriages,wearing ruffled shirts, kid gloves, massive gold watch-chains with largegold seals, and flourishing a heavy gold-headed cane, I was a poor boy,hired on a flatboat at eight dollars a month, and had only one pair ofbreeches to my name, and they were buckskin,--and if you know the natureof buckskin, when wet and dried by the sun it will shrink,--and minekept shrinking until they left several inches of my legs bare betweenthe tops of my socks and the lower part of my breeches. Whilst I wasgrowing taller, they were becoming shorter and so much tighter that theyleft a blue streak around my legs that can be seen to this day. If youcall this aristocracy, I plead guilty to the charge.'""The Saturday evening preceding the election," says Mr. Lamon, "thecandidates were addressing the people in the Court House at Springfield.Dr. Early, one of the candidates on the Democratic side, made somecharge which Mr. N.W. Edwards, one of the candidates on the Whig side,deemed untrue. Edwards climbed on a table, so as to be seen by Early andby everyone in the house, and at the top of his voice told Early thatthe charge was false. The excitement that followed was intense--so muchso that fighting men thought a duel must settle the difficulty. Lincoln,by the programme, followed Early. He took up the subject in dispute andhandled it fairly and with such ability that everyone was astonishedand pleased. So that difficulty ended there. Then for the first time,aroused by the excitement of the occasion, he spoke in that tenorintonation of voice that ultimately settled down into that clear, shrillmonotone style that afterwards characterized his public speaking, andenabled his audience, however large, to hear distinctly the lowest soundof his voice." Mr. Arnold says that Lincoln's reply to Dr. Early was"often spoken of as exhibiting wonderful ability, and a crushing powerof sarcasm and ridicule. When he began he was embarrassed, spoke slowlyand with some hesitation and difficulty. But becoming excited by hissubject, he forgot himself entirely, and went on with argument and wit,anecdote and ridicule, until his opponent was completely crushed. Oldsettlers of Sangamon County who heard this reply speak of his personaltransformation as wonderful. When Lincoln began, they say, he seemedawkward, homely, unprepossessing. As he went on, and became excited, hisfigure rose to its full height and became commanding and majestic. Hisplain face was illuminated and glowed with expression. His dreamy eyeflashed with inspiration, and his whole person, his voice, his gestures,were full of the magnetism of powerful feeling, of conscious strengthand true eloquence."The inflexible honesty and fine sense of honor which lay at thefoundation of Lincoln's character are nobly exhibited in the followingletter to a former friend but now political opponent, Col. Robert Allen:     DEAR COLONEL:--I am told that during my absence last week, you     passed through this place, and stated publicly that you were in     possession of a fact or facts which, if known to the public, would     entirely destroy the prospects of N.W. Edwards and myself at the     ensuing election, but that through favor to us you would forbear to     divulge them. No one has needed favors more than I, and generally     few have been less unwilling to accept them; but in this case     favor to me would be injustice to the public, and therefore I must     beg your pardon for declining it. That I once had the confidence of     the people of Sangamon County is sufficiently evident; and if I     have since done anything, either by design or misadventure, which     if known would subject me to a forfeiture of that confidence, he     who knows of that thing and conceals it is a traitor to his     country's interest.     I find myself wholly unable to form any conjecture of what fact or     facts, real or supposed, you spoke. But my opinion of your veracity     will not permit me for a moment to doubt that you at least believed     what you said. I am flattered with the personal regard you     manifested for me; but I do hope that on more mature reflection you     will view the public interest as a paramount consideration, and     therefore determine to let the worst come.     I assure you that the candid statement of facts on your part,     however low it may sink me, shall never break the ties of personal     friendship between us.     I wish an answer to this, and you are at liberty to publish both if     you choose.     Very respectfully,     A. LINCOLN.     COL. ROBERT ALLEN.The campaign resulted in Lincoln's election to the Legislature of 1836.The nine delegates from Sangamon County happened to be men of remarkablestature, each one measuring six feet or more in height; and verynaturally they were nicknamed the "Long Nine." Lincoln overtopped allthe rest, and as a consequence was called "the Sangamon Chief." TheState capital was then at Vandalia; and Lincoln's journey there fromSpringfield was made mainly on foot. As he was trudging along the muddyroad, he fell in with Judge John Dean Caton, one of the early lawyers ofIllinois, afterwards Chief Justice of the State, who became an intimatefriend of Lincoln. Judge Caton gives an interesting account of theirfirst meeting, which occurred at this time. "I first met Mr. Lincoln,"says Judge Caton, "about the last of November, 1835, when on my way toVandalia to join the Supreme Court, which met there the first Monday inDecember, at the same time as the meeting of the Legislature. There werea great many people and all sorts of vehicles on the road fromSpringfield to Vandalia. The roads were very bad, and most of thepassengers got out and walked a considerable portion of the distance. Itseemed almost like the movement of a little army. While walking thusalong the side of the road I met Mr. Lincoln for the first time, and inthe course of a two days' journey we became quite well acquainted. If hehad been admitted to the bar at that time, he had not become known as alawyer out of his own immediate circuit. He was going to Vandalia as amember of the Legislature. He was one of the 'Long Nine,' as it wascalled, from Sangamon County, who by their successful manoeuvring andunited efforts succeeded in getting the seat of government moved fromVandalia to Springfield. During my stay of a few weeks in Vandalia Ifrequently met Mr. Lincoln. He was a very pleasant companion; but as wewalked along the road on the occasion referred to, talking aboutindifferent subjects, nothing impressed me with any idea of his futuregreatness."When Lincoln took his seat in the first session of the new Legislatureat Vandalia, his mind was full of new projects. His real public servicewas now about to begin, and having spent his time in the previousLegislature mainly as an observer and listener he was determined duringthis session to identify himself conspicuously with the "liberal"progressive legislation, dreaming of a fame far different from that heactually obtained as an anti-slavery leader. As he remarked to hisfriend Speed, he hoped to obtain the great distinction of being called"the De Witt Clinton of Illinois."It was at a special session of this Legislature that Lincoln first sawStephen A. Douglas, his great political antagonist of the future, whomhe describes as "the _least_ man" he ever saw. Douglas had come into theState from Vermont only the previous year, and having studied law forseveral months considered himself eminently qualified to be State'sattorney for the district in which he lived. General Linder says of thetwo men at this time: "I here had an opportunity, better than any I hadpreviously possessed, of measuring the intellectual stature of AbrahamLincoln. He was then about twenty-seven years old--my own age. Douglaswas four years our junior; consequently he could not have been overtwenty-three years old. Yet he was a very ready and expert debater, evenat that early period of his life. He and Lincoln were very frequentlypitted against each other, being of different politics. They bothcommanded marked attention and respect."A notable measure effected by the "Long Nine" during this session of theLegislature was the removal of the State Capital from Vandalia toSpringfield. It was accomplished by dint of shrewd and persistentmanagement, in which Lincoln was a leading spirit. Mr. Robert L. Wilson,one of his colleagues, says: "When our bill to all appearance was deadbeyond resuscitation, and our friends could see no hope, Lincoln neverfor a moment despaired. Collecting his colleagues in his room forconsultation, his practical common-sense, his thorough knowledge ofhuman nature, made him an overmatch for his compeers, and for any man Ihave ever known."Lincoln's reputation as an orator was gradually extending beyond thecircle of his friends and constituents. He was gaining notice as a readyand forcible speaker, with shrewd and sensible ideas which he expressedwith striking originality and independence. He was invited to addressthe Young Men's Lyceum at Springfield, January 27, 1837, and read acarefully prepared paper on "The Perpetuation of Our PoliticalInstitutions," which was afterwards published in the Springfield"Weekly Journal." The address was crude and strained in style, but thefeeling pervading it was fervent and honest, and its patriotic sentimentand sound reflection made it effective for the occasion. A fewparagraphs culled from this paper, some of them containing remarkableprophetic passages, afford a clue to the stage of intellectualdevelopment which Lincoln had reached at the age of twenty-seven, and aninteresting contrast with the terser style of his later years.     In the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the     American people, find our account running under date of the     nineteenth century of the Christian era. We find ourselves in the     peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth, as regards     extent of territory, fertility of soil, and salubrity of climate.     We find ourselves under the government of a system of political     institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and     religious liberty than any of which the history of former times     tells us. We, when mounting the stage of existence, found ourselves     the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings. We toiled not     in the acquisition or establishment of them; they are a legacy     bequeathed us by a once hardy, brave and patriotic, but now     lamented and departed race of ancestors. Theirs was the task (and     nobly they performed it) to possess themselves, and, through     themselves, us, of this goodly land, and to uprear upon its hills     and valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights; 'tis     ours only to transmit these--the former unprofaned by the foot of     an invader, the latter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by     usurpation--to the latest generation that fate shall permit the     world to know. This task, gratitude to our fathers, justice to     ourselves, duty to posterity, all imperatively require us     faithfully to perform.     How, then, shall we perform it? At what point shall we expect the     approach of danger? Shall we expect some transatlantic military     giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the     armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure     of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a     Bonaparte for a commander, could not, by force, take a drink from     the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in a trial of a     thousand years! At what point, then, is the approach of danger to     be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, _it must spring up     amongst ourselves_. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be     our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation     of free men, we must live through all time, or die by suicide. I     hope I am not over-wary; but, if I am not, there is even now     something of ill-omen amongst us. I mean the increasing disregard     for law which pervades the country, the growing disposition to     substitute the wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober     judgment of the courts, and the worse than savage mobs for the     executive ministers of justice. This disposition is awfully fearful     in any community; and that it now exists in ours, though grating to     our feelings to admit it, it would be a violation of truth and an     insult to our intelligence to deny. Accounts of outrages committed     by mobs form the every-day news of the times. They have pervaded     the country from New England to Louisiana; they are neither     peculiar to the eternal snows of the former, nor the burning sun of     the latter. They are not the creature of climate; neither are they     confined to the slaveholding or non-slaveholding States. Alike they     spring up among the pleasure-hunting masters of Southern slaves and     the order-loving citizens of the land of steady habits. Whatever     their course may be, it is common to the whole country. Here, then,     is one point at which danger may be expected. The question recurs,     How shall we fortify against it? The answer is simple. Let every     American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to his     posterity, swear by the blood of the Revolution, never to violate     in the least particular the laws of the country, and never to     tolerate their violation by others. As the patriots of     'seventy-six' did to the support of the Declaration of     Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and the Laws     let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred     honor; let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample     on the blood of his father, and to tear the charter of his own and     his children's liberty. Let reverence for the laws be breathed by     every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap.     Let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges. Let it     be written in primers, spelling-books, and in almanacs. Let it be     preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and     enforced in courts of justice. And, in short, let it become the     political religion of the nation.During the years of Lincoln's service in the Illinois Legislature theDemocratic party was strongly dominant throughout the State. The feelingon the subject of slavery was decidedly in sympathy with the South. Alarge percentage of the settlers in the southern and middle portions ofIllinois were from States in which slave labor was maintained; andalthough the determination not to permit the institution to obtain afoothold in the new commonwealth was general, the people were opposed toany action which should affect its condition where it was alreadyestablished. During the sessions of 1836-7 resolutions of an extremepro-slavery character were carried through the Legislature by theDemocratic party, aiming to prevent the Abolitionists from obtaining afoothold in the State. Lincoln could not conscientiously support theresolutions, nor hold his peace concerning them. He did not shrink fromthe issue, but at the hazard of losing his political popularity and thegratifying prospects that were opening before him he drew up a protestagainst the pro-slavery enactment and had it entered upon the Journal ofthe House. The state of public opinion in Illinois at that time may bejudged by the fact that of the hundred Representatives in the House_only one_ had the courage to sign the protest with him. Lincoln'sprotest was as follows:     _March 3, 1837_.     The following protest, presented to the House, was read and ordered     to be spread on the journals, to wit:     Resolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having passed both     branches of the General Assembly at its present session, the     undersigned hereby protest against the passage of the same.     They believe that the institution of slavery is founded on both     injustice and bad policy; but that the promulgation of abolition     doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.     They believe that the Congress of the United States has no power,     under the Constitution, to interfere with the institution of     slavery in the different States.     They believe that the Congress of the United States has the power,     under the Constitution, to abolish slavery in the District of     Columbia, but that the power ought not to be exercised, unless at     the request of the people of the District.     The difference between these opinions and those contained in the     said resolutions, is their reason for entering this protest.     (Signed)     DAN STONE,     A. LINCOLN,     _Representatives from the County of Sangamon._The great financial panic which swept over the country in 1837 renderedexpedient an extra session of the Legislature, which was called togetherin July. General Lee D. Ewing had been elected to this session fromFayette County for the express purpose of repealing the law removing thecapital from Vandalia to Springfield. "General Ewing was," says Mr.Linder, "a man of considerable notoriety, popularity, and talents. Hehad been a member of Congress from Illinois, and had filled variousState offices in his time. He was a man of elegant manners, greatpersonal courage, and would grace either the _salons_ of fashion or theSenate chamber at Washington. The Legislature opened its special session(I was there as a spectator), and General Ewing sounded the tocsin ofwar. He said that 'the arrogance of Springfield, its presumption inclaiming the seat of government, was not to be endured; that the law hadbeen passed by chicanery and trickery; that the Springfield delegationhad sold out to the internal improvement men, and had promised theirsupport to every measure that would gain them a vote to the law removingthe seat of government.' He said many other things, cutting andsarcastic. Lincoln was chosen by his colleagues to reply to Ewing; andI want to say here that this was the first time that I began to conceivea very high opinion of the talents and personal courage of AbrahamLincoln. He retorted upon Ewing with great severity, denouncing hisinsinuations imputing corruption to him and his colleagues, and payingback with usury all that Ewing had said, when everybody thought andbelieved that he was digging his own grave; for it was known that Ewingwould not quietly pocket any insinuations that would degrade himpersonally. I recollect his reply to Lincoln well. After addressing theSpeaker, he turned to the Sangamon delegation, who all sat in the sameportion of the house, and said: 'Gentlemen, have you no other championthan this coarse and vulgar fellow to bring into the lists against me?Do you suppose that I will condescend to break a lance with your low andobscure colleague?' We were all very much alarmed for fear there wouldbe a personal conflict between Ewing and Lincoln. It was confidentlybelieved that a challenge must pass between them; but friends on bothsides took the matter in hand, and it was settled without anythingserious growing out of it."When the legislative session ended, in February, 1837, Lincoln returnedto a job of surveying which he had begun a year before at Petersburg,near his old home at Salem. He spent a month or two at Petersburg,completing the surveying and planning of the town. That his work waswell and satisfactorily done is attested by many--among them by Mr. JohnBennett, who lived in Petersburg at the time. "My earliest acquaintancewith Lincoln," says Mr. Bennett, "began on his return from Vandalia,where he had spent the winter as a member of the Legislature fromSangamon County. Lincoln spent most of the month of March in Petersburg,finishing up the survey and planning of the town he had commenced theyear before. I was a great deal in his company, and formed a highestimate of his worth and social qualities, which was strengthened bymany years of subsequent social intercourse and business transactions,finding him always strictly honest. In fact, he was now generally spokenof in this region as 'Honest Abe.' After Menard County was formed out ofa portion of Sangamon County, and the county seat established atPetersburg, Mr. Lincoln was a regular attendant at the courts. I wasthen keeping a hotel, and he was one of my regular customers. Here hemet many of his old cronies of his early days at Salem, and they spentthe most of the nights in telling stories or spinning long yarns, ofwhich Mr. Lincoln was particularly fond."CHAPTER IV     Lincoln's Removal to Springfield--A Lawyer without Clients or     Money--Early Discouragements--Proposes to Become a     Carpenter--"Stuart & Lincoln, Attorneys at Law"--"Riding the     Circuit"--Incidents of a Trip Round the Circuit--Pen Pictures of     Lincoln--Humane Traits--Kindness to Animals--Defending Fugitive     Slaves--Incidents in Lincoln's Life as a Lawyer--His Fondness for     Jokes and Stories.Lincoln's removal from New Salem to Springfield, where his more activelife as a lawyer began, occurred in April, 1837, soon after thecompletion of his survey work at Petersburg. The event was closelyconnected with the removal of the State capital from Vandalia toSpringfield, the law for which was passed at the legislative session of1836-7. As has been stated, Lincoln was a member of that Legislature andwas active in procuring the passage of the bill. The citizens ofSpringfield were very desirous of the removal of the capital to theirtown, and many of them were present at the session when the measure wasup for discussion. They had thus become acquainted with Lincoln; theywere favorably impressed as to his abilities and character, and pleasedwith his efforts in the matter in which they were so greatly interested.Through their influence and encouragement he chose Springfield as hisfuture home.Lincoln's first interview, after his arrival in Springfield, was withMr. Joshua F. Speed, with whom he already had a slight acquaintance, andwho details the circumstances of their meeting. "He had ridden intotown," says Mr. Speed, "on a borrowed horse, with no earthly propertysave a pair of saddle-bags containing a few clothes. I was a merchant atSpringfield, and kept a large country store, embracing dry goods,groceries, hardware, books, medicines, bed-clothes, mattresses,--infact, everything that country people needed. Lincoln came into the storewith his saddle-bags on his arm, and said he wanted to buy the fixingsfor a single bed. The mattresses, blankets, sheets, coverlid, andpillow, according to the figures made by me, would cost seventeendollars. He said that was perhaps cheap enough, but small as the sum washe was unable to pay it. But if I would credit him till Christmas andhis experiment as a lawyer was a success, he would pay then; adding, inthe saddest tone, 'If I fail in this, I do not know that I can ever payyou.' As I looked up at him I thought then, and think now, that I neversaw a sadder face. I said to him, 'You seem to be so much pained atcontracting so small a debt, I think I can suggest a plan by which youcan avoid the debt and at the same time attain your end. I have a largeroom with a double bed up-stairs which you are very welcome to sharewith me.' 'Where is your room?' said he. 'Up-stairs,' said I, pointingto a pair of winding stairs which led from the store to my room. He tookhis saddle-bags on his arm, went up-stairs, set them down on the floor,and came down with the most changed countenance. Beaming with pleasure,he exclaimed, 'Well, Speed, I'm moved!' Lincoln was then twenty-eightyears old. He was a lawyer without a client, with no money, all hisearthly wealth consisting of the clothes he wore and the contents of hissaddle-bags."Lincoln shared the same room with Mr. Speed during his early residencein Springfield, taking his meals with his companion at the house of Mr.William Butler, with whom he boarded for five years. His professionaladvancement at first was slow, and he had periods of greatdiscouragement. An old settler of Illinois, named Page Eaton, says: "Iknew Lincoln when he first came to Springfield. He was an awkward buthard-working young man. Everybody said he would never make a goodlawyer because he was too honest. He came to my shop one day, after hehad been here five or six months, and said he had a notion to quitstudying law and learn carpentering. He thought there was more need ofcarpenters out here than lawyers." Soon after Lincoln's settlement inSpringfield, he formed a law partnership with Major John T. Stuart, whomhe had known for some years and who already had a good position at thebar. This partnership began, according to the statement of Major Stuart,on April 27, 1837. It continued just four years, when it was dissolved,and Lincoln and Judge Stephen T. Logan became partners. This latterpartnership continued about two years, when, on September 20, 1843, thefirm of Lincoln & Herndon was formed, and it continued to the time ofLincoln's death.When Lincoln began to practice law, it was the custom in Illinois to"ride the circuit," a proceeding of which the older communities of theEast know nothing. The State of Illinois, for instance, is divided intoa number of districts, each composed of a number of counties, of which asingle judge, appointed or elected as the case may be, for that purpose,makes the circuit, holding courts at each county seat. Railroads beingscarce, the earlier circuit judges made their trips from county tocounty on horseback or in a gig; and the prominent lawyers living withinthe limits of the circuit made the tour of the circuit with the judge.It is said that when Lincoln first began to "ride the circuit" he wastoo poor to own a horse or vehicle, and was compelled to borrow from hisfriends. But in due time he became the proprietor of a horse, which hefed and groomed himself, and to which he was very much attached. On thisanimal he would set out from home, to be gone for weeks together, withno baggage but a pair of saddle-bags containing a change of linen, andan old cotton umbrella to shelter him from sun or rain. When he got alittle more of this world's goods he set up a one-horse buggy, a verysorry and shabby-looking affair which he generally used when the weatherpromised to be bad. The other lawyers were always glad to see him, andlandlords hailed his coming with pleasure; but he was one of thosegentle, uncomplaining men whom they would put off with indifferentaccommodations. It was a significant remark of a lawyer who wasthoroughly acquainted with his habits and disposition that "Lincoln wasnever seated next the landlord at a crowded table, and never got achicken-liver or the best cut from the roast." Lincoln once remarked toMr. Gillespie that he never felt his own unworthiness so much as when inthe presence of a hotel clerk or waiter. If rooms were scarce, and one,two, three, or four gentlemen were required to lodge together in orderto accommodate some surly man who "stood upon his rights," Lincoln wassure to be one of the unfortunates. Yet he loved the life of thecircuit, and never went home without reluctance.In describing the many experiences of the lawyers who travelled thecircuits at this period, Mr. Arnold says: "The State was settled with ahardy, fearless, honest, but very litigious population. The court-housewas sometimes framed and boarded, but more frequently it was built oflogs. The judge sat upon a raised platform behind a rough board,sometimes covered with green baize, for a table on which to write hisnotes. A small table stood on the floor in front for the clerk. In thecenter of the room was another larger table around which in rude chairsthe lawyers were grouped, too often with their feet on top of it. Roughbenches were placed there for the jury, the parties to the suit,witnesses and bystanders. The court-rooms were nearly always crowded forhere were rehearsed and acted the dramas, the tragedies, and thecomedies of real life. The court-house has always been a very attractiveplace to the people of the frontier. It supplied the place of theatres,lecture and concert rooms, and other places of interest and amusement inthe older settlements and towns. The leading lawyers and judges were thestar actors, and had each his partisans. Hence crowds attended thecourts to see the judges, to hear the lawyers contend, with argument andlaw and wit, for success, victory, and fame. The merits and ability ofthe leading advocates, their success or discomfiture in examining orcross-examining a witness, the ability of this or that one to obtain averdict, were canvassed at every cabin-raising, bee, or horse-race, andat every log-house and school in the county. Thus the lawyers werestimulated to the utmost exertion of their powers, not only bycontroversy and desire of success, but by the consciousness that theirefforts were watched with eagerness by friends, clients, partisans, orrivals. From one to another of these rude court-houses the gentlemen ofthe bar passed, following the judge around his circuits from county tocounty, travelling generally on horseback, with saddle-bags, brushes, anextra shirt or two, and perhaps two or three law books. Sometimes two orthree lawyers would unite and travel in a buggy, and the poorer andyounger ones not seldom walked. But a horse was not an unusual fee, andin those days when horse thieves as clients were but too common, it wasnot long before a young man of ability found himself well mounted."There was very great freedom in social intercourse. Manners were rude,but genial, kind, and friendly. Each was always ready to assist hisfellows, and selfishness was not tolerated. The relations between thebench and bar were familiar, free and easy. Flashes of wit and humor andrepartee were constantly exchanged. Such was the life upon which Lincolnnow entered; and there gathered with him around those pine tables of thefrontier court-house a very remarkable combination of men, men whowould have been leaders of the bar at Boston or New York, Philadelphiaor Washington; men who would have made their mark in Westminster Hall,or upon any English circuit. At the capital were John T. Stuart, StephenT. Logan, Edward D. Baker, Ninian W. Edwards, Josiah Lamborn, and manyothers. Among the leading lawyers from other parts of the State whopracticed in the Supreme and Federal Courts at the capital were StephenA. Douglas; Lyman Trumbull, for many years chairman of the judiciarycommittee of the United States Senate; O.H. Browning, Senator and memberof the Cabinet at Washington; William H. Bissell, Member of Congress,and Governor of the State; David Davis, justice of the Supreme Court,Senator and Vice-President of the United States; Justin Butterfield ofChicago, and many others almost or quite equally distinguished. This'circuit riding' involved all sorts of adventures. Hard fare atmiserable country taverns, sleeping on the floor, and fording streams,were every-day occurrences. All such occurrences were met with goodhumor and often turned into sources of frolic and fun. In fordingswollen streams, Lincoln was frequently sent forward as a scout orpioneer. His extremely long legs enabled him, by taking off his bootsand stockings, and by rolling up or otherwise disposing of his trousers,to test the depth of the stream, find the most shallow water, and thusto pilot the party through the current without wetting his garments."A gentleman who lived in one of the judicial circuits of Illinois inwhich Lincoln had an extensive though not very lucrative practice givessome graphic and interesting reminiscences. "The terms of the court wereheld quarterly and usually lasted about two weeks. They were alwaysseasons of great importance and much gayety in the little town that hadthe honor of being the county seat. Distinguished members of the barfrom surrounding and even from distant counties, ex-judges andex-Members of Congress, attended and were personally and many of thempopularly known to almost every adult, male and female, of the limitedpopulation. They came in by stages and on horseback. Among them the onewhose arrival was looked forward to with the most pleasurableanticipations, and whose possible absence--although he almost never wasabsent--was feared with the liveliest emotions of anxiety, was 'UncleAbe,' as he was lovingly called by us all. Sometimes he might happen tobe a day or two late. Then, as the Bloomington stage came in at sundown,the bench and bar, jurors and citizens, would gather in crowds at thehotel where he always put up, to give him a welcome if, happily, heshould arrive, and to experience the keenest feelings of disappointmentif he should not. If he arrived, as he alighted and stretched out bothhis long arms to shake hands with those nearest to him and with thosewho approached, his homely face handsome in its broad and sunshinysmile, his voice touching in its kindly and cheerful accents, everyonein his presence felt lighter in heart and more joyous. He brought lightwith him. He loved his fellow-men with all the strength of his greatnature, and those who came in contact with him could not helpreciprocating the love."Another old friend describes Lincoln as being at this time "very plainin his costume, as well as rather uncourtly in his address and generalappearance. His clothing was of home Kentucky jean, and the firstimpression made by his tall, lank figure upon those who saw him was notspecially prepossessing. He had not outgrown his hard backwoodsexperience, and showed no inclination to disguise or to cast behind himthe honest and manly though unpolished characteristics of his earlierdays. Never was a man further removed from all snobbish affectation. Aslittle was there, also, of the demagogue art of assuming an uncouthnessor rusticity of manner and outward habit with the mistaken notion ofthus securing particular favor as 'one of the masses.' He chose toappear then, as in all his later life, precisely what he was. Hisdeportment was unassuming, though without any awkwardness of reserve."Mr. Crane, an old settler of Tazewell County, says he used to seeLincoln when passing through Washington, in that county, on his way toattend court at Metamora; and he remembers him as "dressed in a homespuncoat that came below his knees and was out at both elbows."Lincoln's tenderness of heart was displayed in his treatment of animals,toward which he was often performing unusual acts of kindness. On oneoccasion, as Mr. Speed relates, Lincoln and the other members of theSpringfield bar had been attending court at Christiansburg, and Mr.Speed was riding with them toward Springfield. There was quite a partyof these lawyers, riding two by two along a country lane. Lincoln andJohn J. Hardin brought up the rear of the cavalcade. "We had passedthrough a thicket of wild plum and crab-apple trees," says Mr. Speed,"and stopped to water our horses. Hardin came up alone. 'Where isLincoln?' we inquired. 'Oh,' replied he, 'when I saw him last he hadcaught two young birds which the wind had blown out of their nests, andhe was hunting the nest to put them back.' In a short time Lincoln cameup, having found the nest and placed the young birds in it. The partylaughed at him; but he said, 'I could not have slept if I had notrestored those little birds to their mother.'"Again, as Dr. Holland narrates, "Lincoln was one day riding by a deepslough or pit in which, to his exceeding pain, he saw a pig struggling,and with such faint efforts that it was evident that he could notextricate himself. Lincoln looked at the pig and the mud that envelopedhim, and then looked ruefully at some new clothes in which he had but ashort time before enveloped himself. Deciding against the claims of thepig he rode on; but he could not get rid of the vision of the poorbrute, and at last, after riding two miles, he turned back, determinedto rescue the animal at the expense of his new clothes. Arrived at thespot, he tied his horse, and coolly went to work to build of old rails apassage to the bottom of the hole. Descending on these rails, he seizedthe pig and dragged him out, but not without serious damage to theclothes he wore. Washing his hands in the nearest brook and wiping themon the grass, he mounted his gig and rode along. He then fell toexamining the motive that sent him back to the release of the pig. Atthe first thought it seemed to be pure benevolence; but at length hecame to the conclusion that it was selfishness, for he certainly went tothe pig's relief in order (as he said to the friend to whom he relatedthe incident) to 'take a pain out of his own mind.'"Instances showing the integrity, candor, unselfishness, and humanity ofLincoln's conduct in his law practice could be multiplied indefinitely.The following are given by Dr. Holland: "The lawyers of Springfield,particularly those who had political aspirations, were afraid toundertake the defense of anyone who had been engaged in helping offfugitives slaves. It was a very unpopular business in those days and inthat locality; and few felt that they could afford to engage in it. Onewho needed such aid went to Edward D. Baker, and was refused, distinctlyand frankly on the ground that as a political man he could not affordit. The man applied to an ardent anti-slavery friend for advice. Hespoke of Mr. Lincoln, and said, 'He's not afraid of an unpopular case.When I go for a lawyer to defend an arrested fugitive slave, otherlawyers will refuse me. But if Mr. Lincoln is at home he will alwaystake my case.'"An old woman of seventy-five years, the widow of a revolutionarypensioner, came tottering into his law office one day, and told him thata certain pension agent had charged her the exorbitant fee of twohundred dollars for collecting her pension. Lincoln was satisfied byher representations that she had been swindled, and finding that she wasnot a resident of the town, and that she was poor, gave her money, andset about the work of procuring restitution. He immediately entered suitagainst the agent to recover a portion of his ill-gotten money. Thissuit was one of the most remarkable that Lincoln ever conducted. The daybefore the case came up he asked his partner, Mr. Herndon, to get him a"Life of Washington," and he spent the whole afternoon reading it. Hisspeech to the jury was long remembered. The whole court-room was intears as he closed with these words: "Gentlemen of the jury. Time rollsby. The heroes of '76 have passed away. They are encamped on the othershore. This soldier has gone to his rest, and now, crippled, blinded,and broken, his widow comes to you and to me, gentlemen of the jury, toright her wrongs. She was not always as you see her now. Once her stepwas elastic. Her face was fair. Her voice was as sweet as any that rangin the mountains of old Virginia. Now she is old. She is poor anddefenceless. Out here on the prairies of Illinois, hundreds of milesfrom the scenes of her childhood, she appeals to you and to me who enjoythe privileges achieved for us by the patriots of the Revolution for oursympathetic aid and manly protection. I have but one question to askyou, gentlemen of the jury. Shall we befriend her?" During the speechthe defendant sat huddled up in the court-room, writhing under the lashof Lincoln's tongue. The jury returned a verdict for every cent thatLincoln had asked. He became the old lady's surety for costs, paid herhotel bill and sent her home rejoicing. He made no charges for his ownor his partner's services. A few days afterwards Mr. Herndon picked up alittle scrap of paper in the office. He looked at it a moment, and burstinto a roar of laughter. It was Lincoln's notes for the argument of thiscase. They were unique:--"No contract--Not professionalservices--Unreasonable charges--Money retained by Deft not given byPl'ff.--Revolutionary War--Describe Valley Forge--Ice--Soldiers'bleeding feet--Pl'ff's husband--Soldiers leaving home for thearmy--_Skin Def't_--Close."In his Autobiography, Joseph Jefferson tells how he visited Springfieldwith a theatrical company in the early days (1839) and planned to open atheatrical season in that godly town. But "a religious revival was inprogress, and the fathers of the church not only launched forth againstus in their sermons, but got the city to pass a new law enjoining aheavy license against our 'unholy' calling. I forget the amount, but itwas large enough to be prohibitory." The company had begun the buildingof a new theatre; and naturally the situation was perplexing. In themidst of their trouble, says Mr. Jefferson, "a young lawyer called onthe Managers. He had heard of the injustice, and offered, if they wouldplace the matter in his hands, to have the license taken off,--declaringthat he only wanted to see fair play, and he would accept no fee whetherhe failed or succeeded. The case was brought up before the council. Theyoung lawyer began his harangue. He handled the subject with tact,skill, and humor, tracing the history of the drama from the time whenThespis acted in a cart, to the stage of to-day. He illustrated hisspeech with a number of anecdotes, and kept the council in a roar oflaughter. His good humor prevailed, and the exorbitant tax was takenoff. This young lawyer was very popular in Springfield, and was honoredand beloved by all who knew him; and after the time of which I write heheld rather an important position in the Government of the UnitedStates. He now lies buried in Springfield, under a monumentcommemorating his greatness and his virtues,--and his name was AbrahamLincoln."Judge Gillespie tells a good story, to the effect that Lincoln andGeneral U.P. Linder were once defending a man who was being tried on acriminal charge before Judge David Davis, who said at dinner-time thatthe case must be disposed of that night. Lincoln suggested that the bestthing they could do would be to run Benedict, the prosecuting attorney,as far into the night as possible, in hopes that he might, in his rage,commit some indiscretion that would help their case. Lincoln began, butto save his life he could not speak one hour, and the laboring oar fellinto Linder's hands. "But," said Lincoln, "he was equal to the occasion.He spoke most interestingly three mortal hours, about everything in theworld. He discussed Benedict from head to foot, and put in aboutthree-quarters of an hour on the subject of Benedict's whiskers."Lincoln said he never envied a man so much as he did Linder on thatoccasion. He thought he was inimitable in his capacity to talkinterestingly about everything and nothing, by the hour.But if Lincoln had not General Linder's art of "talking against time,"his wit often suggested some readier method of gaining advantage in acase. On one occasion, a suit was on trial in the Circuit Court ofSangamon County, in which Lincoln was attorney for the plaintiff, andMr. James C. Conkling, then a young man just entering practice, wasattorney for the defendant. It was a jury trial, and Lincoln waived theopening argument to the jury, leaving Mr. Conkling to sum up his casefor the defense. The latter spoke at considerable length, in asophomoric style, laboring under the impression that unless he made anextraordinary exertion to influence the jury he would be quite eclipsedby Lincoln in his closing speech. But he was completely taken back bythe unlooked-for light manner in which Lincoln treated the case in hisclosing. Lincoln proceeded to reply but, in doing so he talked onwithout making the slightest reference to the case on hearing or to theargument of Mr. Conkling. His summing-up to the jury was to thefollowing effect: "Gentlemen of the jury: In early days there lived inthis vicinity, over on the Sangamon river, an old Indian of the Kickapootribe by the name of Johnnie Kongapod. He had been taken in charge bysome good missionaries, converted to Christianity, and educated to suchextent that he could read and write. He took a great fancy to poetry andbecame somewhat of a poet himself. His desire was that after his deaththere should be placed at the head of his grave an epitaph, which heprepared himself, in rhyme, in the following words:     "'Here lies poor Johnnie Kongapod;       Have mercy on him, gracious God,       As he would do if he were God       And you were Johnnie Kongapod.'"Of course all this had no reference to the case, nor did Lincoln intendit should have any. It was merely his way of ridiculing the eloquence ofhis opponent. The verdict of the jury was for the plaintiff, as Lincolnexpected it would be; and this was the reason of his treating the caseas he did.A story somewhat similar to the above was told by the late Judge JohnPearson shortly before his death. In the February term, 1850, of theCircuit Court of Vermilion County, Illinois, a case was being tried inwhich a young lady had brought suit for 10,000 against a recreant loverwho had married another girl. The amount sued for was thought to be anenormous sum in those days, and the ablest talent to be found wasbrought into requisition by both sides. Richard Thompson and Daniel W.Voorhees were associated with O.L. Davis for the fair plaintiff. H.W.Beckwith, Ward Lamon, and Abraham Lincoln were for the defendant. Thelittle town of Danville was crowded with people from far and near whohad come to hear the big speeches. The evidence brought out in thetrial was in every way against the defendant, and the sympathy of thepublic was, naturally enough, with the young lady plaintiff. Lincoln andhis associate counsel plainly saw the hopelessness of their cause; andthey wisely concluded to let their side of the case stand upon itsmerits, without even a plea of extenuating circumstances. Voorhees wasyoung, ambitious, and anxious to display his oratory. He arranged withhis colleagues at the beginning that he should make a speech, and hespent several hours in his room at the hotel in the preparation of anoratorical avalanche. It became generally known that Dan was going toout-do himself, and the expectation of the community was at its highesttension. The little old court-house was crowded. The ladies were out infull force. Voorhees came in a little late, glowing with the excitementof the occasion. It had been arranged that Davis was to open, Lincolnwas to follow, and Voorhees should come next. Mr. Davis made a clearstatement of the case, recited the character of the evidence, and closedwith a plain logical argument. Then Lincoln arose, and stood in silencefor a moment, looking at the jury. He deliberately re-arranged some ofthe books and papers on the table before him, as though "making a goodready," as he used to say, and began in a spirited but deliberate way:"Your Honor, the evidence in this case is all in, and doubtless allconcerned comprehend its fullest import without the aid of furtherargument. Therefore we will rest our case here." This move, of course,cut off all future discussion. Voorhees, with his load of pyrotechnicswas shut out. An ominous silence followed Lincoln's remark; thenVoorhees arose, white with rage, and entered a protest against thetactics of the defense. All the others were disappointed, but amused,and the only consolation that Voorhees got out of this affair was averdict for the full amount claimed by his client. But he never forgaveLincoln for thus "nipping" his great speech "in the bud."Mr. Wickizer gives a story which illustrates the off-hand readiness ofLincoln's wit. "In the court at Bloomington Mr. Lincoln was engaged in acase of no great importance; but the attorney on the other side, Mr. S.,a young lawyer of fine abilities, was always very sensitive about beingbeaten, and in this case he manifested unusual zeal and interest. Thecase lasted until late at night, when it was finally submitted to thejury. Mr. S. spent a sleepless night in anxiety, and early next morninglearned, to his great chagrin, that he had lost the case. Mr. Lincolnmet him at the court-house and asked him what had become of his case.With lugubrious countenance and melancholy tone, Mr. S. said, 'It's goneto hell!' 'Oh, well!' replied Lincoln, 'Never mind,--you can try itagain there!'"Lincoln was always ready to join in a laugh at his own expense, and usedto tell the following story with intense enjoyment: "In the days when Iused to be 'on the circuit' I was accosted in the cars by a stranger whosaid, 'Excuse me, sir, but I have an article in my possession whichbelongs to you.' 'How is that?' I asked, considerably astonished. Thestranger took a jack-knife from his pocket. 'This knife,' said he, 'wasplaced in my hands some years ago with the injunction that I was to keepit until I found a man uglier than myself. I have carried it from thattime to this. Allow me to say, sir, that I think you are fairly entitledto the property.'"Mr. Gillespie says of Lincoln's passion for story-telling: "As a booncompanion, Lincoln, although he never drank liquor or used tobacco inany form, was without a rival. No one would ever think of 'putting in'when he was talking. He could illustrate any subject, it seemed to me,with an appropriate and amusing anecdote. He did not tell stories merelyfor the sake of telling them, but rather by way of illustration ofsomething that had happened or been said. There seemed to be no end tohis fund of stories." Mr. Lamon states: "Lincoln frequently said that helived by his humor and would have died without it. His manner of tellinga story was irresistibly comical, the fun of it dancing in his eyes andplaying over every feature. His face changed in an instant; the hardlines faded out of it, and the mirth seemed to diffuse itself all overhim like a spontaneous tickle. You could see it coming long before heopened his mouth, and he began to enjoy the 'point' before his eagerauditors could catch the faintest glimpse of it. Telling and hearingridiculous stories was one of his ruling passions." A good illustrationof this fondness for story-telling is given by Judge Sibley, of Quincy,Illinois, who knew Lincoln when practicing law at Springfield. One day aparty of lawyers were sitting in the law library of the court-house atSpringfield, awaiting the opening of court, and telling stories to fillthe time. Judge Breese of the Supreme bench--one of the mostdistinguished of American jurists, and a man of great personaldignity--passed through the room where the lawyers were sitting, on hisway to open court. Lincoln, seeing him, called out in his hearty way,"Hold on, Breese! Don't open court yet! Here's Bob Blackwell just goingto tell a new story!" The judge passed on without replying, evidentlyregarding it as beneath the dignity of the Supreme Court to delayproceedings for the sake of a story.CHAPTER V     Lincoln in the Legislature--Eight Consecutive Years of Service--His     Influence in the House--Leader of the Whig Party in Illinois--Takes     a Hand in National Politics--Presidential Election in 1840--A "Log     Cabin" Reminiscence--Some Memorable Political Encounters--A Tilt     with Douglas--Lincoln Facing a Mob--His Physical Courage--Lincoln     as a Duellist--The Affair with General Shields--An Eye-Witness'     Account of the Duel--Courtship and Marriage.In 1838 Lincoln was for a third time a candidate for the StateLegislature. Mr. Wilson, one of his colleagues from Sangamon County,states that a question of the division of the county was one of thelocal issues. "Mr. Lincoln and myself," says Mr. Wilson, "among othersresiding in the portion of the county which sought to be organized intoa new county, opposed the division; and it became necessary that Ishould make a special canvass through the northwest part of the county,then known as Sand Ridge. I made the canvass. Mr. Lincoln accompaniedme, and being personally acquainted with everyone we called at nearlyevery house. At that time it was the universal custom to keep somewhiskey in the house for private use and to treat friends. The subjectwas always mentioned as a matter of politeness, but with the usualremark to Mr. Lincoln, 'We know you never drink, but maybe your friendwould like to take a little.' I never saw Mr. Lincoln drink. He oftentold me he never drank; had no desire for drink, nor for thecompanionship of drinking men."The result of this canvass was that Lincoln was elected to theLegislature for the session of 1838-39. The next year he was electedfor the session of 1840-41. This ended his legislative service, whichcomprised eight consecutive years, from 1834 to 1841. In these latersessions he was as active and prominent in the House as he had been inthe earlier times when a member from New Salem.Lincoln's faculty for getting the better of an adversary by an aptillustration or anecdote was seldom better shown than by an incidentwhich occurred during his last term in the Legislature. Hon. James C.Conkling has given the following graphic description of the scene: "Agentleman who had formerly been Attorney-General of the State was also amember. Presuming upon his age, experience, and former officialposition, he thought it incumbent upon himself to oppose Lincoln, whowas then one of the acknowledged leaders of his party. He at lengthattracted the attention of Lincoln, who replied to his remarks, tellingone of his humorous anecdotes and making a personal application to hisopponent which placed the latter in such a ridiculous attitude that itconvulsed the whole House. All business was suspended. In vain theSpeaker rapped with his gavel. Members of all parties, withoutdistinction, were compelled to laugh. They not only laughed, theyscreamed and yelled; they thumped upon the floor with their canes; theyclapped their hands and threw up their hats; they shouted and twistedthemselves into all sorts of contortions, until their sides ached andthe tears rolled down their cheeks. One paroxysm passed away, but wasspeedily succeeded by another, and again they laughed and screamed andyelled. Another lull occurred, and still another paroxysm, until theyseemed to be perfectly exhausted. The ambition of Lincoln's opponent wasabundantly gratified, and for the remainder of the session he lapsedinto profound obscurity."In June, 1842, ex-President Van Buren was journeying through Illinoiswith a company of friends. When near Springfield they were delayed bybad roads, and were compelled to spend the night at Rochester, somemiles out. The accommodations at this place were very poor, and a few ofthe ex-President's Springfield friends proposed to go out to meet himand try to aid in entertaining him. Knowing Lincoln's ability as atalker and story-teller, they begged him to go with them and aid inmaking their guest at the country inn pass the evening as pleasantly aspossible. Lincoln, with his usual good nature, went with them, andentertained the party for hours with graphic descriptions of Westernlife, anecdotes and witty stories. Judge Peck, who was of the party, anda warm friend of the ex-President, says that Lincoln was at his best.There was a constant succession of brilliant anecdotes and funnystories, accompanied by loud laughter in which Van Buren took his fullshare. "He also," says the Judge, "gave us incidents and anecdotes ofElisha Williams, and other leading members of the New York bar, goingback to the days of Hamilton and Burr. Altogether there was a rightmerry time. Mr. Van Buren said the only drawback upon his enjoyment wasthat his sides were sore from laughing at Lincoln's stories for a weekthereafter."Lincoln's eight years of legislative service had given him considerablereputation in politics, and he had become the acknowledged leader of theWhig party in Illinois. In the exciting Presidential campaign of 1840,known as the "Log Cabin" campaign, he took a very active part. He hadbeen nominated as Presidential Elector on the Harrison ticket, andstumped a large portion of the State. A peculiarly interestingreminiscence of Lincoln's appearance on one occasion during the "LogCabin" campaign is furnished by Mr. G.W. Harris, who says: "In the fallof the year 1840 there came into the log school-house in a village inSouthern Illinois where I, a lad, was a pupil, a tall, awkward,plain-looking young man dressed in a full suit of 'blue jean.'Approaching the master, he gave his name, and, apologizing for theintrusion, said, 'I am told you have a copy of Byron's works. I wouldlike to borrow it for a few hours.' The book was produced and loaned tohim. With his thanks and a 'Good-day' to the teacher, and a smile suchas I have never seen on any other man's face and a look that took in allof us lads and lassies, the stranger passed out of the room. This wasduring a Presidential canvass. Isaac Walker, candidate for DemocraticElector, and Abraham Lincoln, candidate for Whig Elector, were byappointment to discuss political matters in the afternoon of that day. Iasked for and got a half-holiday. I had given no thought to the matteruntil the appearance of Lincoln (for he it was) in the school-room. But,something in the man had aroused, not only in me but in others of thescholars, a strong desire to see him again and to hear him speak. IsaacWalker in his younger days had been a resident of the village. Lincolnwas aware of this, and shrewdly suspected that Walker in his remarkswould allude to the circumstance; so, having the opening speech, hedetermined to 'take the wind out of his sails.' He did so--howeffectually, it is hardly necessary for me to say. He had borrowedByron's works to read the opening lines of 'Lara':    "He, their unhoped, but unforgotten lord,    The long self-exiled chieftain, is restored.    There be bright faces in the busy hall,    Bowls on the board, and banners on the wall;           *       *       *       *       *    "He comes at last in sudden loneliness,    And whence they know not, why they need not guess;    They more might marvel, when the greeting's o'er,    Not that he came, but came not long before."During this period Lincoln continued to enjoy the hospitality of Mr.Speed at Springfield. "After he made his home with me," says Mr. Speed,"on every winter's night at my store, by a big wood fire, no matter howinclement the weather, eight or ten choice spirits assembled, withoutdistinction of party. It was a sort of social club without organization.They came there because they were sure to find Lincoln. His habit was toengage in conversation upon any and all subjects except politics. Butone evening a political argument sprang up between Lincoln and Douglas,which for a time ran high. Douglas sprang to his feet and said:'Gentlemen, this is no place to talk politics; we will discuss thequestions publicly with you.'" A few days later the Whigs held a meetingand challenged the Democrats to a joint debate. The challenge wasaccepted. Douglas, Lamborn, Calhoun, and Jesse Thomas were deputed bythe Democrats to meet Logan, Baker, Browning, and Lincoln on the part ofthe Whigs. The intellectual encounter between these noted champions isstill described by those who witnessed it as "the great debate." It tookplace in the Second Presbyterian church at Springfield, and lasted eightnights, each speaker occupying a night in turn. Mr. Speed speaks thus ofLincoln's effort: "Lincoln delivered his speech without manuscript ornotes. He had a wonderful faculty in that way. He might be writing animportant document, be interrupted in the midst of a sentence, turn hisattention to other matters entirely foreign to the subject on which hewas engaged, and then take up his pen and begin where he left offwithout reading the previous part of the sentence. He could grasp,exhaust, and quit any subject with more facility than any man I haveever seen or heard of." The subjoined paragraphs from the speech abovereferred to show the impassioned feeling which Lincoln poured forth thatnight. Those familiar with his admirable style in his later years wouldscarcely recognize him in these florid and rather over-weighted periods:     Many free countries have lost their liberty, and ours may lose     hers; but if she shall, be it my proudest plume, not that I was     the last to desert, but that I never deserted her. I know that the     great volcano at Washington, aroused and directed by the evil     spirit that reigns there, is belching forth the lava of political     corruption in a current broad and deep, which is sweeping with     frightful velocity over the whole length and breadth of the land,     bidding fair to leave unscathed no green spot or living thing;     while on its bosom are riding, like demons on the waves of hell,     the imps of the Evil Spirit, and fiendishly torturing and taunting     all those who dare resist its destroying course with the     hopelessness of their effort; and knowing this, I cannot deny that     all may be swept away. Broken by it, I too may be; bow to it, I     never will. The probability that we may fall in the struggle ought     not to deter us from the support of a cause which we deem to be     just. It shall not deter me. If I ever feel the soul within me     elevate and expand to those dimensions not wholly unworthy of its     Almighty architect, it is when I contemplate the cause of my     country deserted by all the world beside, and I, standing up boldly     and alone, hurling defiance at her victorious oppressors. And here,     without contemplating consequences, before high Heaven and in the     face of the whole world, I swear eternal fidelity to the just     cause, as I deem it, of the land of my life, my liberty, and my     love. And who that thinks with me will not fearlessly adopt the     oath I take? Let none falter who thinks he is right, and we may     succeed. But if, after all, we shall fail, be it so. We shall have     the proud consolation of saying to our conscience and to the     departed shade of our country's freedom, that the cause approved by     our judgments and adored by our hearts in disaster, in chains, in     torture, and in death, we never failed in defending.In this canvass Lincoln came again into collision with Douglas, theadversary whom he had met two years before and with whom he was tosustain an almost life-long political conflict. He also had occasion toshow his courage and presence of mind in rescuing from a mob hisdistinguished friend, Col. E.D. Baker, afterwards a Senator of theUnited States. "Baker was speaking in a large room," says Mr. Arnold,"rented and used for the court sessions, and Lincoln's office was in anapartment over the court-room, communicating with it by a trap-door.Lincoln was in his office listening to Baker through the open trap-door,when Baker, becoming excited, abused the Democrats, many of whom werepresent. A cry was raised, 'Pull him off the stand!' The instant Lincolnheard the cry, knowing a general fight was imminent, his athletic formwas seen descending from above through the opening of the trap-door,and, springing to the side of Baker, and waving his hand for silence, hesaid with dignity: 'Gentlemen, let us not disgrace the age and countryin which we live. This is a land where freedom of speech is guaranteed.Baker has a right to speak. I am here to protect him, and no man shalltake him from this stand if I can prevent it.' Quiet was restored, andBaker finished his speech without further interruption."A similar occurrence, happening about the same period, is detailed byGeneral Linder: "On a later occasion, when Colonel Baker and myself wereboth battling together in the Whig cause, at a convention held inSpringfield, I made a speech at the State House, which I think now,looking back at it from this point, was the very best I ever made in mylife. While I was addressing the vast assembly some ruffian in thegalleries flung at me a gross personal insult accompanied with a threat.Lincoln and Colonel Baker, who were both present and were warm personaland political friends of mine, anticipating that I might be attackedwhen I left the State House, came upon the stand a little while before Iconcluded my speech and took their station on each side of me. When Iwas through, and after my audience had greeted me with three heartycheers, each took one of my arms, and Lincoln said to me: 'Linder, Bakerand I are apprehensive that you may be attacked by some of thoseruffians who insulted you from the galleries, and we have come up toescort you to your hotel. We both think we can do a little fighting, sowe want you to walk between us until we get you to your hotel. Yourquarrel is our quarrel and that of the great Whig party of this nation.Your speech upon this occasion is the greatest that has been made by anyof us, for which we wish to honor and defend you.' This I consider noordinary compliment, coming from Lincoln, for he was no flatterer nordisposed to bestow praise where it was undeserved. Colonel Bakerheartily concurred in all he said, and between those two glorious men Ileft the stand and we marched out of the State House through ourfriends, who trooped after us evidently anticipating what Lincoln andBaker had suggested to me, accompanying us to my hotel."That Lincoln had an abundance of physical courage, and was well able todefend himself when necessity demanded, is clear from the incidents justgiven. Mr. Herndon, his intimate friend, adds his testimony on thispoint. As Lincoln was grand in his good nature, says Mr. Herndon, so hewas grand in his rage. "Once I saw him incensed at a judge for giving anunfair decision. It was a terrible spectacle. At another time I saw twomen come to blows in his presence. He picked them up separately andtossed them apart like a couple of kittens. He was the strongest man Iever knew, and has been known to lift a man of his own weight and throwhim over a worm fence. Once in Springfield the Irish voters meditatedtaking possession of the polls. News came down the street that theywould permit nobody to vote but those of their own party. Mr. Lincolnseized an axe-handle from a hardware store and went alone to open a wayto the ballot-box. His appearance intimidated them, and we had neitherthreats nor collisions all that day."An unsuspected side of Lincoln's character was shown, at this period ofhis life, in the affair with General Shields. With all his gentlenessand his scrupulous regard for the rights of others, Lincoln was not oneto submit to being bullied; while his physical courage had been provedin many a rough--and--tumble encounter, often against heavy odds, withthe rude and boisterous spirits of his time. These encounters wereusually with nature's weapons; but in the Shields affair--duel, it wassometimes called--he showed that he would not shrink from the use ofmore deadly weapons if forced to do so. In judging this phase of hischaracter, account must be taken of his Kentucky birth and origin, andof the customs and standards of his time. James Shields (afterwards adistinguished Union General and U.S. Senator) was at this time (1842)living at Springfield, holding the office of State Auditor. He isdescribed as "a gallant, hot-headed bachelor, from Tyrone County,Ireland." He was something of a beau in society, and was the subject ofsome satirical articles which, in a spirit of fun, Miss Mary Todd(afterwards Mrs. Lincoln) had written and published in a local journal.Shields was furious, and, demanding the name of the writer, Lincoln senthim word that he would assume full responsibility in the matter. Achallenge to a duel followed, which Lincoln accepted and namedbroadswords as the weapons. General Linder states that Lincoln said tohim that he did not want to kill Shields, and felt sure he could disarmhim if they fought with broadswords, while he felt sure Shields wouldkill him if pistols were the weapons. It seems that Lincoln actuallytook lessons in broadsword exercise from a Major Duncan; and at theappointed time all parties proceeded to the chosen field, near Alton.But friends appeared on the scene while the preliminaries were beingarranged, and succeeded in effecting a reconciliation. Major Lucas, ofSpringfield, who was on the field, stated that he "had no doubt Lincolnmeant to fight. Lincoln was no coward, and he would unquestionably haveheld his own against his antagonist, for he was a powerful man and wellskilled in the use of the broadsword. Lincoln said to me, after theaffair was all over, 'I could have split him in two.'" But there can belittle doubt that he was well pleased that the affair proved abloodless one.The mention of Miss Mary Todd, in the preceding paragraph, brings us toLincoln's marriage with that lady, which occurred in 1842, he being thenin his thirty--fourth year. Miss Todd was the daughter of the Hon.Robert T. Todd, of Lexington, Kentucky. She came to Springfield in 1839,to live with her sister, Mrs. Ninian W. Edwards. "She was young," saysMr. Lamon, "just twenty-one,--her family was of the best and herconnections in Illinois among the most refined and distinguished people.Her mother having died when she was a little girl, she had been educatedunder the care of a French lady. She was gifted with rare talents, had akeen sense of the ridiculous, a ready insight into the weaknesses ofindividual character, and a most fiery and ungovernable temper. Hertongue and her pen were equally sharp. Highbred, proud, brilliant,witty, and with a will that bent every one else to her purpose, she tookLincoln captive. He was a rising politician, fresh from the people, andpossessed of great power among them. Miss Todd was of aristocratic anddistinguished family, able to lead through the awful portals of 'goodsociety' whomsoever they chose to countenance. It was thought that aunion between them could not fail of numerous benefits to both parties.Mr. Edwards thought so; Mrs. Edwards thought so; and it was not longbefore Mary Todd herself thought so. She was very ambitious, and evenbefore she left Kentucky announced her belief that she was destined tobe the wife of some future President. For a while she was courted byDouglas as well as by Lincoln. Being asked which of them she intended tohave, she answered, 'The one that has the best chance of beingPresident.' She decided in favor of Lincoln; and in the opinion of someof her husband's friends she aided to no small extent in the fulfilmentof the prophecy which the bestowal of her hand implied." Mrs. Edwards,Miss Todd's sister, has related that "Lincoln was charmed with Mary'swit and fascinated with her quick sagacity, her will, her nature andculture. I have happened in the room," she says, "where they weresitting, often and often, and Mary led the conversation. Lincoln wouldlisten, and gaze on her as if drawn by some superior power--irresistiblyso. He listened, but seldom said a word."Preparations were made for the marriage between Lincoln and Miss Todd.But they were interrupted by a painful occurrence--a sudden breaking outof a fit of melancholy, or temporary insanity, such as had afflictedLincoln on a former occasion. This event has been made the subject of nolittle gossip, into which it is not now necessary or desirable to go,further than to mention that at about this time Lincoln seems to haveformed a strong attachment for Miss Matilda Edwards, a sister of NinianW. Edwards; and that the engagement with Miss Todd was for a time brokenoff. In consequence of these complications, Lincoln's health wasseriously affected. He suffered from melancholy, which was so profoundthat "his friends were alarmed for his life." His intimate companion,Mr. Speed, endeavored to rescue him from the terrible depression, urgingthat he would die unless he rallied. Lincoln replied, "I am not afraidto die, and would be more than willing. But I have an irrepressibledesire to live till I can be assured that the world is a little betterfor my having been in it."Mr. Herndon gives as his opinion that Lincoln's insanity grew out of amost extraordinary complication of feelings--aversion to the marriageproposed, a counter--attachment to Miss Edwards, and a revival of histenderness for the memory of Anne Rutledge. At all events, hisderangement was nearly if not quite complete. "We had to remove razorsfrom his room," says Mr. Speed, "take away all knives, and otherdangerous things. It was terrible." Mr. Speed determined to do for himwhat Bowlin Greene had done on a similar occasion at New Salem. Havingsold out his store on the first of January,1841, he took Lincoln with him to his home in Kentucky and kept himthere during most of the summer and fall, or until he seemedsufficiently restored to be given his liberty again, when he was broughtback to Springfield. His health was soon regained, and on the 4th ofNovember, 1842, the marriage between him and Miss Todd was celebratedaccording to the rites of the Episcopal Church. After the marriageLincoln secured pleasant rooms for himself and wife at the Globe Tavern,at a cost of four dollars a week. In 1844 he purchased of the Rev.Nathan Dressar the plain dwelling which was his home for the ensuingseventeen years, and which he left in 1861 to enter the White House.CHAPTER VI     Lincoln in National Politics--His Congressional     Aspirations--Law-Partnership of Lincoln and Herndon--The     Presidential Campaign of 1844--Visit to Henry Clay--Lincoln Elected     to Congress--Congressional Reputation--Acquaintance with     Distinguished Men--First Speech in Congress--"Getting the Hang" of     the House--Lincoln's Course on the Mexican War--Notable Speech in     Congress--Ridicule of General Cass--Bill for the Abolition of     Slavery--Delegate to the Whig National Convention of 1848--Stumping     the Country for Taylor--Advice to Young Politicians--"Old Abe"--A     Political Disappointment--Lincoln's Appearance as an Office Seeker     in Washington--"A Divinity that Shapes our Ends."In the spring of 1843 Lincoln was among the nominees proposed torepresent the Sangamon district in Congress; but Col. Edward D. Bakercarried the delegation, and was elected. In writing to his friend Speed,Lincoln treated the circumstance with his usual humor. "We had," hesays, "a meeting of the Whigs of the county here last Monday to appointdelegates to a district convention. Baker beat me, and got thedelegation instructed to go for him. The meeting, in spite of my attemptto decline it, appointed me one of the delegates; so that in gettingBaker the nomination I shall be 'fixed' a good deal like a fellow who ismade groomsman to the man who 'cut him out' and is marrying his owngirl."On the 20th of September, 1843, the partnership between Lincoln andJudge Logan was dissolved; and the same day a new association was formedwith William H. Herndon, a relative of one of Lincoln's former friendsof Clary Grove. It is said that in spite of their close friendship Mr.Herndon could not understand it when Lincoln one day plunged up theoffice stairs and said, "Herndon, should you like to be my partner?""Don't laugh at me, Mr. Lincoln," was the response. Persistentrepetition of the question could hardly gain a hearing; but at last Mr.Herndon said: "Mr. Lincoln, you know I am too young, and I have nostanding and no money; but if you are in earnest, there is nothing inthis world that would make me so happy." Nothing more was said till thepapers were brought to Herndon to sign. The partnership of "Lincoln &Herndon" was a happy one, and continued until Lincoln became President,a period of nearly eighteen years.The life of Henry Clay, which Lincoln read in his boyhood, had filledhim with enthusiasm for the great Whig leader; and when the latter wasnominated for the Presidency, in 1844, there was no more earnestadherent of his cause than the "Sangamon Chief," as Lincoln was nowcalled. Lincoln canvassed Illinois and a part of Indiana during thecampaign, meeting the chief Democratic speakers, and especially Douglas,in debate. Lincoln had not at this time heard the "silvery-tonguedorator" of Kentucky; but two years later the opportunity was affordedand eagerly embraced. It is possible, as Dr. Holland remarks, that he"needed the influence of this visit to restore a healthy tone to hisfeelings, and to teach him that the person whom his imagination hadtransformed into a demigod was only a man, possessing the full measureof weaknesses common to men. In 1846 Lincoln learned that Clay was todeliver a speech at Lexington, Kentucky, in favor of gradualemancipation. This event seemed to give him an excuse for breaking awayfrom his business and satisfying his desire to look his demigod in theface and hear the music of his eloquence. He accordingly went toLexington, and arrived there in time to attend the meeting. On returningto his home from this visit he did not attempt to disguise hisdisappointment. Clay's speech was written and read; it lacked entirelythe fire and eloquence which Lincoln had anticipated. At the close ofthe meeting Lincoln secured an introduction to the great orator and asClay knew what a friend Lincoln had been to him, he invited his admirerand partisan to Ashland. No invitation could have delighted Lincolnmore. But the result of his private intercourse with Clay was no moresatisfactory than that which followed the speech. Those who have knownboth men will not wonder at this; for two men could hardly be moreunlike in their motives and manners than the two thus brought together.One was a proud man; the other was a humble man. One was princely in hisbearing; the other was lowly. One was distant and dignified; the otherwas as simple and approachable as a child. One received the deference ofmen as his due; the other received it with an uncomfortable sense of hisunworthiness. A friend of Lincoln, who had a long conversation with himafter his return from Ashland, found that his old enthusiasm was gone.Lincoln said that though Clay was polished in his manners, and veryhospitable, he betrayed a consciousness of superiority that none couldmistake."For two years after the Presidential contest between Clay and Polk,Lincoln devoted himself assiduously to his law practice. But in 1846 hewas again active in politics, this time striving for a seat in theNational Congress. His chief opponent among the Whig candidates was hisold friend John J. Hardin, who soon withdrew from the contest, leavingMr. Lincoln alone in the field. The candidate on the Democratic ticketwas Peter Cartwright, the famous Methodist preacher. It was supposedfrom his great popularity as a pulpit orator that Mr. Cartwright wouldrun far ahead of his ticket. Instead of this, Lincoln received amajority of 1,511 in his district, which in 1844 had given Clay amajority of only 914 and in 1848 had allowed the Whig candidate forCongress to be defeated by 106 votes.Lincoln took his seat in the Thirtieth Congress in December, 1847, theonly Whig member from Illinois. Among the notable members of thisCongress were ex-president John Quincy Adams; Andrew Johnson, electedVice-President with Lincoln on his second election; A.H. Stephens,afterwards Vice-President of the Confederacy; Toombs, Rhett, Cobb, andothers who afterwards became leaders of the Rebellion. In the Senatewere Daniel Webster, Simon Cameron, Lewis Cass, Mason, Hunter, John C.Calhoun, and Jefferson Davis.Lincoln entered Congress as the Illinois leader of the Whig party. Hewas reputed to be an able and effective speaker. In speaking of theimpression he made upon his associates, the Hon. Robert C. Winthropsays: "I recall vividly the impressions I then formed both of hisability and amiability. We were old Whigs together, and agreed entirelyupon all questions of public interest. I could not always concur in thepolicy of the party which made him President, but I never lost mypersonal regard for him. For shrewdness, sagacity, and keen practicalsense, he has had no superior in our day or generation."Alexander H. Stephens, writing seventeen years after Lincoln's death,recalled their service together in Congress. "I knew Mr. Lincoln welland intimately," said Mr. Stephens. "We both were ardent supporters ofGeneral Taylor for President in 1848. Lincoln, Toombs, Preston, myself,and others, formed the first Congressional Taylor Club, known as 'TheYoung Indians,' and organized the Taylor movement which resulted in hisnomination. Mr. Lincoln was careless as to his manners and awkward inhis speech, but possessed a strong, clear, vigorous mind. He alwaysattracted and riveted the attention of the House when he spoke. Hismanner of speech as well as of thought was original. He had no model. Hewas a man of strong convictions, and what Carlyle would have called an_earnest_ man. He abounded in anecdote. He illustrated everything hewas talking about by an anecdote, always exceedingly apt and pointed;and socially he always kept his company in a roar of laughter."Alluding to his first speech in Congress--on some post-office questionof no special interest--Lincoln wrote to his friend Herndon that hisprincipal object was to "get the hang of the House"; adding that he"found speaking here and elsewhere about the same thing. I was about asbadly scared as when I spoke in court, but no more so."Lincoln's mental power, as well as his self-confidence, developedrapidly under the responsibilities of his new position. During his termof service in the House he was zealous in the performance of his duties,alert to seize every opportunity to strike a blow for his party andacquit himself to the satisfaction of his constituents. In January,1848, he made a telling speech in support of the "Spot Resolutions," inwhich his antagonism to the course of the Administration in regard tothe war on Mexico was uncompromisingly announced. These resolutions wereoffered for the purpose of getting from President Polk a statement offacts regarding the beginning of the war. In this speech Lincoln warnedthe President not to try to "escape scrutiny by fixing the public gazeupon the exceeding brightness of military glory--that attractive rainbowthat rises in showers of blood, that serpent's eye that charms but todestroy." In writing, a few days after the delivery of this speech, toMr. Herndon, Lincoln said: "I will stake my life that if you had been inmy place you would have voted just as I did. Would you have voted whatyou felt and knew to be a lie? I know you would not. Would you have goneout of the House--skulked the vote? I expect not. If you had skulked onevote you would have had to skulk many more before the end of thesession. Richardson's resolutions, introduced before I made any move orgave any vote upon the subject, make a direct question of the justiceof the war; so no man can be silent if he would. You are compelled tospeak; and your only alternative is to tell the _truth_ or tell a _lie_.I cannot doubt which you would do."Lincoln's position on the Mexican War has been generally approved by themoral sense of the country; but it gave his political enemies anopportunity, which they were not slow to improve, for trying to makepolitical capital out of it and using it to create a prejudice againsthim. Douglas in particular never missed an opportunity of referring toit. In the great joint debate in 1858 he spoke of Lincoln's having"distinguished himself in Congress by his opposition to the Mexican War,taking the side of the common enemy against his own country." No betterrefutation of these oft-repeated charges could be made than that givenby Lincoln himself on this occasion. "The Judge charges me," he said,"with having, while in Congress, opposed our soldiers who were fightingin the Mexican War. I will tell you what he can prove by referring tothe record. You remember I was an old Whig; and whenever the Democraticparty tried to get me to vote that _the war had been righteously begun_by the President, I would not do it. But whenever they asked for anymoney or land-warrants, or anything to pay the soldiers, I gave _thesame vote that Judge Douglas did_. Such is the truth, and the Judge hasa right to make all he can out of it."The most ambitious utterance of Lincoln during this term in Congress wasthat of July 27, 1848, when he took for his subject the verycomprehensive one of "The Presidency and General Politics." It was apiece of sound and forcible argumentation, relieved by strong andeffective imagery and quiet humor. A considerable portion of it wasoccupied with an exposure of the weaknesses of General Cass, thePresidential candidate opposed to General Taylor. Lincoln ridiculed Casswith all the wit at his command. An extract from this speech hasalready been quoted in this work, in the account of Lincoln in the BlackHawk War. Another passage, equally telling, relates to the vacillatingaction of General Cass on the Wilmot Proviso. After citing a number offacts in reference to the case, Lincoln says: "These extracts show thatin 1846 General Cass was for the Proviso _at once_; that in March, 1847,he was still for it, _but not just then_; and that in December, 1847, hewas _against it_ altogether. This is a true index to the whole man. Whenthe question was raised, in 1846, he was in a blustering hurry to takeground for it. He sought to be in advance, and to avoid theuninteresting position of a mere follower. But soon he began to seeglimpses of the great Democratic ox-gad waving in his face, and to hearindistinctly a voice saying, 'Back! Back, sir! Back a little!' He shakeshis head and bats his eyes and blunders back to his position of March,1847. But still the gad waves, and the voice grows more distinct andsharper still, 'Back, sir! Back, I say! Further back!' And back he goesto the position of December, 1847, at which the gad is still and thevoice soothingly says, 'So! Stand still at that!'"Again, after extended comment on the extra charges of General Cass uponthe Treasury for military services, he continued in a still moresarcastic vein: "But I have introduced General Cass's accounts herechiefly to show the wonderful physical capacities of the man. They showthat he not only did the labor of several men _at the same time_, butthat he often did it _at several places_ many hundred miles apart _atthe same time_. And at eating, too, his capacities are shown to be quiteas wonderful. From October, 1821, to May, 1822, he ate ten rations a dayin Michigan, ten rations a day here in Washington, and near fivedollars' worth a day besides, partly on the road between the two places.And then there is an important discovery in his example--the art ofbeing paid for what one eats, instead of having to pay for it.Hereafter if any nice young man shall owe a bill which he cannot pay inany other way he can just board it out. Mr. Speaker, we have all heardof the animal standing in doubt between two stacks of hay and starvingto death. The like of that would never happen to General Cass. Place thestacks a thousand miles apart, he would stand stock-still midway betweenthem and eat them _both at once;_ and the green grass along the linewould be apt to suffer some, too, at the same time. By all means makehim President, gentlemen. He will feed you bounteously--if--if--there isany left after he shall have helped himself."Lincoln's most important act in the Congress of 1848-9 was theintroduction of a bill for the gradual abolition of slavery in theDistrict of Columbia. But the state of feeling on the subject ofemancipation was so feverish at the time that the bill could not even begot before the House.The Whig National Convention met at Philadelphia the first of June, tonominate a candidate for the Presidency. Lincoln attended the Conventionas a delegate from Illinois. During the campaign of 1848 he laboredearnestly for the election of General Taylor. This campaign made himknown more generally throughout the country, as he spoke in New York andNew England as well as in Illinois and the West.While in Washington, Lincoln kept up a free correspondence with hisfriend and law-partner Herndon, which affords many interesting glimpsesof his thoughts and views. In one of these letters, endeavoring toincite Herndon to political ambition, he wrote: "Nothing could afford memore satisfaction than to learn that you and others of my young friendsat home were doing battle in the contest, endearing themselves to thepeople and taking a stand far above any I have ever been able to reachin their admiration. I cannot conceive that other old men feeldifferently. Of course, I cannot demonstrate what I say; but I was youngonce, and I am sure I was never ungenerously thrust back. The way for ayoung man to rise is to improve himself in every way he can, neversuspecting that anybody wishes to hinder him. Allow me to assure youthat suspicion and jealousy never did help any man in any situation.There may sometimes be ungenerous attempts to keep a young man down; andthey will succeed, too, if he allows his mind to be diverted from itstrue channel, to brood over the attempted injury. Cast about and see ifthis feeling has not injured every person you have ever known to fallinto it. Now, in what I have said I am sure you will suspect nothing butsincere friendship. I would save you from a fatal error. You have been alaborious, studious young man. You are far better informed on almost allsubjects than I have ever been. You cannot fail in any laudable objectunless you allow your mind to be improperly directed. I have some theadvantage of you in the world's experience, merely by being older; andit is this that induces me to offer you this advice."It will be observed that, in this letter Lincoln speaks of himself as an"old man." This had been a habit with him for years; and yet at thisdate he was under thirty-nine. He was already beginning to be known as"Old Abe." Hon. E.B. Washburne states that he remembers hearing him thuscalled, in Chicago, in July, 1847. "One afternoon," says Mr. Washburne,"several of us sat on the sidewalk under the balcony in front of theSherman House, and among the number was the accomplished scholar andunrivalled orator, Lisle Smith, who suddenly interrupted theconversation by exclaiming, 'There is Lincoln on the other side of thestreet! _Just look at old Abe!_' And from that time we all called him'Old Abe.' No one who saw him can forget his personal appearance at thattime. Tall, angular, and awkward, he had on a short-waisted, thin,swallow-tail coat, a short vest of the same material, thin pantaloonsscarcely coming down to his ankles, a straw hat, and a pair of brogans,with woollen socks."During the summer following the expiration of Lincoln's term in Congress(March 4, 1849) he made a strong effort to secure the position ofCommissioner of the General Land Office, but without success. The placewas given to Justin Butterfield of Chicago. It was a severedisappointment to Lincoln. Major Wilcox, who at the period referred tolived in McDonough County, Illinois, and in early days was a Whigpolitician, visited Washington to aid Lincoln in seeking thisappointment, and has furnished a graphic account of the circumstancesand of Lincoln's appearance at the national capital in the novelcapacity of an office-seeker. Major Wilcox says that in June, 1849, hewent to Washington and had an interview with the newly-inauguratedPresident, General Taylor, regarding Lincoln's appointment to thedesired office. The interview was but partially satisfactory, thePresident remarking that he was favorable to Lincoln, but that Mr.Butterfield was very strongly urged for the place and the chances ofappointment were in his favor. Lincoln had arranged to be in Washingtonat a time specified, after Major Wilcox should have had opportunity tolook the ground over. Major Wilcox says that he went to the railroaddepot to meet Lincoln at the train. It was in the afternoon, towardsnight. The day had been quite warm, and the road was dry and dusty. Hefound Lincoln just emerging from the depot. He had on a thin suit ofsummer clothes, his coat being a linen duster, much soiled. His wholeappearance was decidedly shabby. He carried in his hand an old-fashionedcarpet-sack, which added to the oddity of his appearance. Major Wilcoxsays if it had been anybody else he would have been rather shy of beingseen in his company, because of the awkward and unseemly appearance hepresented. Lincoln immediately began to talk about his chances for theappointment; whereupon Major Wilcox related to him everything that hadtranspired, and what President Taylor had said to him. They proceeded atonce to Major Wilcox's room, where they sat down to look over thesituation. Lincoln took from his pocket a paper he had prepared in thecase, which comprised eleven reasons why he should be appointedCommissioner of the General Land Office. Amongst other things Lincolnpresented the fact that he had been a member of Congress from Illinoistwo years; that his location was in the West, where the government landswere; that he was a native of the West, and had been reared underWestern influences. He gave reasons why the appointment should be givento Illinois, and particularly to the southern part of the State. MajorWilcox says that he was forcibly struck by the clear, convincing, andmethodical statement of Lincoln as contained in these eleven reasons whyhe should have the appointment. But it was given to Mr. Butterfield.After Lincoln became President, a Member of Congress asked him for anappointment in the army in behalf of a son of the same JustinButterfield. When the application was presented, the President paused,and after a moment's silence, said: "Mr. Justin Butterfield onceobtained an appointment I very much wanted, in which my friends believedI could have been useful, and to which they thought I was fairlyentitled. I hardly ever felt so bad at any failure in my life. But I amglad of an opportunity of doing a service to his son." And he made anorder for his commission. In lieu of the desired office, General Tayloroffered Lincoln the post of Governor, and afterwards of Secretary, ofOregon Territory; but these offers he declined. In after years a friendremarked to him, alluding to the event: "How fortunate that youdeclined! If you had gone to Oregon you might have come back asSenator, but you would never have been President." "Yes, you areprobably right," said Lincoln; and then, with a musing, dreamy look, headded: "I have all my life been a fatalist. What is to be, will be; or,rather, I have found all my life, as Hamlet says,--    'There's a divinity that shapes our ends,    Rough-hew them how we will.'"CHAPTER VII     Lincoln again in Springfield--Back to the Circuit--His Personal     Manners and Appearance--Glimpses of Home-Life--His Family--His     Absent-Mindedness--A Painful Subject--Lincoln a Man of     Sorrows--Familiar Appearance on the Streets of Springfield--Scenes     in the Law-Office--Forebodings of a "Great or Miserable End "--An     Evening with Lincoln in Chicago--Lincoln's Tenderness to His     Relatives--Death of His Father--A Sensible Adviser--Care of His     Step-Mother--Tribute from Her.Retiring, somewhat reluctantly, from Washington life, which he seems tohave liked very much, Lincoln returned to Springfield in 1849 andresumed the practice of the law. He declined an advantageous offer of alaw-partnership at Chicago, made him by Judge Goodrich, giving as areason that if he went to Chicago he would have to sit down and studyhard, and this would kill him; that he would rather go around thecircuit in the country than to sit down and die in a big city. So hesettled down once more in the rather uneventful and fairly prosperouslife of a country lawyer.A gentleman who knew Lincoln intimately in Springfield, in his maturity,has given the following capital description of him. "He stands six feetfour inches high in his stockings. His frame is not muscular, but gauntand wiry; his arms are long, but not disproportionately so for a personof his height; his lower limbs are not disproportioned to his body. Inwalking, his gait, though firm, is never brisk. He steps slowly anddeliberately, almost always with his head inclined forward and his handsclasped behind his back. In matters of dress he is by no means precise.Always clean, he is never fashionable; he is careless, but not slovenly.In manner he is remarkably cordial and at the same time simple. Hispoliteness is always sincere but never elaborate and oppressive. A warmshake of the hand and a warmer smile of recognition are his methods ofgreeting his friends. At rest, his features, though those of a man ofmark, are not such as belong to a handsome man; but when his fine darkgray eyes are lighted up by any emotion, and his features begin theirplay, he would be chosen from among a crowd as one who had in him notonly the kindly sentiments which women love but the heavier metal ofwhich full-grown men and Presidents are made. His hair is black, and,though thin, is wiry. His head sits well on his shoulders, but beyondthat it defies description. It nearer resembles that of Clay than thatof Webster; but it is unlike either. It is very large, andphrenologically well proportioned, betokening power in all itsdevelopments. A slightly Roman nose, a wide-cut mouth, and a darkcomplexion, with the appearance of having been weather-beaten, completethe description."Of Lincoln's life at this period, another writer says: "He lived simply,comfortably, and respectably, with neither expensive tastes nor habits.His wants were few and simple. He occupied a small unostentatious housein Springfield, and was in the habit of entertaining, in a very simpleway, his friends and his brethren of the bar during the terms of thecourt and the sessions of the Legislature. Mrs. Lincoln oftenentertained small numbers of friends at dinner and somewhat largernumbers at evening parties. In his modest and simple home everything wasorderly and refined, and there was always, on the part of both Mr. andMrs. Lincoln, a cordial and hearty Western welcome which put every guestat ease. Yet it was the wit and humor, anecdote, and unrivalledconversation of the host which formed the chief attraction and made adinner at Lincoln's cottage an event to be remembered. Lincoln's incomefrom his profession was now from 2,000 to 3,000 per annum. Hisproperty consisted of his house and lot in Springfield, a lot in thetown of Lincoln which had been given to him, and 160 acres of wild landin Iowa which he had received for his services in the Black Hawk War. Heowned a few law and miscellaneous books. All his property may have beenof the value of 10,000 or 12,000."Lincoln was at this time the father of two sons: Robert Todd, born onthe 1st day of August, 1843; and Edward Baker, born on the 10th ofMarch, 1846. In a letter to his friend Speed, dated October 22 of thelatter year, Lincoln writes: "We have another boy, born the 10th ofMarch. He is very much such a child as Bob was at his age, rather of a_longer_ order. Bob is 'short and low,' and I expect he always will be.He talks very plainly, almost as plainly as anybody. He is quite smartenough. I sometimes fear he is one of the little _rare-ripe_ sort thatare smarter at about five than ever after. He has a great deal of thatsort of mischief that is the offspring of much animal spirits. Since Ibegan this letter a messenger came to tell me Bob was lost; but by thetime I reached the house his mother had found him and had him whipped.By now, very likely, he is run away again."December 21, 1850, a third son, William Wallace, was born to him; and onApril 4, 1853, a fourth and last child, named Thomas."A young man bred in Springfield," says Dr. Holland, "speaks of a visionof Lincoln, as he appeared in those days, that has clung to his memoryvery vividly. The young man's way to school led by the lawyer's door. Onalmost any fair summer morning he would find Lincoln on the sidewalk infront of his house, drawing a child backward and forward in a littlegig. Without hat or coat, wearing a pair of rough shoes, his handsbehind him holding to the tongue of the gig, and his tall form bentforward to accommodate himself to the service, he paced up and down thewalk forgetful of everything around him and intent only on some subjectthat absorbed his mind. The young man says he remembers wondering in hisboyish way how so rough and plain a man should happen to live in sorespectable a house. The habit of mental absorption, or'absent-mindedness' as it is called, was common with him always, butparticularly during the formative periods of his life. The New Salempeople, it will be remembered, thought him crazy because he passed hisbest friends in the street without seeing them. At the table, in his ownfamily, he often sat down without knowing or realizing where he was, andate his food mechanically. When he 'came to himself' it was a trick withhim to break the silence by the quotation of some verse of poetry from afavorite author. It relieved the awkwardness of the situation, served asa 'blind' to the thoughts which had possessed him, and startedconversation in a channel that led as far as possible from the subjectthat he had set aside."Mr. Lamon has written with great freedom of the sorrow that brooded overLincoln's home. Some knowledge of the blight which this cast upon hislife is necessary for a right interpretation of the gloomy moods thatconstantly oppressed him and left their indelible impress on his faceand character. Mr. Lamon states unreservedly that Lincoln's marriage wasan unhappy one. The circumstances preceding his union with Miss Toddhave been related. Mr. Lamon says: "He was conscientious and honorableand just. There was but one way of repairing the injury he had done MissTodd, and he adopted it. They were married; but they understood eachother, and suffered the inevitable consequences. Such troubles seldomfail to find a tongue; and it is not strange that in this case neighborsand friends, and ultimately the whole country, came to know the state ofthings in that house. Lincoln scarcely attempted to conceal it. Hetalked of it with little or no reserve to his wife's relatives, as wellas to his own friends. Yet the gentleness and patience with which hebore this affliction from day to day and from year to year was enough tomove the shade of Socrates. It touched his acquaintances deeply, andthey gave it the widest publicity." Mrs. Colonel Chapman, daughter ofDennis Hanks and a relative of Lincoln, made him a long visit previousto her marriage. "You ask me," says she, "how Mr. Lincoln acted at home.I can say, and that truly, he was all that a husband, father, andneighbor should be, kind and affectionate to his wife and child ('Bob'being the only one they had when I was with them), and very pleasant toall around him. Never did I hear him utter an unkind word."It seems impossible to arrive at all the causes of Lincoln's melancholydisposition. He was, according to his most intimate friends, totallyunlike other people,--was, in fact, "a mystery." But whatever thehistory or the cause,--whether physical reasons, the absence of domesticconcord, a series of painful recollections of his mother, of earlysorrows and hardships, of Anne Rutledge and fruitless hopes, or allthese combined,--Lincoln was a terribly sad and gloomy man. "I do notthink that he knew what happiness was for twenty years," says Mr.Herndon. "'_Terrible_' is the word which all his friends used todescribe him in the black mood. 'It was terrible! It was terrible!' saidone to another." Judge Davis believes that Lincoln's hilarity was mainlysimulated, and that "his stories and jokes were intended to whistle offsadness." "The groundwork of his social nature was sad," says JudgeScott. "But for the fact that he studiously cultivated the humorous, itwould have been very sad indeed. His mirth always seemed to me to be puton; like a plant produced in a hot-bed, it had an unnatural andluxuriant growth." Mr. Herndon, Lincoln's law-partner and most intimatefriend, describes him at this period as a "thin, tall, wiry, sinewy,grizzly, raw-boned man, looking 'woe-struck.' His countenance washaggard and careworn, exhibiting all the marks of deep and protractedsuffering. Every feature of the man--the hollow eyes, with the darkrings beneath; the long, sallow, cadaverous face intersected by thosepeculiar deep lines; his whole air; his walk; his long silent reveries,broken at long intervals by sudden and startling exclamations, as if toconfound an observer who might suspect the nature of histhoughts,--showed he was a man of sorrows, not sorrows of to-day oryesterday, but long-treasured and deep, bearing with him a continualsense of weariness and pain. He was a plain, homely, sad, weary-lookingman, to whom one's heart warmed involuntarily because he seemed at oncemiserable and kind."Mr. Page Eaton, an old resident of Springfield, says: "Lincoln alwaysdid his own marketing, even after he was elected President and beforehe went to Washington. I used to see him at the butcher's or baker'severy morning, with his basket on his arm. He was kind and sociable,and would always speak to everyone. He was so kind, so childlike, thatI don't believe there was one in the city who didn't love him as afather or brother." "On a winter's morning," says Mr. Lamon, "he couldbe seen wending his way to the market, with a basket on his arm and athis side a little boy whose small feet rattled and pattered over theice-bound pavement, attempting to make up by the number of his shortsteps for the long strides of his father. The little fellow jerked atthe bony hand which held his, and prattled and questioned, begged andgrew petulant, in a vain effort to make his father talk to him. Butthe latter was probably unconscious of the other's existence, andstalked on, absorbed in his own reflections. He wore on such occasionsan old gray shawl, rolled into a coil and wrapped like a rope aroundhis neck. The rest of his clothes were in keeping. 'He did not walkcunningly--Indian-like--but cautiously and firmly.' His tread was evenand strong. He was a little pigeon-toed; and this, with anotherpeculiarity, made his walk very singular. He set his whole foot flaton the ground, and in turn lifted it all at once--not restingmomentarily upon the toe as the foot rose nor upon the heel as itfell. He never wore his shoes out at the heel and the toe, as most mendo, more than at the middle. Yet his gait was not altogether awkward,and there was manifest physical power in his step. As he moved alongthus, silent and abstracted, his thoughts dimly reflected in his sharpface, men turned to look after him as an object of sympathy as well ascuriosity. His melancholy, in the words of Mr. Herndon, '_dripped fromhim_ as he walked.' If, however, he met a friend in the street, andwas roused by a hearty 'Good-morning, Lincoln!' he would grasp thefriend's hand with one or both of his own, and with his usualexpression of 'Howdy! howdy!' would detain him to hear a story;something reminded him of it; it happened in Indiana, and it must betold, for it was wonderfully pertinent. It was not at home that hemost enjoyed seeing company. He preferred to meet his friendsabroad,--on a street-corner, in an office, at the court-house, orsitting on nail-kegs in a country store." Mrs. Lincoln experiencedgreat difficulty in securing the punctual attendance of her husband atthe family meals. Dr. Bateman has repeatedly seen two of the boyspulling with all their might at his coat-tails, and a third pushing infront, while _paterfamilias_ stood upon the street cordially shakingthe hand of an old acquaintance.After his breakfast-hour, says Mr. Lamon, he would appear at his officeand go about the labors of the day with all his might, displayingprodigious industry and capacity for continuous application, although henever was a fast worker. Sometimes it happened that he came without hisbreakfast; and then he would have in his hands a piece of cheese orbologna sausage, and a few crackers, bought by the way. At such times hedid not speak to his partner, or his friends if any happened to bepresent; the tears perhaps struggling into his eyes, while his pride wasstruggling to keep them back. Mr. Herndon knew the whole story at aglance. There was no speech between them, but neither wished thevisitors at the office to witness the scene. So Lincoln retired to theback office while Mr. Herndon locked the front one and walked away withthe key in his pocket. In an hour or more the latter would return andperhaps find Lincoln calm and collected. Otherwise he went out again andwaited until he was so. Then the office was opened and everything wenton as usual."His mind was filled with gloomy forebodings and strong apprehensions ofimpending evil, mingled with extravagant visions of personal grandeurand power. He never doubted for a moment that he was formed for some'great or miserable end.' He talked about it frequently and sometimescalmly. Mr. Herndon remembers many of these conversations in theiroffice at Springfield and in their rides around the circuit. Lincolnsaid the impression had grown in him all his life; but Mr. Herndonthinks it was about 1840 that it took the character of a 'religiousconviction.' He had then suffered much, and considering hisopportunities he had achieved great things. He was already a leaderamong men, and a most brilliant career had been promised him by theprophetic enthusiasm of many friends. Thus encouraged and stimulated,and feeling himself growing gradually stronger and stronger in theestimation of 'the plain people' whose voice was more potent than allthe Warwicks, his ambition painted the rainbow of glory in the sky,while his morbid melancholy supplied the clouds that were to overcastand obliterate it with the wrath and ruin of the tempest. To him it wasfate, and there was no escape or defense. The presentiment neverdeserted him. It was as clear, as perfect, as certain as any imageconveyed by the senses. He had now entertained it so long that it was asmuch a part of his nature as the consciousness of identity. All doubtshad faded away, and he submitted humbly to a power which he couldneither comprehend nor resist. He was to fall,--fall from a lofty placeand in the performance of a great work."On one occasion Lincoln visited Chicago as counsel in a case in theU.S. District Court. The Hon. N.B. Judd, an intimate friend, was alsoengaged upon the case, and took Mr. Lincoln home with him as a guest.The following account of this visit is given by Mrs. Judd in Oldroyd'sMemorial Album: "Mr. Judd had invited Mr. Lincoln to spend the eveningat our pleasant home on the shore of Lake Michigan. After tea, and untilquite late, we sat on the broad piazza, looking out upon as lovely ascene as that which has made the Bay of Naples so celebrated. A numberof vessels were availing themselves of a fine breeze to leave theharbor, and the lake was studded with many a white sail. I remember thata flock of sea-gulls were flying along the beach, dipping their beaksand white-lined wings in the foam that capped the short waves as theyfell upon the shore. Whilst we sat there the great white moon appearedon the rim of the eastern horizon and slowly crept above the water,throwing a perfect flood of silver light upon the dancing waves. Thestars shone with the soft light of a midsummer night, and the breakingof the low waves upon the shore added the charm of pleasant sound to thebeauty of the night. Mr. Lincoln, whose home was far inland from thegreat lakes, seemed greatly impressed with the wondrous beauty of thescene, and carried by its impressiveness away from all thought of jarsand turmoil of earth. In that mild, pleasant voice, attuned to harmonywith his surroundings, as was his wont when his soul was stirred byaught that was lovely or beautiful, Mr. Lincoln began to speak of themystery which for ages enshrouded and shut out those distant worldsabove us from our own; of the poetry and beauty which was seen and feltby seers of old when they contemplated Orion and Arcturus as theywheeled, seemingly around the earth, in their nightly course; of thediscoveries since the invention of the telescope, which had thrown aflood of light and knowledge on what before was incomprehensible andmysterious; of the wonderful computations of scientists who had measuredthe miles of seemingly endless space which separated the planets in oursolar system from our central sun, and our sun from other suns. Hespeculated on the possibilities of knowledge which an increased power ofthe lens would give in the years to come. When the night air became toochilling to remain longer on the piazza we went into the parlor. Seatedon the sofa, his long limbs stretching across the carpet and his armsfolded behind him, Mr. Lincoln went on to speak of other discoveries, ofthe inventions which had been made during the long cycles of time lyingbetween the present and those early days when the sons of Adam began tomake use of material things about them and invent instruments of variouskinds in brass and gold and silver. He gave us a short but succinctaccount of all the inventions referred to in the Old Testament, from thetime when Adam walked in the garden of Eden until the Bible recordended, 600 B.C. I said, 'Mr. Lincoln, I did not know you were such aBible student.' He replied: 'I must be honest, Mrs. Judd, and tell youjust how I come to know so much about these early inventions.' He thenwent on to say that in discussing with some friend the relative age ofthe discovery and use of the precious metals he went to the Bible tosatisfy himself and became so interested in his researches that he madememoranda of the different discoveries and inventions. Soon after, hewas invited to lecture before some literary society, I think inBloomington. The interest he had felt in the study convinced him thatthe subject would interest others, and he therefore prepared anddelivered his lecture on The Age of Different Inventions. 'Of course,'he added, 'I could not after that forget the order or time of suchdiscoveries and inventions.'"In all the years that had passed since Lincoln left his father's humblehouse, he had preserved an affectionate interest in the welfare of itsvarious members. He paid them visits whenever he could find opportunity,and never failed to extend his aid and sympathy whenever needed. He hadrisen to success in his profession, was widely known throughout hissection, and though still a poor man he had good prospects andconsiderable influence. Yet he ever retained a considerate regard andremembrance for the poor and obscure relatives he had left plodding inthe humble ways of life. He never assumed the slightest superiority tothem. Whenever, upon his circuit, he found time, he always visited them.Countless times he was known to leave his companions at the villagehotel after a hard day's work in the court-room and spend the eveningwith these old friends and companions of his humbler days. On oneoccasion, when urged not to go, he replied, "Why, Aunt's heart would bebroken if I should leave town without calling upon her,"--yet he wasobliged to walk several miles to make the call. As his fortunes improvedhe often sent money and presents to his father and step-mother, boughtland for them, and tried in every way to make them comfortable andhappy. The father was gratified at these marks of affection, and feltgreat pride in the rising prosperity of his son. Mr. Herndon says that"for years Lincoln supported or helped to support his aged father andmother. It is to his honor that he dearly loved his step-mother, and itis equally true that she idolized her step-son. He purchased a piece ofproperty in Coles County as a home for his father and mother, and hadit deeded in trust for their use and benefit."In 1851 Lincoln's father died, at the age of seventy-three. Thefollowing letter, written a few days before this event, reveals theaffectionate solicitude of the son:     Springfield, Jan. 12,1851.     DEAR BROTHER:--On the day before yesterday I received a letter from     Harriet, written at Greenup. She says she has just returned from     your house, and that father is very low and will hardly recover.     She also says that you have written me two letters, and that,     although you do not expect me to come now, you wonder that I do not     write. I received both your letters; and although I have not     answered them, it is not because I have forgotten them, or not been     interested about them, but because it appeared to me I could write     nothing which could do any good. You already know I desire that     neither father nor mother shall be in want of any comfort, either     in health or sickness, while they live; and I feel sure you have     not failed to use my name, if necessary, to procure a doctor or     anything else for father in his present sickness. My business is     such that I could hardly leave home now, if it were not, as it is,     that my wife is sick a-bed. I sincerely hope father may yet recover     his health; but, at all events, tell him to remember to call upon     and confide in our great and good and merciful Maker, who will not     turn away from him in any extremity. He notes the fall of a     sparrow, and numbers the hairs of our heads; and He will not forget     the dying man who puts his trust in Him. Say to him, that if we     could meet now it is doubtful whether it would not be more painful     than pleasant; but that if it be his lot to go now he will soon     have a joyous meeting with loved ones gone before, and where the     rest of us, through the help of God, hope ere long to join them.     Write me again when you receive this.     Affectionately,     A. LINCOLN.The step-brother, John Johnston, to whom the foregoing letter isaddressed, was the cause of considerable anxiety to Lincoln. It was withhim that their parents resided, and frequent were his appeals toLincoln to extricate him from some pecuniary strait into which he hadfallen through his confirmed thriftlessness and improvidence. "JohnJohnston," Mr. Herndon says, "was an indolent and shiftless man, one whowas 'born tired.' Yet he was clever, generous and hospitable." Thefollowing document affords a hint of Lincoln's kindly patience as wellas of his capacity for sound practical advice when it was much needed:     DEAR JOHNSTON:--Your request for eighty dollars I do not think it     best to comply with now. At the various times when I have helped     you a little you have said to me, 'We can get along very well now';     but in a very short time I find you in the same difficulty again.     Now, this can only happen by some defect in your conduct. What that     defect is, I think I know. You are not lazy, and still you are an     idler. I doubt whether, since I saw you, you have done a good whole     day's work in any one day. You do not very much dislike to work,     and still you do not work much, merely because it does not seem to     you that you could get much for it. This habit of uselessly wasting     time is the whole difficulty; and it is vastly important to you,     and still more so to your children, that you should break the     habit. It is more important to them, because they have longer to     live, and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it     easier than they can get out after they are in. You are now in need     of some money; and what I propose is that you shall go to work,     'tooth and nail,' for somebody who will give you money for it. Let     father and your boys take charge of things at home, prepare for a     crop, and make the crop, and you go to work for the best     money-wages, or in discharge of any debt you owe, that you can get;     and, to secure you a fair reward for your labor, I now promise you,     that, for every dollar you will, between this and the first of next     May, get for your own labor, either in money or as your own     indebtedness, I will then give you one other dollar. By this, if     you hire yourself at ten dollars a month, from me you will get ten     more, making twenty dollars a month for your work. In this I do not     mean you shall go off to St. Louis, or the lead-mines, or the     gold-mines in California; but I mean for you to go at it, for the     best wages you can get, close to home, in Coles County. Now, if you     will do this you will soon be out of debt, and, what is better, you     will have a habit that will keep you from getting in debt again.     But if I should now clear you out of debt, next year you would be     in just as deep as ever. You say you would almost give your place     in heaven for 70 or 80. Then you value your place in heaven very     cheap; for I am sure you can, with the offer I make, get the     seventy or eighty dollars for four or five months' work. You say,     if I will furnish you the money, you will deed me the land, and if     you don't pay the money back, you will deliver possession.     Nonsense! If you can't now live with the land, how will you then     live without it? You have always been kind to me, and I do not mean     to be unkind to you. On the contrary, if you will but follow my     advice, you will find it worth more than eighty times eighty     dollars to you.     Affectionately your brother,     A. LINCOLN.In other letters he wrote even more sharply to his thriftlessstep-brother.     Shelbyville, Nov. 4, 1851     DEAR BROTHER:--When I came into Charleston, day before yesterday, I     learned that you are anxious to sell the land where you live, and     move to Missouri. I have been thinking of this ever since, and     cannot but think such a notion is utterly foolish. What can you do     in Missouri better than here? Is the land any richer? Can you     there, any more than here, raise corn and wheat and oats without     work? Will any body there, any more than here, do your work for     you? If you intend to go to work, there is no better place than     right where you are; if you do not intend to go to work, you can     not get along anywhere. Squirming and crawling about from place to     place can do no good. You have raised no crop this year; and what     you really want is to sell the land, get the money and spend it.     Part with the land you have, and, my life upon it, you will never     after own a spot big enough to bury you in. Half of what you will     get for the land you will spend in moving to Missouri, and the     other half you will eat and drink and wear out, and no foot of     land will be bought. Now, I feel it is my duty to have no hand in     such a piece of foolery. I feel that it is so even on your own     account, and particularly on mother's account. The eastern forty     acres I intend to keep for mother while she lives; if you will not     cultivate it, it will rent for enough to support her; at least, it     will rent for something. Her dower in the other two forties she can     let you have, and no thanks to me. Now, do not misunderstand this     letter. I do not write it in any unkindness. I write it in order,     if possible, to get you to face the truth, which truth is, you are     destitute because you have idled away all your time. Your thousand     pretences for not getting along better are all nonsense. They     deceive nobody but yourself. _Go to work_ is the only cure for your     case.     Sincerely yours,     A. LINCOLN.In still another letter he reveals his tender solicitude for hisstep-mother, as well as his care for his step-brother's unfortunatechildren.     Shelbyville, Nov. 9, 1851     DEAR BROTHER:--When I wrote you before, I had not received your     letter. I still think as I did; but if the land can be sold so that     I get 300 to put at interest for mother, I will not object, if she     does not. But before I will make a deed, the money must be had, or     secured beyond all doubt, at ten per cent. As to Abram, I do not     want him on my own account; but I understand he wants to live with     me, so that he can go to school, and get a fair start in the world,     which I very much wish him to have. When I reach home, if I can     make it convenient I will take him, provided there is no mistake     between us as to the object and terms of my taking him.     In haste, as ever,     A. LINCOLN.In speaking of Lincoln's regard for his step-mother, it is interestingalso to learn her opinion of him. A gentleman visiting the old ladyafter her son's death says: "She is eighty-four years old, and quitefeeble. She is a plain, unsophisticated old lady, with a frank, opencountenance, a warm heart full of kindness toward others, and in manyrespects very much like the President. Abraham was evidently her idol;she speaks of him still as her 'good boy,' and with much feeling said,'He was always a good boy, and willing to do just what I wanted. He andhis step-brother never quarrelled but once, and that, you know, is agreat deal for step-brothers. I didn't want him elected President. Iknowed they would kill him.'" She died in April, 1869, and was buried bythe side of her husband, Thomas Lincoln.CHAPTER VIII     Lincoln as a Lawyer--His Appearance in Court--Reminiscences of a     Law-Student in Lincoln's Office--An "Office Copy" of Byron--Novel     way of Keeping Partnership Accounts--Charges for Legal     Services--Trial of Bill Armstrong--Lincoln before a Jury--Kindness     toward Unfortunate Clients--Refusing to Defend Guilty     Men--Courtroom Anecdotes--Anecdotes of Lincoln at the Bar--Some     Striking Opinions of Lincoln as a Lawyer.The ten years following the close of Lincoln's Congressional service, in1849, were given to the uninterrupted practice of the law, to which hedevoted himself laboriously and successfully, though not with greatpecuniary gains. His legal fees were regarded by his brethren at the baras "ridiculously small." His practice had extended to the Supreme Courtof his State and to the United States District and Circuit Courts, andhe was occasionally retained for cases in other States. With greaterlove of money and less sympathy for his fellows, he might have acquireda fortune in his profession.Lincoln never speculated. Apparently he had no great desire to acquirewealth. He had many opportunities in the days of the State's earlygrowth to make good and safe investments, but he never took advantage ofthem. Many of his fellow lawyers were becoming wealthy, but Lincolnstill rode the circuit wearing the familiar gray shawl about hisshoulders, carrying a carpet-bag filled with papers and a change ofunderclothing, and a faded, green cotton umbrella with "A. Lincoln" inlarge white muslin letters on the inside. The knob was gone from thehandle of the umbrella and a piece of twine kept it from falling open. Ayoung lawyer who saw him for the first time thus--one who grew to lovehim and who afterwards gave his life for the Union--in relating thecircumstance a long time afterward, exclaimed: "He was the _ungodliest_figure I ever saw."An interesting and vivid description of Lincoln's personal appearanceand manner in the trial of a case is furnished by one who was a witnessof the scenes which he so admirably describes. The writer says: "Whileliving in Danville, Illinois, in 1854, I saw Abraham Lincoln for thefirst time. The occasion of his visit was as prosecutor of a slandersuit brought by Dr. Fithian against a wealthy farmer whose wife diedunder the doctor's hands. The defense was represented by Edward A.Hannegan, of Indiana, ex-United States Senator and afterward Minister toBerlin, an able and eloquent man; and O.B. Ficklin, who, after Douglasand Lincoln, was considered the best lawyer in Illinois. Lincoln had allhe could do to maintain himself against his two formidable adversaries,but he was equal to the occasion. The trial lasted three or four days,the examination of witnesses consuming most of the time. In this part ofthe work Lincoln displayed remarkable tact. He did not badger thewitnesses, or attempt to confuse them. His questions were plain andpractical, and elicited answers that had a direct bearing upon the case.He did nothing for effect, and made no attempt to dazzle the jury orcaptivate the audience. When he arose to speak he was confronted by anaudience that was too numerous for all to find seats in the court-room.He was attired in a fine broadcloth suit, silk hat, and polished boots.His neck was encircled by an old-fashioned silk choker. He perspiredfreely, and used a red silk handkerchief to remove the perspiration. Hisclothes fitted him, and he was as genteel-looking as any man in theaudience. The slouchy appearance which he is said to have presented onother occasions was conspicuously absent here. As he stood before thevast audience, towering above every person around him, he was the centreof attraction. I can never forget how he looked, as he cast his eyesover the crowd before beginning his argument. His face was long andsallow; high cheek bones; large, deep-set eyes, of a grayish-browncolor, shaded by heavy eyebrows; high but not broad forehead; large,well-formed head, covered with an abundance of coarse black hair, wornrather long, through which he frequently passed his fingers; arms andlegs of unusual length; head inclined slightly forward, which made himappear stoop-shouldered. His features betrayed neither excitement noranxiety. They were calm and fixed. In short, his appearance was that ofa man who felt the responsibility of his position and was determined toacquit himself to the best of his ability. I do not remember the pointsof his speech; but his manner was so peculiar, so different from that ofother orators whom I have heard, that I can never forget it. He spokefor almost two hours, entirely without notes and with an eloquence thatI have never heard surpassed. He was all life, all motion; every muscleand fibre of his body seemed brought into requisition. His voice wasclear, distinct, and well modulated. Every word was clean-cut andexactly suited to its place. At times he would stoop over until hishands almost swept the floor. Then he would straighten himself up, foldhis arms across his breast, and take a few steps forward or back. Thismovement completed, he would fling his arms above his head, or thrustthem beneath his coat-tails, elevating or depressing his voice to suitthe attitude assumed and the sentiment expressed. Arms and legs werecontinually in motion. It seemed impossible for him to stand still. Inthe midst of the most impassioned or pathetic portions of his speech, hewould extend his long arms toward the judge or jury, and shake his bonyfingers with an effect that is indescribable. He held his audience tothe last; and when he sat down there was a murmur of applause which thejudge with difficulty prevented from swelling to a roar. The argumentmust have been as able as the manner of the speaker was attractive, forthe verdict was in favor of his client."When he had retired to his hotel after the trial, and while conversingwith a number of gentlemen who had called to pay their respects to him,Lincoln was informed that an old colored woman, who had known him yearsbefore in Kentucky, wished to see him. She was too feeble to come tohim, and desired him to go to her. Ascertaining where she lived, Lincolnstarted at once, accompanied by a boy who acted as pilot. He found thewoman in a wretched hovel in the outskirts of the town, sick anddestitute. He remembered her very well, as she had belonged to the ownerof the farm upon which Lincoln was born. He gave her money to supply herimmediate wants, promised her that he would see she did not suffer forthe necessaries of life, and when he returned to town hunted up aphysician and engaged him to give the old woman all the medicalattention that her case demanded."Mr. G.W. Harris, whose first meeting with Lincoln in a log school-househas been previously described in these pages, subsequently became aclerk in Lincoln's law-office at Springfield, and furnishes someexcellent reminiscences of that interesting period. "A crack-brainedattorney who lived in Springfield, supported mainly by the other lawyersof the place, became indebted, in the sum of two dollars and fiftycents, to a wealthy citizen of the county, a recent comer. The creditor,failing after repeated efforts to collect the amount due him, came toMr. Lincoln and asked him to bring suit. Lincoln explained the man'scondition and circumstances, and advised his client to let the matterrest; but the creditor's temper was up, and he insisted on having suitbrought. Again Lincoln urged him to let the matter drop, adding, 'Youcan make nothing out of him, and it will cost you a good deal more thanthe debt to bring suit.' The creditor was still determined to have hisway, and threatened to seek some other attorney who would be morewilling to take charge of the matter than Lincoln appeared to be.Lincoln then said, 'Well, if you are determined that suit shall bebrought, I will bring it; but my charge will be ten dollars.' The moneywas paid him, and peremptory orders were given that the suit be broughtthat day. After the client's departure, Lincoln went out of the office,returning in about an hour with an amused look on his face. I asked whatpleased him, and he replied, 'I brought suit against ----, and thenhunted him up, told him what I had done, handed him half of the tendollars, and we went over to the squire's office. He confessed judgmentand paid the bill.' Lincoln added that he didn't see any other way tomake things satisfactory for his client as well as the rest of theparties."Mr. Lincoln had a heart that was more a woman's than a man's--filled tooverflowing with sympathy for those in trouble, and ever ready torelieve them by any means in his power. He was ever thoughtful ofothers' comforts, even to the forgetting of himself. In those early dayshis face wore a sad look when at rest--a look that made you feel thatyou would like to take from him a part of his burden. One who knew himthen and had known his career since would be inclined to think that healready felt premonitions of the heavy burdens that his broad shoulderswere to bear, and the sorrows that his kind heart would have to endure."Mr. Lincoln was fond of playing chess and checkers, and usually actedcautiously upon the defensive until the game had reached a stage whereaggressive movements were clearly justified. He was also somewhat fondof ten-pins, and occasionally indulged in a game. Whatever may have beenhis tastes in his younger days, at this period of his life he took nointerest in fishing-rod or gun. He was indifferent to dress, carelessalmost to a fault of his personal appearance. The same indifferenceextended to money. So long as his wants were supplied--and they were fewand simple--he seemed to have no further use for money, except in thegiving or the lending of it, with no expectation or desire for itsreturn, to those whom he thought needed it more than he. Debt heabhorred, and under no circumstances would he incur it. He wasabstemious in every respect. I have heard him say that he did not knowthe taste of liquor. At the table he preferred plain food, and a verylittle satisfied him."Under no circumstances would he, as an attorney, take a case he knew tobe wrong. Every possible means was used to get at the truth before hewould undertake a case. More cases, by his advice, were settled withouttrial than he carried into the courts; and that, too, without charge.When on one occasion I suggested that he ought to make a charge in suchcases, he laughingly answered, 'They wouldn't want to pay me; they don'tthink I have earned a fee unless I take the case into court and make aspeech or two.' When trivial cases were brought to him, such as wouldmost probably be carried no farther than a magistrate's office, and hecould not induce a settlement without trial, he would generally referthem to some young attorney, for whom he would speak a good word at thesame time. He was ever kind and courteous to these young beginners whenhe was the opposing counsel. He had a happy knack of setting them attheir ease and encouraging them. In consequence he was the favorite ofall who came in contact with him. When his heart was in a case he was apowerful advocate. I have heard more than one attorney say that it waslittle use to expect a favorable verdict in any case where Lincoln wasopposing counsel, as his simple statements of the facts had more weightwith the jury than those of the witnesses."As a student (if such a term could be applied to Mr. Lincoln) one whodid not know him might have called him indolent. He would pick up a bookand run rapidly over the pages, pausing here and there. At the end of anhour--never, as I remember, more than two or three hours--he would closethe book, stretch himself out on the office lounge, and with hands underhis head and eyes shut he would digest the mental food he had justtaken."In the spring of 1846, war between the United States and Mexico brokeout. Mr. Lincoln was opposed to the war. He looked upon it asunnecessary and unjust. Volunteers were called for. John J. Hardin, wholost his life in that war, and Edward D. Baker, who was killed at Ball'sBluff during our Civil War--both Whigs--were engaged in raisingregiments. Meetings were held and speeches made. At one of them, afterBaker and others had spoken, Lincoln, who was in the audience, wascalled for, and the call was repeated until at last he ascended theplatform. He thanked the audience for the compliment paid him in thewish they had expressed to hear him talk, and said he would gladly makethem a speech if he had anything to say. But he was not going into thewar; and as he was not going himself, he did not feel like tellingothers to go. He would simply leave it to each individual to do as hethought his duty called for. After a few more remarks, and a story 'witha nib to it,' he bowed himself off the platform."About a year after this, Mr. Lincoln was seeking to be nominated as acandidate for Congress. Finding the writing of letters (at hisdictation) to influential men in the different counties and evenprecincts of the district somewhat burdensome, I suggested printingcirculars. He objected, on the ground that a printed letter would nothave the same effect that a written one would; the latter had theappearance of personality, it was more flattering to the receiver, andwould more certainly gain his assistance, or at least his good-will. Indiscussing the probabilities of his nomination, I remarked that therewas so much unfairness, if not downright trickery, used that it appearedto me almost useless to seek a nomination without resort to similarmeans. His reply was: 'I want to be nominated; I would like to go toCongress; but if I cannot do so by fair means, I prefer to stay athome.' He was nominated, and in the following fall was elected by amajority over three times as large as the district had ever beforegiven."Mr. Lincoln, like many others in their callow days, scribbled verses;and so far as I was capable of judging, their quality was above theaverage. It was accidentally that I learned this. In arranging the booksand papers in the office, I found two or three quires of letter-paperstitched together in book form, nearly filled with poetical effusions inMr. Lincoln's handwriting, and evidently original. I looked through themsomewhat hurriedly, and when Lincoln came in I showed him themanuscript, asking him if it was his. His response was, 'Where did youfind it?' and rolling it up, he put it in his coat-tail pocket; and Isaw it no more. Afterwards, in speaking of the matter to Mr. Lincoln'spartner, he said, 'I believe he has at times scribbled some verses; buthe is, I think, somewhat unwilling to have it known.'"Lincoln's love of poetry is further shown by the following incident,related by a gentleman who visited the old law-office of Lincoln &Herndon, at Springfield. He says: "I took up carelessly, as I stoodthinking, a handsome octavo volume lying on the office table. It openedso persistently at one place, as I handled it, that I looked to see whatit was, and found that somebody had thoroughly thumbed the pages of 'DonJuan.' I knew Mr. Herndon was not a man to dwell on it, and it dartedthrough my mind that perhaps it had been a favorite with Lincoln. 'DidMr. Lincoln ever read this book?' I said, hurriedly. 'That book!' saidHerndon, looking up from his writing and taking it out of my hand. 'Oh,yes; he read it often. It is the office copy.'" Lincoln was so fond ofthe book that he kept it ready to his hand.Mr. John T. Stuart, Lincoln's first law-partner, says of him that hisaccounts were correctly kept, but in a manner peculiar to himself. Soonafter their law-partnership was formed, Mr. Stuart was elected toCongress, thereafter spending much of his time in Washington. Lincolnconducted the business of the firm in his absence. When Mr. Stuartreached home, at the close of the first session of Congress, Lincolnproceeded to give him an account of the earnings of the office duringhis absence. The charges for fees and entry of receipts of money werenot in an account book, but stowed away in a drawer in Lincoln's desk,among the papers in each case. He proceeded to lay the papers before Mr.Stuart, taking up each case by itself. The account would run in thisway:  Fees charged in this case................  Amount collected.........................  Stuart's half............................The half that belonged to Mr. Stuart would invariably accompany thepapers in the case. Lincoln had the reputation of being very moderate inhis charges. He was never grasping, and seemed incapable of believingthat his services could be worth much to anyone.One of the most famous cases in which Lincoln engaged was that ofWilliam D. Armstrong, son of Jack and Hannah Armstrong of New Salem, thechild whom Lincoln had rocked in the cradle while Mrs. Armstrongattended to other household duties. Jack Armstrong, it will beremembered, was an early friend of Lincoln's, whom he had beaten in awrestling-match on his first arrival in New Salem. He and his wife hadfrom that time treated the youth with the utmost kindness, giving him ahome when he was out of work, and showing him every kindness it was intheir power to offer. Lincoln never forgot his debt of gratitude tothem; and when Hannah, now a widow, wrote to him of the peril her boywas in, and besought him to help them in their extremity, he repliedpromptly that he would do what he could. The circumstances were these:"In the summer of 1857, at a camp-meeting in Mason County, one Metzgarwas most brutally murdered. The affray took place about half a mile fromthe place of worship, near some wagons loaded with liquor andprovisions. Two men, James H. Norris and William D. Armstrong, wereindicted for the crime. Norris was tried in Mason County, convicted ofmanslaughter, and sentenced to the penitentiary for a term of eightyears. The popular feeling being very high against Armstrong in MasonCounty, he took a change of venue to Cass County, and was there tried(at Beardstown) in the spring of 1858. Hitherto Armstrong had had theservices of two able counsellors; but now their efforts weresupplemented by those of a most determined and zealous volunteer. Thecase was so clear against the accused that defense seemed almostuseless. The strongest evidence was that of a man who swore that ateleven o'clock at night he saw Armstrong strike the deceased on thehead; that the moon was shining brightly, and was nearly full; and thatits position in the sky was just about that of the sun at ten o'clock inthe morning, and by it he saw Armstrong give the mortal blow." This wasfatal, unless the effect could be broken by contradiction orimpeachment. Lincoln quietly looked up an almanac, and found that at thetime this witness declared the moon to have been shining with full lightthere was no moon at all. Lincoln made the closing argument. "At first,"says Mr. Walker, one of the counsel associated with him, "he spoke veryslowly and carefully, reviewing the testimony and pointing out itscontradictions, discrepancies and impossibilities. When he had thusprepared the way, he called for an almanac, and showed that at the hourat which the principal witness swore he had seen, by the light of thefull moon, the mortal blow given, _there was no moon_. The last fifteenminutes of his speech were as eloquent as I ever heard; and such werethe power and earnestness with which he spoke to that jury, that all satas if entranced, and, when he was through, found relief in a gush oftears." Said one of the prosecutors: "He took the jury by storm. Therewere tears in Mr. Lincoln's eyes while he spoke, but they were genuine.His sympathies were fully enlisted in favor of the young man, and histerrible sincerity could not help but arouse the same passion in thejury. I have said a hundred times that it was Lincoln's speech thatsaved that man from the gallows." "Armstrong was not cleared by any wantof testimony against him, but by the irresistible appeal of Mr. Lincolnin his favor," says Mr. Shaw, one of the associates in the prosecution.His mother, who sat near during Lincoln's appeal, says: "He told thestories about our first acquaintance, and what I did for him and how Idid it. Lincoln said to me, 'Hannah, your son will be cleared beforesundown.' He and the other lawyers addressed the jury, and closed thecase. I went down to Thompson's pasture. Stator came to me and told methat my son was cleared and a free man. I went up to the court-house;the jury shook hands with me, so did the court, so did Lincoln. We wereall affected, and tears were in Lincoln's eyes. He then remarked to me,'Hannah, what did I tell you? I pray to God that William may be a goodboy hereafter; that this lesson may prove in the end a good lesson tohim and to all.' After the trial was over, Lincoln came down to where Iwas in Beardstown. I asked him what he charged me; told him I was poor.He said, 'Why, Hannah, I shan't charge you a cent--never. Anything I cando for you I will do willingly and without charges.' He wrote to meabout some land which some men were trying to get from me, and said,'Hannah, they can't get your land. Let them try it in the Circuit Court,and then you appeal it. Bring it to the Supreme Court, and Herndon and Iwill attend to it for nothing.'"Lincoln regarded himself not only as the legal adviser of unfortunatepeople, but as their friend and protector; and he would never press themfor pay for his services. A client named Cogdal was unfortunate inbusiness, and gave Lincoln a note in payment of legal fees. Soonafterwards he met with an accident by which he lost a hand. MeetingLincoln some time after, on the steps of the State House, the kindlawyer asked him how he was getting along. "Badly enough," replied Mr.Cogdal. "I am both broken up in business and crippled." Then he added,"I have been thinking about that note of yours." Lincoln, who hadprobably known all about Mr. Cogdal's troubles, and had prepared himselffor the meeting, took out his pocket-book, and saying, with a laugh,"Well you needn't think any more about it," handed him the note. Mr.Cogdal protesting, Lincoln said, "Even if you had the money, I would nottake it," and hurried away.Mr. G.L. Austin thus describes an incident of Lincoln's career at thebar: "Mr. Lincoln was once associated with Mr. Leonard Swett indefending a man accused of murder. He listened to the testimony whichwitness after witness gave against his client, until his honest heartcould stand it no longer; then, turning to his associate, he said:'Swett, the man is guilty; you defend him; I can't.' Swett did defendhim, and the man was acquitted. When proffered his share of the largefee, Lincoln most emphatically declined it, on the ground that 'all ofit belonged to Mr. Swett, whose ardor and eloquence saved a guilty manfrom justice.'"At a term of court in Logan County, a man named Hoblit had brought suitagainst a man named Farmer. The suit had been appealed from a justice ofthe peace, and Lincoln knew nothing of it until he was retained byHoblit to try the case in the Circuit Court. G.A. Gridley, then ofBloomington, appeared for the defendant. Judge Treat, afterwards on theUnited States bench, was the presiding judge at the trial. Lincoln'sclient went upon the witness stand and testified to the account he hadagainst the defendant, gave the amount due after allowing all creditsand set-offs, and swore positively that it had not been paid. Theattorney for the defendant simply produced a receipt in full, signed byHoblit prior to the beginning of the case. Hoblit had to admit thesigning of the receipt, but told Lincoln he "supposed the cuss had lostit." Lincoln at once arose and left the court-room. The Judge told theparties to proceed with the case; and Lincoln not appearing, Judge Treatdirected a bailiff to go to the hotel and call him. The bailiff ranacross the street to the hotel, and found Lincoln sitting in the officewith his feet on the stove, apparently in a deep study, when heinterrupted him with: "Mr. Lincoln, the Judge wants you." "Oh, does he?"replied Lincoln. "Well, you go back and tell the Judge I cannot come.Tell him I have to _wash my hands_." The bailiff returned with themessage, and Lincoln's client suffered a non-suit. It was Lincoln's wayof saying he wanted nothing more to do with such a case.Lincoln would never advise clients into unwise or unjust lawsuits. Hewould always sacrifice his own interests, and refuse a retainer, ratherthan be a party to a case which did not command the approval of hissense of justice. He was once waited upon by a lady who held areal-estate claim which she desired to have him prosecute, putting intohis hands, with the necessary papers, a check for two hundred and fiftydollars as a retaining fee. Lincoln said he would look the case over,and asked her to call again the next day. Upon presenting herself, hetold her that he had gone through the papers very carefully, and wasobliged to tell her frankly that there was "not a peg" to hang her claimupon, and he could not conscientiously advise her to bring an action.The lady was satisfied, and, thanking him, rose to go. "Wait," saidLincoln, fumbling in his vest pocket; "here is the check you left withme." "But, Mr. Lincoln," returned the lady, "I think you have earnedthat." "No, no," he responded, handing it back to her; "that would notbe right. I can't take pay for doing my duty." To a would-be client whohad carefully stated his case, to which Lincoln had listened with theclosest attention, he said: "Yes, there is no reasonable doubt that Ican gain your case for you. I can set a whole neighborhood atloggerheads; I can distress a widowed mother and her six fatherlesschildren, and thereby get for you six hundred dollars, which rightfullybelongs, it appears to me, as much to the woman and her children as itdoes to you. You must remember that some things that are _legally_ rightare not _morally_ right. I shall not take your case, but will give you alittle advice, for which I will charge you nothing. You seem to be asprightly, energetic man. I would advise you to try your hand at _makingsix hundred dollars some other way_."Senator McDonald states that he saw a jury trial in Illinois, at whichLincoln defended an old man charged with assault and battery. No bloodhad been spilled, but there was malice in the prosecution, and the chiefwitness was eager to make the most of it. On cross-examination, Lincoln"gave him rope" and drew him out; asked him how long the fight lastedand how much ground it covered. The witness thought the fight must havelasted half an hour and covered an acre of ground. Lincoln called hisattention to the fact that nobody was hurt, and then with an inimitableair asked him if he didn't think it was "a mighty small crop for an acreof ground." The jury rejected the prosecution's claim.Many of the stories told of Lincoln at the bar are extremelyridiculous, and represent him in anything but a dignified light. Butthey are a part of the character of the man, and should be givenwherever there is reason to suppose they are genuine. Besides, they areusually full of a humor that is irresistible. Such an incident is givenby the Hon. Lawrence Weldon, Lincoln's old friend and legal associate inIllinois. "I can see him now," says Judge Weldon, "through the decayingmemories of thirty years, standing in the corner of the old court-room,and as I approached him with a paper I did not understand, he said:'Wait until I fix this plug for my _gallus_, and I will pitch into thatlike a dog at a root.' While speaking, he was busily engaged in tryingto connect his suspender with his trousers by making a 'plug' performthe function of a button. Lincoln liked old-fashioned words, and neverfailed to use them if they could be sustained as proper. He was probablyaccustomed to say 'gallows,' and he never adopted the modern word'suspender.'"On a certain occasion Lincoln appeared at the trial of a case in whichhis friend Judge Logan was his opponent. It was a suit between twofarmers who had had a disagreement over a horse-trade. On the day of thetrial, Mr. Logan, having bought a new shirt, open in the back, with ahuge standing collar, dressed himself in extreme haste, and put on theshirt with the _bosom at the back_, a linen coat concealing the blunder.He dazed the jury with his knowledge of "horse points"; and as the daywas sultry, took off his coat and "summed" up in his shirt-sleeves.Lincoln, sitting behind him, took in the situation, and when his turncame he remarked to the jury: "Gentlemen, Mr. Logan has been trying forover an hour to make you believe he knows more about a horse than thesehonest old farmers who are witnesses. He has quoted largely from his'horse doctor,' and now, gentlemen, I submit to you," (here he liftedLogan out of his chair, and turned him with his back to the jury andthe crowd, at the same time flapping up the enormous standing collar)"what dependence can you place in his horse knowledge, when he _has notsense enough to put on his shirt_?" Roars of laughter greeted thisexposition, and the verdict was given to Lincoln.The preceding incident leads to another, in which Lincoln himselffigures as a horse-trader. The scene is a very humorous one; and, asusual in an encounter of wit, Lincoln came out ahead. He and a certainJudge once got to bantering each other about trading horses; and it wasagreed that the next morning at nine o'clock they should make a trade,the horses to be unseen up to that hour,--and no backing out, under aforfeit of twenty-five dollars. At the hour appointed the Judge came up,leading the sorriest looking specimen of a nag ever seen in those parts.In a few minutes Lincoln was seen approaching with a _wooden saw-horse_upon his shoulders. Great were the shouts and the laughter of the crowd;and these increased, when Lincoln, surveying the Judge's animal, setdown his saw-horse, and exclaimed: "Well, Judge, this is the first timeI ever _got the worst of it_ in a horse-trade!"There has been much discussion as to Lincoln's rank and ability as alawyer. Opinion among his contemporaries seems to have been somewhatdivided. Mr. Herndon felt warranted in saying that he was at the sametime a very great and a very insignificant lawyer. His mind was logicaland direct. Generalities and platitudes had no charm for him. He had theability to seize the strong points of a case and present them withclearness and compactness. His power of comparison was great. He rarelyfailed in a legal discussion to use this mode of reasoning. Yet he knewpractically nothing of the rules of evidence, of pleading, of practice,as laid down in the text-books, and seemed to care little about them.Sometimes he lost cases of the plainest justice which the mostinexperienced lawyer could have won. He looked upon two things asessential to his success in a case. One was time; he was slow inreasoning and slow in speech. The other was confidence that the cause herepresented was just. "If either of these were lacking," said Mr.Herndon, "Lincoln was the weakest man at the bar. When it fell to him toaddress the jury he often relied absolutely on the inspiration of themoment,--but he seldom failed to carry his point."Among the great number of opinions of Lincoln's rank as a lawyer,expressed by his professional brethren, a few may properly be given inclosing this chapter, which is devoted chiefly to Mr. Lincoln'sprofessional career. First we may quote the brief but emphatic words ofthe distinguished jurist, Judge Sidney Breese, Chief Justice ofIllinois, who said: "For my single self, I have for a quarter of acentury regarded Mr. Lincoln as the finest lawyer I ever knew, and of aprofessional bearing so high-toned and honorable, as justly, and withoutderogating from the claims of others, entitling him to be presented tothe profession as a model well worthy of the closest imitation."Another distinguished Chief Justice, Hon. John Dean Caton; says: "In1840 or 1841, I met Mr. Lincoln, and was for the first time associatedwith him in a professional way. We attended the Circuit Court atPontiac, Judge Treat presiding, where we were both engaged in thedefense of a man by the name of Lavinia. That was the first and onlytime I was associated with him at the bar. He practiced in a circuitthat was beyond the one in which I practiced, and consequently we werenot brought together much in the practice of the law. He stood well atthe bar from the beginning. I was a younger man, but an older lawyer. Hewas not admitted to the bar till after I was. I was not closelyconnected with him. Indeed, I did not meet him often, professionally,until I went on the bench in 1842; and he was then in full practicebefore the Supreme Court, and continued to practice there regularly atevery term until he was elected President. Mr. Lincoln understood therelations of things, and hence his deductions were rarely wrong from anygiven state of facts. So he applied the principles of law to thetransactions of men with great clearness and precision. He was a closereasoner. He reasoned by analogy, and enforced his views by aptillustration. His mode of speaking was generally of a plain andunimpassioned character, and yet he was the author of some of the mostbeautiful and eloquent passages in our language, which, if collected,would form a valuable contribution to American literature. The mostpunctilious honor ever marked his professional and private life."The Hon. Thomas Drummond, for many years Judge of the United StatesDistrict Court at Chicago, said: "It is not necessary to claim for Mr.Lincoln attributes or qualities which he did not possess. He had enoughto entitle him to the love and respect and esteem of all who knew him.He was not skilled in the learning of the schools, and his knowledge ofthe law was acquired almost entirely by his own unaided study and by thepractice of his profession. Nature gave him great clearness andacuteness of intellect and a vast fund of common-sense; and as aconsequence of these he had much sagacity in judging of the motives andsprings of human conduct. With a voice by no means pleasing, and,indeed, when excited, in its shrill tones sometimes almost disagreeable;without any of the personal graces of the orator; without much in theoutward man indicating superiority of intellect; without great quicknessof perception,--still, his mind was so vigorous, his comprehension soexact and clear, and his judgments so sure, that he easily mastered theintricacies of his profession, and became one of the ablest reasonersand most impressive speakers at our bar. With a probity of characterknown to all, with an intuitive insight into the human heart, with aclearness of statement which was itself an argument, with an uncommonpower and facility of illustration, often, it is true, of a plain andhomely kind, and with that sincerity and earnestness of manner to carryconviction, he was perhaps one of the most successful jury lawyers wehave ever had in the State. He always tried a case fairly and honestly.He never intentionally misrepresented the testimony of a witness or thearguments of an opponent. He met both squarely, and, if he could notexplain the one or answer the other, substantially admitted it. He nevermisstated the law according to his own intelligent view of it. Such wasthe transparent candor and integrity of his nature that he could notwell or strongly argue a side or a cause that he thought wrong. Ofcourse, he felt it his duty to say what could be said, and to leave thedecision to others; but there could be seen in such cases the inwardstruggle in his own mind. In trying a cause he might occasionally dwelltoo long or give too much importance to an inconsiderable point; butthis was the exception, and generally he went straight to the citadel ofa cause or a question, and struck home there, knowing if that were wonthe outwork would necessarily fall. He could hardly be called verylearned in his profession, and yet he rarely tried a cause without fullyunderstanding the law applicable to it. I have no hesitation in sayinghe was one of the ablest lawyers I have ever known. If he was forciblebefore the jury he was equally so with the court. He detected withunerring sagacity the marked points of his opponents' arguments, andpressed his own views with overwhelming force. His efforts were quiteunequal, and it may have been that he would not on some occasions strikeone as at all remarkable; but let him be thoroughly aroused, let himfeel that he was right and that some great principle was involved in hiscase, and he would come out with an earnestness of conviction, a powerof argument, and a wealth of illustration, that I have never seensurpassed.... Simple in his habits, without pretensions of any kind, anddistrustful of himself, he was willing to yield precedence and place toothers, when he ought to have claimed them for himself. He rarely, ifever, sought office except at the urgent solicitations of his friends.In substantiation of this, I may be permitted to relate an incidentwhich now occurs to me. Prior to his nomination for the Presidency, and,indeed, when his name was first mentioned in connection with that highoffice, I broached the subject upon the occasion of meeting him here.His response was, 'I hope they will select some abler man than myself.'"Mr. C.S. Parks, a lawyer associated with Lincoln for some years,furnishes the following testimony concerning his more prominentqualities: "I have often said that for a man who was for a quarter of acentury both a lawyer and a politician he was the most _honest_ man Iever knew. He was not only morally honest, but intellectually so. Hecould not reason falsely; if he attempted it, he failed. In politics hewould never try to mislead. At the bar, when he thought he was wrong, hewas the weakest lawyer I ever saw."Hon. David Davis, afterwards Associate Justice U.S. Supreme Court andU.S. Senator, presided over the Eighth Judicial Circuit of Illinoisduring the remaining years of Lincoln's practice at the bar. He wasunited to Lincoln in close bonds of friendship, and year after yeartravelled with him over the circuit, put up with him at the same hotels,and often occupied the same room with him. "This simple life," saysJudge Davis, "Mr. Lincoln loved, preferring it to the practice of thelaw in the city. In all the elements that constitute the great lawyer,he had few equals. He seized the strong points of a cause, and presentedthem with clearness and great compactness. He read law-books butlittle, except when the cause in hand made it necessary; yet he wasunusually self-reliant, depending on his own resources, and rarelyconsulting his brother lawyers either on the management of his case orthe legal questions involved. He was the fairest and most accommodatingof practitioners, granting all favors which he could do consistentlywith his duty to his client, and rarely availing himself of an unwaryoversight of his adversary. He hated wrong and oppression everywhere,and many a man, whose fraudulent conduct was undergoing review in acourt of justice, has withered under his terrific indignation andrebuke."Mr. Speed says: "As a lawyer, after his first year he was acknowledgedto be among the best in the State. His analytical powers weremarvellous. He always resolved every question into its primary elements,and gave up every point on his own side that did not seem to beinvulnerable. One would think, to hear him present his case in thecourt, he was giving his case away. He would concede point after pointto his adversary. But he always reserved a point upon which he claimed adecision in his favor, and his concessions magnified the strength of hisclaim. He rarely failed in gaining his cases in court."The special characteristics of Lincoln's practice at the bar are thusably summed up: "He did not make a specialty of criminal cases, but wasengaged frequently in them. He could not be called a great lawyer,measured by the extent of his acquirement of legal knowledge; he was notan encyclopaedia of cases; but in the clear perception of legalprinciples, with natural capacity to apply them, he had great ability.He was not a case lawyer, but a lawyer who dealt in the deep philosophyof the law. He always knew the cases which might be quoted as absoluteauthority, but beyond that he contented himself in the application anddiscussion of general principles. In the trial of a case he movedcautiously. He never examined or cross-examined a witness to thedetriment of his side. If the witness told the truth, he was safe fromhis attacks; but woe betide the unlucky and dishonest individual whosuppressed the truth or colored it against Mr. Lincoln's side. Hisspeeches to the jury were very effective specimens of forensic oratory.He talked the vocabulary of the people, and the jury understood everypoint he made and every thought he uttered. I never saw him when Ithought he was trying to make an effort for the sake of mere display;but his imagination was simple and pure in the richest gems of trueeloquence. He constructed short sentences of small words, and neverwearied the minds of the jury by mazes of elaboration."CHAPTER IX     Lincoln and Slavery--The Issue Becoming More Sharply     Defined--Resistance to the Spread of Slavery--Views Expressed by     Lincoln in 1850--His Mind Made Up--Lincoln as a Party Leader--The     Kansas Struggle--Crossing Swords with Douglas--A Notable Speech by     Lincoln--Advice to Kansas Belligerents--Honor in Politics--Anecdote     of Lincoln and Yates--Contest for the U.S. Senate in     1855--Lincoln's Defeat--Sketched by Members of the Legislature.At the death of Henry Clay, in June, 1852, Lincoln was invited todeliver a eulogy on Clay's life and character before the citizens ofSpringfield. He complied with the request on the 16th of July. The sameseason he made a speech before the Scott Club of Springfield, in replyto the addresses with which Douglas had opened his extended campaign ofthat summer, at Richmond, Virginia. Except on these two occasions,Lincoln took but little part in politics until the passage of theNebraska Bill by Congress in 1854. The enactment of this measureimpelled him to take a firmer stand upon the question of slavery than hehad yet assumed. He had been opposed to the institution on grounds ofsentiment since his boyhood; now he determined to fight it fromprinciple. Mr. Herndon states that Lincoln really became an anti-slaveryman in 1831, during his visit to New Orleans, where he was deeplyaffected by the horrors of the traffic in human beings. On one occasionhe saw a slave, a beautiful mulatto girl, sold at auction. She was feltover, pinched, and trotted around to show bidders she was sound. Lincolnwalked away from the scene with a feeling of deep abhorrence. He said toJohn Hanks, "_If I ever get a chance to hit that institution, John, I'llhit it hard_!" Again, in the summer of 1841, he was painfully impressedby a scene witnessed during his journey home from Kentucky, described ina letter written at the time to the sister of his friend Speed, in whichhe says: "A fine example was presented on board the boat forcontemplating the effect of conditions upon human happiness. A man hadpurchased twelve negroes in different parts of Kentucky, and was takingthem to a farm in the South. They were chained six and six together; asmall iron clevis was around the left wrist of each, and this wasfastened to the main chain by a shorter one, at a convenient distancefrom the others, so that the negroes were strung together like so manyfish upon a trot-line. In this condition they were being separatedforever from the scenes of their childhood, their friends, their fathersand mothers, brothers and sisters, and many of them from their wives andchildren, and going into perpetual slavery."Judge Gillespie records a conversation which he had with Lincoln in 1850on the slavery question, remarking by way of introduction that thesubject of slavery was the only one on which he (Lincoln) was apt tobecome excited. "I recollect meeting him once at Shelbyville," saysJudge Gillespie, "when he remarked that something must be done orslavery would overrun the whole country. He said there were about sixhundred thousand non-slaveholding whites in Kentucky to aboutthirty-three thousand slaveholders; that in the convention then recentlyheld it was expected that the delegates would represent these classesabout in proportion to their respective numbers; but when the conventionassembled, there was not a single representative of the non-slaveholdingclass; everyone was in the interest of the slaveholders; 'and,' said he,'the thing is spreading like wildfire over the country. In a few yearswe will be ready to accept the institution in Illinois, and the wholecountry will adopt it.' I asked him to what he attributed the changethat was going on in public opinion. He said he had recently put thatquestion to a Kentuckian, who answered by saying, 'You might have anyamount of land, money in your pocket, or bank-stock, and whiletravelling around nobody would be any wiser; but if you had a darkeytrudging at your heels, everybody would see him and know that you owneda slave. It is the most ostentatious way of displaying property in theworld; if a young man goes courting, the only inquiry is as to how manynegroes he owns.' The love for slave property was swallowing up everyother mercenary possession. Its ownership not only betokened thepossession of wealth, but indicated the gentleman of leisure who scornedlabor. These things Mr. Lincoln regarded as highly pernicious to thethoughtless and giddy young men who were too much inclined to look uponwork as vulgar and ungentlemanly. He was much excited, and said withgreat earnestness that this spirit ought to be met, and if possiblechecked; that slavery was a great and crying injustice, an enormousnational crime, and we could not expect to escape punishment for it. Iasked him how he would proceed in his efforts to check the spread ofslavery. He confessed he did not see his way clearly; but I think hemade up his mind that from that time he would oppose slavery actively. Iknow that Lincoln always contended that no man had any right, other thanwhat mere brute force gave him, to hold a slave. He used to say it wassingular that the courts would hold that a man never lost his right toproperty that had been stolen from him, but that he instantly _lost hisright to himself_ if he was stolen. Lincoln always contended that thecheapest way of getting rid of slavery was for the nation to buy theslaves and set them free."While in Congress, Lincoln had declared himself plainly as opposed toslavery; and in public speeches not less than private conversations hehad not hesitated to express his convictions on the subject. In 1850 hesaid to Major Stuart: "The time will soon come when we must all beDemocrats or Abolitionists. When that time comes, _my mind is made up_.The slavery question cannot be compromised." The hour had now struck inwhich Lincoln was to espouse with his whole heart and soul that causefor which finally he was to lay down his life. In the language of Mr.Arnold, "He had bided his time. He had waited until the harvest wasripe. With unerring sagacity he realized that the triumph of freedom wasat hand. He entered upon the conflict with the deepest conviction thatthe perpetuity of the Republic required the extinction of slavery. So,adopting as his motto, 'A house divided against itself cannot stand,' hegirded himself for the contest. The years from 1854 to 1860 were on hispart years of constant, active, and unwearied effort. His position inthe State of Illinois was central and commanding. He was now to becomethe recognized leader of the anti-slavery party in the Northwest, and inall the Valley of the Mississippi. Lincoln was a practical statesman,never attempting the impossible, but seeking to do the best thingpracticable under existing circumstances. He knew that prohibition inthe territories would result in no more slave states and no slaveterritory. And now, when the repeal of the Missouri Compromise shatteredall parties into fragments, he came forward to build up the Free Soilparty and threw into the conflict all his strength and vigor. Theconviction of his duty was deep and sincere. Hence he pleaded the causeof liberty with an energy, ability, and power which rapidly gained forhim a national reputation. Conscious of the greatness of his cause,inspired by a genuine love of liberty, animated and made strong by themoral sublimity of the conflict, he solemnly announced his determinationto speak for freedom and against slavery until--in his ownwords--wherever the Federal Government has power, 'the sun shall shine,the rain shall fall, and the wind shall blow upon no man who goes forthto unrequited toil.'"The absorbing political topic in 1855 was the contest in Kansas, whichproved the battle-ground for the struggle over the introduction ofslavery into the territories north of the line established by the"Missouri Compromise." Lincoln's views on the subject are defined in anotable letter to his friend Joshua Speed, a resident of Kentucky. Thefollowing passages show, in Lincoln's own words, where he stood on theslavery question at this memorable epoch:     SPRINGFIELD, AUGUST 24, 1855.     Dear Speed:--You know what a poor correspondent I am. Ever since I     received your very agreeable letter of the twenty-second of May, I     have been intending to write you in answer to it. You suggest that     in political action now, you and I would differ. You know I dislike     slavery, and you fully admit the abstract wrong of it. So far,     there is no cause of difference. But you say that sooner than yield     your legal right to the slave, especially at the bidding of those     who are not themselves interested, you would see the Union     dissolved. I am not aware that any one is bidding you yield that     right--very certainly I am not. I leave the matter entirely to     yourself. I also acknowledge your rights and my obligations under     the Constitution, in regard to your slaves. I confess I hate to see     the poor creatures hunted down, and caught, and carried back to     their stripes and unrequited toil; but I bite my lip and keep     quiet. In 1841 you and I had together a tedious low-water trip on a     steamboat from Louisville to St. Louis. You may remember, as I well     do, that from Louisville to the mouth of the Ohio, there were on     board ten or a dozen slaves, shackled together with irons. That     sight was a continual torment to me; and I see something like it     every time I touch the Ohio, or any other slave border. It is not     fair for you to assume that I have no interest in a thing which     has, and continually exercises, the power of making me miserable.     You ought rather to appreciate how much the great body of the     people of the North do crucify their feelings in order to maintain     their loyalty to the Constitution and the Union.     I do oppose the extension of slavery, because my judgment and     feelings so prompt me; and I am under no obligations to the     contrary. If for this you and I must differ, differ we must. You     say, if you were President you would send an army and hang the     leaders of the Missouri outrages upon the Kansas elections; still,     if Kansas fairly votes herself a slave State, she must be admitted,     or the Union must be dissolved. But how if she votes herself a     slave State unfairly--that is, by the very means for which you     would hang men? Must she still be admitted, or the Union dissolved?     That will be the phase of the question when it first becomes a     practical one. In your assumption that there may be a fair decision     of the slavery question in Kansas, I plainly see you and I would     differ about the Nebraska law. I look upon that enactment not as a     law but a violence from the beginning. It was conceived in     violence, passed in violence, is maintained in violence, and is     being executed in violence. I say it was conceived in violence,     because the destruction of the Missouri Compromise under the     Constitution was nothing less than violence. It was passed in     violence, because it could not have passed at all but for the votes     of many members in violent disregard of the known will of their     constituents. It is maintained in violence, because the elections     since clearly demand its repeal; and the demand is openly     disregarded. That Kansas will form a slave constitution, and with     it will ask to be admitted into the Union, I take to be already a     settled question, and so settled by the very means you so pointedly     condemn. By every principle of law ever held by any court, North or     South, every negro taken to Kansas is free; yet in utter disregard     of this--in the spirit of violence merely--that beautiful     Legislature gravely passes a law to hang any man who shall venture     to inform a negro of his legal rights. This is the substance and     real object of the law. If, like Haman, they should hang upon the     gallows of their own building, I shall not be among the mourners     for their fate. In my humble sphere I shall advocate the     restoration of the Missouri Compromise so long as Kansas remains a     Territory; and, when, by all these foul means, it seeks to come     into the Union as a slave State, I shall oppose it.... You inquire     where I now stand. That is a disputed point. I think I am a Whig;     but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an Abolitionist.     When I was in Washington I voted for the Wilmot Proviso as good as     forty times, and I never heard of any attempt to unwhig me for     that. I now do no more than oppose the extension of slavery. I am     not a Know-Nothing--that is certain. How could I be? How can anyone     who abhors the oppression of the negroes be in favor of degrading     classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me     to be pretty rapid. As a nation we began by declaring that 'all men     are created equal.' We now practically read it 'all men are created     equal, except negroes.' When the Know-Nothings get control, it will     read, 'all men are created equals, except negroes and foreigners     and Catholics.' When it comes to that, I should prefer emigrating     to some other country where they make no pretense of loving     liberty--to Russia for instance, where despotism can be taken pure,     and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.     Your friend forever,     A. LINCOLN.Lincoln was soon accorded an opportunity to cross swords again with hisformer political antagonist, Douglas, who had lately come from his placein the Senate Chamber at Washington, where he had carried the obnoxiousNebraska Bill against the utmost efforts of Chase, Seward, Sumner, andothers, to defeat it. As Mr. Arnold narrates the incident,--"When, latein September, 1854, Douglas returned to Illinois he was received with astorm of indignation which would have crushed a man of less power andwill. A bold and courageous leader, conscious of his personal power overhis party, he bravely met the storm and sought to allay it. In October,1854, the State Fair being then in session at Springfield, with a greatcrowd of people in attendance from all parts of the State, Douglas wentthere and made an elaborate and able speech in defense of the repeal ofthe Missouri Compromise. Lincoln was called upon by the opponents ofthis repeal to reply, and he did so with a power which he neversurpassed and had never before equalled. All other issues which haddivided the people were as chaff, and were scattered to the winds by theintense agitation which arose on the question of extending slavery, notmerely into free territory, but into territory which had been declaredfree by solemn compact. Lincoln's speech occupied more than three hoursin delivery, and during all that time he held the vast crowd in thedeepest attention."Mr. Herndon said of this event: "This anti-Nebraska speech of Mr.Lincoln was the profoundest that he made in his whole life. He feltburning upon his soul the truths which he uttered, and all presentfelt that he was true to his own soul. His feelings once or twice camenear stifling utterance. He quivered with emotion. He attacked theNebraska Bill with such warmth and energy that all felt that a man ofstrength was its enemy, and that he intended to blast it, if he could,by strong and manly efforts. He was most successful, and the houseapproved his triumph by loud and continued huzzas, while women wavedtheir white handkerchiefs in token of heartfelt assent. Douglas feltthe sting, and he frequently interrupted Mr. Lincoln; his friends feltthat he was crushed by the powerful argument of his opponent. TheNebraska Bill was shivered, and, like a tree of the forest, was tornand rent asunder by hot bolts of truth. At the conclusion of thisspeech, every man, woman, and child felt that it was unanswerable." Inspeaking of the same occasion, Mr. Lamon says: "Many fine speecheswere made upon the one absorbing topic; but it is no shame to any oneof these orators that their really impressive speeches were butslightly appreciated or long remembered beside Mr. Lincoln's splendidand enduring performance,--enduring in the memory of his auditors,although preserved upon no written or printed page."A few days after this encounter, Douglas spoke in Peoria, and wasfollowed by Lincoln with the same crushing arguments that had served himat the State Fair, and with the same triumphant effect. His Peoriaspeech was written out by him and published after its delivery. A fewspecimens will show its style and argumentative power.     Argue as you will, and as long as you will, this is the naked front     and aspect of the measure; and in this aspect it could not but     produce agitation. Slavery is founded in the selfishness of man's     nature; opposition to it, in his love of justice. These principles     are an eternal antagonism; and when brought into collision so     fiercely as slavery extension brings them, shocks, throes, and     convulsions must ceaselessly follow. Repeal the Missouri     Compromise; repeal all compromises; repeal the Declaration of     Independence; repeal all past history,--you still cannot repeal     human nature. It still will be the abundance of man's heart, that     slavery extension is wrong; and out of the abundance of his heart,     his mouth will continue to speak.... When Mr. Pettit, in connection     with his support of the Nebraska Bill, called the Declaration of     Independence 'a self-evident lie,' he only did what consistency and     candor require all other Nebraska men to do. Of the forty-odd     Nebraska Senators who sat present and heard him, no one rebuked     him.... If this had been said among Marion's men, Southerners     though they were, what would have become of the man who said it? If     this had been said to the men who captured Andre, the man who said     it would probably have been hung sooner than Andre was. If it had     been said in old Independence Hall seventy-eight years ago, the     very doorkeeper would have throttled the man, and thrust him into     the street.... Thus we see the plain, unmistakable spirit of that     early age towards slavery was hostility to the principle, and     toleration only by necessity. But now it is to be transformed into     a 'sacred right.' Nebraska brings it forth, places it on the high     road to extension and perpetuity, and with a pat on its back says     to it: 'Go, and God speed you.' Henceforth it is to be the chief     jewel of the nation, the very figurehead of the ship of state.     Little by little, but steadily as man's march to the grave, we have     been giving the old for the new faith. Nearly eighty years ago we     began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now from     that beginning we have run down to that other declaration, 'that     for _some_ men to enslave others is a sacred right of     self-government.' ... In our greedy chase to make profit of the     negro, let us beware lest we cancel and tear to pieces even the     white man's charter of freedom.... If all earthly power were given     me, I should not know what to do as to the existing institution. My     first impulse would be to free all the slaves, and send them to     Liberia--to their own native land. But, if they were all landed     there in a day, they would all perish in the next ten days; and     there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough to carry     them there in many times ten days. What then? Free them all, and     keep them among us as underlings? Is it quite certain that this     betters their condition? I think I would not hold one in slavery at     any rate; yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce     people upon. What next? Free them, and make them politically and     socially our equals? My own feelings will not admit of this; and,     if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of white     people will not. A universal feeling, whether well or ill founded,     cannot be safely disregarded. We cannot then make them equals. It     does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be     adopted; but, for their tardiness in this, I will not undertake to     judge our brethren of the South.     Our Republican robe is soiled--trailed in the dust. Let us repurify     it. Let us turn and wash it white, in the spirit, if not the blood,     of the Revolution. Let us turn slavery from its claims of 'moral     right,' back upon its existing legal rights and its arguments of     'necessity.' Let us return it to the position our fathers gave it,     and there let it rest in peace. Let us re-adopt the Declaration of     Independence, and with it the practices and policy which harmonize     with it. Let North and South--let all Americans--let all lovers of     liberty everywhere--join in the great and good work. If we do     this, we shall not only have saved the Union, but we shall have so     saved it as to make and to keep it forever worthy of the saving. We     shall have so saved it that the succeeding millions of free and     happy people, the world over, shall rise up and call us blessed to     the latest generations.It was in one of these speeches that Lincoln's power of repartee wasadmirably illustrated by a most laughable retort made by him to Douglas.Mr. Ralph E. Hoyt, who was present, says: "In the course of his speech,Mr. Douglas had said, 'The Whigs are all dead.' For some time beforespeaking, Lincoln sat on the platform with only his homely face visibleto the audience above the high desk before him. On being introduced, hearose from his chair and proceeded to straighten himself up. For a fewseconds I wondered when and where his head would cease its ascent; butat last it did stop, and 'Honest Old Abe' stood before us. He commenced,'Fellow-citizens: My friend, Mr. Douglas, made the startlingannouncement to-day that the Whigs are all dead. If this be so,fellow-citizens, you will now experience the novelty of hearing a speechfrom a dead man; and I suppose you might properly say, in the languageof the old hymn:    "Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound!"'This set the audience fairly wild with delight, and at once brought theminto full confidence with the speaker."Hating slavery though he did, Lincoln was steadily opposed to all formsof unlawful or violent opposition to it. At about the time of which weare speaking a party of Abolitionists in Illinois had become so excitedover the Kansas struggle that they were determined to go to the aid ofthe Free-State men in that territory. As soon as Lincoln learned of thisproject, he opposed it strongly. When they spoke to him of "Liberty,Justice, and God's higher law," he replied in this temperate andjudicious strain:Friends, you are in the minority--in a sad minority; and you can't hopeto succeed, reasoning from all human experience. You would rebel againstthe Government, and redden your hands in the blood of your countrymen.If you have the majority, as some of you say you have, you can succeedwith the ballot, throwing away the bullet. You can peaceably, then,redeem the Government and preserve the liberties of mankind, throughyour votes and voice and moral influence. _Let there be peace_. In ademocracy, where the majority rule by the ballot through the forms oflaw, these physical rebellions and bloody resistances are radicallywrong, unconstitutional, and are treason. Better bear the ills you havethan fly to those you know not of. Our own Declaration of Independencesays that governments long established should not be resisted fortrivial causes. Revolutionize through the ballot-box, and restore theGovernment once more to the affection and hearts of men, by making itexpress, as it was intended to do, the highest spirit of justice andliberty. Your attempt, if there be such, to resist the laws of Kansas byforce, will be criminal and wicked; and all your feeble attempts will befollies, and end in bringing sorrow on your heads, and ruin the causeyou would freely die to preserve.No doubt was felt of Lincoln's sympathies; indeed, he is known to havecontributed money to the Free-State cause. But it is noticeable that inthis exciting episode he showed the same coolness, wisdom, moderation,love of law and order that so strongly characterized his conduct in thestormier period of the Civil War, and without which it is doubtful if hewould have been able to save the nation.Some interesting recollections of the events of this stirring period,and of Lincoln's part in them, are given by Mr. Paul Selby, for a longtime editor of the "State Journal" at Springfield, and one ofLincoln's old-time friends and political associates. "While AbrahamLincoln had the reputation of being inspired by an almost unboundedambition," says Mr. Selby, "it was of that generous quality whichcharacterized his other attributes, and often led him voluntarily torestrain its gratification in deference to the conflicting aspirationsof his friends. All remember his magnanimity towards Col. Edward D.Baker, when the latter was elected to Congress from the SpringfieldDistrict in 1844, and the frankness with which he informed Baker ofhis own desire to be a candidate in 1846--when for the only time inhis life, he was elected to that body. In 1852, Richard Yates ofJacksonville, then recognized as one of the rising young orators andstatesmen of the West, was elected to Congress for the second timefrom the Springfield District. It was during the term following thiselection that the Kansas-Nebraska issue was precipitated upon thecountry by Senator Douglas, in the introduction of his bill for therepeal of the Missouri Compromise. Yates, in obedience to hisimpulses, which were always on the side of freedom, took strong groundagainst the measure--notwithstanding the fact that a majority of hisconstituents, though originally Whigs, were strongly conservative, aswas generally the case with people who were largely of Kentucky andTennessee origin. In 1854 the Whig party, which had been divided onthe Kansas-Nebraska question, began to manifest symptoms ofdisintegration; while the Republican party, though not yet known bythat name, began to take form. At this time I was publishing a paperat Jacksonville, Yates's home; and although from the date of myconnection with it, in 1852, it had not been a political paper, theintroduction of a new issue soon led me to take decided ground on theside of free territory. Lincoln at once sprang into prominence as oneof the boldest, most vigorous and eloquent opponents of Mr. Douglas'smeasure, which was construed as a scheme to secure the admission ofslavery into all the new territories of the United States. At thattime Lincoln's election to a seat in Congress would probably have beenvery grateful to his ambition, as well as acceptable in a pecuniarypoint of view; and his prominence and ability had already attractedthe eyes of the whole State toward him in a special degree. Havingoccasion to visit Springfield one day while the subject of theselection of a candidate was under consideration among the opponentsof the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, I encountered Mr. Lincoln on the street.As we walked along, the subject of the choice of a candidate forCongress to succeed Yates came up, when I stated that many of theold-line Whigs and anti-Nebraska men in the western part of thedistrict were looking to him as an available leader. While he seemedgratified by the compliment, he said: 'No; Yates has been a true andfaithful Representative, and should be returned.' Yates wasrenominated; and although he ran ahead of his ticket, yet so far hadthe disorganization of the Whig party then progressed, and so strong afoothold had the pro-slavery sentiment obtained in the district, thathe was defeated by Major Thomas L. Harris, of Petersburg, whom he haddefeated when he first entered the field as a candidate four yearsbefore. While it is scarcely probable that Lincoln, if he had been acandidate, could have changed the result, yet the prize was one whichhe would then have considered worth contending for; and if thenomination could have been tendered him without doing injustice to hisfriend, he would undoubtedly have accepted it gladly and thrown allthe earnestness and ability which he possessed into the contest. Thisinstance only illustrates a feature of his character which has sooften been recognized and commented upon--his generosity toward thoseamong his political friends who might be regarded as occupying theposition of rivals."In 1854, during Lincoln's absence from Springfield, he was nominated asa candidate for the State Legislature. It was in one of Lincoln'speriods of profound depression, and it was with the greatest difficultythat he could be persuaded to accept the nomination. "I went to seehim," says one of his close political friends, Mr. William Jayne, "inorder to get his consent to run. This was at his house. He was then thesaddest man I ever saw--the gloomiest. He walked up and down the floor,almost crying; and to all my persuasions to let his name stand in thepaper, he said, 'No, I can't. You don't know all. I say you don't beginto know one-half; and that's enough.'" His name, however, was allowed tostand, and he was elected by about 600 majority. But Lincoln was thenextremely desirous of succeeding General James Shields, whose term inthe United States Senate was to expire the following March. The SenateChamber had long been the goal of his ambition. He summed up hisfeelings in a letter to Hon. N.B. Judd, some years after, saying, "Iwould rather have a full term in the United States Senate than thePresidency." He therefore resigned his seat in the Legislature--the factthat a majority in both houses was opposed to the Nebraska Bill allowinghim to do so without injury to his party--and became a candidate for theSenate. But the act was futile. When the Legislature met, in February,1855, to make choice of a Senator, a clique of anti-Nebraska Democratsheld out so firmly against the nomination of Lincoln that there wasdanger of the Whigs leaving their candidate altogether. In this dilemmaLincoln was consulted. Mr. Lamon thus describes the incident: "Lincolnsaid, unhesitatingly, 'You ought to drop me and go for Trumbull; that isthe only way you can defeat Matteson.' Judge Logan came up about thattime, and insisted on running Lincoln still; but the latter said, 'Ifyou do, you will lose both Trumbull and myself; and I think the cause inthis case is to be preferred to men.' We adopted his suggestion, andtook up Trumbull and elected him, although it grieved us to the heart togive up Lincoln." Mr. Parks, a member of the Legislature at this time,and one of Lincoln's intimate friends, said: "Mr. Lincoln was very muchdisappointed, for I think it was the height of his ambition to get intothe United States Senate. Yet he manifested no bitterness toward Mr.Judd or the other anti-Nebraska Democrats by whom politically he wasbeaten, but evidently thought their motives were right. He told meseveral times afterwards that the election of Trumbull was the bestthing that could have happened."Hon. Elijah M. Haines, ex-Speaker of the Illinois Legislature, aresident of the State for over half a century, and one of Lincoln'searly friends, was a member of the Legislature during the Senatorialstruggle just referred to. His familiarity with all its incidents lendsvalue to his distinct and vivid recollections. "Abraham Lincoln had beenelected a member of the House on the Fusion ticket, with Judge StephenT. Logan, for the district composed of Sangamon County," writes Mr.Haines. "But it being settled that the Fusion party--which was ananti-Douglas combination, including Whigs, Free-Soilers, Know-Nothings,etc.--would have a majority of the two houses on ballot, Mr. Lincoln wasinduced to become a candidate for United States Senator, for the supportof that party. He therefore did not qualify as a member. Although Mr.Lincoln never acquired the reputation of being an office-seeker, yet ithappened frequently that his name would be mentioned in connection withsome important position. He became quite early in life one of theprominent leaders of the Whig party of the State, and for a long time,in connection with a few devoted associates, led the forlorn hope ofthat party. During a period of about twenty years there was seldom morethan one Whig member in the Illinois delegation of Congressmen. TheSangamon district, in which Mr. Lincoln lived, was always sure to electa Whig member when the party was united; but it contained quite a numberof aspiring Whig orators, and there was a kind of understanding betweenthem that no one who attained the position of Representative in Congressshould hold it longer than one term; that he would then give way for thenext favorite. Mr. Lincoln had held the position once, and its return tohim was far in the future. The Fusion triumph in the Legislature wasconsidered by the Whig element as a success, in which they acknowledgedgreat obligation to Mr. Lincoln. That element in the Fusion partytherefore urged his claims as the successor of General Shields. His oldassociate and tried friend in the Whig cause, Judge Logan, became thechampion of his interests in the House of Representatives. I was presentand saw something of Mr. Lincoln during the early part of the session,before the vote for Senator was taken. He was around among the membersmuch of the time. His manner was agreeable and unassuming; he was notforward in pressing his case upon the attention of members, yet beforethe interview would come to a close some allusion to the Senatorshipwould generally occur, when he would respond in some such way as this:'Gentlemen, that is rather a delicate subject for me to talk upon; but Imust confess that I would be glad of your support for the office, if youshall conclude that I am the proper person for it.' When he hadfinished, he would generally take occasion to withdraw before anydiscussion on the subject arose. When the election of Senator occurred,in February, Lincoln received 45 votes--the highest number of any ofthe candidates, and within six votes of enough to secure his election.This was on the first ballot, after which Lincoln's votes declined.After the ninth ballot, Mr. Lincoln stepped forward--or, as Mr. Richmondexpresses it, _leaned_ forward from his position in the lobby--andrequested the committee to withdraw his name. On the tenth ballot JudgeTrumbull received fifty-one votes and was declared elected." Thus wereLincoln's political ambitions again frustrated. But their realizationwas only delayed for the far grander triumph that was so soon to come,although no man then foresaw its coming.CHAPTER X     Birth of the Republican Party--Lincoln One of Its Fathers--Takes     His Stand with the Abolitionists--The Bloomington     Convention--Lincoln's Great Anti-Slavery Speech--A Ratification     Meeting of Three--The First National Republican     Convention--Lincoln's Name Presented for the     Vice-Presidency--Nomination of Fremont and Dayton--Lincoln in the     Campaign of 1856--His Appearance and Influence on the     Stump--Regarded as a Dangerous Man--His Views on the Politics of     the Future--First Visit to Cincinnati--Meeting with Edwin M.

It had becometoo narrow and restricted to answer the needs of the hour. A newplatform was demanded, one that would admit the great principles andissues growing out of the slavery agitation. A convention of the Whigleaders throughout the country met at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on the22d of February of that year, to consider the necessity of a neworganization. A little later, Mr. Herndon, in the office of Lincoln,prepared a call for a convention at Bloomington, Illinois, "summoningtogether all those who wished to see the government conducted on theprinciples of Washington and Jefferson." This call was signed by themost prominent Abolitionists of Illinois, with the name of A. LINCOLN atthe head. The morning after its publication, Major Stuart entered Mr.Herndon's office in a state of extreme excitement, and, as the latterrelates, demanded: "'Sir, did Mr. Lincoln sign that Abolition call whichis published this morning?' I answered, 'Mr. Lincoln did not sign thatcall.' 'Did Lincoln authorize you to sign it?' 'No, he never authorizedme to sign it.' 'Then do you know that you have ruined Mr. Lincoln?' 'Idid not know that I had ruined Mr. Lincoln; did not intend to do so;thought he was a made man by it; that the time had come whenconservatism was a crime and a blunder.' 'You, then, take theresponsibility of your acts, do you?' 'I do, most emphatically.'However, I instantly sat down and wrote to Mr. Lincoln, who was then inPekin or Tremont--possibly at court. He received my letter, andinstantly replied, either by letter or telegraph--most likely byletter--that he adopted _in toto_ what I had done, and promised to meetthe radicals--Lovejoy and such like men--among us." Mr. Herndon adds:"Never did a man change as Lincoln did from that hour. No sooner had heplanted himself right on the slavery question than his whole soul seemedburning. _He blossomed right out._ Then, too, other spiritual thingsgrew more real to him."Mr. Herndon had been an Abolitionist from birth. It was an inheritancewith him; but Lincoln's conversion was a gradual process, stimulated andconfirmed by the influence of his companion. "From 1854 to 1860," saysMr. Herndon, "I kept putting into Lincoln's hands the speeches andsermons of Theodore Parker, Wendell Phillips, and Henry Ward Beecher. Itook 'The Anti-Slavery Standard' for years before 1856, 'The ChicagoTribune,' and 'The New York Tribune'; kept them in my office, kept thempurposely on my table, and would read to Lincoln the good, sharp, solidthings, well put. Lincoln was a natural anti-slavery man, as I think,and yet he needed watching,--needed hope, faith, energy; and I think I_warmed him_."It is stated that "when Herndon was very young--probably before Mr.Lincoln made his first protest in the Legislature of the State in behalfof liberty--Lincoln once said to him: 'I cannot see what makes yourconvictions so decided as regards the future of slavery. What tells youthe thing must be rooted out?' 'I feel it in my bones,' was Herndon'semphatic answer. 'This continent is not broad enough to endure thecontest between freedom and slavery!' It was almost in these very wordsthat Lincoln afterwards opened the great contest with Douglas. From thistime forward he submitted all public questions to what he called 'thetest of Bill Herndon's _bone philosophy_'; and their arguments wereclose and protracted."Lincoln's attitude on slavery aroused formidable opposition among hisfriends, and even in his own family. Mrs. Lincoln was decidedlypro-slavery in her views. Once while riding with a friend she said: "Ifmy husband dies, his spirit will never find me residing outside thelimits of a slave State." But opposition, whether from without orwithin, could never swerve him from a course to which conscience andreason clearly impelled him. Long before Mr. Herndon published the callfor the Bloomington convention, he had said to a deputation of men fromChicago, in answer to the inquiry whether Lincoln could be trusted forfreedom: "Can you trust yourselves? If you can, you can trust Lincolnforever."The convention met at Bloomington, May 29, 1856. One of its chiefincidents was a speech by Lincoln. This speech was one of the greatefforts of his life, and had a powerful influence on the convention."Never," says one of the delegates, "was an audience more completelyelectrified by human eloquence. Again and again his hearers sprang totheir feet, and by long continued cheers expressed how deeply thespeaker had aroused them." "It was there," says Mr. Herndon in one ofhis lectures, "that Lincoln was baptized and joined our church. He madea speech to us. I have heard or read all of Mr. Lincoln's greatspeeches; and I give it as my opinion that the Bloomington speech wasthe grand effort of his life. Heretofore, and up to this moment, he hadsimply argued the slavery question on grounds of policy,--on what arecalled the _statesman's_ grounds,--never reaching the question of theradical and eternal right. Now he was newly baptized and freshly born;he had the fervor of a new convert; the smothered flame broke out;enthusiasm unusual to him blazed up; his eyes were aglow withinspiration; he felt a new and more vital justice; his heart was aliveto the right; his sympathies burst forth; and he stood before the throneof the eternal Right, in presence of his God, and then and thereunburdened his penitential and fired soul. This speech was fresh, new,genuine, odd, original; filled with fervor not unmixed with a divineenthusiasm; his head breathing out through his tender heart its truths,its sense of right, and its feeling of the good and for the good. Thisspeech was full of fire and energy and force; it was logic; it waspathos; it was enthusiasm; it was justice, equity, truth, right, andgood, set ablaze by the divine fires of a soul maddened by wrong; it washard, heavy, knotty, gnarly, edged, and heated. I attempted for aboutfifteen minutes, as was usual with me then, to take notes; but at theend of that time I threw pen and paper to the dogs, and lived only inthe inspiration of the hour. If Mr. Lincoln was six feet four incheshigh usually, _at Bloomington he was seven feet_, and inspired at that.From that day to the day of his death, he stood firm on the right. Hefelt his great cross, had his great idea, nursed it, kept it, taught itto others, and in his fidelity bore witness of it to his death, andfinally sealed it with his precious blood."The committee on resolutions at the convention found themselves, afterhours of discussion, unable to agree; and at last they sent for Lincoln.He suggested that all could unite on the principles of the Declarationof Independence and hostility to the extension of slavery. "Let us,"said he, "in building our new party make our cornerstone theDeclaration of Independence; let us build on this rock, and the gates ofhell shall not prevail against us." The problem was mastered, and theconvention adopted the following:     _Resolved_, That we hold, in accordance with the opinions and     practices of all the great statesmen of all parties for the first     sixty years of the administration of the government, that under the     Constitution Congress possesses full power to prohibit slavery in     the territories; and that while we will maintain all constitutional     rights of the South, we also hold that justice, humanity, the     principles of freedom, as expressed in our Declaration of     Independence and our National Constitution, and the purity and     perpetuity of our government, require that that power should be     exerted to prevent the extension of slavery into territories     heretofore free.The Bloomington convention concluded its work by choosing delegates tothe National Republican convention to be held at Philadelphia thefollowing month, for the nomination of candidates for the Presidency andVice-presidency of the United States. And thus was organized theRepublican party in Illinois, which revolutionized the politics of theState and elected Lincoln to the Presidency.The people of Bloomington seem to have had but little sympathy with thisconvention. A few days later, Herndon and Lincoln tried to hold aratification meeting; but only three persons were present--Lincoln,Herndon, and John Pain. "When Lincoln came into the court-room where themeeting was to be held," says Herndon, "there was an expression ofsadness and amusement on his face. He walked to the stand, mounted it ina kind of mockery--mirth and sadness all combined--and said, 'Gentlemen,this meeting is larger than I thought it would be. I knew that Herndonand myself would come, but I did not know that anyone else would behere; and yet another has come--you, John Pain. These are sad times,and seem out of joint. All seems dead; but the age is not yet dead; itliveth as sure as our Maker liveth. Under all this seeming want of lifeand motion, the world does move nevertheless. Be hopeful. And now let usadjourn and appeal to the people.'"The National convention of the Republican party met at Philadelphia inJune, 1856, and adopted a declaration of principles substantially basedupon those of the Bloomington convention. John C. Fremont was nominatedas candidate for President. Among the names presented for Vice-presidentwas that of Abraham Lincoln, who received 110 votes. William L. Daytonreceived 259 votes and was unanimously declared the nominee. Fremont andDayton thus became the standard-bearers of the new national party. Whenthe news reached Lincoln, in Illinois, that he had received 110 votes asnominee for the Vice-presidency, he could not at first believe that hewas the man voted for, and said, "No, it could not be; it must have beenthe great Lincoln of Massachusetts!" He was then in one of hismelancholy moods, full of depression and despondency.In the stirring presidential campaign of 1856, Lincoln was particularlyactive, and rendered most efficient service to the Republican party. Hespoke constantly, discussing the great question of "slavery in theterritories" in a manner at once original and masterly. A graphicpicture of one of these campaign gatherings is furnished by Hon. WilliamBross, afterwards Lieutenant-Governor of Illinois. "I first met Mr.Lincoln, to know him," says Governor Bross, "at Vandalia, the oldcapital of the State, in October, 1856. There was to be a politicalmeeting in front of the old State House, in the center of the square, at2 o'clock. Soon after that hour the sonorous voice of Dr. Curdy rangthrough the town: 'O, yes! O, yes! All ye who want to hear publicspeaking, draw near!' The crowd at once began to gather from all sidesof the square. The Doctor then introduced the first speaker, and heproceeded to make the best presentation he could of the principles ofthe newly-formed Republican party, and the reasons why Fremont, 'thegallant pathfinder of the West,' should be elected President. About thetime the first speaker closed his remarks, Hon. Ebenezer Peck andAbraham Lincoln arrived and took the stand; and both made able andeffective speeches. After that, Lincoln and I frequently met during thecanvass, and often afterwards I spoke with him from the same platform.The probable result of an election was often canvassed, and a noticeablefact was that in most cases he would mark the probable result belowrather than above the actual majority."Some lively reminiscences of Lincoln's appearance and efforts in thiscampaign are given by Mr. Noah Brooks, the well-known journalist andauthor, who at that time lived in Northern Illinois and attended many ofthe great Republican mass-meetings. "At one of these great assemblies inOgle County," says Mr. Brooks, "to which the country people came onhorseback, in farm wagons, or afoot, from far and near, there wereseveral speakers of local celebrity. Dr. Egan of Chicago, famous for hisracy stories, was one; and Joe Knox of Bureau County, a stump speaker ofrenown, was another attraction. Several other orators were 'on thebills' for this long-advertised 'Fremont and Dayton rally,' among thembeing a Springfield lawyer who had won some reputation as a closereasoner, and a capital speaker on the stump. This was Abraham Lincoln,popularly known as 'Honest Abe Lincoln.' In those days he was not sofamous in our part of the State as the two speakers whom I have named.Possibly he was not so popular among the masses of the people; but hisready wit, his unfailing good humor, and the candor which gave him hischaracter for honesty, won for him the admiration and respect of allwho heard him. I remember once meeting a choleric old Democrat stridingaway from an open-air meeting where Lincoln was speaking, striking theearth with his cane as he stumped along, and exclaiming, 'He's adangerous man, sir! A d----d dangerous man! He makes you _believe_ whathe says, in spite of yourself!' It was Lincoln's manner. He admittedaway his whole case apparently--and yet, as his political opponentscomplained, he usually carried conviction with him. As he reasoned withhis audience, he bent his long form over the railing of the platform,stooping lower and lower as he pursued his argument, until, havingreached his point, he clinched it, usually with a question, and thensuddenly sprang upright, reminding one of the springing open of ajack-knife blade. At the Ogle County meeting to which I refer, Lincolnled off, the raciest speakers being reserved for the latter part of thepolitical entertainment. I am bound to say that Lincoln did not awakenthe boisterous applause which some of those who followed him did, buthis speech made a more lasting impression. It was talked about for weeksafterward in the neighborhood, and it probably changed many votes; forthat was the time when Free-soil votes were being made in NorthernIllinois."Mr. Brooks had made Lincoln's acquaintance early in the day referred to;and after Lincoln had spoken, and while some of the other orators wereentertaining the audience, the two drew a little off from the crowd andfell into a discussion over the political situation and prospects. "Wecrawled under the pendulous branches of a tree," says Mr. Brooks, "andLincoln, lying flat on the ground, with his chin in his hands, talkedon, rather gloomily as to the present but absolutely confident as to thefuture. I was dismayed to find that he did not believe it possible thatFremont could be elected. As if half pitying my youthful ignorance, butadmiring my enthusiasm, he said, 'Don't be discouraged if we don'tcarry the day this year. We can't do it, that's certain. We can't carryPennsylvania; those old Whigs down there are too strong for us. But weshall sooner or later elect our President. I feel confident of that.''Do you think we shall elect a Free-soil President in 1860?' I asked.'Well, I don't know. Everything depends on the course of the Democracy.There's a big anti-slavery element in the Democratic party, and if wecould get hold of that we might possibly elect our man in 1860. But it'sdoubtful, very doubtful. Perhaps we shall be able to fetch it by 1864;perhaps not. As I said before, the Free-soil party is bound to win inthe long run. It may not be in my day; but it will be in yours, I doreally believe.'" The defeat of Fremont soon verified Lincoln'sprediction on that score.A peculiarly interesting episode of Lincoln's life belongs to thisperiod, though unrelated to political events. This was the meeting, in aprofessional way, with Edwin M. Stanton, at that time a prominent lawyerof Pittsburgh, afterwards the great War Secretary of President Lincoln'scabinet. The circumstances were briefly these: Among Lincoln's law caseswas one connected with the patent of the McCormick Reaper; and in thesummer of 1857 he visited Cincinnati to argue the case before JudgeMcLean of the United States Circuit Court. It was a case of greatimportance, involving the foundation patent of the machine which wasdestined to revolutionize the harvesting of grain. Reverdy Johnson wason one side of the case, and E.M. Stanton and George Harding on theother. It became necessary, in addition, to have a lawyer who was aresident of Illinois; and inquiry was made of Hon. E.B. Washburne, thenin Congress, as to whether he knew a suitable man. The latter repliedthat "there was a man named Lincoln at Springfield, who had considerablereputation in the State." Lincoln was retained in the case, and came onto Cincinnati with a brief. Stanton and Harding saw in their associatecounsel "a tall, dark, uncouth man, who did not strike them as of anyaccount, and, indeed, they gave him hardly any chance." An interestingaccount of this visit, and of various incidents connected with it, hasbeen prepared by the Hon. W.M. Dickson of Cincinnati. "Mr. Lincoln cameto the city," says Mr. Dickson, "a few days before the argument tookplace, and remained during his stay at the house of a friend. The casewas one of large importance pecuniarily, and in the law questionsinvolved. Reverdy Johnson represented the plaintiff. Mr. Lincoln hadprepared himself with the greatest care; his ambition was to speak inthe case, and to measure swords with the renowned lawyer from Baltimore.It was understood between his client and himself, before his coming,that Mr. Harding of Philadelphia was to be associated with him in thecase, and was to make the 'mechanical argument.' Mr. Lincoln was alittle surprised and annoyed after reaching Cincinnati, to learn thathis client had also associated with him Mr. Edwin M. Stanton, ofPittsburgh, and a lawyer of our own bar; the reason assigned being thatthe importance of the case required a man of the experience and power ofMr. Stanton to meet Mr. Johnson. The reasons given did not remove theslight conveyed in the employment, without consultation with Lincoln, ofthis additional counsel. He keenly felt it, but acquiesced. The trial ofthe case came on; the counsel for defense met each morning forconsultation. On one of these occasions one of the counsel moved thatonly two of them should speak in the case. This motion was alsoacquiesced in. It had always been understood that Mr. Harding was tospeak to explain the mechanism of the reapers. So this motion excludedeither Mr. Lincoln or Mr. Stanton. By the custom of the bar, as betweencounsel of equal standing and in the absence of any action of theclient, the original counsel speaks. By this rule Mr. Lincoln hadprecedence. Mr. Stanton suggested to Mr. Lincoln to make the speech. Mr.Lincoln answered, 'No; you speak,' Mr. Stanton replied, 'I will,' andtaking up his hat, said he would go and make preparation. Mr. Lincolnacquiesced in this, but was deeply grieved and mortified; he took butlittle more interest in the case, though remaining until the conclusionof the trial. He seemed to be greatly depressed, and gave evidence ofthat tendency to melancholy which so marked his character. His partingon leaving the city cannot be forgotten. Cordially shaking the hand ofhis hostess, he said: 'You have made my stay here most agreeable, and Iam a thousand times obliged to you; but as for repeating my visit, Imust say to you I never expect to be in Cincinnati again. I have nothingagainst the city, but things have so happened here as to make itundesirable for me ever to return.' Thus untowardly met for the firsttime, Lincoln and Stanton. Little did either then suspect that they wereto meet again on a larger theatre, to become the chief actors in a greathistorical epoch."If Lincoln was "surprised and annoyed" at the treatment he received fromStanton, the latter was no less surprised, and a good deal moredisgusted, on seeing Lincoln and learning of his connection with thecase. He made no secret of his contempt for the "long, lank creaturefrom Illinois," as he afterwards described him, "wearing a dirty linenduster for a coat, on the back of which the perspiration had splotchedwide stains that resembled a dirty map of the continent." He blurted outhis wrath and indignation to his associate counsel, declaring that if"that giraffe" was permitted to appear in the case he would throw up hisbrief and leave it. Lincoln keenly felt the affront, but his greatnature forgave it so entirely that, recognizing the singular abilitiesof Stanton beneath his brusque exterior, he afterwards, for the publicgood, appointed him to a seat in his cabinet.Lincoln, says Mr. Dickson, "remained in Cincinnati about a week, movingfreely about. Yet not twenty men in the city knew him personally, orknew he was here; not a hundred would have known who he was had his namebeen given to them. He came with the fond hope of making fame in aforensic contest with Reverdy Johnson. He was pushed aside, humiliatedand mortified. He attached to the innocent city the displeasure thatfilled his bosom, and shook its dust from his feet."In his Autobiography, Moncure D. Conway records a glimpse of Lincolnduring his Cincinnati visit that seems worth transcribing. "One warmevening in 1859, passing through the market-place in Cincinnati, I foundthere a crowd listening to a political speech in the open air. Thespeaker stood on the balcony of a small brick house, some lampsassisting the moonlight. Something about the speaker, and some wordsthat reached me, led me to press nearer. I asked the speaker's name, andlearned that it was Abraham Lincoln. Browning's description of theGerman professor, 'Three parts sublime to one grotesque,' was applicableto this man. The face had a battered and bronzed look, without beinghard. His nose was prominent, and buttressed a strong and high forehead.His eyes were high-vaulted, and had an expression of sadness; his mouthand chin were too close together, the cheeks hollow. On the whole,Lincoln's appearance was not attractive until one heard his voice, whichpossessed variety of expression, earnestness, and shrewdness in everytone. The charm of his manner was that he had no manner; he was simple,direct, humorous. He pleasantly repeated a mannerism of hisopponent,--'This is what Douglas calls his '_gur-reat per-rinciple.'_But the next words I remember were these: '_Slavery is wrong_.'"CHAPTER XI     The Great Lincoln-Douglas Debate--Rivals for the U.S.     Senate--Lincoln's "House-Divided-against-Itself" Speech--An     Inspired Oration--Alarming His Friends--Challenges Douglas to a     Joint Discussion--The Champions Contrasted--Their Opinions of Each     Other--Lincoln and Douglas on the Stump--Slavery the Leading     Issue--Scenes and Anecdotes of the Great Debate--Pen-Picture of     Lincoln on the Stump--Humors of the Campaign--Some Sharp     Rejoinders--Words of Soberness--Close of the Conflict.The year 1858 is memorable alike in the career of Lincoln and in thepolitical history of the country. It was distinguished by the jointdiscussions between the two great political leaders of Illinois, whichrank among the ablest forensic debates that have taken place since thefoundation of the republic. The occasion was one to call out thegreatest powers of the two remarkable men who there contested forpolitical supremacy. It was not alone that Lincoln and Douglas wereopposing candidates for a high office--that of Senator of the UnitedStates: they were the champions and spokesmen of their parties at acritical period when great issues were to be discussed and greatmovements outlined and directed. It was naturally expected that thewinner in the contest would become the political leader of his State.Little was it imagined that the loser would become the leader and saviorof the Nation.On the 21st of April the Democratic convention of Illinois met atSpringfield and announced Stephen A. Douglas, then United StatesSenator, as its choice for another term. June 16 the Republicanconvention met at the same place and declared unanimously that "AbrahamLincoln is our first and only choice for United States Senator to fillthe vacancy about to be created by the expiration of Mr. Douglas's termof office." For a number of days previous to the meeting of theRepublican convention Lincoln had been engaged in preparing a speech forthe occasion. It was composed after his usual method--the separatethoughts jotted down as they came to him, on scraps of paper at hand atthe moment, and these notes were arranged in order and elaborated into afinished essay, copied on large sheets of paper in a plain and legiblehandwriting. This was the speech which afterwards came to be socelebrated as the "house-divided-against-itself" speech. Lincoln wasgravely conscious of its unusual importance, and gave great care anddeliberation to its composition. The evening of June 16--the day of hisnomination by the convention--Lincoln went to his office, accompanied byhis friend Herndon, and having locked the door proceeded to read hisspeech. Slowly and distinctly he read the first paragraph, and thenturned to Herndon with, "What do you think of that?" Mr. Herndon wasstartled at its boldness. "I think," said he, "it is all true. But is itentirely politic to read or speak it as it is written?" "That makes nodifference," said Lincoln. "That expression is a truth of all humanexperience,--'a house divided against itself cannot stand.' Theproposition is indisputably true, and has been true for more than sixthousand years; I want to use some universally known figure, expressedin simple language, that may strike home to the minds of men in order torouse them to the peril of the times." Mr. Herndon was convinced byLincoln's language, and advised him to deliver the speech just as it waswritten. Lincoln was satisfied, but thought it would be prudent toconsult a few other friends in the matter, and about a dozen were calledin. "After seating them at the round table," says John Armstrong, one ofthe number, "he read that clause or section of his speech which reads,'a house divided against itself cannot stand,' etc. He read it slowlyand cautiously, so as to let each man fully understand it. After he hadfinished the reading, he asked the opinions of his friends as to thewisdom or policy of it. Every man among them condemned the speech insubstance and spirit, especially that section quoted above, as unwiseand impolitic if not untrue. They unanimously declared that the wholespeech was too far in advance of the times. Herndon sat still while theywere giving their respective opinions of its unwisdom and impolicy; thenhe sprang to his feet and said, 'Lincoln, deliver it _just as it reads_.If it is in advance of the times, let us lift the people to its level.The speech is true, wise, and politic, and will succeed now or in thefuture. Nay, it will aid you, if it will not make you President of theUnited States.' Mr. Lincoln sat still a moment, then rose from hischair, walked backwards and forwards in the hall, stopped, and said:'Friends, I have thought about this matter a great deal, have weighedthe questions from all corners, and am thoroughly convinced the time hascome when this speech should be uttered; and if it be that I must godown because of it, then let me go down linked to truth--die in theadvocacy of what is right and just. This nation cannot live oninjustice; "a house divided against itself cannot stand," I say againand again.' This was spoken with emotion--the effects of his love oftruth, and sorrow from the disagreement of his friends."On the next evening the speech was delivered to an immense audience inthe hall of the House of Representatives at Springfield. "The hall andlobbies and galleries were even more densely crowded and packed than atany time during the day," says the official report; and as Lincoln"approached the speaker's stand, he was greeted with shouts and hurrahs,and prolonged cheers." The prophetic sentences which dropped first fromthe lips of the speaker were freighted with a solemn import which evenhe could scarcely have divined in full. The seers of old were not moreinspired than he who now, out of the irresistible conviction of hisheart, said to his surprised and unbelieving listeners:     If we could first know where we are and whither we are tending, we     could then better judge what to do and how to do it. We are now far     on in the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed     object and confident promise of putting an end to slavery     agitation. Under the operation of that policy, that agitation has     not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented. In my opinion it     will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed.     'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this     Government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free. I     do not expect the Union to be dissolved--I do not expect the house     to fall--but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will     become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of     slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where     the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in course of     ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward till it     shall become alike lawful in all the States--old as well as     new--North as well as South.Mr. Jeriah Bonham, an old citizen of Illinois, relates that he waspresent as a delegate at the Springfield convention and heard the famousspeech of Lincoln. According to Mr. Bonham, "The speech was preparedwith unusual care, every paragraph and sentence carefully weighed. Thefirm bedrock of principles, the issues of the campaign on which heproposed to stand and fight his battles, were all well considered, andhis arguments were incontrovertible. In that memorable speech culminatedall the grand thoughts he had ever uttered, embodying divinity,statesmanship, law, and morals, and even fraught with prophecy. As headvanced in this argument he towered to his full height, forgettinghimself entirely as he grew warm in his work. Men and women who heardthat speech well remember the wonderful transformation wrought inLincoln's appearance. The plain, homely man towered up majestically; hisface lit as with angelic light; the long, bent, angular figure, like thestrong oak of the forest, stood erect, and his eyes flashed with thefire of inspiration."The party that had nominated Lincoln for the Senate was not prepared toendorse his restriction of the coming struggle to the single issue ofthe slavery question. His friends dreaded the result of hisuncompromising frankness, while politicians quite generally condemnedit. Even so stanch a friend as Leonard Swett, whose devotion to Lincolnnever wavered throughout his whole career, shared these apprehensions.Says Mr. Swett: "The first ten lines of that speech defeated him. Thesentiment of the 'house divided against itself' seemed whollyinappropriate. It was a speech made at the commencement of a campaign,and apparently made for the campaign. Viewing it in this light alone,nothing could have been more unfortunate or inappropriate. It was sayingthe wrong thing first; yet he felt that it was an abstract truth, andthat standing by the speech would ultimately find him in the rightplace. I was inclined at the time to believe these words were hastilyand inconsiderately uttered; but subsequent facts have convinced me theywere deliberate and had been well matured."A few days after the delivery of this speech, a gentleman named Dr. Longcalled on Lincoln and gave him a foretaste of the remarks he was to hearduring the next few months. "Well, Lincoln," said he, "that foolishspeech of yours will kill you--will defeat you in this contest, andprobably for all offices for all time to come. I am sorry, sorry, verysorry. I wish it was wiped out of existence. Don't you wish so too?"Laying down the pen with which he had been writing, and slowly raisinghis head and adjusting his spectacles, Lincoln replied: "Well, Doctor,if I had to draw a pen across and erase my whole life from existence,and I had one poor gift or choice left as to what I should save from thewreck, _I should choose that speech_, and leave it to the worldunerased."The Senatorial campaign was now well begun. Douglas opened it by aspeech at Chicago on the 9th of July. Lincoln was present, and on thenext evening spoke in reply from the same place--the balcony of theTremont House. A week later Douglas spoke at Bloomington, with Lincolnagain in the audience. The notion of a joint discussion seems to haveoriginated with Lincoln, who on the 24th of July addressed a note toDouglas as follows:     HON. S.A. DOUGLAS--My Dear Sir:--Will it be agreeable to you to     make an arrangement for you and myself to divide time, and     address the same audiences during the present canvass? Mr. Judd,     who will hand you this, is authorized to receive your answer,     and, if agreeable to you, to enter into the terms of such     arrangement. Your obedient servant, A. LINCOLN.The result of this proposal was an agreement that there should be ajoint discussion between the two candidates in each of the sevenCongressional districts in which they had not both already been heard.Places were named and dates fixed extending to the middle of October. Itwas agreed that the opening speech on each occasion should occupy onehour; the reply, one hour and a half; the close, half an hour; and thatMr. Douglas should have the first and last voice in four of the sevenmeetings.The champions who were thus to enter the lists in a decisive trial offorensic strength and skill are forcibly contrasted by Mr. Speed, whosays: "They were the respective leaders of their parties in the State.They were as opposite in character as they were unlike in their persons.Lincoln was long and ungainly; Douglas was short and compact. Douglas,in all elections, was the moving spirit and manager. He was contentwith nothing short of a blind submission to himself. He could nottolerate opposition to his will within his party organization. He heldthe reins and controlled the movements of the Democratic chariot. With alarge State majority, with many able and ambitious men in it, he steppedto the front in his youth and held his place till his death. Lincoln, onthe other hand, shrank from any controversy with his friends. His partybeing in a minority in the State, he was forced to the front because hisfriends thought he was the only man with whom they could win. In acanvass his friends had to do all the management. He knew nothing of howto reach the people except by addressing their reason. If the situationhad been reversed--Lincoln representing the majority and Douglas theminority--I think it most likely Lincoln would never have had the place.He had no heart for a fight with friends."The Hon. James G. Blaine has given a masterly description and analysisof the comparative powers of the two illustrious debaters. Douglas, saysMr. Blaine, "was everywhere known as a debater of singular skill. Hismind was fertile in resources. He was a master of logic. No manperceived more quickly than he the strength or the weakness of anargument, and no one excelled him in the use of sophistry and fallacy.Where he could not elucidate a point to his own advantage, he wouldfatally becloud it for his opponent. In that peculiar style of debatewhich in intensity resembles a physical combat, he had no equal. Hespoke with extraordinary readiness. There was no halting in his phrase.He used good English, terse, vigorous, pointed. He disregarded theadornments of rhetoric--rarely used a simile. He was utterly destituteof humor, and had slight appreciation of wit. He never cited historicalprecedents except from the domain of American politics. Inside thatfield his knowledge was comprehensive, minute, critical; beyond it hislearning was limited. He was not a reader. His recreations were not inliterature. In the whole range of his voluminous speaking, it would bedifficult to find either a line of poetry or a classical allusion. Buthe was by nature an orator, and by long practice a debater. He couldlead a crowd almost irresistibly to his own conclusions. He could, if hewished, incite a mob to desperate deeds. He was, in short, an able,audacious, almost unconquerable opponent in public discussion. It wouldhave been impossible to find any man of the same type able to meet himbefore the people of Illinois. Whoever attempted it would probably havebeen destroyed in the first encounter. But the man who was chosen tomeet him, who challenged him to the combat, was radically different inevery phase of character. Scarcely could two men be more unlike inmental and moral constitution than Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A.Douglas. Lincoln was calm and philosophic. He loved the truth for thetruth's sake. He would not argue from a false premise, or be deceivedhimself or deceive others by a false conclusion. He had pondered deeplyon the issues which aroused him to action. He had given anxious thoughtto the problems of free government, and to the destiny of the Republic.He had marked out a path of duty for himself, and he walked itfearlessly. His mental processes were slower but more profound thanthose of Douglas. He did not seek to say merely the thing which was bestfor that day's debate, but the thing which would stand the test of timeand square itself with eternal justice. He wished nothing to appearwhite unless it was white. His logic was severe and faultless. He didnot resort to fallacy, and could detect it in his opponent and expose itwith merciless directness. He had an abounding sense of humor, andalways employed it in illustration of his argument--but never for themere sake of provoking merriment. In this respect he had the wonderfulaptness of Franklin. He often taught a great truth with the felicitousbrevity of an Aesop fable. His words did not flow in an impetuoustorrent, as did those of Douglas; but they were always well chosen,deliberate and conclusive."Mr. Arnold, in the course of an extended comparison, says: "At the timeof these discussions, both Lincoln and Douglas were in the full maturityof their powers. Douglas was forty-five and Lincoln forty-nine years ofage. Physically and mentally, they were as unlike as possible. Douglaswas short, not much more than five feet high, with a large head, massivebrain, broad shoulders, a wide, deep chest, and features stronglymarked. He impressed every one, at first sight, as a strong, sturdy,resolute, fearless man. Lincoln's herculean stature has already beendescribed. A stranger who listened to him for five minutes would say:'This is a kind, genial, sincere, genuine man; a man you can trust,plain, straightforward, honest, and true.' If this stranger were to hearhim make a speech, he would be impressed with his clear good sense, byhis wit and humor, by his general intelligence, and by the simple,homely, but pure and accurate language he used. In his long residence atWashington, Douglas had acquired the bearing and manners of a gentlemanand a man of the world. But he was always a fascinating and attractiveman, and always and everywhere personally popular. He had been for yearscarefully and thoroughly trained on the stump, in Congress, and in theSenate, to meet in debate the ablest speakers in the State and Nation.For years he had been accustomed to meet on the floor of the Capitol theleaders of the old Whig and Free-soil parties. Among them were Websterand Seward, Fessenden and Crittenden, Chase, Trumbull, Hale and othersof nearly equal eminence; and his enthusiastic friends insisted thatnever, either in single conflict or when receiving the assault of thesenatorial leaders of a whole party, had he been discomfited. His stylewas bold, vigorous, and aggressive; at times even defiant. He was ready,fluent, fertile in resources, familiar with national and party history,severe in denunciation, and he handled with skill nearly all the weaponsof debate. His iron will and restless energy, together with greatpersonal magnetism, made him the idol of his friends and party. Hislong, brilliant, and almost universally successful career, gave himperfect confidence in himself, and at times he was arrogant andoverbearing.... Lincoln also was a thoroughly trained speaker. He hadmet successfully, year after year, at the bar and on the stump, theablest men of Illinois and the Northwest, including Lamborn, Stephen T.Logan, John Calhoun, and many others. He had contended, in generousemulation, with Hardin, Baker, Logan, and Browning; and had very oftenmet Douglas, a conflict with whom he always courted rather than shunned.His speeches, as we read them to-day, show a more familiar knowledge ofthe slavery question than those of any other statesman of our country.This is especially true of the Peoria speech and the Cooper Institutespeech. Lincoln was powerful in argument, always seizing the strongpoints, and demonstrating his propositions with a clearness and logicapproaching the certainty of mathematics. He had, in wit and humor, agreat advantage over Douglas. Then he had the better temper; he wasalways good humored, while Douglas, when hard pressed, was sometimesirritable. Douglas perhaps carried away the more popular applause;Lincoln made the deeper and more lasting impression. Douglas did notdisdain an immediate _ad captandum_ triumph; while Lincoln aimed atpermanent conviction. Sometimes, when Lincoln's friends urged him toraise a storm of applause, which he could always do by his happyillustrations and amusing stories, he refused, saying, 'The occasion istoo serious; the issues are too grave. I do not seek applause, or toamuse the people, but to _convince_ them.' It was observed in thecanvass that while Douglas was greeted with the loudest cheers, whenLincoln closed the people seemed serious and thoughtful, and could beheard all through the crowd, gravely and anxiously discussing thesubjects on which he had been speaking."Soon after the arrangements for the debate had been made, SenatorDouglas visited Alton, Illinois. A delegation of prominent Democratsthere paid their respects to him, and during the conversation one ofthem congratulated Douglas on the easy task he would have in defeatingLincoln; at the same time expressing surprise at the champion whom hehad selected. Douglas replied: "Gentlemen, you do not know Mr. Lincoln.I have known him long and well, and I know that I shall have anythingbut an easy task. I assure you I _would rather meet any other man in thecountry than Abraham Lincoln."_ This was Douglas's mature opinion ofthe man of whom, years before, he had said, in his characteristic way:"Of all the d----d Whig rascals about Springfield, Abe Lincoln is theablest and honestest." On another occasion, Douglas said: "I have knownLincoln for nearly twenty-five years. There were many points of sympathybetween us when we first got acquainted. We were both comparativelyboys, and both struggling with poverty in a strange land. I was aschool-teacher in the town of Winchester, and he a flourishinggrocery-keeper in the town of Salem. He was more successful in hisoccupation than I was in mine, and hence more fortunate in the world'sgoods. Lincoln is one of those peculiar men who perform with admirableskill everything they undertake. I made as good a school-teacher as Icould, and when a cabinet-maker I made as good bedsteads and tables as Icould--although my old boss says that I succeeded better with _bureaus_and _secretaries_ than with anything else. But I believe that Lincolnwas always more successful in business than I, for his business enabledhim to get into the Legislature. I met him there, however, and had asympathy with him because of the up-hill struggle we both had had inlife. He was then just as good at telling an anecdote as now. He couldbeat any of the boys in wrestling or running a foot-race, in pitchingquoits or pitching a copper; and the dignity and impartiality with whichhe presided at a horse-race or fist-fight excited the admiration and wonthe praise of everybody that was present. I sympathized with him becausehe was struggling with difficulties, and so was I. Mr. Lincoln servedwith me in the Legislature of 1836; then we both retired, and hesubsided, or became submerged, and was lost sight of as a public man forsome years. In 1846, when Wilmot introduced his celebrated proviso, andthe Abolition tornado swept over the country, Lincoln again turned up asa Member of Congress from the Sangamon district. I was then in theSenate of the United States, and was glad to welcome my old friend."Lincoln, in a speech delivered two years before the joint debate, hadspoken thus of Senator Douglas: "Twenty-two years ago, Judge Douglas andI first became acquainted; we were both young then--he a trifle youngerthan I. Even then, we were both ambitious--I perhaps quite as much ashe. With me, the race of ambition has been a failure--a flat failure;with him, it has been one of splendid success. His name fills thenation, and is not unknown even in foreign lands. I affect no contemptfor the high eminence he has reached; so reached that the oppressed ofmy species might have shared with me in the elevation, I would ratherstand on that eminence than wear the richest crown that ever pressed amonarch's brow."A few days before the first discussion was to take place, Lincoln, whohad become conscious that some of his party friends distrusted hisability to meet successfully a man who, as the Democrats declared andbelieved, had never had his equal on the stump, met an old friend fromVermilion County, and, shaking hands, inquired the news. His friendreplied, "All looks well; our friends are wide awake, but they arelooking forward with some anxiety to these approaching joint discussionswith Douglas." A shade passed over Lincoln's face, a sad expression cameand instantly passed, and then a blaze of light flashed from his eyes,and with his lips compressed and in a manner peculiar to him, halfserious and half jocular, he said: "My friend, sit down a minute, and Iwill tell you a story. You and I, as we have travelled the circuittogether attending court, have often seen two men about to fight. One ofthem, the big or the little giant, as the case may be, is noisy andboastful; he jumps high in the air, strikes his feet together, smiteshis fists, brags about what he is going to do, and tries hard to'_skeer_' the other man. The other man says not a word; his arms are athis side, his fists are clenched, his teeth set, his head settled firmlyon his shoulders; he saves his breath and strength for the struggle._This man will whip,_ as sure as the fight comes off. Good-bye, andremember what I say."The spirit and purpose with which Lincoln went into the contest areshown also in the following words: "I shall not ask any favors at all.Judge Douglas asks me if I wish to push this matter to the point ofpersonal difficulty. I tell him, _No!_ He did not make a mistake, in oneof his early speeches, when he called me an 'amiable' man, thoughperhaps he did when he called me an 'intelligent' man. I again tell him,_No!_ I very much prefer, when this canvass shall be over, however itmay result, that we at least part without any bitter recollections ofpersonal difficulties."The speeches in these joint discussions were entirely extemporaneous inform, yet they were reported and printed in all the prominent papers inthe West, and found eager readers throughout the country. The voice andmanner, which add so much to the effect of a speaker, could not bereproduced on the printed page; nor could full justice be done, in ahasty transcript, to the force and fitness of the language employed.Still, the impressions of those who heard them at the time, as well aslater and cooler analyses of them, have agreed in pronouncing thesedebates among the most able and interesting on record. The scenesconnected with the different meetings were intensely exciting. Vastthrongs were invariably in attendance, while a whole nation was watchingthe result. "At Freeport," says an observer, "Mr. Douglas appeared in anelegant barouche drawn by four white horses, and was received with greatapplause. But when Mr. Lincoln came up, in a 'prairie schooner,'--anold-fashioned canvas-covered pioneer wagon,--the enthusiasm of the vastthrong was unbounded."At Charleston Lincoln opened and closed the day's debate. It was thefourth discussion, and there was no more doubt of his ability to sustainthe conflict. According to Mr. Arnold, "Douglas's reply to Lincoln wasmainly a defense. Lincoln's close was intensely interesting anddramatic. His logic and arguments were crushing, and Douglas's evasionswere exposed with a power and clearness that left him utterlydiscomfited. Republicans saw it. Democrats realized it, and a sort ofpanic seized them, and ran through the crowd of upturned faces. Douglasrealized his defeat, and, as Lincoln's blows fell fast and heavy, helost his temper. He could not keep his seat; he rose and walked rapidlyup and down the platform, behind Lincoln, holding his watch in his hand,and obviously impatient for the call of _'time.'_ A spectator says: 'Hewas greatly agitated, his long grizzled hair waving in the wind, likethe shaggy locks of an enraged lion.' It was while Douglas was thusexhibiting to the crowd his eager desire to stop Lincoln, that thelatter, holding the audience entranced by his eloquence, was strikinghis heaviest blows. The instant the secondhand of his watch reached thepoint at which Lincoln's time was up, Douglas, holding up the watch,called out: 'Sit down, Lincoln, sit down! Your time is up!' Turning toDouglas, Lincoln said calmly: 'I will. I _will_ quit. I believe my time_is_ up.' 'Yes,' said a voice from the platform, 'Douglas has hadenough; it is time you let up on him.'"The institution of slavery was, of course, the topic around whichcircled all the arguments in these joint discussions. It was the greattopic of the hour--the important point of division between theRepublican and Democratic parties. Lincoln's exposition of the subjectwas profound and masterly. At the meeting in Quincy the issue wasdefined and the argument driven home with unsparing logic anddirectness. In closing the debate, he said:     I wish to return to Judge Douglas my profound thanks for his     public annunciation here to-day, to be put on record, that his     system of policy in regard to the institution of slavery     contemplates that it shall last _forever_. We are getting a     little nearer the true issue of this controversy, and I am     profoundly grateful for this one sentence. Judge Douglas asks     you, 'Why cannot the institution of slavery, or, rather, why     cannot the nation, part slave and part free, continue as our     fathers made it forever?' In the first place, I insist that our     fathers _did not_ make this nation half slave and half free, or     part slave and part free. I insist that they found the     institution of slavery existing here. They did not make it so,     but they left it so, because they knew of no way to get rid of it     at that time. When Judge Douglas undertakes to say that, as a     matter of choice, the fathers of the Government made this nation     part slave and part free, he assumes what is historically a     _falsehood_. More than that; when the fathers of the Government     cut off the source of slavery by the abolition of the     slave-trade, and adopted a system of restricting it from the new     Territories where it had not existed, I maintain that they placed     it where they understood, and all sensible men understood, it was     in the course of ultimate extinction; and when Judge Douglas asks     me why it cannot continue as our fathers made it, I ask him why     he and his friends could not let it remain as our friends made     it? It is precisely all I ask of him in relation to the     institution of slavery, that it shall be placed upon the basis     that our fathers placed it upon. Mr. Brooks, of South Carolina,     once said, and truly said, that when this Government was     established, no one expected the institution of slavery to last     until this day; and that the men who formed this Government were     wiser and better than the men of these days; but the men of these     days had experience which the fathers had not, and that     experience had taught them the invention of the cotton-gin, and     this had made the perpetuation of the institution of slavery a     necessity in this country. Judge Douglas could not let it stand     upon the basis on which our fathers placed it, but removed it,     and put it upon the cotton-gin basis. It is a question,     therefore, for him and his friends to answer--why they could not     let it remain where the fathers of the Government originally     placed it.In these debates Lincoln often seemed like one transfigured--carriedaway by his own eloquence and the force of his conviction. He said to afriend during the canvass: "Sometimes, in the excitement of speaking, Iseem to see the end of slavery. I feel that the time is soon coming whenthe sun shall shine, the rain shall fall, on no man who shall go forthto unrequited toil.... How this will come, when it will come, by whom itwill come, I cannot tell;--but that time will surely come." Again, atthe first encounter at Alton, he uttered these pregnant sentences:     On this subject of treating slavery as a wrong, and limiting its     spread, let me say a word. Has anything ever threatened the     existence of this Union save and except this very institution of     slavery? What is it that we hold most dear among us? Our own     liberty and prosperity. What has ever threatened our liberty and     prosperity, save and except this institution of slavery? If this     is true, how do you propose to improve the condition of things by     enlarging slavery?--by spreading it out and making it bigger? You     may have a wen or cancer upon your person, and not be able to cut     it out lest you bleed, to death; but surely it is no way to cure     it to ingraft it and spread it over your whole body--that is no     proper way of treating what you regard a wrong. This peaceful way     of dealing with it as a wrong--restricting the spread of it, and     not allowing it to go into new countries where it has not already     existed--that is the peaceful way, the old-fashioned way, the way     in which the fathers themselves set us the example. Is slavery     wrong? That is the real issue. That is the issue that will     continue in this country when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas     and myself shall be silent. It is the eternal struggle between     these two principles--right and wrong--throughout the world. They     are two principles that have stood face to face from the     beginning of time; and will ever continue to struggle. The one is     the common right of humanity, and the other the divine right of     kings. It is the same principle, in whatever shape it develops     itself. It is the same spirit that says: 'You work, and toil, and     earn bread, and I'll eat it.' No matter in what shape it comes,     whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people     of his own nation and live by the fruit of their labor, or from     one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is     the same tyrannical principle.On still another occasion he used these unmistakable words:     My declarations upon this subject of negro slavery may be     misrepresented, but cannot be misunderstood. I have said that I     do not understand the Declaration to mean that all men were     created equal in all respects. They are not our equal in color.     But I suppose that it does mean to declare that all men are     created equal in some respects; they are equal in their right to     'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' Certainly the     negro is not our equal in color, perhaps not in many other     respects; still, _in the right to put into his mouth the bread     that his own hands have earned, he is the equal of every other     man, white or black_.It is not in the scope of this narrative to print extended quotationsfrom the speeches made in this memorable contest, but rather to givesuch reminiscences and anecdotes, and description by eye-witnesses, aswill best serve to bring the scenes and actors vividly to mind.Fortunately, many such records are still in existence, and from themsome most entertaining personal accounts have been obtained. Among theseis an impressive pen-picture of Lincoln on the stump, as admirablysketched by the Rev. Dr. George C. Noyes, of Chicago. "Mr. Lincoln inrepose," says Dr. Noyes, "was a very different man in personalappearance from Mr. Lincoln on the platform or on the stump, when hiswhole nature was roused by his masterful interest in the subject of hisdiscourse. In the former case he was, as has often been described, a manof awkward and ungainly appearance and exceedingly homely countenance.In the latter case, he was a man of magnificent presence and remarkablyimpressive manner. The writer retains to this day a very vividimpression of his appearance in both these characters, and both on thesame day. It was in Jacksonville, in the summer of 1858, and during thegreat contest with Douglas, when the prize contended for was a seat inthe United States Senate. The day was warm; the streets were dusty, andfilled with great crowds of people. When Lincoln arrived on the trainfrom Springfield, he was met by an immense procession of people onhorseback, in carriages, in wagons and vehicles of every description,and on foot, who escorted him through the principal streets to hishotel. The enthusiasm of the multitude was great; but Lincoln'sextremely homely face wore an expression of sadness. He rode in acarriage near the head of the procession, looking dust-begrimed and wornand weary; and though he frequently lifted his hat in recognition of thecheers of the crowds lining the streets, I saw no smile on his face, andhe seemed to take no pleasure in the demonstrations of enthusiasm whichhis presence called forth. His clothes were very ill-fitting, and hislong arms and hands protruded far through his coat sleeves, giving him apeculiarly uncouth appearance. Though I had often seen him before, andhad heard him in court--always with delight in his clearness and cogencyof statement, his illuminating humor, and his conspicuous fairness andcandor--yet I had never before seen him when he appeared so homely; andI thought him about the ugliest man I had ever seen. There was nothingin his looks or manner that was prepossessing. Such he appeared as herode in the procession on the forenoon of that warm summer day. Hisappearance was not different in the afternoon of that day, when, in thepublic square, he first stood before the great multitude who hadassembled there to hear him. His powers were aroused gradually as hewent on with his speech. There was much play of humor. 'Judge Douglashas,' he said, 'one great advantage of me in this contest. When hestands before his admiring friends, who gather in great numbers to hearhim, they can easily see, with half an eye, all kinds of _fat offices_sprouting out of his fat and jocund face, and, indeed, from every partof his plump and well-rounded body. His appearance is thereforeirresistibly attractive. His friends expect him to be President, andthey expect their reward. But when I stand before the people, not thesharpest vision is able to detect in my lean and lank person, or in mysunken and hollow cheeks, _the faintest sign or promise_ of an office. Iam not a candidate for the Presidency, and hence there is no beauty inme that men should desire me.' The crowd was convulsed with laughter atthis sally. As the speech went on, the speaker, though often impressinghis points with apposite and laughter-provoking stories, grew more andmore earnest. He showed that the government was founded in the interestof freedom, not slavery. He traced the steady aggressions of the slavepower step by step, until he came to declare and to dwell upon the factof the irrepressible conflict between the two. Then, as he went on toshow, with wonderful eloquence of speech and of manner, that the countrymust and would ultimately become, not all slave, but all free, he wastransfigured before his audience. His homely countenance fairly glowedwith the splendor of his prophetic speech; and his body, no longerawkward and ungainly, but mastered and swayed by his thought, became anobedient and graceful instrument of eloquent expression. The whole manseemed to speak. He seemed like some grand Hebrew prophet, whose facewas glorified by the bright visions of a better day which he saw anddeclared. His eloquence was not merely that of clear and luminousstatement, felicitous illustration, or excited yet restrained feeling;it was the eloquence also of _thought_. With something of theimaginative, he united rare dialectic power. He felt the truth before heexpounded it; but when once it was felt by him, then his logical powercame into remarkably effective play. Step by step he led his hearersonward, till at last he placed them on the summit whence they could seeall the landscape of his subject in harmonious and connected order. Ofthese two contrasted pictures of Lincoln, it is only the last whichshows him as he was in his real and essential greatness. And not thisfully; for it was in his character that he was greatest. He was notmerely a thinker, but a thinker for man, directing his thought to theends of justice, freedom, and humanity. If he desired and sought highposition, it was only that he might thus better serve the cause offreedom to which he was devoted. From the time when he withdrew, in aspirit of magnanimity that was never appreciated, in favor of a rivalcandidate for the United States Senate, it was evident that the _cause_was more to him than any personal advantage or advancement."Another graphic description of Lincoln's appearance and manner on thestump is given by Mr. Jeriah Bonham, whose account of the famous"house-divided-against-itself" speech has already found a place in thisnarrative. "When Mr. Lincoln took the stand," says Mr. Bonham, "he didnot, on rising, show his full height, but stood in a stooping posture,his long-tailed coat hanging loosely around his body, and descendingover an ill-fitting pair of pantaloons that covered his not verysymmetrical legs. He began his speech in a rather diffident manner,seeming for awhile at a loss for words; his voice was irregular, even alittle tremulous, as he began his argument. As he proceeded he seemed togain more confidence, his form straightened up, his face brightened, hislanguage became free and animated. Soon he had drawn the attention ofthe crowd by two or three well-told stories that illustrated hisargument; and then he became eloquent, carrying his audience at will, astumultuous applause greeted every telling point he made."Mrs. John A. Logan, in her "Recollections of a Soldier's Wife," says: "Ialways like to think of Mr. Lincoln as he was when I saw him with theeyes of an opponent. His awkwardness has not been exaggerated, but itgave no effect of self-consciousness. There was something about hisungainliness and his homely face which would have made anyone who simplypassed him in the street remember him. His very awkwardness was an assetin public life, in that it attracted attention to him. Douglas, on theother hand, won by the magnetism of his personality. Lincoln did not_seem_ to have any magnetism, though of course he actually did have therarest and most precious kind. Give Mr. Lincoln five minutes and Mr.Douglas five minutes before an audience which knew neither, and Mr.Douglas would make the greater impression. But give them each an hour,and the contrary would be true."In the party that attended Lincoln in the Senatorial campaign was theHon. Andrew Shuman, afterwards Lieutenant-Governor of Illinois and oneof the veteran journalists of Chicago. Mr. Shuman was detailed to reportthe joint debates for his paper; and he accompanied Lincoln throughnearly all of the campaign, travelling with him by night--sometimesoccupying the same room, and when in crowded quarters the same bed. Hethus saw much of Lincoln, and had the best of opportunities for studyinghis character; not only hearing all his public speeches, but having longconversations with him in private, and listening to the stories,anecdotes, and gay or grave discourse by which the journeys and thefrequent "waits" were enlivened. The group consisted of severalgentlemen, including Norman B. Judd of Chicago, afterwards a member ofCongress; Robert R. Hitt, who was Lincoln's shorthand reporter,afterwards member of Congress from Illinois; Mr. Villard, later thePresident of the Northern Pacific Railroad, then a newspapercorrespondent; Mr. Shuman; and, at various times, other politicians andjournalists. Of this party Lincoln was always the leading spirit inconversation. He would tell stories himself, and draw out stories fromothers; and his laugh, though not the loudest, was always the heartiest.Then he would pass to soberer themes, and discuss them with a tinge ofthat melancholy which, however he might be surrounded, never seemed fardistant from him. At night, stopping at the country tavern or at somefriend's house, the evenings would be spent in discussion andstory-telling, or perhaps in a humorous review of the events of theday; and after retiring, Lincoln would entertain his companion, oftenfar into the night, discoursing on many varied subjects,--politics,literature, views of human life and character, or the prominent men andmeasures then before the country.One day, according to Governor Shuman, Lincoln had been announced tospeak in a town in the extreme southern part of Illinois, in the veryheart of "Egypt," where there was a strong pro-slavery sentiment; andit was feared there might be trouble, as Lincoln's anti-slaverytendencies were well known. To make matters worse, a party ofKentuckians and Missourians had come over to attend the meeting, andit was noised about that they would not allow Lincoln to speak. Heheard of it, and both he and his friends were somewhat apprehensive oftrouble. The place of the meeting was a grove in the edge of the town,the speakers occupying an improvised stand. The gathering was a largeone, and it had every appearance of a Southern crowd. It was customaryin those times for the men in that section of the country to carrypistols and ugly-looking knives strapped to their persons, on publicoccasions. It was a semi-barbarous community, and their hatred of theAbolitionists, as they called all anti-slavery men, was as intense aswas their love of bad whiskey. Lincoln privately told his friends, whoin that locality were very few in number, that "if only they will giveme a fair chance to say a few opening words, I'll fix them all right."Before mounting the speaker's stand he was introduced to many of thecrowd, and shook their hands in the usual Western way. Getting a smallcompany of the rough-looking fellows around him, he opened on them."Fellow-citizens of Southern Illinois--fellow-citizens of the State ofKentucky--fellow-citizens of Missouri," he said, in a tone more ofconversation than of oratory, looking them straight in the eye, "I amtold that there are some of you here present who would like to maketrouble for me. I don't understand why they should. I am a plain,common man, like the rest of you; and why should not I have as good aright to speak my sentiments as the rest of you? Why, good friends, Iam one of you; I am not an interloper here! I was born in Kentucky,raised in Illinois, just like the most of you, and worked my way rightalong by hard scratching. I know the people of Kentucky, and I knowthe people of Southern Illinois, and I think I know the Missourians. Iam one of them, and therefore ought to know them, and they ought toknow me better, and if they did know me better they would know that Iam not disposed to make them trouble; then why should they, or any oneof them, want to make trouble for me? Don't do any such foolish thing,fellow-citizens. Let us be friends, and treat each other like friends.I am one of the humblest and most peaceable men in the world--wouldwrong no man, would interfere with no man's rights; and all I ask isthat, having something to say, you will give me a decent hearing. And,being Illinoisans, Kentuckians, and Missourians--brave and gallantpeople--I feel sure that you will do that. And now let us reasontogether, like the honest fellows we are." Having uttered these words,his face the very picture of good-nature and his voice full ofsympathetic earnestness, he mounted the speaker's stand and proceededto make one of the most impressive speeches against the furtherextension of slavery that he ever made in his life. He was listened toattentively; was applauded when he indulged in flashes of humor, andonce or twice his eloquent passages were lustily cheered. His littleopening remarks had calmed the threatening storm, had conquered hisenemies, and he had smooth sailing. From that day to the time of hisdeath, Abraham Lincoln held a warm place in the respect of very manyof those rough and rude "Egyptians," and he had no warmer supportersfor the Presidency, or while he was President, than they were.Mr. Leonard Volk, the sculptor who afterwards made an excellent bust ofLincoln, says: "My first meeting with Abraham Lincoln was in 1858, whenthe celebrated Senatorial contest opened between him and Stephen A.Douglas. I was invited by the latter to accompany him and his party by aspecial train to Springfield, to which train was attached a platform-carhaving on board a cannon, which made considerable noise on the journey.At Bloomington we all stopped over night, as Douglas had a speech tomake there in the evening. The party went to the Landon House--the onlyhotel, I believe, in the place at that time. While we were sitting inthe hotel office after supper, Mr. Lincoln entered, carrying an oldcarpet-bag in his hand, and wearing a weather-beaten silk hat--toolarge, apparently, for his head--a long, loosely-fitting frock-coat ofblack alpaca, and vest and trousers of the same material. He walked upto the counter, and, saluting the clerk pleasantly, passed the bag overto him, and inquired if he was too late for supper. The clerk repliedthat supper was over, but perhaps enough could be 'scraped up' for him.'All right,' said Mr. Lincoln; 'I don't want much.' Meanwhile, he said,he would wash the dust off. He was certainly very dusty; it was themonth of June, and quite warm. While he was so engaged, several oldfriends, who had learned of his arrival, rushed in to see him, some ofthem shouting, 'How are you, Old Abe?' Mr. Lincoln grasped them by thehand in his cordial manner, with the broadest and pleasantest smile onhis rugged face. This was the first good view I had of the 'coming man.'The next day we all stopped at the town of Lincoln, where short speecheswere made by the contestants, and dinner was served at the hotel; afterwhich, as Mr. Lincoln came out on the plank-walk in front, I wasformally presented to him. He saluted me with his natural cordiality,grasping my hand in both his large hands with a vice-like grip, andlooking down into my face with his beaming, dark, full eyes, said: 'Howdo you do? I am glad to meet you. I have read of you in the papers. Youare making a statue of Judge Douglas for Governor Matteson's new house.''Yes, sir,' I answered; 'and sometime when you are in Chicago, and canspare the time, I would like to have you sit to me for a bust.' 'Yes, Iwill, Mr. Volk; I shall be glad to, the first opportunity I have.' Allwere soon on board the long train, crowded with people, going to hearthe speeches at Springfield. The train stopped on the track, nearEdward's Grove, in the northern outskirts of the town, where staging waserected and a vast crowd waited under the shade of the trees. On leavingthe train, most of the passengers climbed over the fences and crossedthe stubble-field, taking a short-cut to the grove,--among them Mr.Lincoln, who stalked forward alone, taking immense strides, thebefore-mentioned carpet-bag and an umbrella in his hands, and his coatskirts flying in the breeze. I managed to keep pretty close in the rearof the tall, gaunt figure, with the head craned forward, apparently muchover the balance, like the Leaning Tower of Pisa, that was movingsomething like a hurricane across that rough stubble-field."The contest between Lincoln and Douglas seemed to be, as expressed byDr. Newton Bateman, "one between sharpness and greatness." Lincolnseemed to Dr. Bateman, "a man strongly possessed by a belief to which hewas earnestly striving to win the people over; while the aim of Mr.Douglas seemed rather to be simply to defeat Mr. Lincoln." Yet, althoughLincoln was usually earnest and considerate of his opponent, he could,when occasion required, bring his powers of humor and sarcasm into playin a very effective manner. A few pointed illustrations may be given. Inhis speech at Galesburg, Douglas sneeringly informed the citizens that"Honest Abe" had been a liquor-seller. Lincoln met this with the candidadmission that once in early life he had, under the pressure of poverty,accepted and for a few months held a position in a store where it wasnecessary for him to retail liquor. "But the difference between JudgeDouglas and myself is just this," he added, "that while I was _behind_the bar, he was _in front_ of it."At the close of the joint discussion at Alton, Douglas led off with aspeech an hour long, in which he showed no little irritability. Thecampaign was evidently wearing on him. Lincoln, on the contrary, was incapital spirits. "He sat taking in the speech of Douglas with seemingimmobility," says Mr. Jeriah Bonham, who was present, "and when it wasended, he rose to reply. As in the opening of all his speeches, he spokeslowly, did not rise to his full height, leaning forward in a stoopingposture at first, his person showing all the angularities of limb andface. For the first five or ten minutes he was both awkward anddiffident, as in almost monotonous tones he began to untangle the meshesof Douglas's sophistry. Proceeding, he gained confidence gradually; hisvoice rang out strong and clear; his tall form towered to its fullheight; his face grew radiant with impassioned feeling, as he pouredforth an outburst of crushing argument and inspiring eloquence. Thepeople became wild with enthusiasm, but his voice rang loud above theircheers. Frequently in his speech he would turn toward Douglas, and saywith emphasis, 'You _know_ these things are so, Mr. Douglas!' or 'Youknow these things are _not_ so, Mr. Douglas!' At one time he bent hislong body over his adversary, pouring in his arguments so sharply, thatDouglas, chafing under the attack, rose to explain; but Lincoln wouldnot allow it. 'Sit down, Mr. Douglas!' said he peremptorily. 'I did notinterrupt you, and you shall not interrupt me. You will haveopportunity to reply to me--if you can--in your closing speech.'"A good story is told of the occasion on which Lincoln and Douglas spokein Chicago. A well-known citizen who on account of his age was knownfamiliarly as "Father Brewster"--a man of standing, and a member of theBoard of Education--was one of the listeners on the platform. Lincolnadmired the old gentleman very much, and the admiration was mutual. Theysat together while Douglas made the opening speech. He spoke for morethan an hour, and never more brilliantly. When Lincoln's turn came hecould see that Father Brewster was exceedingly anxious as to theoutcome. Lincoln arose, let out all the joints in his long body, slowlyremoved his overcoat and laid it across Mr. Brewster's knees. "FatherBrewster," he said, "will you hold my overcoat _while I stone Stephen?_"Everybody shouted and cheered, and even Douglas joined in the laugh athis own expense.Beneath the humors and excitements of the campaign, the prevailing toneof Lincoln's thought was deeply serious and reflective. Toward theclose, when indications pointed to his defeat for the Senate, he seemedsomewhat depressed, and occasionally his old habitual melancholy wouldsteal over him and impart to his words a touching pathos. On such anoccasion, in one of the smaller cities of Illinois, Douglas, having thefirst speech, made an unusually brilliant effort. He carried the crowdwith him; and when Lincoln rose to reply, it was evident that he felthis disadvantage--felt, too, that do what he would final defeat wasprobable. He made a good speech, but not one of his best. Concluding hisargument, he stopped and stood silent for a moment, looking around uponthe throng of half-indifferent, half-friendly faces before him, withthose deep-sunken weary eyes that always seemed full of unshed tears.Folding his hands, as if they too were tired of the hopeless fight, hesaid, in his peculiar monotone: "My friends, it makes littledifference, very little difference, whether Judge Douglas or myself iselected to the United States Senate; but the great issue which we havesubmitted to you to-day is far above and beyond any personal interestsor the political fortunes of any man. And, my friends, that issue willlive and breathe and burn when the poor, feeble, stammering tongues ofJudge Douglas and myself are silent in the grave." The crowd swayed asif smitten by a mighty wind. The simple words, and the manner in whichthey were spoken, touched every heart to the core.Lincoln spoke in all about fifty times during the campaign. At itsclose, says Mr. Arnold, "both Douglas and Lincoln visited Chicago.Douglas was so hoarse that he could hardly articulate, and it waspainful to hear him attempt to speak. Lincoln's voice was clear andvigorous, and he really seemed in better tone than usual. His darkcomplexion was bronzed by the prairie sun and winds; his eye was clear,his step firm, and he looked like a trained athlete, ready to enter,rather than one who had closed, a conflict."Of the speeches in this campaign, Mr. Henry J. Raymond, thedistinguished journalist, pronounced the following well-consideredopinion: "While Douglas fully sustained his previous reputation, andjustified the estimate his friends had placed upon his abilities, helabored under the comparative disadvantage of being much better known tothe country at large than was his antagonist. During his long publiccareer, people had become partially accustomed to his manner ofpresenting arguments and enforcing them. The novelty and freshness ofLincoln's addresses, on the other hand, the homeliness and force of hisillustrations, their wonderful pertinence, his exhaustless humor, hisconfidence in his own resources, engendered by his firm belief in thejustice of the cause he so ably advocated, never once rising, however,to the point of arrogance or superciliousness, fastened upon him theeyes of the people everywhere, friends and opponents alike. It was notstrange that more than once, during the course of the unparalleledexcitement which marked this canvass, Douglas should have been thrownoff his guard by the singular self-possession displayed by hisantagonist, and by the imperturbable firmness with which he maintainedand defended a position once taken. The unassuming confidence whichmarked Lincoln's conduct was early imparted to his supporters, and eachsucceeding encounter added largely to the number of his friends, untilthey began to indulge the hope that a triumph might be secured in spiteof the adverse circumstances under which the struggle was commenced."Samuel Bowles, editor of the Springfield (Mass.) "Republican," said thatLincoln "handled Douglas as he would an eel--by main strength.Sometimes, perhaps, he handled him so strongly that he _slipped throughhis fingers_.""In this canvass," says Mr. Lamon, "Mr. Lincoln earned a reputation as apopular debater second to that of no man in America--certainly notsecond to that of his famous antagonist. He kept his temper; he was notprone to personalities; he was fair, frank, and manly; and, if thecontest had shown nothing else, it would have shown at least that 'OldAbe' could behave like a gentleman under very trying circumstances. Hismarked success in these discussions was probably no surprise to thepeople of the Springfield district, who knew him as well as they did Mr.Douglas, or even better. But in the greater part of the State, andthroughout the Union, the series of brilliant victories successively wonby an obscure man over an orator of such wide experience and renown wasreceived with exclamations of astonishment alike by listeners andreaders."Caleb Cushing, the distinguished Massachusetts lawyer, was one of thoseacute minds whose attention was attracted to Lincoln by his debateswith Douglas. Mr. Cushing said that these debates showed Lincoln to bethe superior of Douglas "in every vital element of power"; and addedthat "the world does not yet know how much of a man Lincoln really is."It was soon to know him much more clearly. In less than two years afterthe great debate this lately obscure Illinois lawyer was electedPresident of the United States.CHAPTER XII     A Year of Waiting and Trial--Again Defeated for the     Senate--Depression and Neglect--Lincoln Enlarging His     Boundaries--On the Stump in Ohio--A Speech to Kentuckians--Second     Visit to Cincinnati--A Short Trip to Kansas--Lincoln in New York     City--The Famous Cooper Institute Speech--A Strong and Favorable     Impression--Visits New England--Secret of Lincoln's Success as an     Orator--Back to Springfield--Disposing of a Campaign     Slander--Lincoln's Account of His Visit to a Five Points Sunday     School.On the 2d of November, 1858, the State election was held in Illinois.The chief significance of this election was due to the fact that theLegislature then chosen would decide whether Douglas or Lincoln shouldbe sent to the Senate at Washington. The result showed that Lincoln had,by his hard efforts, won a victory for his cause and for his party, butnot for himself. The Republican State ticket was elected by a majorityof about 4,000 votes; but in the Legislature a number of members heldover from the election of two years before, and the Republican gains,though considerable, were not quite sufficient to overcome this adverseelement. When the Legislature met, Douglas was re-elected to the Senateby a small majority. It is said that Lincoln was deeply grieved by hisdefeat. When some one inquired of him how he felt over the result, heanswered that he felt "like the boy that stubbed his toe,--'it hurt toobad to laugh, and he was too big to cry!'"A few days after his return to Springfield, there was pressed on theattention of the defeated candidate a matter which must have beenpeculiarly unwelcome at the time, but which was accepted with habitualfortitude. What this matter was is revealed in the following letter:     SPRINGFIELD, NOV. 16, 1858.     HON. N.B. JUDD--_My Dear Sir_:--Yours of the 15th is just received.     I wrote you the same day. As to the pecuniary matter, I am willing     to pay according to my ability, but I am the poorest hand living to     get others to pay. I have been on expense so long, without earning     anything, that I am absolutely without money now for even household     expenses. Still, if you can put in two hundred and fifty dollars     for me towards discharging the debt of the committee, I will allow     it when you and I settle the private matter between us. This, with     what I have already paid with an outstanding note of mine, will     exceed my subscription of five hundred dollars. This, too, is     exclusive of my ordinary expenses during the campaign, all of     which, being added to my loss of time and business, bears pretty     heavily upon one no better off than I am. But as I had the post of     honor, it is not for me to be over-nice.     You are feeling badly. _And this, too, shall pass away;_ never     fear.     Yours as ever,     A. LINCOLN.Hon. E.M. Haines, who was a member of the Legislature of 1858-9, and asupporter of Lincoln for the Senate, states that Lincoln seemed greatlydepressed by his defeat, and that his friends were also somewhatdisheartened regarding his future prospects, and neglected him to someextent. "Some time after the Senatorial election," says Mr. Haines,"Governor Bissell gave a reception at his house, which I attended withmy wife. After we had paid our respects to the Governor and Mrs.Bissell, we passed on to an adjoining room, where there was quite athrong of people engaged in conversation. Mr. Lincoln was standing nearthe centre of the room, entirely alone, with his usual sad countenance,and apparently unnoticed by anyone. I said to my wife, 'Here is Mr.Lincoln; he looks as if he had lost all his friends; come and have anintroduction to him, and cheer him up.' Mr. Lincoln received us verycordially, and we entered into a general conversation, apparentlyunnoticed, and attracting no attention from others as they passed andrepassed around us. Dancing was going on in the adjacent rooms, and Mr.Lincoln invited my wife to join him in the dancing, which she did, andhe apparently took much pleasure in the recreation. My wife afterwardsrelated to me much that Mr. Lincoln said in their conversation duringthe evening. His despondency became much dispelled after they becameengaged in conversation; indeed, she said that he seemed to be puttingforth an effort to get out of the gloomy condition which had come uponhim from the result of his Senatorial canvass. He had occasion duringtheir conversation to refer to his age, remarking incidentally that hewas almost fifty years old; whereupon, as if suddenly reflecting thathis age was a good part of a man's life, and as if unwilling torelinquish his hold upon the future, he suddenly braced himself up, andsaid, 'But, Mrs. Haines, I feel that I am good for another fifty yearsyet.'"During the winter following the Senatorial debate Lincoln was occupiedwith his private affairs. The love of public speaking had become sostrong with him that he prepared a lecture and delivered it to thepublic at several places during the winter. It was somewhat humorous incharacter, but was not much of a success, and he soon declined furtherinvitations to deliver it. To one correspondent he wrote, in March,1859: "Your note, inviting me to deliver a lecture in Galesburg, isreceived. I regret to say that I cannot do so now. I must stick to thecourts for awhile. I read a sort of a lecture to three differentaudiences during the last month and this; but I did so undercircumstances which made it a waste of time, of no value whatever."The following autumn (1859) Senator Douglas visited Ohio and madespeeches for the Democratic party there. From the Republican ranks therearose a cry for Lincoln, whose superiority to Douglas in the greatdebate of the preceding year was still fresh in the public mind. Hepromptly answered it, and spoke in that State with marked effect. AtCincinnati he addressed himself especially to Kentuckians, and said, ina strain which is now seen to be prophetic:     I should not wonder if there were some Kentuckians in this     audience; we are close to Kentucky; but whether that be so or not,     we are on elevated ground, and by speaking distinctly I should not     wonder if some of the Kentuckians would hear me on the other side     of the river. For that purpose I propose to address a portion of     what I have to say to the Kentuckians. I say, then, in the first     place, to the Kentuckians, that I am what they call, as I     understand it, a 'Black Republican.' I think slavery is wrong,     morally and politically. I desire that it should be no further     spread in these United States, and I should not object if it should     gradually terminate in the whole Union. While I say this for     myself, I say to you Kentuckians, that I understand you differ     radically with me upon this proposition; that you believe slavery     is a good thing; that slavery is right; that it ought to be     extended and perpetuated in this Union. Now, there being this broad     difference between us, I do not pretend, in addressing myself to     you Kentuckians, to attempt proselyting you; that would be a vain     effort. I will tell you, so far as I am authorized to speak for the     opposition, what we mean to do with you. We mean to treat you, as     nearly as we possibly can, as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison     treated you. We mean to leave you alone, and in no way to interfere     with your institution; to abide by all and every compromise of the     Constitution, and, in a word, coming back to the original     proposition, to treat you, so far as degenerated men (if we have     degenerated) may, according to the examples of those noble     fathers--Washington, Jefferson and Madison. We mean to remember     that you are as good as we; that there is no difference between     us, other than the difference of circumstances. We mean to     recognize and bear in mind always, that you have as good hearts in     your bosoms as other people, or as we claim to have, and treat you     accordingly. We mean to marry your girls, when we have a     chance--the white ones, I mean--and I have the honor to inform you     that I once did have a chance in that way. I have told you what we     mean to do. I want to know now what _you_ mean to do. I often hear     it intimated that you mean to divide the Union whenever a     Republican, or anything like it, is elected President of the United     States. [A voice--'That is so.'] 'That is so,' one of them says; I     wonder if he is a Kentuckian? [A voice--'He is a Douglas man.']     Well, then, I want to know what you are going to do with your half     of it? Are you going to split the Ohio down through, and push your     half off a piece? Or are you going to keep it right alongside of us     outrageous fellows? Or are you going to build up a wall some way     between your country and ours, by which that movable property of     yours can't come over here any more, to the danger of your losing     it? Do you think you can better yourselves on that subject by     leaving us here under no obligation whatever to return those     specimens of your movable property that come hither? You have     divided the Union because we would not do right with you, as you     think, upon that subject; when we cease to be under obligations to     do anything for you, how much better off do you think you will be?     Will you make war upon us and kill us all? Why, gentlemen, I think     you are as gallant and as brave men as live; that you can fight as     bravely in a good cause, man for man, as any other people living;     that you have shown yourselves capable of this upon various     occasions; but man for man, you are not better than we are, and     there are not so many of you as there are of us. You will never     make much of a hand at whipping us. If we were fewer in numbers     than you, I think that you could whip us; if we were equal, it     would likely be a drawn battle; but being inferior in numbers, you     will make nothing by attempting to master us.The Hon. W.M. Dickson, whose interesting account of Lincoln's firstvisit to Cincinnati and the disappointments attending it has alreadybeen given in this narrative, says of this second visit as contrastedwith the obscurity of the first: "Lincoln returned to the city with afame wide as the continent, with the laurels of the Douglas contest onhis brow, and the Presidency almost in his grasp. He returned, greetedwith the thunder of cannon, the strains of martial music, and the joyousplaudits of thousands of citizens thronging the streets. He addressed avast concourse on Fifth Street Market; was entertained in princely styleat the Burnet House; and there received with courtesy the foremostcitizens, come to greet this Western rising star."In December of the same year Lincoln visited Kansas and addressed thepeople of that troubled State upon the political questions then beforethe country. At Leavenworth, Atchison, Elwood, and other places, he wasmet by large gatherings of eager listeners who were charmed andconvinced by his fresh and reassuring utterances. His journeys werecomplete ovations, and he returned to Illinois leaving a host of newfriends behind him. As several of Lincoln's biographers make noreference to his Kansas visit, and the entire matter seems more or lessobscured, the following letter, lately written by Mr. Harry W. Stewart,of Carlsbad, New Mexico, is of much interest: "I have recently seen areference to Lincoln's visit to Kansas as if the fact were not clearlyestablished. In this connection I may offer a personal recollection ofmy father, James G. Stewart, who was a physician practicing in thelittle town of Elwood, Kansas, from 1856 to 1860. He said that bothLincoln and Seward came out and spoke in St. Joseph, Mo., just acrossthe river from Elwood. On each occasion a large following of 'freestate' men went over to St. Jo to hear the speech and incidentally tosupport the speaker in case of violence, which had been freelypredicted. According to this reminiscence, Lincoln crossed the Missouriinto Kansas, my father having the honor of taking him in a buggy to asmall town fourteen miles distant from Elwood in Doniphan County. Theydrove out to Troy, where Mr. Lincoln made a speech. From here I think hewent on to Lawrence and other places before returning to St. Joseph, buthave no account of his movements beyond Troy. I think it was in the year1858 and must have been in the summer time, for the party took Mr.Lincoln over the Missouri on a ferry. It did not make trips oftener thanabout once in two hours. When Lincoln came to the bank on the Missouriside the boat had just gone. There was no waiting-room or benches to siton and some of the party were inclined to think they were in hard luck.When Lincoln found out how it was, he said: 'It's all right. We'll sitright down on the sand and wait for the boat.' Then they all sat down onthe ground and listened to genuine Lincoln stories till the time was up.My father often spoke with delight of this incident. I have looked invain in Lincoln histories for a more definite account of this Kansastrip. Of the actual fact there can be no doubt."Lincoln's fame, as we have seen, had now extended to the East, where heseems to have been looked upon as a rising man and an interesting figurein national politics. Invitations to visit the East now began to reachhim. In the following February (1860) he went to Brooklyn, for thepurpose of delivering a lecture in Mr. Beecher's church. The invitationhad given him much pleasure, and he prepared himself thoroughly; indeed,it is said that no effort of his life cost him so much labor as this. Inthe Plymouth congregation of Brooklyn there was an association of youngmen which was successful in getting an annual course of six lectures ofthe highest order. This association discerned in Lincoln a man worthy ofa place in its course, and invited him to give such a lecture.Meanwhile, some prominent Republican politicians of New York had heardof him as a possible candidate for the Presidency, and desired him tomake a speech in that city in order to determine whether he would be theman to present to the Republican National convention in case Mr. Sewardcould not be nominated. Lincoln informed these gentlemen of his Brooklynengagement, but said he would speak in New York if the Brooklyn clubgave its consent. That club agreed to this arrangement; and thus it wasdecided that Lincoln's speech should be delivered in New York City,instead of Brooklyn, as had been first intended. Mr. R.C. McCormick, whowas a member of the committee in charge of the arrangements, says: "WhenMr. Lincoln came to New York City, there was some confusion in thearrangements. He had at first been invited to appear in Brooklyn, butupon deliberation his friends thought it best that he should be heard inNew York. Reaching the Astor House on Saturday, February 25, he wassurprised to find by announcement in the public prints that he was tospeak at the Cooper Institute. He said he must review his address if itwas to be delivered in New York. What he had prepared for Mr. Beecher'schurch-folks might not be altogether appropriate to a miscellaneouspolitical audience. Saturday was spent in a review of the speech, and onSunday morning he went to Plymouth church, where apparently he greatlyenjoyed the service. On Monday morning I waited upon him with severalmembers of the Young Men's Republican Union, into whose hands thepreparations for the meeting at the Cooper Institute had fallen. Wefound him in a suit of black, much wrinkled from its careless packing ina small valise. He received us cordially, apologizing for the awkwardand uncomfortable appearance he made in his new suit, and expressinghimself surprised at being in New York. His form and manner were indeedvery odd, and we thought him the most unprepossessing public man we hadever met. I spoke to him of the manuscript of his forthcoming address,and suggested to him that it should be given to the press at hisearliest convenience, in order that it might be published in full on themorning following its delivery. He appeared in much doubt as to whetherany of the papers would care to print it; and it was only when Iaccompanied a reporter to his room and made a request for it, that hebegan to think his words might be of interest to the metropolitanpublic. He seemed wholly ignorant of the custom of supplying slips tothe different journals from the office first putting the addresses intype, and was charmingly innocent of the machinery so generally used,even by some of our most popular orators, to give success and _eclat_ totheir public efforts. The address was written upon blue foolscap paper,all in his own hand, and with few interlineations. I was bold enough toread portions of it, and had no doubt that its delivery would create amarked sensation throughout the country. Lincoln referred frequently toDouglas, but always in a generous and kindly manner. It was difficult toregard them as antagonists. Many stories of the famous Illinois debateswere told us, and in a very short time his frank and sparklingconversation won our hearts and made his plain face pleasant to us all.During the day it was suggested that he should be taken up Broadway andshown the city, of which he knew but little--stating, I think, that hehad been here but once before. At one place he met an Illinoisacquaintance of former years, to whom he said, in his dry, good-naturedway: 'Well, B., how have you fared since you left Illinois?' To which B.replied, 'I have made a hundred thousand dollars, and lost all. How isit with you, Mr. Lincoln?' 'Oh, very well,' said Lincoln. 'I have thecottage at Springfield, and about eight thousand dollars in money. Ifthey make me Vice-president with Seward, as some say they will, I hope Ishall be able to increase it to twenty thousand; and that is as much asany man ought to want.' We visited a photographic establishment uponthe corner of Broadway and Bleeker streets, where he sat for hispicture, the first taken in New York. At the gallery he met and wasintroduced to Hon. George Bancroft, and had a brief conversation withthat gentleman, who welcomed him to New York. The contrast in theappearance of the men was most striking; the one courtly and precise inhis every word and gesture, with the air of a trans-Atlantic statesman;the other bluff and awkward, his very utterance an apology for hisignorance of metropolitan manners and customs. 'I am on my way toMassachusetts,' he said to Mr. Bancroft, 'where I have a son at school,who, if report be true, already knows much more than his father.'"On the evening of February 27 a large and brilliant audience gathered atCooper Institute, to hear the famous Western orator. The scene was onenever to be forgotten by those who witnessed it. Upon the platform satmany of the prominent men of the Republican party, and in the body ofthe hall were many ladies. The meeting was presided over by thedistinguished citizen and poet William Cullen Bryant, of whom Mr.Lincoln afterward said, "It was worth a journey to the East merely tosee such a man." The orator of the evening was introduced by Mr. Bryantwith some very complimentary allusions, especially to his controversywith Douglas. "When Mr. Lincoln came on the platform and was introducedby Mr. Bryant," says one who was present, "he seemed a giant in contrastwith him. His first sentence was delivered in a peculiarly high-keyedvoice, and disappointed us. In a short time the sharp points of hisaddress began to come, and he had not been speaking for half an hourbefore his audience seemed wild with enthusiasm." Another account says:"His manner was, to a New York audience, a very strange one, but it wascaptivating. He held the vast meeting spell-bound, and as one by onehis oddly expressed but trenchant and convincing arguments confirmed thesoundness of his political conclusions, the house broke out in wild andprolonged enthusiasm. I think I never saw an audience more thoroughlycarried away by an orator." This speech was full of trenchant passages,which called forth tumultuous applause. The following is a specimen:     I defy anyone to show that any living man in the whole world ever     did, prior to the beginning of the present century (and I might     almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present     century), declare that, in his understanding, any proper division     of local from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution,     forbade the Federal Government to control slavery in the Federal     territories. To those who now so declare, I give not only our     fathers who framed the government under which we live, but with     them all other living men within the century in which it was     framed, among whom to search, and they shall not be able to find     the evidence of a single man agreeing with them.Referring to the South, and the growing political discontent in thatquarter, he said:     Let all who believe that our fathers understood this question just     as well as, and even better than, we do now, speak as they spoke     and act as they acted upon it. This is all Republicans ask--all     Republicans desire--in relation to slavery. As those fathers marked     it, so let it be again marked, as an evil not to be extended, but     to be tolerated and protected only because, and so far as, its     actual presence among us makes that toleration and protection a     necessity. Let all the guarantees those fathers gave it be not     grudgingly but fully and fairly maintained.His counsel to the young Republican party was timely and full of wisdom.     A few words now to Republicans: It is exceedingly desirable that     all parts of this great Confederacy shall be at peace, and in     harmony one with another. Let us Republicans do our part to have it     so. Even though much provoked, let us do nothing through passion     and ill-temper. Even though the Southern people will not so much as     listen to us, let us calmly consider their demands, and yield to     them, if in our deliberate view of our duty we possibly can.The address closed with the following impressive words:     Wrong as we think slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone     where it is, because that much is due to the necessity arising from     its actual presence in the nation; but can we, while our votes will     prevent it, allow it to spread into the National Territories, and     to overrun us here in these free States? If our sense of duty     forbids this, then let us stand by our duty, fearlessly and     effectively. Let us be diverted by none of those sophistical     contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and     belabored--contrivances such as groping for some middle ground     between the right and the wrong, vain as the search for a man who     should be neither a living man nor a dead man,--such as a policy of     'don't care' on a question about which all true men do care,--such     as Union appeals, beseeching true Union men to yield to     Disunionists, reversing the divine rule, and calling not the     sinners but the righteous to repentance,--such as invocations of     Washington, imploring men to unsay what Washington said and undo     what Washington did. Neither let us be slandered from our duty by     false accusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces of     destruction to the Government nor of dungeons to ourselves. Let us     have faith that right makes might; and in that faith, let us to the     end dare to do our duty as we understand it.The Cooper Institute speech made a profound impression upon the public.All who saw and heard Lincoln on that occasion felt the influence of hisstrange but powerful personality; and acute minds recognized in theunsophisticated Western lawyer a new force in American politics. Thisspeech made Lincoln known throughout the country, and undoubtedly didmore than anything else to secure him the nomination for the Presidency.Aside from its extensive publication in the newspapers, various editionsof it appeared in pamphlet form, one of the best of which was issued byMessrs. C.C. Nott and Cephas Brainard, who appended to their edition anestimate of the speech that is well worth reprinting here: "No one whohas not actually attempted to verify its details can understand thepatient research and historical labor which it embodies. The history ofour earlier politics is scattered through numerous journals, statutes,pamphlets, and letters; and these are defective in completeness andaccuracy of statement, and in indexes and tables of contents. Neithercan any one who has not travelled over this precise ground appreciatethe accuracy of every trivial detail, or the self-denying impartialitywith which Mr. Lincoln has turned from the testimony of 'the fathers' onthe general question of slavery to present the single question which hediscusses. From the first line to the last, from his premises to hisconclusion, he travels with a swift, unerring directness which nologician ever excelled,--an argument complete and full, without theaffectation of learning, and without the stiffness which usuallyaccompanies dates and details. A single easy, simple sentence of plainAnglo-Saxon words contains a chapter of history that, in some instances,has taken days of labor to verify, and must have cost the author monthsof investigation to acquire; and though the public should justlyestimate the labor bestowed on the facts which are stated, they cannotestimate the greater labor involved on those which are omitted--how manypages have been read--how many works examined--what numerous statutes,resolutions, speeches, letters, and biographies have been lookedthrough. Commencing with this address as a political pamphlet, thereader will leave it as an historical work--brief, complete, profound,impartial, truthful,--which will survive the time and the occasion thatcalled it forth, and be esteemed hereafter no less for its intrinsicworth than for its unpretending modesty."Lincoln's oldest son, Robert, was at this time a student in HarvardUniversity, and, chiefly to visit him, Lincoln made a brief trip to NewEngland. While there he spoke at Concord and Manchester in NewHampshire; at Woonsocket in Rhode Island; and at Hartford, New Haven,Norwich, Meriden, and Bridgeport in Connecticut. These speeches wereheard with delight by large audiences, and received hearty praise fromthe press. At Manchester, "The Mirror," a neutral paper, published thefollowing remarks on Lincoln's style of oratory: "He spoke an hour and ahalf, with great fairness, great apparent candor, and with wonderfulinterest. He did not abuse the South, the administration, or theDemocrats, nor indulge in any personalities, with the exception of a fewhits at 'Douglas's notions.' He is far from prepossessing in personalappearance, and his voice is disagreeable; and yet he wins attention andgood-will from the start. He indulges in no flowers of rhetoric, noeloquent passages. He is not a wit, a humorist, or a clown; yet so finea vein of pleasantry and good-nature pervades what he says, gliding overa deep current of poetical arguments, that he keeps his hearers in asmiling mood, ready to swallow all he says. His sense of the ludicrousis very keen; and an exhibition of that is the clincher of all hisarguments--not the ludicrous acts of persons, but ludicrous ideas. Forthe first half-hour his opponents would agree with every word heuttered; and from that point he began to lead them off little by little,until it seemed as if he had got them all into his fold."The Rev. John. P. Gulliver, of Norwich, Connecticut, has given a mostinteresting reminiscence of Lincoln's speech in that city while on histour through New England. On the morning following the speech he metLincoln on a railroad train, and entered into conversation with him. Inspeaking of his speech, Mr. Gulliver remarked to Lincoln that he thoughtit the most remarkable one he ever heard. "Are you sincere in what yousay?" inquired Lincoln. "I mean every word of it," replied the minister;"indeed, I learned more of the art of public speaking last evening thanI could from a whole course of lectures on rhetoric." Then Lincolninformed him of a "most extraordinary circumstance" that had occurred atNew Haven a few days previous. A professor of rhetoric in Yale College,he had been told, came to hear him, took notes of his speech, and gave alecture on it to his class the following day, and, not satisfied withthat, followed him to Meriden the next evening and heard him again forthe same purpose. All this seemed to Lincoln to be "very extraordinary."He had been sufficiently astonished by his success in the West, but hehad no expectation of any marked success in the East, particularly amongliterary and learned men. "Now," said Lincoln, "I should like very muchto know what it is in my speech which you thought so remarkable, andwhich interested my friend the professor so much." Mr. Gulliver's answerwas: "The clearness of your statements, the unanswerable style of yourreasoning, and especially your illustrations, which were romance andpathos and fun and logic all welded together." After Mr. Gulliver hadfully satisfied his curiosity by a further exposition of thepolitician's peculiar power, Lincoln said: "I am much obliged to you forthis. I have been wishing for a long time to find someone who would makethis analysis for me. It throws light on a subject which has been darkto me. I can understand very readily how such a power as you haveascribed to me will account for the effect which seems to be producedby my speeches. I hope you have not been too flattering in yourestimate. Certainly I have had a most wonderful success for a man of mylimited education." Mr. Gulliver then inquired into the processes bywhich he had acquired his education, and was rewarded with manyinteresting details. When they were about to part, the minister said:"Mr. Lincoln, may I say one thing to you before we separate?""Certainly; anything you please," was the response. "You have justspoken," said Mr. Gulliver, "of the tendency of political life inWashington to debase the moral convictions of our representatives there,by the admixture of considerations of mere political expediency. Youhave become, by the controversy with Mr. Douglas, one of our leaders inthis great struggle with slavery, which is undoubtedly the struggle ofthe nation and the age. What I would like to say is this, and I say itwith a full heart: Be true to your principles, and we will be true toyou, and God will be true to us all." Mr. Lincoln, touched by theearnestness of his interlocutor, took his hand in both his own, and,with his face full of sympathetic light, exclaimed: "I say _amen_ tothat! _amen to that_!"After the New England tour, Lincoln returned to his home in Springfield.As often happens, those least appreciative of his success were his ownneighbors; and certain reflections gained vogue concerning his motivesin visiting the East. It was charged that he had been mercenary; thathis political speeches had been paid for. Something of this sort havingbeen brought to Lincoln's notice, he disposed of the matter in thefollowing manly and characteristic letter:     C.F. McNEILL, ESQ.--_Dear Sir:_--Reaching home yesterday, I found     yours of the 23d March, enclosing a slip from the 'Middleport     Press.' It is not true that I ever charged anything for a political     speech in my life; but this much is true: Last October I was     requested by letter to deliver some sort of speech in Mr. Beecher's     church in Brooklyn, 200 being offered in the first letter. I wrote     that I could do it in February, provided they would take a     political speech if I could find time to get up no other. They     agreed; and subsequently I informed them the speech would have to     be a political one. When I reached New York, I learned for the     first time that the place was changed to Cooper Institute. I made     the speech, and left for New England, where I have a son at school,     neither asking for pay nor having any offered me. Three days after,     a check for 200 was sent me, and I took it, and did not know it     was wrong. My understanding now is--though I knew nothing of it at     the time--that they did charge for admittance at the Cooper     Institute, and that they took in more than twice 200. I have made     this explanation to you as a friend; but I wish no explanation made     to our enemies. What they want is a squabble and a fuss; and that     they can have if we explain; and they cannot have it if we don't.     When I returned through New York from New England, I was told by     the gentleman who sent me the check that a drunken vagabond in the     club, having learned something about the 200, made the exhibition     out of which the 'Herald' manufactured the article quoted by the     'Press' of your town. My judgment is, and therefore my request is,     that you give no denial, and no explanations.     Thanking you for your kind interest in the matter, I remain,     Yours truly, A. LINCOLN.It appears that on the Sunday which Lincoln spent in New York City hevisited a Sunday School in the notorious region called Five Points, andthere made a short address to the scholars. After his return toSpringfield, one of his neighbors, hearing of this, thought it would bea good subject for bantering Lincoln about, and accordingly visited himfor that purpose. This neighbor was generally known as "Jim," just asLincoln was called "Abe." The following account of his visit, furnishedby Mr. Edward Eggleston, shows that he did not derive as much fun fromthe "bantering" as he had expected: "He started for 'Old Abe's' office;but bursting open the door impulsively, found a stranger in conversationwith Mr. Lincoln. He turned to retrace his steps, when Lincoln calledout, 'Jim! What do you want?' 'Nothing.' 'Yes, you do; come back.' Aftersome entreaty 'Jim' approached Mr. Lincoln, and remarked, with a twinklein his eye, 'Well, Abe, I see you have been making a speech to SundaySchool children. What's the matter?' 'Sit down, Jim, and I'll tell youall about it.' And with that Lincoln put his feet on the stove, andbegan: 'When Sunday morning came, I didn't know exactly what to do. Mr.Washburne asked me where I was going. I told him I had nowhere to go;and he proposed to take me down to the Five Points Sunday School, toshow me something worth seeing. I was very much interested by what Isaw. Presently, Mr. Pease came up and spoke to Mr. Washburne, whointroduced me. Mr. Pease wanted us to speak. Washburne spoke, and then Iwas urged to speak. I told them I did not know anything about talking toSunday Schools, but Mr. Pease said many of the children were friendlessand homeless, and that a few words would do them good. Washburne said Imust talk. And so I rose to speak; but I tell you, Jim, I didn't knowwhat to say. I remembered that Mr. Pease said they were homeless andfriendless, and I thought of the time when I had been pinched byterrible poverty. And so I told them that I had been poor; that Iremembered when my toes stuck out through my broken shoes in winter;when my arms were out at the elbows; when I shivered with the cold. AndI told them there was only one rule; that was, always do the very bestyou can. I told them that I had always tried to do the very best Icould; and that, if they would follow that rule, they would get alongsomehow. That was about what I said. And when I got through, Mr. Peasesaid it was just the thing they needed. And when the school wasdismissed, all the teachers came up and shook hands with me, and thankedme; although I did not know that I had been saying anything of anyaccount. But the next morning I saw my remarks noticed in the papers.'Just here Mr. Lincoln put his hand in his pocket, and remarked that hehad never heard anything that touched him as had the songs which thosechildren sang. With that he drew forth a little book, saying that theyhad given him one of the books from which they sang. He began to read apiece with all the earnestness of his great, earnest soul. In the middleof the second verse his friend 'Jim' felt a choking in his throat and atickling in his nose. At the beginning of the third verse he saw thatthe stranger was weeping, and his own tears fell fast. Turning towardLincoln, who was reading straight on, he saw the great blinding tears inhis eyes, so that he could not possibly see the pages. He was repeatingthat little song from memory. How often he had read it, or how long itssweet and simple accents continued to reverberate through his soul, noone can know."CHAPTER XIII     Looking Towards the Presidency--The Illinois Republican Convention     of 1860--A "Send-Off" for Lincoln--The National Republican     Convention at Chicago--Contract of the Leading Candidates--Lincoln     Nominated--Scenes at the Convention--Sketches by     Eye-Witnesses--Lincoln Hearing the News--The Scene at     Springfield--A Visit to Lincoln at His Home--Recollections of a     Distinguished Sculptor--Receiving the Committee of the     Convention--Nomination of Douglas--Campaign of 1860--Various     Campaign Reminiscences--Lincoln and the Tall Southerner--The Vote     of the Springfield Clergy--A Graceful Letter to the Poet     Bryant--"Looking up Hard Spots."In the latter part of the year 1859, after Lincoln had gainedconsiderable national prominence through events already brieflynarrated, some of his friends began to consider the expediency ofbringing him forward as a candidate for the Presidency in 1860. Theyoung Republican party had thus far been in the minority, and thenecessity was generally felt of nominating a man who would not renderhimself objectionable by advocating extreme or unpopular measures. Thesubject was mentioned to Lincoln, but he seems not to have taken it veryseriously. He said that there were distinguished men in the party whowere more worthy of the nomination, and whose public services entitledthem to it. Toward spring in 1860 Lincoln consented to a conference onthe subject with some of his more intimate friends. The meeting tookplace in a committee-room in the State House. Mr. Bushnell, Mr. Hatch(then Secretary of State), Mr. Judd (Chairman of the Republican StateCentral Committee), Mr. Peck, and Mr. Grimshaw were present. They wereunanimous in opinion as to the expediency and propriety of makingLincoln a candidate. But he was still reluctant; he doubted that hecould get the nomination even if he wished it, and asked until the nextmorning to consider the matter. The next day he authorized his friendsto work for him, if they so desired, as a candidate for the Presidency,at the National Republican convention to be held in May at Chicago.It is evident that while Lincoln had no serious expectation of receivingthe nomination, yet having consented to become a candidate he was by nomeans indifferent on the subject. The following confidential letter tohis friend N.B. Judd shows his feelings at this time.     SPRINGFIELD, ILL., FEBRUARY 9, 1860.     HON. N.B. JUDD--_Dear Sir_:--I am not in a position where it would     hurt much for me not to be nominated on the national ticket; but I     am where it would hurt some for me not to get the Illinois     delegates. What I expected when I wrote the letter to Messrs. Dole     and others is now happening. Your discomfited assailants are more     bitter against me, and they will, for revenge upon me, lay to the     Bates egg in the South and the Seward egg in the North, and go far     towards squeezing me out in the middle with nothing. Can you not     help me a little in this matter in your end of the vineyard? (I     mean this to be private.)     Yours as ever, A. LINCOLN.It would seem that the original intention of Lincoln's friends had beento bring him out as a candidate for the Vice-Presidency. Hon. E.M.Haines states that as early as the spring of 1859, before theadjournment of the Legislature of which he was a member, some of theRepublican members discussed the feasibility of urging Lincoln's namefor the Vice-Presidency. Lincoln appears not to have taken very stronglyto the suggestion. "I recollect," says Mr. Haines, "that one day Mr.Lincoln came to my desk in the House of Representatives, to make someinquiry regarding another member; and during the conversation, referringto his growing reputation, I remarked to him that I did not know thatwe would be able to make him President, but perhaps we could do the nextbest thing, and make him Vice-President. He brightened up somewhat, andanswered by a story which I do not clearly recall, but the applicationof which was that he scarcely considered himself a big enough man forPresident, while the Vice-Presidency was scarcely big enough office forone who had aspired to a seat in the Senate of the United States."On the 9th and 10th of May, 1860, the Republicans of Illinois met inconvention at Decatur. Lincoln was present, although he is said to havebeen there as a mere spectator. It was, Mr. Lamon tells us, "A verylarge and spirited body, comprising the most brilliant as well as theshrewdest men in the party. It was evident that something of more thanusual importance was expected to transpire. A few moments after theconvention organized, 'Old Abe' was seen squatting, or sitting on hisheels, just within the door of the convention building. Governor Oglesbyrose and said, amid increasing silence, 'I am informed that adistinguished citizen of Illinois, and one whom Illinois will everdelight to honor, is present; and I wish to move that this body invitehim to a seat on the stand.' Here the Governor paused, as if to workcuriosity up to the highest point; then he shouted the magic name,'_Abraham Lincoln_!' A roar of applause shook every board and joist ofthe building. The motion was seconded and passed. A rush was made forthe hero, who still sat on his heels. He was seized and jerked to hisfeet. An effort was made to 'jam him through the crowd' to his place ofhonor on the stage; but the crowd was too dense. Then he was'boosted'--lifted up bodily--and lay for a few seconds sprawling andkicking upon the heads and shoulders of the great throng. In this mannerhe was gradually pushed toward the stand, and finally reached it,doubtless to his great relief, 'in the arms of some half-dozengentlemen,' who set him down in full view of his clamorous admirers.'The cheering was like the roar of the sea. Hats were thrown up by theChicago delegation, as if hats were no longer useful.' Mr. Lincoln rose,bowed, smiled, blushed, and thanked the assembly as well as he could inthe midst of such a tumult. A gentleman who saw it all says, 'I thenthought him one of the most diffident and worst-plagued men I ever saw.'At another stage of the proceedings, Governor Oglesby rose again withanother provoking and mysterious speech. 'There was,' he said, 'an oldDemocrat outside who had something he wished to present to theconvention.' 'Receive it!' 'Receive it!' cried some. 'What is it?' 'Whatis it?' yelled some of the lower Egyptians, who seemed to have an ideathat the 'old Democrat' might want to blow them up with an infernalmachine. The door opened; and a fine, robust old fellow, with an opencountenance and bronzed cheeks, marched into the midst of theassemblage, bearing on his shoulder 'two small triangular heart rails,'surmounted by a banner with this inscription: '_Two rails from a lotmade by Abraham Lincoln and John Hanks, in the Sangamon Bottom, in theyear 1830_.' The sturdy rail-bearer was old John Hanks himself, enjoyingthe great field-day of his life. He was met with wild and tumultuouscheers, prolonged through several minutes; and it was observed that theChicago and Central-Illinois men sent up the loudest and longestcheering. The scene was tempestuous and bewildering. But it ended atlast; and now the whole body, those in the secret and those out of it,clamored for a speech from Mr. Lincoln, who in the meantime 'blushed,'but seemed to shake with inward laughter. In response to the repeatedcalls he rose and said: 'Gentlemen, I suppose you want to know somethingabout those things' (pointing to old John and the rails). 'Well, thetruth is, John Hanks and I did make rails in the Sangamon Bottom. Idon't know whether we made those rails or not; the fact is, I don'tthink they are a credit to the makers' (laughing as he spoke). 'But I doknow this: I made rails then, and I think I could make better ones thanthese now.' By this time the innocent Egyptians began to open theireyes; they saw plainly enough the admirable Presidential scheme unfoldedto their view. The result of it all was a resolution declaring that'Abraham Lincoln is the first choice of the Republican party of Illinoisfor the Presidency, and instructing the delegates to the Chicagoconvention to use all honorable means to secure his nomination, and tocast the vote of the State as a unit for him.'"On the 16th of May, 1860, the National Republican convention met atChicago. An immense building called "The Wigwam," erected for theoccasion, was filled with an excited throng numbering fully twelvethousand. After the usual preliminaries the convention settled down tothe serious work of nominating a candidate for the Presidency. From theoutset the contest was clearly between Abraham Lincoln of Illinois andWilliam H. Seward of New York. On the first ballot, Seward's vote of173-1/2 was followed by Lincoln with 102--the latter having more thandouble the vote of his next competitor, Simon Cameron of Pennsylvania(51 votes), who was followed by Salmon P. Chase of Ohio (49 votes) andEdward Bates of Missouri (48 votes). A contrast between these tworemarkable men, Seward and Lincoln, now political antagonists but soonto be intimately associated at the head of the Government--one asPresident and the other as his prime minister--is most interesting andinstructive. Seward was a trained statesman and experienced politicianof ripe culture and great sagacity, the acknowledged leader of theRepublican party, New York's ex-Governor and now its most distinguishedSenator. His position and career were therefore far more conspicuousthan those of Lincoln. His supporters in the convention werewell-organized, bold, confident, and expected that he would be nominatedby acclamation. Lincoln, on the other hand, was still essentially acountry lawyer, who had come into prominence mainly as the competitor ofSenator Douglas in Illinois in 1858. With all his native strength ofmind and force of character, he was, compared with the polished Seward,a rude backwoodsman, unskilled in handling the reins of government,unfamiliar with the wiles of statecraft, and unused to the company ofdiplomats and social leaders. His political reputation, and his supportin the convention, were chiefly Western. Yet his Cooper Institutespeech, delivered three months before the convention met, had done muchfor him in the East; and the homely title of "Honest Old Abe" hadextended throughout the free States. Unlike Seward, he had no politicalenemies, and was the second choice of most of the delegates whose firstchoice was some other candidate.In political management and strategy the Western men at the conventionsoon showed that they were at best a match for those from the East. Soonafter the opening of the convention, Lincoln's friends saw that therewas an organized body of men in the crowd who cheered vociferouslywhenever Seward's name was mentioned. "At a meeting of the Illinoisdelegation at the Tremont House," says Mr. Arnold, "on the evening ofthe first day, at which Judd, Davis, Cook and others were present, itwas decided that on the second day Illinois and the West should beheard. There was then living in Chicago a man whose voice could drownthe roar of Lake Michigan in its wildest fury; nay, it was said that hisshout could be heard on a calm day across that lake. Cook of Ottawa knewanother man living on the Illinois river, a Dr. Ames, who had neverfound his equal in his ability to shout and hurrah. He was, however, aDemocrat. Cook telegraphed to him to come to Chicago by the firsttrain. These two men with stentorian voices met some of the Illinoisdelegation at the Tremont House, and were instructed to organize each abody of men to cheer and shout, which they speedily did, out of thecrowds which were in attendance from the Northwest. They were placed onopposite sides of the Wigwam, and instructed that when they saw Cooktake out his white handkerchief they were to cheer and not to ceaseuntil he returned it to his pocket. Cook was conspicuous on theplatform, and at the first utterance of the name of Lincoln,simultaneously with the wave of Cook's handkerchief, there went up sucha cheer, such a shout as had never before been heard, and which startledthe friends of Seward as the cry of 'Marmion' on Flodden Field 'startledthe Scottish foe.' The New Yorkers tried to follow when the name ofSeward was spoken, but, beaten at their own game, their voices weredrowned by the cheers for Lincoln. This was kept up until Lincoln wasnominated, amidst a storm of applause probably never before equalled ata political convention."The result on the first ballot, with Seward leading Lincoln by 71-1/2votes, has already been given. On the second ballot Seward gained 11votes, giving him 184-1/2; while Lincoln made the astonishing gain of 78votes, giving him a total of 181 and reducing Seward's lead of 71-1/2votes to 3-1/2 votes. There was no longer doubt of the result. The thirdballot came, and Lincoln, passing Seward who had fallen off 3-1/2 votesfrom the previous ballot, ran rapidly up to 231-1/2 votes--233 being thenumber required to nominate. Lincoln now lacked but a vote and a half tomake him the nominee. At this juncture, the chairman of the Ohiodelegation rose and changed four votes from Chase to Lincoln, giving himthe nomination. The Wigwam was shaken to its foundation by the roaringcheers. The multitude in the streets answered the multitude within, andin a moment more all the volunteer artillery of Chicago joined in thegrand acclamation. After a time the business of the conventionproceeded, amid great excitement. All the votes that had heretofore beencast against Lincoln were cast for him before this ballot concluded. Theconvention completed its work by the nomination of Hannibal Hamlin ofMaine for Vice-President.Mr. F.B. Carpenter, who was present at Lincoln's nomination, furnishes agraphic sketch of this dramatic episode. "The scene surpasseddescription. Men had been stationed upon the roof of the Wigwam tocommunicate the result of the different ballots to the thousandsoutside, far outnumbering the packed crowd inside. To these men one ofthe secretaries shouted: 'Fire the salute! Lincoln is nominated!' Then,as the cheering inside died away, the roar began on the outside, andswelled up from the excited masses like the noise of many waters. Thisthe insiders heard, and to it they replied. Thus deep called to deepwith such a frenzy of sympathetic enthusiasm that even the thunderingsalute of cannon was unheard by many on the platform. When theexcitement had partly subsided, Mr. Evarts of New York arose, and inappropriate words expressed his grief that Seward had not beennominated. He then moved that the nomination of Abraham Lincoln be madeunanimous. Governor John A. Andrew of Massachusetts and Hon. Carl Schurzof Wisconsin seconded the motion, and it was carried. Then theenthusiasm of the multitude burst out anew. A large banner, prepared bythe Pennsylvania delegation, was conspicuously displayed, bearing theinscription, 'Pennsylvania good for twenty thousand majority for thepeople's candidate, Abe Lincoln.' Delegates tore up the sticks andboards bearing the names of their several States, and waved them aloftover their heads. A brawny man jumped upon the platform, and pullinghis coat-sleeves up to his elbows, shouted: 'I can't stop! Three timesthree more cheers for our next President, Abe Lincoln!' A full-lengthportrait of the candidate was produced upon the platform. Mr. Greeleytelegraphed to the N.Y. Tribune: 'There was never another such scene inAmerica.' Chicago went wild. One hundred guns were fired from the top ofthe Tremont House. At night the city was in a blaze of glory. Bonfires,processions, torchlights, fire-works, illuminations and salutes, 'filledthe air with noise and the eye with beauty.' 'Honest Old Abe' was theutterance of every man in the streets. The Illinois delegation before itseparated 'resolved' that the millennium had come."Governor Andrew, who was destined to have highly important and intimaterelations with Lincoln during the Civil War, records his firstimpressions of him in a few vivid sentences. "Beyond the experiences ofthe journey from Boston to Chicago," says Andrew's biographer, "beyondeven the strain and excitement of those hours in caucus and convention,was the impression made on him by Lincoln as he saw him for the firsttime." Andrew was one of the committee of delegates who went toSpringfield to notify Lincoln of his nomination at Chicago. He and theother delegates, he says, "saw in a flash that here was a man who wasmaster of himself. For the first time they understood that he whom theyhad supposed to be little more than a loquacious and clever Statepolitician, had force, insight, conscience; that their misgivings werevain.... My eyes were never visited with the vision of a human face inwhich more transparent honesty and more benignant kindness were combinedwith more of the intellect and firmness which belong to masculinehumanity. I would trust my case with the honesty and intellect and heartand brain of Abraham Lincoln as a lawyer; and I would trust my country'scause in the care of Abraham Lincoln as its chief magistrate, while thewind blows and the water runs."Dr. J.G. Holland gives a vivid picture of Lincoln's reception of theexciting news. "In the little city of Springfield," says Dr. Holland,"in the heart of Illinois, two hundred miles from where these excitingevents were in progress, sat Abraham Lincoln, in constant telegraphiccommunication with his friends in Chicago. He was apprised of theresults of every ballot, and with some of his friends sat in the'Journal' office receiving and commenting upon the dispatches. It wasone of the decisive moments of his life--a moment on which hung his fateas a public man, his place in history. He fully appreciated themomentous results of the convention to himself and the nation, andforesaw the nature of the great struggle which his nomination andelection would inaugurate. At last, in the midst of intense excitement,a messenger from the telegraph office entered with the decisive dispatchin his hand. Without handing it to anyone, he took his way solemnly tothe side of Mr. Lincoln, and said: 'The convention has made anomination, and Mr. Seward is--the second man on the list.' Then hejumped upon the editorial table and shouted, 'Gentlemen, I propose threecheers for Abraham Lincoln, the next President of the United States!'and the call was boisterously responded to. He then handed the dispatchto Mr. Lincoln, who read it in silence, and then aloud. After exchanginggreetings and receiving congratulations from those around him, he stroveto get out of the crowd, and as he moved off he remarked to those nearhim: 'Well, there is a little woman who will be interested in this news,and I will go home and tell her,' and he hurried on, with the crowdfollowing and cheering."As soon as the news spread about Springfield a salute of a hundred gunswas fired, and during the afternoon Lincoln's friends and neighborsthronged his house to tender their congratulations and express theirjoy. "In the evening," says one narrator, "the State House was thrownopen and a most enthusiastic meeting held by the Republicans. At theclose they marched in a body to the Lincoln mansion and called for thenominee. Mr. Lincoln appeared, and after a brief, modest, and heartyspeech, invited as many as could get into the house to enter; the crowdresponding that after the fourth of March they would give him a largerhouse. The people did not retire until a late hour, and then moved offreluctantly, leaving the excited household to their rest."Among the more significant and intimate of the personal reminiscences ofLincoln are those by Mr. Leonard W. Volk, the distinguished sculptoralready mentioned in these pages. Mr. Volk arrived in Springfield on theday of Lincoln's nomination, and had some unusually interestingconversation with him. He had already, only a month before, made thelife-mask of Lincoln that became so well and favorably known. It is oneof the last representations showing him without a beard. Thecircumstances and incidents attending the taking of this life-mask, asnarrated by Mr. Volk, are well worth reproducing here. "One morning inApril, 1860," says Mr. Volk, "I noticed in the paper that AbrahamLincoln was in Chicago,--retained as one of the counsel in a 'Sand-bar'trial in which the Michigan Central Railroad was either plaintiff ordefendant. I at once decided to remind him of his promise to sit to me,made two years before. I found him in the United States District Courtroom, his feet on the edge of the table, and his long dark hair standingout at every imaginable angle. He was surrounded by a group of lawyers,such as James F. Joy, Isaac N. Arnold, Thomas Hoyne, and others. Mr.Arnold obtained his attention in my behalf, when he instantly arose andmet me outside the rail, recognizing me at once with his usual grip ofboth hands. He remembered his promise, and said, in answer to myquestion, that he expected to be detained by the case for a week. Headded: 'I shall be glad to give you the sittings. When shall I come, andhow long will you need me each time?' Just after breakfast every morningwould, he said, suit him the best, and he could remain till court openedat ten o'clock. I answered that I would be ready for him the nextmorning (Thursday). 'Very well, Mr. Volk, I will be there, and I'll goto a barber and have my hair cut before I come.' I requested him not tolet the barber cut it too short, and said I would rather he would leaveit as it was; but to this he would not consent.... He was on handpromptly at the time appointed; indeed, he never failed to be on time.My studio was in the fifth story. There were no elevators in those days,and I soon learned to distinguish his step on the stairs, and am sure hefrequently came up two, if not three, steps at a stride. When he satdown the first time in that hard, wooden, low-armed chair which I stillpossess, and which has been occupied by Douglas, Seward, and GeneralsGrant and Dix, he said, 'Mr. Volk, I have never sat before to sculptoror painter--only for daguerreotypes and photographs. What shall I do?' Itold him I would only take the measurements of his head and shouldersthat time, and that the next morning I would make a cast of his face,which would save him a number of sittings. He stood up against the wall,and I made a mark above his head, and then measured up to it from thefloor and said: 'You are just twelve inches taller than Judge Douglas;that is, just six feet four inches.'"Before commencing the cast next morning, and knowing Mr. Lincoln'sfondness for a story, I told him one in order to remove what I thoughtan apprehensive expression--as though he feared the operation might bedangerous. He sat naturally in the chair when I made the cast, and sawevery move I made in a mirror opposite, as I put the plaster on withoutinterference with his eyesight or his free breathing through thenostrils. It was about an hour before the mould was ready to be removed,and being all in one piece, with both ears perfectly taken, it clungpretty hard, as the cheek-bones were higher than the jaws at the lobe ofthe ear. He bent his head low, and worked the cast off without breakingor injury; it hurt a little, as a few hairs of the tender temples pulledout with the plaster and made his eyes water."He entered my studio on Sunday morning, remarking that a friend at thehotel (Tremont House) had invited him to go to church, 'but,' said Mr.Lincoln, 'I thought I'd rather come and sit for the bust. The fact is,'he continued, 'I don't like to hear cut-and-dried sermons. No--when Ihear a man preach, I like to see him act as _if he were fighting bees_!'And he extended his long arms, at the same time suiting the action tothe words. He gave me on this day a long sitting of more than fourhours, and when it was concluded we went to our family apartment to lookat a collection of photographs which I had made in 1855-6-7 in Rome andFlorence. While sitting in the rocking-chair, he took my little son onhis lap and spoke kindly to him, asking his name, age, etc. I held thephotographs up and explained them to him; but I noticed a growingweariness, and his eyelids closed occasionally as if he were sleepy, orwere thinking of something besides Grecian and Roman statuary andarchitecture. Finally he said, 'These things must be very interesting toyou, Mr. Volk; but the truth is, I don't know much of history, and all Ido know of it I have learned from law books.'"The sittings were continued daily till the Thursday following; andduring their continuance he would talk almost unceasingly, telling someof the funniest and most laughable of stories, but he talked little ofpolitics or religion during these sittings. He said, 'I am bored nearlyevery time I sit down to a public dining-table by some one pitching intome on politics.' Many people, presumably political aspirants with an eyeto future prospects, besieged my door for interviews, but I made it arule to keep it locked, and I think Mr. Lincoln appreciated theprecaution. On our last sitting I noticed that Mr. Lincoln was insomething of a hurry. I had finished the head, but desired to representhis breast and brawny shoulders as nature presented them; so he strippedoff his coat, waistcoat, shirt, cravat, and collar, threw them on achair, pulled his undershirt down a short distance, tying the sleevesbehind him, and stood up without a murmur for an hour or so. I then saidI had done, and was a thousand times obliged to him for his promptnessand patience, and offered to assist him to re-dress, but he said, 'No, Ican do it better alone.' I kept at my work without looking toward him,wishing to catch the form as accurately as possible while it was freshin my memory. He left hurriedly, saying he had an engagement, and with acordial 'Good-bye! I will see you again soon,' passed out. A few minutesafter, I recognized his steps rapidly returning. The door opened and inhe came, exclaiming, 'Hello, Mr. Volk! I got down on the sidewalk, andfound I had forgotten to put on my undershirt, and thought it wouldn'tdo to go through the streets this way.' Sure enough, there were thesleeves of that garment dangling below the skirts of his broadclothfrock-coat! I went at once to his assistance, and helped to undress andre-dress him all right, and out he went with a hearty laugh at theabsurdity of the thing."Returning to the visit with Lincoln at Springfield on the day of hisnomination, Mr. Volk says. "The afternoon was lovely--bright and sunny,neither too warm nor too cool; the grass, trees, and the hosts ofblooming roses, so profuse in Springfield, appeared to be vying withthe ringing bells and waving flags. I went straight to Mr. Lincoln'sunpretentious little two-story house. He saw me from his door or windowcoming down the street, and as I entered the gate he was on the platformin front of the door, and quite alone. His face looked radiant. Iexclaimed: 'I am the first man from Chicago, I believe, who has thehonor of congratulating you on your nomination for President.' Thenthose two great hands took both of mine with a grasp never to beforgotten. And while shaking them, I said: 'Now that you will doubtlessbe the next President of the United States, I want to make a statue ofyou, and shall do my best to do you justice.' Said he, 'I don't doubtit, for I have come to the conclusion that you are an honest man,' andwith that greeting I thought my hands were in a fair way of beingcrushed. I was invited into the parlor, and soon Mrs. Lincoln entered,holding a rose-bouquet in her hand, which she presented to me after theintroduction; and in return I gave her a cabinet-size bust of herhusband, which I had modelled from the large one, and happened to havewith me. Before leaving the house it was arranged that Mr. Lincoln wouldgive Saturday forenoon to obtaining full-length photographs to serve mefor the proposed statue. On Saturday evening, the committee appointed bythe convention to notify Mr. Lincoln formally of his nomination, headedby Mr. Ashmun of Massachusetts, reached Springfield by special train,bearing a large number of people, two or three hundred of whom carriedrails on their shoulders, marching in military style from the train tothe old State House Hall of Representatives, where they stacked themlike muskets. The evening was beautiful and clear, and the entirepopulation was astir. The bells pealed, flags waved, and cannonthundered forth the triumphant nomination of Springfield's distinguishedcitizen. The bonfires blazed brightly, and especially in front of thatprim-looking white house on Eighth street. The committee and the vastcrowd following it passed in at the front door, and made their exitthrough the kitchen door in the rear, Mr. Lincoln giving them all ahearty shake of the hand as they passed him in the parlor. Byappointment, I was to cast Mr. Lincoln's hands on the Sunday followingthis memorable Saturday, at nine A.M. I found him ready, but he lookedmore grave and serious than he had appeared on the previous days. Iwished him to hold something in his right hand, and he looked for apiece of pasteboard, but could find none. I told him a round stick woulddo as well as anything. Thereupon he went to the wood-shed, and I heardthe saw go, and he soon returned to the dining-room (where I did thework), whittling off the end of a piece of broom-handle. I remarked tohim that he need not whittle off the edges. 'Oh, well,' said he, 'Ithought I would like to have it nice.' When I had successfully cast themould of the right hand, I began the left, pausing a few moments to hearMr. Lincoln tell me about a scar on the thumb. 'You have heard that theycall me a rail-splitter, and you saw them carrying rails in theprocession Saturday evening; well, it is true that I did split rails,and one day, while I was sharpening a wedge on a log, the axe glancedand nearly took my thumb off, and there is the scar, you see.' The righthand appeared swollen as compared with the left, on account of excessivehand-shaking the evening before; this difference is distinctly shown inthe cast. That Sunday evening I returned to Chicago with the moulds ofhis hands, three photographic negatives of him, the identical blackalpaca campaign suit of 1858, and a pair of Lynn newly-made peggedboots. The clothes were all burned up in the great Chicago fire. Thecasts of the face and hands I saved by taking them with me to Rome, andthey have crossed the sea four times. The last time I saw Mr. Lincolnwas in January, 1861, at his house in Springfield. His little parlorwas full of friends and politicians. He introduced me to them all, andremarked to me aside that since he had sat to me for his bust, eight ornine months before, he had lost forty pounds in weight. This was easilyperceptible, for the lines of his jaws were very sharply defined throughthe short beard which he was allowing to grow. Then he turned to thecompany and explained in a general way that I had made a bust of himbefore his nomination, and that he was then giving daily sittings toanother sculptor; that he had sat to him for a week or more, but couldnot see the likeness, though he might yet bring it out. 'But,' continuedMr. Lincoln, 'in two or three days after Mr. Volk began my bust, therewas the animal himself!' And this was about the last, if not the last,remark I ever heard him utter, except the good-bye and his good wishesfor my success."Saturday, May 19, the committee of the Chicago convention arrived atSpringfield to notify Mr. Lincoln of his nomination. The Hon. GeorgeAshmun, as chairman of the committee, delivered the formal address, towhich Lincoln listened with dignity, but with an air of profoundsadness, as though the trials in store for him had already "cast theirshadows before." In response to the address, Lincoln said:     MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE:--I tender to you and     through you to the Republican National convention, and all the     people represented in it, my profoundest thanks for the high honor     done me, which you now formally announce. Deeply and even painfully     sensible of the great responsibility which is inseparable from this     high honor--a responsibility which I could almost wish had fallen     upon some one of the far more eminent men and experienced statesmen     whose distinguished names were before the convention--I shall, by     your leave, consider more fully the resolutions of the convention,     denominated the platform, and, without unnecessary and     unreasonable delay, respond to you, Mr. Chairman, in writing, not     doubting that the platform will be found satisfactory, and the     nomination gratefully accepted. And now I will not longer defer the     pleasure of taking you, and each of you, by the hand.A letter was then handed Lincoln containing the official notice,accompanied by the resolutions of the convention. To this letter hereplied, a few days later, as follows:     SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, MAY 23, 1860.     SIR--I accept the nomination tendered to me by the convention over     which you presided, of which I am formally apprised in a letter of     yourself and others acting as a Committee of the Convention for     that purpose. The declaration of principles and sentiments which     accompanies your letter meets my approval, and it shall be my care     not to violate it, or disregard it in any part. Imploring the     assistance of Divine Providence, and with due regard to the views     and feelings of all who were represented in the convention, to the     rights of all the States and Territories and people of the nation,     to the inviolability of the Constitution, and the perpetual union,     harmony and prosperity of all, I am most happy to co-operate for     the practical success of the principles declared by the convention.In June Mr. Douglas was nominated for the Presidency by the Democraticconvention, which met at Baltimore on the 18th. Mr. Douglas made apersonal canvass, speaking in most of the states, North and South, andexerting all the powers of which he was master to win success. Thecampaign, as Mr. Arnold states, "has had no parallel. The enthusiasm ofthe people was like a great conflagration, like a prairie fire before awild tornado. A little more than twenty years had passed since OwenLovejoy, brother of Elijah Lovejoy, on the bank of the Mississippi,kneeling on the turf not then green over the grave of the brother whohad been killed for his fidelity to freedom, had sworn eternal waragainst slavery. From that time on, he and his associate Abolitionistshad gone forth preaching their crusade against oppression, with heartsof fire and tongues of lightning; and now the consummation was to berealized of a President elected on the distinct ground of opposition tothe extension of slavery. For years the hatred of that institution hadbeen growing and gathering force. Whittier, Bryant, Lowell, Longfellow,and others, had written the lyrics of liberty; the graphic pen of Mrs.Stowe, in 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' had painted the cruelties of the overseerand the slaveholder; but the acts of slaveholders themselves did more topromote the growth of anti-slavery than all other causes. Thepersecutions of Abolitionists in the South; the harshness and crueltyattending the execution of the fugitive laws; the brutality of Brooks inknocking down, on the floor of the Senate, Charles Sumner, for wordsspoken in debate: these and many other outrages had fired the hearts ofthe people of the free States against this barbarous institution.Beecher, Phillips, Channing, Sumner, and Seward, with their eloquence;Chase with his logic; Lincoln, with his appeals to the principles of theDeclaration of Independence, and to the opinions of the founders of therepublic, his clear statements, his apt illustrations, and, above all,his wise moderation,--all had swelled the voice of the people, whichfound expression through the ballot-box, and which declared that slaveryshould go no further."Among the various reminiscences of the memorable Presidential campaignof 1860, some of peculiar interest are furnished by Dr. Newton Bateman,President of Knox College, Illinois. Dr. Bateman had known Lincoln since1842; and from the year 1858, when Dr. Bateman was elected StateSuperintendent of Public Instruction in Illinois, to the close ofLincoln's residence in Springfield in 1861, they saw each other daily.The testimony of so intimate an acquaintance, and one so well qualifiedto judge the character and abilities of men, is of unusual value; and itis worth noting that Dr. Bateman remarks that, while he was always anadmirer of Lincoln, yet the greatness of the man grew upon him as theyears pass by. In his professional and public work, says Dr. Bateman,Lincoln not only proved himself equal to every emergency and to everysuccessive task, but made, from the outset, the impression upon the mindof those who knew him of being in possession of great reserve force.Perhaps the secret of this lies in part in the fact that he wasaccustomed to ponder deeply upon the ultimate principles of governmentand society, and strove to base his discussions upon the firm ground ofethical truth. Says Dr. Bateman, "He was the saddest man I ever knew."It was a necessity of his nature to be much alone; and he said that allhis serious work--by which he meant the process of getting down to thebed-rock of first principles--must be done in solitude. Upon oneoccasion he called Dr. Bateman to him, and spent more than two hours inearnest conversation upon the most serious themes. At the close, Dr.Bateman said: "I did not know, Mr. Lincoln, that it was your habit tothink so deeply upon this class of subjects." "Didn't you?" said Mr.Lincoln. "I can almost say that I think of _nothing else_."One day there entered Lincoln's room a tall Southerner, a ColonelSomebody from Mississippi, whose eye's hard glitter spoke superciliousdistrust and whose stiff bearing betokened suppressed hostility. It wasbeautiful, says Dr. Bateman, to see the cold flash of the Southerner'sdark eye yield to a warmer glow, and the haughty constraint melt intofrank good-nature, under the influence of Lincoln's words of simpleearnestness and unaffected cordiality. They got so far in half an hourthat Lincoln could say, in his hearty way: "Colonel, how tall are you?""Well, taller than you, Mr. Lincoln," replied the Mississippian. "Youare mistaken there," retorted Lincoln. "Dr. Bateman, will you measureus?" "You will have to permit me to stand on a chair for that,"responded the Doctor. So a big book was adjusted above the head of each,and pencil marks made at the respective points of contact with the whitewall. Lincoln's altitude, as thus indicated, was a quarter inch abovethat of the Colonel. "I knew it," said Lincoln. "They raise tall mendown in Mississippi, but you go home and tell your folks that _Old Abetops you a little_." The Colonel went away much mollified and impressed."My God!" said he to Dr. Bateman, as he went out. "There's going to bewar; but could my people know what I have learned within the last hour,there need be no war."During the Presidential campaign, the vote of the city of Springfieldwas canvassed house by house. There were at that time twenty-threeclergymen residing in the city (not all pastors). All but three of thesesignified their intention to vote _against_ Lincoln. This fact seemed togrieve him somewhat. Soon after, in conversing upon the subject with Dr.Bateman, he said, as if thinking aloud: "These gentlemen know that JudgeDouglas does not care a cent whether slavery in the territories is votedup or voted down, for he has repeatedly told them so. They know that I_do_ care." Then, drawing from a breast pocket a well-thumbed copy ofthe New Testament, he added, after a pause, tapping upon the book withhis bony finger: "I do not so understand this book."The poet Bryant was conspicuous among the prominent Eastern men whofavored Lincoln's nomination for the Presidency in 1860. He hadintroduced Lincoln to the people of New York at the Cooper Institutemeeting of the previous winter, and was a firm believer in the Westernpolitician. After the convention Mr. Bryant wrote Lincoln a mostfriendly and timely letter, full of good feeling and of wise advice.Especially did he warn Lincoln to be cautious in committing himself toany specific policy, or making pledges or engagements of any kind. Mr.Bryant's letter contained much political wisdom, and was written in thatscholarly style for which he was distinguished. But it could not surpassthe simple dignity and grace of Lincoln's reply:     SPRINGFIELD, ILL., JUNE 28, 1860.     Please accept my thanks for the honor done me by your kind letter     of the 16th. I appreciate the danger against which you would guard     me; nor am I wanting in the _purpose_ to avoid it. I thank you for     the additional strength your words give me to maintain that     purpose.     Your friend and servant, A. LINCOLN.Mr. A.J. Grover relates that about this time he met Lincoln, and had amemorable conversation with him on the Fugitive Slave Law. Lincolndetested this law, but argued that until it was declaredunconstitutional it must be obeyed. This was a short time after therescue of a fugitive slave at Ottawa, Illinois, by John Hossack, JamesStout, Major Campbell, and others, after Judge John D. Caton, acting asUnited States Commissioner, had given his decision remanding him to thecustody of his alleged owner; and the rescuers were either in prison orout on bail, awaiting their trials. Says Mr. Grover: "When Mr. Lincolnhad finished his argument I said, 'Constitutional or not, I will neverobey the Fugitive Slave Law. I would have done as Hossack and Stout andCampbell did at Ottawa. I will never catch and return slaves inobedience to any law or constitution. I do not believe a man's libertycan be taken from him constitutionally without a trial by jury. Ibelieve the law to be not only unconstitutional, but most inhuman.''Oh,' said Mr. Lincoln, and I shall never forget his earnestness as heemphasized it by striking his hand on his knee, 'it is ungodly! it isungodly! no doubt it is ungodly! but it is the law of the land, and wemust obey it as we find it.' I said: 'Mr. Lincoln, how often have yousworn to support the Constitution? We propose to elect you President.How would you look taking an oath to support what you declare is anungodly Constitution, and asking God to help you?' He felt the force ofthe question, and, inclining his head forward and running his fingersthrough his hair several times, seemed lost in reflection; then heplaced his hand upon my knee and said, very earnestly: 'Grover, it's nouse to be always _looking up these hard spots_!'" In the terrible yearsthen almost upon him, Lincoln found many such "hard spots" withouttaking the trouble to look them up.CHAPTER XIV     Lincoln Chosen President--The Election of 1860--The Waiting-time at     Springfield--A Deluge of Visitors--Various Impressions of the     President-elect--Some Queer Callers--Looking over the Situation     with Friends--Talks about the Cabinet--Thurlow Weed's Visit to     Springfield--The Serious Aspect of National Affairs--The South in     Rebellion--Treason at the National Capital--Lincoln's Farewell     Visit to his Mother--The Old Sign, "Lincoln & Herndon"--The Last     Day at Springfield--Farewell Speech to Friends and Neighbors--Off     for the Capital--The Journey to Washington--Receptions and Speeches     along the Route--At Cincinnati: A Hitherto Unpublished Speech by     Lincoln--At Cleveland: Personal Descriptions of Mr. and Mrs.     Lincoln--At New York City: Impressions of the New President--Perils     of the Journey--The Baltimore Plot--Change of Route--Arrival at the     Capital.The Presidential campaign of 1860, with its excitements and struggles,its "Wide-awake" clubs and boisterous enthusiasm throughout the North,and its bitter and threatening character throughout the South, was atlast ended; and on the 6th of November Abraham Lincoln was electedPresident of the United States.[A] His cause had been aided not a littleby an unexpected division in the Democratic party. Douglas had beennominated for the Presidency by this party in its convention atBaltimore on the 18th of June; but he was bitterly opposed by theextreme slavery element of the Democracy, and this faction held aconvention of its own at Baltimore ten days later and nominated forPresident John C. Breckenridge of Kentucky. There was still anotherparty, though a very minor one, in the field--the "Constitutional UnionParty," based chiefly on a desire to avoid the issue of slavery innational politics--which on the 9th of May had nominated John Bell ofTennessee as its candidate for the Presidency, with Edward Everett ofMassachusetts for the Vice-Presidency. There were thus four tickets inthe field--the Republican, including if not representing theanti-slavery element in the North; the Democratic, which was pro-slaveryin its tendencies but had so far failed to satisfy the Southernwing--now grown alarmed and restless at the growth and tendencies of theRepublican party--that this element nominated as a third ticket anout-and-out pro-slavery candidate; and (fourth) a "Constitutional Union"ticket, representing a well-meant but fatuous desire to keep slavery outof national politics altogether.This eventful contest was therefore determined largely on sectionallines, with slavery as the great underlying issue. Lincoln'sgratification at his election was not untempered with disappointments.While he had a substantial majority of the electoral vote (180 to 123),the popular vote was toward a million (930,170), more against him thanfor him. Fifteen States gave him no electoral vote, and in nine States'he received not a single popular vote. The slave States--"the SolidSouth"--were squarely against him. Lincoln saw the significance of this,and it filled him with regret and apprehension. But he faced the futurewithout dismay, and with a calm resolve to do his duty. With all hishatred of slavery, loyalty to the Constitution had always been paramountin his mind; and those who knew him best never doubted that it wouldcontinue so.Lincoln took no active part in the campaign, preferring to remainquietly at his home in Springfield. Scarcely was the election decidedthan he was beset with visitors from all parts of the country, who cameto gratify curiosity or solicit personal favors of the incomingPresident. The throng became at last so great, and interfered so muchwith the comfort of Lincoln's home, that the Executive Chamber in theState House was set apart as his reception room. Here he met all whochose to come--"the millionaire and the menial, the priest and thepolitician, men, women, and children, old friends and new friends, thosewho called for love and those who sought for office. From morning untilnight this was his occupation; and he performed it with conscientiouscare and the most unwearying patience." The situation at the Lincolnhome at this time, and the spirit prevailing there, is well depicted byone of these callers, Mr. R.C. McCormick, whose interesting account ofhis meeting with Lincoln in New York City has already been quoted inthese pages. "In January, 1861," says Mr. McCormick, "at the instance ofvarious friends in New York who wished a position in the Cabinet for aprominent Kentuckian, I went to Springfield armed with documents for hisconsideration. I remained there a week or more, and was at the Lincolncottage daily. Of the numerous formal and informal interviews that Iwitnessed, I remember all with the sincerest pleasure. I never found theman upon whom rested the great responsibilities of the nation impatientor ill-humored. The plainest and most tedious visitors were made welcomeand happy in his presence; the poor commanded as much of his time as therich. His recognition of old friends and companions in frontier life,whom many elevated as he had been would have found it convenient toforget, was especially hearty. His correspondence was already immense,and the town was alive with cabinet-makers and office-seekers; but hemet all with a calm temper." Mr. Don Piatt relates that he had metLincoln during the Presidential campaign, and had been invited to visitSpringfield. He did so, and was asked to supper at the Lincoln house."It was a plain, comfortable structure," says Mr. Piatt, "and the supperwas mainly of cake, pies, and chickens, the last evidently killed in themorning, to be eaten that evening. After the supper we sat far into thenight, talking over the situation. Mr. Lincoln was the homeliest man Iever saw. His body seemed to me a huge skeleton in clothes. Tall as hewas, his hands and feet looked out of proportion, so long and clumsywere they. Every movement was awkward in the extreme. He sat with oneleg thrown over the other, and the pendent foot swung almost to thefloor. And all the while two little boys, his sons, clambered over thoselegs, patted his cheeks, pulled his nose, and poked their fingers in hiseyes, without reprimand. He had a face that defied artistic skill tosoften or idealize. It was capable of few expressions, but those wereextremely striking. When in repose, his face was dull, heavy, andrepellent. It brightened like a lit lantern when animated. His dull eyeswould fairly sparkle with fun, or express as kindly a look as I eversaw, when moved by some matter of human interest."Hon. George W. Julian, of Indiana, was another visitor to the Lincolnhome in January. He says: "I had a curiosity to see the famous'rail-splitter,' as he was then familiarly called, and as a member-electof the Thirty-seventh Congress I desired to form some acquaintance withthe man who was to play so conspicuous a part in the impending nationalcrisis. On meeting him I found him far better looking than the campaignpictures had represented him. His face, when lighted up in conversation,was not unhandsome, and the kindly and winning tones of his voicepleaded for him like the smile that played about his rugged features.He was full of anecdote and humor, and readily found his way to thehearts of those who enjoyed a welcome to his fireside. His face,however, was sometimes marked by that touching expression of sadnesswhich became so noticeable in the years following. On the subject ofslavery I was gratified to find him less reserved and more emphatic thanI had expected. I was much pleased with our first Republican Executive,and I returned home more fully inspired than ever with the purpose tosustain him to the utmost in facing the duties of his great office."The wide range of these callers and their diverse errands areillustrated by examples furnished by Mr. Lamon. Two tall, ungainlyfellows,--"Suckers," as they were called,--entered Lincoln's room oneday while he was engaged in conversation with a friend. They lingeredbashfully near the door, and Lincoln, noticing their embarrassment, roseand said good-naturedly, "How do you do, my good fellows? What can I dofor you? Will you sit down?" The spokesman of the pair, the shorter ofthe two, declined to sit, and explained the object of the call. He hadhad a talk about the relative height of Lincoln and his companion, andhad asserted his belief that they were of exactly the same height. Hehad come in to verify his judgment. Lincoln smiled, then got his cane,and placing the end of it upon the wall said, "Here, young man, comeunder here!" The young man came under the cane, as Lincoln held it, andwhen it was perfectly adjusted to his height Lincoln said, "Now come outand hold up the cane." This he did, while Lincoln stepped under. Rubbinghis head back and forth to see that it worked easily under themeasurement, he stepped out, and declared that the young man had guessedwith remarkable accuracy--that he and the tall fellow were exactly ofthe same height. Then he shook hands with them and sent them on theirway. The next caller was a very different person--an old and modestlydressed woman who tried to explain that she knew Lincoln. As he did notat first recognize her, she tried to recall to his memory certainincidents connected with his rides upon the circuit--especially hisdining at her house upon the road at different times. Then he rememberedher and her home. Having fixed her own place in his recollection, shetried to recall to him a certain scanty dinner of bread and milk that heonce ate at her house. He could not remember it--on the contrary, heonly remembered that he had always fared well at her house. "Well," saidshe, "one day you came along after we had got through dinner, and we hadeaten up everything, and I could give you nothing but a bowl of breadand milk; you ate it, and when you got up you said it was _good enoughfor the President of the United States_." The good woman, rememberingthe remark, had come in from the country, making a journey of eight orten miles, to relate to Lincoln this incident, which in her mind haddoubtless taken the form of prophecy. Lincoln placed her at her ease,chatted with her of old times, and dismissed her in the most happy andcomplacent frame of mind.Among the judicious friends of Lincoln who gave him timely counsel atthis important epoch of his life was Judge John D. Caton, who, though aDemocrat, was a far-sighted man who saw plainly the tendency ofpolitical affairs and was anxious for the preservation of the Union. "Imet Lincoln in Springfield," writes Judge Caton, "and we had aconference in the law-library. I told him it was plain that he had a waron his hands; that there was a determination on the part of the South tosecede from the Union, and that there would be throughout the North anequal determination to maintain the Union. I advised him to avoidbringing on the war by precipitate action, but let the Southerners beginit; to forbear as long as forbearance could be tolerated, in order tounite the North the more effectually to support his hands in thestruggle that was certain to come; that by such a course the great bodyof the people of the North, of all parties, would come to his support.Mr. Lincoln listened intently, and replied that he foresaw that thestruggle was inevitable, but that it would be his desire and effort tounite the people in support of the Government and for the maintenance ofthe Union; that he was aware that no single party could sustain himsuccessfully, and that he must rely upon the great masses of the peopleof all parties, and he would try to pursue such a course as would securetheir support. The interview continued perhaps an hour."Judge David Davis, a most intimate and confidential friend of Lincoln,states that the latter was firmly determined to appoint "Democrats andRepublicans alike to office." Mr. Lamon corroborates the statement,pointedly remarking: "He felt that his strength lay in conciliation atthe outset; that was his ruling conviction during all those months ofpreparation for the great task before him. It showed itself not only inthe appointments which he sought to make but in those which he did make.Harboring no jealousies, entertaining no fears concerning his personalinterests in the future, he called around him the most powerful of hislate rivals--Seward, Chase, Bates--and unhesitatingly gave into theirhands powers which most Presidents would have shrunk from committing totheir equals, and much more to their superiors, in the conduct of publicaffairs." In a noted instance where the most powerful influence wasbrought to bear upon Lincoln to induce him to make what he regarded asan unworthy appointment, he exclaimed: "All that I am in the world--thePresidency and all else--I owe to the opinion of me which the peopleexpress when they call me 'Honest Old Abe.' Now, what would they thinkof their _honest_ Abe if he should make such an appointment as the oneproposed?"Hon. Leonard Swett, who knew Lincoln from 1848 to the time of his death,and had "traveled the circuit" with him in Illinois, relates that soonafter the election he and Judge Davis advised Lincoln to consult ThurlowWeed regarding the formation of the Cabinet and on political affairsgenerally. "Mr. Lincoln asked me," says Mr. Swett, "to write Mr. Weedand invite him to a conference at Lincoln's house in Springfield. I didso, and the result was that Judge Davis, Thurlow Weed, and myself spenta whole day with him in discussing the men and measures of hisadministration. At that meeting, which took place in less than a monthafter Lincoln's election, or early in December, 1860, Lincoln becameconvinced that war was imminent between the North and the South. Mr.Weed was a very astute man, and had a wonderful knowledge of what wasgoing on. He told Lincoln of preparations being made in the SouthernStates that could mean nothing less than war. It was a serious time withall of us, of course, but Lincoln took it with the imperturbability thatalways distinguished him."The account given by Thurlow Weed, the veteran New York editor andjournalist, of his visit to Lincoln on this occasion is of peculiarinterest. Mr. Weed remained in Springfield two or three days in closeconsultation with the President-elect, the formation of the new Cabinetbeing the subject principally discussed. After expressing gratificationat his election, and an apprehension of the dangers which threatened theincoming administration, says Mr. Weed, in his autobiography, "Mr.Lincoln remarked, smiling, that he supposed I had had some experience incabinet-making; that he had job on hand, and as he had never learnedthat trade he was disposed to avail himself of the suggestions offriends. The question thus opened became the subject of conversation, atintervals, during that and the following day. I say at intervals,because many hours were consumed in talking of the public men connectedwith former administrations, interspersed, illustrated, and seasonedpleasantly with Mr. Lincoln's stories, anecdotes, etc. And here I feelcalled upon to vindicate Mr. Lincoln, as far as my opportunities andobservation go, from the frequent imputation of telling indelicate andribald stories. I saw much of him during his whole Presidential term,with familiar friends and alone, when he talked without restraint; but I_never heard him use a profane or indecent word, or tell a story thatmight not be repeated in the presence of ladies_.""Mr. Lincoln observed," continues Mr. Weed, "that the making of aCabinet, now that he had it to do, was by no means as easy as he hadsupposed; that he had, even before the result of the election was known,assuming the probability of success, fixed upon the two leading membersof his Cabinet, but that in looking about for suitable men to fill theother departments he had been much embarrassed, partly from his want ofacquaintance with the prominent men of the day, and partly because hebelieved that while the population of the country had immenselyincreased _really great men were scarcer than they used to be_.... Asthe conversation progressed, Lincoln remarked that he intended to inviteGovernor Seward to take the State Department and Governor Chase theTreasury Department, remarking that aside from their long experience inpublic affairs and their eminent fitness they were prominently beforethe people and the convention as competitors for the Presidency, eachhaving higher claims than his own for the place which he was to occupy.On naming Hon. Gideon Welles as the man he thought of as therepresentative of New England in the Cabinet, I remarked that I thoughthe could find several New England gentlemen whose selection for a placein his Cabinet would be more acceptable to the people of New England.'But,' said Mr. Lincoln, 'we must remember that the Republican party isconstituted of two elements, and that we must have men of Democratic aswell as of Whig antecedents in the Cabinet.' ... In the course of ourconversations Mr. Lincoln remarked that it was particularly pleasant tohim to reflect that he was coming into office unembarrassed by promises.He owed, he supposed, his exemption from importunities to thecircumstance that his name as a candidate was but a short time beforethe people, and that only a few sanguine friends anticipated thepossibility of his nomination. 'I have not,' said he, 'promised anoffice to any man, nor have I, but in a single instance, mentallycommitted myself to an appointment.'""In this way two days passed very pleasantly," says Mr. Weed, "theconversation being alternately earnest and playful. I wish it werepossible to give, in Mr. Lincoln's amusing but quaint manner, the manystories, anecdotes, and witticisms with which he interlarded andenlivened what with almost any of his predecessors in the high office ofPresident would have been a grave, dry consultation. The great merit ofMr. Lincoln's stories, like Captain Bunsby's opinion, 'lays in theapplication on it.' They always and exactly suited the occasion and theobject, and none to which I ever listened seemed far-fetched orpointless. I will attempt to repeat one of them. If I have an especialfondness for any particular luxury, it manifests itself in a remarkableway when properly made December sausages are placed before me. While atbreakfast, Judge Davis, noticing that, after having been bountifullyserved with sausage, like Oliver Twist I wanted some more, said, 'Youseem fond of our Illinois sausages.' To which I responded affirmatively,adding that I thought the article might be relied on where pork wascheaper than dogs. 'That,' said Mr. Lincoln, 'reminds me of whatoccurred down at Joliet, where a popular grocer supplied all thevillagers with sausages. One Saturday evening, when his grocery wasfilled with customers for whom he and his boys were busily engaged inweighing sausages, a neighbor with whom he had had a violent quarrelthat day, came into the grocery and made his way up to the counterholding by the tail two enormous dead cats which he deliberately threwon to the counter, saying, 'This makes seven to-day. I'll call aroundMonday and get my money for them.'"       *       *       *       *       *During the months intervening between his election and his departure forWashington, Lincoln maintained a keen though quiet watchfulness of thethreatening aspect of affairs at the national capital and throughout theSouth. He was careful not to commit himself by needless utterances as tohis future policy; but in all his demeanor, as a friend said, hedisplayed the firmness and determination, without the temper, ofJackson. In December following his election he wrote the followingletters to his intimate friend, Hon. E.B. Washburne, then a member ofCongress from Illinois:     SPRINGFIELD, ILL., Dec. 13, 1860.     HON. E.B. WASHBURNE--_My Dear Sir_: Your long letter received.     Prevent, as far as possible, any of our friends from demoralizing     themselves and our cause by entertaining propositions for     compromise of any sort on the slavery extension. There is no     possible compromise upon it but which puts us under again, and     leaves us all our work to do over again. Whether it be a Missouri     line, or Eli Thayer's Popular Sovereignty, it is all the same. Let     either be done, and immediately filibustering and extending slavery     recommences. On that point hold firm, as with a chain of steel.     Yours as ever, A. LINCOLN.     SPRINGFIELD, ILL., Dec. 21, 1860.     HON. E.B. WASHBURNE--_My Dear Sir_: Last night I received your     letter giving an account of your interview with General Scott, and     for which I thank you. Please present my respects to the General,     and tell him confidentially that I shall be obliged to him to be as     well prepared as he can to either _hold_ or retake the forts, as     the case may require, at and after the inauguration.     Yours as ever, A. LINCOLN.The Southern States, led on by South Carolina, which formally severedits connection with the Union November 17, 1860 (only eleven days afterLincoln's election), were preparing to dissolve their alliance with theFree States. Mississippi passed the ordinance of secession January 9,1861; Florida followed on the 10th; Alabama on the 11th; Georgia on the19th; Louisiana on the 25th; and Texas on the 1st day of February. Theplans of the seceders went on, unmolested by the Buchananadministration. Southerners in the Cabinet and in Congress conspired todeplete the resources of the Government, leaving it helpless to contestthe assumptions of the revolted States. The treasury was deliberatelybankrupted; the ships of the navy were banished to distant ports; theNorthern arsenals were rifled to furnish arms for the seceded States;the United States forts and armaments on the Southern coast weredelivered into the hands of the enemy, with the exception of FortSumter, which was gallantly held by Major Robert Anderson. While thissystem of bold and unscrupulous treachery was carried on by men in thehighest places of trust, the chief executive of the nation remained apassive spectator. The South was in open rebellion, and the North waspowerless to interfere. The weeks prior to the inauguration of the newadministration dragged slowly along, each day adding fresh cause foranxiety and alarm.Amidst these portentous scenes Lincoln, watching them from a distance,maintained his calm and vigilant attitude. No one knew better than hethe significance of these ominous events that were taking place at thenation's capital and in the disaffected States; but there was nothing hecould do about them. His time for action had not yet come. He saidlittle, but enough to show unmistakably what he thought of the situationand what course he had resolved upon to meet it. As early as December17, 1860--a little more than a month after his election--in writing toThurlow Weed, he said: "_My opinion is that no State can in any way getout of the Union without the consent of the other States_; and that _itis the duty of the President to run the machine as it is_." He had beenmade the pilot of the ship of State, and his duty and purpose were tosave the vessel.[B] Upon this mighty task were concentrated all thepowers of his intellect and will; and through all the desperate voyagethat followed he never wavered or faltered in his course, from the timeof his supreme resolve, made in the quiet of his country home, to thehour when     "From fearful trip the victor ship came in with object won"--but with her more than heroic but now victorious Captain "fallen coldand dead" upon her deck.As the winter wore away, and the time for Lincoln's inauguration asPresident drew near, he began making preparation for leaving thefamiliar scenes where his life had thus far been spent. Early inFebruary he made a parting visit to his relatives in Coles County, towhom in this hour of grave trial and anxiety his heart turned with freshyearning. He spent a night at Charleston, where his cousin Dennis Hanks,and Mrs. Colonel Chapman, a daughter of Dennis, resided. We are toldthat "the people crowded by hundreds to see him; and he was serenaded by'both the string and brass bands of the town, but declined making aspeech." The following morning he passed on to Farmington, to the homeof his beloved step-mother, who was living with her daughter, Mrs.Moore. Mr. Lamon relates that "the meeting between him and the old ladywas of a most affectionate and tender character. She fondled him as herown 'Abe,' and he her as his own mother. Then Lincoln and ColonelChapman drove to the house of John Hall, who lived on the old 'Lincolnfarm' where Abe split the celebrated rails and fenced in the littleclearing in 1830. Thence they went to the spot where Lincoln's fatherwas buried. The grave was unmarked and utterly neglected. Lincoln saidhe wanted to 'have it enclosed, and a suitable tombstone erected,'" andgave the necessary instructions for this purpose. "We then returned,"says Colonel Chapman, "to Farmington, where we found a large crowd ofcitizens--nearly all old acquaintances--waiting to see him. Hisreception was very enthusiastic, and seemed to gratify him very much.After taking dinner at his stepsister's (Mrs. Moore's), he returned toCharleston. Our conversation during the trip was mostly concerningfamily affairs. On the way down to Farmington Mr. Lincoln spoke to me ofhis step-mother in the most affectionate manner; said she had been hisbest friend, and that no son could love a mother more than he loved her.He also told me of the condition of his father's family at the time hemarried his step-mother, and of the change she made in the family, andof the encouragement he had received from her.... He spoke of hisfather, and related some amusing incidents of the bull-dog's biting theold man on his return from New Orleans; of the old man's escape, when aboy, from an Indian who was shot by his uncle Mordecai, etc. He spoke ofhis uncle Mordecai as being a man of very great natural gifts. AtCharleston we found the house crowded by people wishing to see him. Thecrowd finally became so great that it was decided to hold a publicreception at the Town Hall that evening at seven o'clock; until thenLincoln wished to be left with relatives and friends. At the Town Halllarge numbers of people from the town and surrounding country,irrespective of party, called to see him. His reception by his oldacquaintances was very gratifying to him."A characteristic anecdote showing Lincoln's friendship and love of oldassociations is told among those relating to his last days atSpringfield. When he was about to leave for Washington he went to thedingy little law office, sat down on the couch, and said to hislaw-partner, Herndon, "Billy, you and I have been together nearly twentyyears, and have never 'passed a word.' Will you let my name stay on theold sign till I come back from Washington?" The tears started to Mr.Herndon's eyes. He put out his hand. "Mr. Lincoln," said he, "I willnever have any other partner while you live"; and to the day of theassassination all the doings of the firm were in the name of "Lincoln &Herndon."Governor Bross, of Illinois, relates that he was with Lincoln atSpringfield on the day before he left for Washington. "We were walkingslowly to his home from some place where we had met, and the conditionand prospects of the country, and his vast responsibility in assumingthe position of President, were the subjects of his thoughts. These werediscussed with a breadth and anxiety full of that pathos peculiar to Mr.Lincoln in his thoughtful moods. He seemed to have a thorough prescienceof the dangers through which his administration was to pass. NoPresident, he said, had ever had before him such vast and far-reachingresponsibilities. He regarded war--long, bitter, and dreadful--as almostsure to come. He distinctly and reverently placed his hopes for theresult in the strength and guidance of Him on whom Washington relied inthe darkest hours of the Revolution. He would take the place to whichProvidence and his countrymen had called him, and do the best he couldfor the integrity and the welfare of the Republic. For himself, hescarcely expected ever to see Illinois again."On the morning of the 11th of February, 1861, Lincoln left his home inSpringfield for the scene where he was to spend the most anxious,toilsome, and painful years of his life. An elaborate programme had beenprepared for his journey to Washington, which was to conduct him throughthe principal cities of Indiana, Ohio, New York, New Jersey,Pennsylvania, and Maryland, and consume much of the time interveningbefore the 4th of March. Special trains, preceded by pilot-engines,were prepared for his accommodation. He was accompanied at his departureby his wife and three sons, and a party of friends, including GovernorYates, ex-Governor Moore, Dr. W.M. Wallace (his brother-in-law), N.B.Judd, O.H. Browning, Ward H. Lamon, David Davis, Col. E.E. Ellsworth,and John M. Hay and J.G. Nicolay, the two latter to be his privatesecretaries. Mr. Lamon thus graphically describes the incidents of hisleave-taking: "It was a gloomy day; heavy clouds floated overhead, and acold rain was falling. Long before eight o'clock a great mass of peoplehad collected at the railway station. At precisely five minutes beforeeight, Mr. Lincoln, preceded by Mr. Wood, emerged from a private room inthe depot building, and passed slowly to the car, the people fallingback respectfully on either side, and as many as possible shaking hishands. Having reached the train, he ascended the rear platform, and,facing about to the throng which had closed around him, drew himself upto his full height, removed his hat, and stood for several seconds inprofound silence. His eye roved sadly over that sea of upturned faces,as if seeking to read in them the sympathy and friendship which he neverneeded more than then. There was an unusual quiver in his lip, and astill more unusual tear on his shriveled cheek. His solemn manner, hislong silence, were as full of melancholy eloquence as any words he couldhave uttered. What did he think of? Of the mighty changes which hadlifted him from the lowest to the highest estate on earth? Of the wearyroad which had brought him to this lofty summit? Of his poor motherlying beneath the tangled underbrush in a distant forest? Of that othergrave in the quiet Concord cemetery? Whatever the character of histhoughts, it is evident that they were retrospective and sad. To thosewho were anxiously waiting to catch his words it seemed long until hehad mastered his feelings sufficiently to speak. At length he began, ina husky voice, and slowly and impressively delivered his farewell to hisneighbors. Imitating his example, many in the crowd stood with headsuncovered in the fast-falling rain." Abraham Lincoln spoke none but trueand sincere words, and none more true and heartfelt ever fell from hislips than these, so laden with pathos, with humility, with a craving forthe sympathy of his friends and the people, and for help above andbeyond all earthly power and love.     _My Friends_:--No one not in my position can realize the sadness I     feel at this parting. To this people I owe all that I am. Here I     have lived more than a quarter of a century. Here my children were     born, and here one of them lies buried. I know not how soon I shall     see you again. I go to assume a task more difficult than that which     has devolved upon any other man since the days of Washington. He     never would have succeeded except for the aid of Divine Providence,     upon which he at all times relied. I feel that I cannot succeed     without the same Divine blessing which sustained him; and on the     same Almighty Being I place my reliance for support. And I hope     you, my friends, will all pray that I may receive that Divine     assistance, without which I cannot succeed, but with which success     is certain. Again I bid you an affectionate farewell.The route chosen for the journey to Washington, as has been stated, wasa circuitous one. It seems to have been Lincoln's desire to meetpersonally the people of the great Northern States upon whose devotionand loyalty he prophetically felt he must depend for the salvation ofthe Republic. Everywhere he met the warmest and most generous greetingsfrom the throngs assembled at the railway stations in the various citiesthrough which he passed. At Indianapolis, where the first important haltwas made, cannon announced the arrival of the party, and a royal welcomewas accorded the distinguished traveler. In this, as in the other citiesat which he stopped, Lincoln made a brief address to the people. Hisremarks were well considered and temperate; his manner was serious, hisexpressions thoughtful and full of feeling. He entreated the people tobe calm and patient; to stand by the principles of liberty inwroughtinto the fabric of the Constitution; to have faith in the strength andreality of the Government, and faith in his purpose to discharge hisduties honestly and impartially. He referred continually to his trust inthe Almighty Ruler of the Universe to guide the nation safely out of itspresent peril and perplexity. "I judge," he said at Columbus, "that allwe want is time and patience, and a reliance in that God who has neverforsaken His people." Again, he said: "Let the people on both sides keeptheir self-possession, and just as other clouds have cleared away in duetime, so will this; and this great nation shall continue to prosper asheretofore." Alluding more definitely to his purposes for the future, hedeclared: "I shall do all that may be in my power to promote a peacefulsettlement of all our difficulties. The man does not live who is moredevoted to peace than I am--none who would do more to preserve it. _Butit may be necessary to put the foot down firmly_."At the conclusion of Lincoln's speech at Columbus, a tremendous crowdsurged forward to shake his hand. Says Dr. Holland: "Every man in thecrowd was anxious to wrench the hand of Abraham Lincoln. He finally gaveboth hands to the work, with great good nature. To quote one of thereports of the occasion: 'People plunged at his arms with franticenthusiasm, and all the infinite variety of shakes, from the wild andirrepressible pump-handle movement to the dead grip, was executed uponthe devoted _dexter_ and _sinister_ of the President. Some glanced athis face as they grasped his hand; others invoked the blessings ofheaven upon him; others affectionately gave him their last gaspingassurance of devotion; others, bewildered and furious, with hats crushedover their eyes, seized his hands in a convulsive grasp, and passed onas if they had not the remotest idea who, what, or where they were.' ThePresident at last escaped, and took refuge in the Governor's residence,although he held a levee at the State House in the evening, where in amore quiet way he met many prominent citizens."At Cincinnati, where Lincoln had had so distasteful an experience a fewyears before, a magnificent ovation greeted him. The scene is describedby one who witnessed it--Hon. William Henry Smith, at that time aresident of Cincinnati. "It was on the 13th of February that Mr. Lincolnreached the Queen City. The day was mild for mid-winter, but the sky wasovercast with clouds, emblematic of the gloom that filled the hearts ofthe unnumbered thousands who thronged the streets and covered thehouse-tops. Lincoln rode in an open carriage, standing erect withuncovered head, and steadying himself by holding on to a board fastenedto the front part of the vehicle. A more uncomfortable ride than this,over the bouldered streets of Cincinnati, cannot well be imagined.Perhaps a journey over the broken roads of Eastern Russia, in atarantass, would secure to the traveler as great a degree of discomfort.Mr. Lincoln bore it with characteristic patience. His face was very sad,but he seemed to take a deep interest in everything. It was not withoutdue consideration that the President-elect touched on the border of aslave State on his way to the capital. In his speech in reply to theMayor of Cincinnati, recognizing the fact that among his auditors werethousands of Kentuckians, he addressed them directly, calling them'Friends,' 'Brethren.' He reminded them that when speaking in FifthStreet Market square in 1859 he had promised that when the Republicanscame into power they would treat the Southern or slave-holding people asWashington, Jefferson, and Madison treated them; that they wouldinterfere with their institutions in no way, but abide by all and everycompromise of the Constitution, and 'recognize and bear in mind alwaysthat you have as good hearts in your bosoms as other people, or as weclaim to have, and treat you accordingly.' Then, to emphasize this, hesaid--in a passage omitted by Mr. Raymond and all other biographers ofLincoln--     And now, fellow-citizens of Ohio, have you who agree in political     sentiment with him who now addresses you ever entertained other     sentiments towards our brethren of Kentucky than those I have     expressed to you? [_Loud and repeated cries of 'No!' 'No!'_] If     not, then why shall we not, as heretofore, be recognized and     acknowledged as brethren again, living in peace and harmony, one     with another? [_Cries of 'We will!'_] I take your response as the     most reliable evidence that it may be so, along with other     evidence, trusting to the good sense of the American people, on all     sides of all rivers in America, under the Providence of God, who     has never deserted us, that we shall again be brethren, forgetting     all parties--ignoring all parties."This statesmanlike expression of conservative opinion," continues Mr.Smith, "alarmed some of the Republicans, who feared that the newPresident might sell out his party; and steps were taken, later in theday, to remind him of certain principles deemed fundamental by those whohad been attracted to the party of Freedom. The sequel will show howthis was done, and how successfully Mr. Lincoln met the unexpectedattack. In the evening I called, with other citizens, at Mr. Lincoln'srooms at the Burnet House to pay my respects. Mr. Lincoln had put offthe melancholy mood that appeared to control him during the day, and wasentertaining those present with genial, even lively, conversation. Thepleasant entertainment was interrupted by the announcement that adelegation of German workingmen were about to serenade Mr. Lincoln.Proceeding to the balcony, there were seen the faces of nearly twothousand of the substantial German citizens who had voted for Mr.Lincoln because they believed him to be a stout champion of free laborand free homesteads. The remarks of their spokesman, FrederickOberkleine, set forth in clear terms what they expected. He said:     We, the German free workingmen of Cincinnati, avail ourselves of     this opportunity to assure you, our chosen Chief Magistrate, of our     sincere and heartfelt regard. You earned our votes as the champion     of Free Labor and Free Homesteads. Our vanquished opponents have,     in recent times, made frequent use of the terms "Workingmen" and     "Workingmen's Meetings," in order to create an impression that the     mass of workingmen were _in favor of compromises between the     interests of free labor and slave labor, by which the victory just     won would be turned into a defeat_. This is a despicable device of     dishonest men. _We spurn such compromises. We firmly adhere to the     principles which directed our votes in your favor. We trust that     you, the self-reliant because self-made man, will uphold the     Constitution and the laws against secret treachery and avowed     treason_. If to this end you should be in need of men, the German     free workingmen, with others, will rise as one man at your call,     ready to risk their lives in the effort to maintain the victory     already won by freedom over slavery."This was bringing the rugged issue boldly to the front, and challengingthe President-elect to meet the issue or risk the loss of the support ofan important section of his own party. Oberkleine spoke with greateffect, but the remarks were hardly his own. Some abler man had put intohis mouth these significant words. Mr. Lincoln replied, verydeliberately, but without hesitation, as follows:     MR. CHAIRMAN:--I thank you, and those you represent, for the     compliment paid me by the tender of this address. In so far as     there is an allusion to our present national difficulty, and the     suggestion of the views of the gentlemen who present this address,     I beg you will excuse me from entering particularly upon it. I deem     it due to myself and the whole country, in the present     extraordinary condition of the country and of public opinion, that     I should wait and see the last development of public opinion before     I give my views or express myself at the time of the inauguration.     I hope at that time to be false to nothing you have been taught to     expect of me. [_Cheers_.]     I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, and with the address of your     constituents, in the declaration that workingmen are the basis of     all governments. That remark is due to them more than to any other     class, for the reason that there are more of them than of any other     class. And as your address is presented to me not only on behalf of     workingmen, but especially of Germans, I may say a word as to     classes. I hold that the value of life is to improve one's     condition. Whatever is calculated to advance the condition of the     honest, struggling laboring man, so far as my judgment will enable     me to judge of a correct thing, I am for that thing.     An allusion has been made to the Homestead Law. I think it worthy     of consideration, and that the wild lands of the country should be     distributed so that every man should have the means and opportunity     of benefiting his condition. [_Cheers_.] I have said that I do not     desire to enter into details, nor will I.     In regard to Germans and foreigners, I esteem foreigners no better     than other people--nor any worse. [_Laughter and cheers_.] They are     all of the great family of men, and if there is one shackle upon     any of them it would be far better to lift the load from them than     to pile additional loads upon them. [_Cheers_.] And inasmuch as the     continent of America is comparatively a new country, and the other     countries of the world are old countries, there is more room here,     comparatively speaking, than there is elsewhere; and if they can     better their condition by leaving their old homes, there is nothing     in my heart to forbid them coming, and I bid them all God speed.     [_Cheers_.] Again, gentlemen, thanking you for your address, I bid     you good night."If anyone," says Mr. Smith, "had expected to trap Mr. Lincoln intoimprudent utterances, or the indulgence of the rhetoric of a demagogue,this admirable reply showed how completely they were disappointed. Thepreservation of this speech is due to my accidental presence. Thevisitation of the Germans was not on the programme, and none of therepresentatives of the press charged with the duty of reporting theevents of the day were present. Observing this, I took short-hand noteson the envelope of an old letter loaned me for the occasion, andafterwards wrote them out. The words of Mr. Lincoln, exactly as spoken,are given above."At Cleveland the party remained over for a day, and Lincoln was greetedwith the usual friendly enthusiasm. An immense crowd met him at thedepot, and he was escorted to the Weddell House, where a reception wasgiven him in the evening. Hon. A.G. Riddle, then a resident ofCleveland, and a newly elected member of the Congress which was to sharewith Lincoln the burdens and responsibilities of the Civil War, waspresent on that occasion, and furnishes the following interestingpersonal recollections of it: "I saw Abraham Lincoln for the first time,at the Weddell House that evening. He stood on the landing-place at thetop of a broad stairway, and the crowd approached him from below. Thisgave him an exaggerated advantage of his six feet four inches of length.The shapelessness of the lathy form, the shock of coarse black hairsurmounting the large head, the retreating forehead--these were notapparent where we stood. My heart sprang up to him--the coming man. Ofthe thousand times I afterward saw him, the first view remains the mostdistinct impression; and never again to me was he more imposing. As weapproached, someone whispered of me to him; he took my hand in both hisfor an instant, and we wheeled into the already crowded rooms. Hismanner was strongly Western; his speech and pronunciation Southwestern.Wholly without self-consciousness with men, he was constrained and illat ease when surrounded, as he several times was, by fashionably dressedladies. One incident of the evening I particularly recall. Ab McElrathwas in the crowd--a handsome giant, an Apollo in youth, of about Mr.Lincoln's height. What brought it about, I do not know; but I saw themstanding back to back, in a contest of altitude--Mr. Lincoln and AbMcElrath--the President-elect, the chosen, the nation's leader in thethick-coming darkness, and the tavern-keeper and fox-hunter. The crowdapplauded."Mr. Lincoln presented me to the gentlemen of his party--Mr. Browning,Mr. Judd, and Mr. Lamon, I remember, as I later became very wellacquainted with them; also the rough-looking Colonel Sumner of the army.Mr. Lincoln invited me to accompany him for at least a day on hiseastward journey. I joined him the next morning at the station. Thevivacity of the night before had utterly vanished, and the rudelysculptured cliffy face struck me as one of the saddest I had ever seen.The eyes especially had a depth of melancholy which I had never seen inhuman eyes before. Some things he wished to know from me, especiallyregarding Mr. Chase, whom, among others, he had called to Springfield.He asked me no direct questions, but I very soon found myself speakingfreely to him, and was able to explain some not well-known features ofOhio politics--and much to his satisfaction, as he let me see. There wasthen some talk of Mr. Seward, and more of Senator Cameron. All three hadbeen his rivals at Chicago, and were, as I then thought, in his mind aspossible Cabinet ministers; although no word was said by him of such anidea in reference to either. Presently he conducted me to Mrs. Lincoln,whom I had not before seen. Presenting me, he returned to the gentlemenof the party, and I saw little more of him except once when he returnedto us, before I left the train. Mrs. Lincoln impressed me veryfavorably, as a woman of spirit, intelligence, and decided opinions,which she put very clearly. Our conversation was mainly of her husband.I remarked that all the likenesses I had ever seen of him did himinjustice. This evidently pleased her. I suggested that a full beardfrom the under lip down (his face was shaven) would relieve and help himvery much. This interested her, and we discussed it and the characterof his face quite fully. The impression I then formed of this mostunfortunate lady was only deepened by the pleasant acquaintance shepermitted, down to the time of the national calamity, which unsettledher mind as I always thought."Of the New York City visit, an excellent account is given by thedistinguished preacher and writer, Dr. S. Irenaeus Prime. "The countrywas at that moment," says Dr. Prime, "in the first throes of the greatrebellion. Millions of hearts were beating anxiously in view of theadvent to power of this untried man. Had he been called of God to thethrone of power at such a time as this, to be the leader and delivererof the people? As the carriage in which he sat passed slowly by me onthe Fifth avenue, he was looking weary, sad, feeble, and faint. Mydisappointment was excessive; so great, indeed, as to be almostoverwhelming. He did not look to me to be the man for the hour. The nextday I was with him and others in the Governor's room in the City Hall,when the Mayor of the city made an official address. Mr. Lincoln's replywas so modest, firm, patriotic, and pertinent, that my fears of the daybefore began to subside, and I saw in this new man a promise of greatthings to come. It was not boldness or dash, or high-sounding pledges;nor did he while in office, with the mighty armies of a roused nation athis command, ever assume to be more than he promised in that littleupper chamber in New York, on his journey to the seat of Government, totake the helm of the ship of state then tossing in the storm."Before the end of the journey, strong fears prevailed in the minds ofLincoln's friends that an attempt would be made to assassinate himbefore he should reach Washington. Every precaution was taken to thwartsuch endeavor; although Lincoln himself was disturbed by no thought ofdanger. He had done, he contemplated doing, no wrong, no injustice toany citizen of the United States; why then should there be a desire tostrike him down? Thus he reasoned; and he was free from any dread ofpersonal peril. But the officials of the railroads over which he was topass, and his friends in Washington, felt that there was cause forapprehension. It was believed by them that a plot existed for makingaway with Lincoln while passing through Baltimore, a city in the heartof a slave State, and rife with the spirit of rebellion. Detectives hadbeen employed to discover the facts in the matter, and their reportsserved to confirm the most alarming conjectures. A messenger wasdespatched from Washington to intercept the Presidential party and warnLincoln of the impending danger. Dr. Holland states that "the detectiveand Mr. Lincoln reached Philadelphia nearly at the same time, and therethe former submitted to a few of the President's friends the informationhe had secured. An interview between Mr. Lincoln and the detective wasimmediately arranged, and took place in the apartments of the former atthe Continental Hotel. Mr. Lincoln, having heard the officer's statementin detail, then informed him that he had promised to raise the Americanflag on Independence Hall the following morning--the anniversary ofWashington's birthday--and that he had accepted an invitation to areception by the Pennsylvania Legislature in the afternoon of the sameday. 'Both of these engagements I will keep,' said Mr. Lincoln, '_if itcosts me my life_.' For the rest, he authorized the detective to makesuch arrangements as he thought proper for his safe conduct toWashington."In the meantime, according to Dr. Holland, General Scott and SenatorSeward, both of whom were in Washington, learned from independentsources that Lincoln's life was in danger, and concurred in sending Mr.Frederick W. Seward to Philadelphia to urge upon him the necessity ofproceeding immediately to Washington in a quiet way. The messengerarrived late on Thursday night, after Lincoln had retired, and requestedan audience. Lincoln's fears had already been aroused, and he wascautious, of course, in the matter of receiving a stranger. Butsatisfied that the messenger was indeed the son of Mr. Seward, hereceived him. Nothing needed to be done except to inform him of the planentered into with the detective, by which the President was to arrive inWashington early on Saturday morning, in advance of his family andparty.On the morning of the 22d, Lincoln, as he had promised, attended theflag-raising at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, the historic buildingin which had been adopted the Declaration of Independence. The occasionwas a memorable one, and Lincoln's address eloquent and impressive. "Allthe political sentiments I entertain," said he, "have been drawn fromthe sentiments which were given to the world from this hall." He spokecalmly but firmly of his resolve to stand by the principles of theimmortal Declaration and of the Constitution of his country; and, asthough conscious of the dangers of his position, he added solemnly: "Ihave said nothing but what I am willing to live by, _and, if it be thepleasure of Almighty God, to die by_."From Philadelphia Lincoln went immediately to Harrisburg, and attendedthe reception given him by the Pennsylvania Legislature, in theafternoon of the same day. Then, leaving his hotel in the evening,attended only by Mr. Lamon and the detective (Mr. Allan Pinkerton), hewas driven to the depot, where he took the regular train for Washington.The train passed through Baltimore in the night, and early the nextmorning (February 23) reached the capital. Mr. Washburne, who had beennotified to be at the depot on the arrival of the train, says: "Iplanted myself behind one of the great pillars in the old Washington andBaltimore depot, where I could see and not be observed. Presently, thetrain came rumbling in on time. When it came to a stop I watched withfear and trembling to see the passengers descend. I saw every caremptied, and there was no Mr. Lincoln. I was well-nigh in despair, andwhen about to leave I saw three persons slowly emerge from the lastsleeping-car. I could not mistake the long, lank form of Mr. Lincoln,and my heart bounded with joy and gratitude. He had on a softlow-crowned hat, a muffler around his neck, and a short overcoat. Anyonewho knew him at that time could not have failed to recognize him atonce; but I must confess he looked more like a well-to-do farmer fromone of the back towns of Jo Daviess County, coming to Washington to seethe city, take out his land warrant and get the patent for his farm,than the President of the United States. The only persons thataccompanied Mr. Lincoln were Pinkerton, the well-known detective, andWard H. Lamon. When they were fairly on the platform, and a shortdistance from the car, I stepped forward and accosted the President:'How are you, Lincoln?' At this unexpected and rather familiarsalutation the gentlemen were apparently somewhat startled; but Mr.Lincoln, who had recognized me, relieved them at once by remarking inhis peculiar voice: 'This is only Washburne!' Then we all exchangedcongratulations, and walked out to the front of the depot, where I had acarriage in waiting. Entering the carriage (all four of us), we droverapidly to Willard's Hotel, entering on Fourteenth Street, before it wasfairly daylight."General Stone, who was in command at Washington at that time, statesthat both General Scott and himself "considered it almost a certaintythat Mr. Lincoln could not pass through Baltimore alive on the dayfixed," and adds: "I recommended that Mr. Lincoln should be officiallywarned; and suggested that it would be best that he should take thetrain that evening from Philadelphia, and so reach Washington early thenext day. General Scott directed me to see Mr. Seward, to whom he wrotea few lines, which he handed me. I did not succeed in finding Mr. Sewarduntil past noon. I handed him the General's note. He listenedattentively to what I said, and asked me to write down my informationand suggestions. Then, taking the paper I had written, he hastily left.The note I wrote was what Mr. Frederick Seward carried to Mr. Lincoln inPhiladelphia. Mr. Lincoln has stated that it was _this note_ whichinduced him to change his journey as he did. _The stories of disguisesare all nonsense_. Mr. Lincoln merely took the sleeping-car in the nighttrain."There is little doubt that the fears of Lincoln's friends regarding hispassage through Baltimore were well grounded; and that but for thetimely warnings and precautions the assassination of April, 1865, mighthave taken place in February of 1861.CHAPTER XV     Lincoln at the Helm--First Days in Washington--Meeting Public Men     and Discussing Public Affairs--The Inauguration--The Inaugural     Address--A New Era Begun--Lincoln in the White House--The First     Cabinet--The President and the Office-seekers--Southern Prejudice     against Lincoln--Ominous Portents, but Lincoln not Dismayed--The     President's Reception Room--Varied Impressions of the New     President--Guarding the White House.The week following Lincoln's arrival in Washington, and preceding hisinauguration, was for him one of incessant activity. From almost thefirst moment he was engrossed either in preparations for hisinauguration and the official responsibilities which would immediatelyfollow that event, or in receiving the distinguished callers whohastened to meet him and in discussing with them the grave aspects ofpolitical affairs. Without rest or opportunity to survey the field thatlay before him, or any preparations save such as the resources of hisown strong character might afford him, he was plunged instantly into thegreat political maelstrom in which he was to remain for four long years,and whose wild vortex might well have bewildered an eye less sure, awill less resolute, and a brain less cool than his. As Emerson put it,"The new pilot was hurried to the helm in a tornado.""Mr. Lincoln's headquarters," says Congressman Riddle of Ohio, "were atWillard's Hotel; and the few days before the inauguration were given upto a continuous reception in the broad corridor of the second floor,near the stairway. I remember a notable morning when the majesticGeneral Scott, in full dress, sword, plumes, and bullion, came to payhis respects to the incoming President. The scene was impressive. By theunknown law that ruled his spirits, Mr. Lincoln was at his best,complete master of himself and of all who came within the magic of hispresence. Never was he happier, speaking most of the time, flashing withanecdote and story. That time now seems as remote as things of a hundredyears ago. The war antiquated all that went before it. The Washington,the men, the spirit of that now ancient time, have faded past all powerto recall and reproduce them. The real Washington was as essentiallySouthern as Richmond or Baltimore. 'Lincoln and his vandals,' fresh fromthe North and West, were thronging the wide, squat, unattractive city,from which the bolder and braver rebel element had not yet departed."Dr. George B. Loring, of Massachusetts, who was one of the first to meetLincoln after his arrival in Washington, says: "I saw him on hisarrival, and when he made his first appearance in a public place. I wasstanding in the upper hall of Willard's Hotel, conversing with a friendand listening to the confused talk of the crowded drawing-roomadjoining. As we stood there, a tall and awkward form appeared above thestairs, especially conspicuous, as it came into view, for a new andstylish hat. It was evidently President Lincoln, whom neither of us hadseen before. As soon as his presence was known, the hall was throngedfrom the drawing-rooms. He seemed somewhat startled by the crowd, didnot remove his hat, wended his way somewhat rapidly and with merepassing recognition, and took shelter in his room. When the crowd haddispersed, my friend and myself--although we had opposed hiselection--called upon him to pay our respects. He received us with greatcordiality, spoke freely of the difficulties by which he was surrounded,and referred with evident satisfaction to the support he had receivedin Massachusetts. 'I like your man Banks,' said he, 'and have tried tofind a place for him in my Cabinet; but I am afraid I shall not quitefetch it.' He bore the marks of anxiety in his countenance, which, inits expression of patience, determination, resolve, and deep innatemodesty, was extremely touching."Before leaving Springfield Lincoln had prepared his inaugural messagewith great care, and placed it in a "gripsack" for transportation toWashington. An odd incident, by which the message came near being loston the journey, was afterwards related by Lincoln to a friend. When theparty reached Harrisburg Lincoln asked his son Robert where the messagewas, and was taken aback by his son's confession that in the excitementcaused by the enthusiastic reception he believed he had let a waiterhave the gripsack. Lincoln, in narrating the incident, said: "My heartwent up into my mouth, and I started downstairs, where I was told thatif a waiter had taken the gripsack I should probably find it in thebaggage-room. Going there, I saw a large pile of gripsacks and otherbaggage, and thought that I discovered mine. My key fitted it, but onopening there was nothing inside but a few paper collars and a flask ofwhisky. A few moments afterward I came across my own gripsack, with thedocument in it all right."The fourth of March soon came, and with it the impressive ceremonies ofLincoln's inauguration as President. A good description of the scene isgiven by Dr. J.G. Holland. "The morning broke beautifully clear, and itfound General Scott and the Washington police in readiness. In thehearts of the surging crowds there was anxiety; but outside all lookedas usual on such occasions, with the exception of an extraordinarydisplay of soldiers. The public buildings, the schools, and most of theplaces of business, were closed during the day, and the stars andstripes were floating from every flag-staff. There was a great desire tohear Lincoln's inaugural; and at an early hour Pennsylvania Avenue wasfull of people wending their way to the east front of the Capitol whereit was to be delivered. As the Presidential party reached the platformerected for the ceremonies, Senator Baker of Oregon, one of Lincoln'sold friends and political rivals in Illinois, introduced him to theassembly. There was not a very hearty welcome given to the President ashe stepped forward to read his inaugural. The reading was listened towith profound attention, those passages which contained any allusion tothe Union being vociferously cheered. None listened more carefully thanMr. Buchanan and Judge Taney, the latter of whom, with noticeableagitation, administered the oath of office to Mr. Lincoln when hisaddress was ended."Another eye-witness has described the dramatic scene, and the principalactors in it, in the following graphic paragraphs: "Near noon I foundmyself a member of the motley crowd gathered around the side entrance toWillard's Hotel. Soon an open barouche drove up, and the only occupantstepped out. A large, heavy, awkward-moving man, far advanced in years,short and thin gray hair, full face plentifully seamed and wrinkled,head curiously inclined to the left shoulder, a low-crowned,broad-brimmed silk hat, an immense white cravat like a poulticethrusting the old-fashioned standing collar up to the ears, dressed inblack throughout, with swallow-tail coat not of the newest style. It wasPresident Buchanan, calling to take his successor to the Capitol. In afew minutes he reappeared, with Mr. Lincoln on his arm; the two tookseats side by side, and the carriage rolled away, followed by a ratherdisorderly and certainly not very imposing procession. I had ample timeto walk to the Capitol, and no difficulty in securing a place whereeverything could be seen and heard to the best advantage. The attendanceat the inauguration was, they told me, unusually small; many being keptaway by anticipated disturbance, as it had been rumored--not withoutgood grounds--that General Scott himself was fearful of an outbreak, andhad made all possible military preparations to meet the emergency. Asquare platform had been built out from the steps to the easternportico, with benches for distinguished spectators on three sides.Senator Douglas, the only one I recognized, sat at the extreme end ofthe seat on the right of the narrow passage leading from the steps.There was no delay, and the gaunt form of the President-elect was soonvisible, slowly making his way to the front. To me, at least, he wascompletely metamorphosed--partly by his own fault, and partly throughthe efforts of injudicious friends and ambitious tailors. He was raising(to gratify a very young lady, it is said) a crop of whiskers, of theblacking-brush variety, coarse, stiff, and ungraceful; and in so doingspoiled, or at least seriously impaired, a face which, though neverhandsome, had in its original state a peculiar power and pathos. On thepresent occasion the whiskers were reinforced by brand-new clothes fromtop to toe; black dress coat instead of the usual frock; black cloth orsatin vest, black pantaloons, and a glossy hat evidently just out of thebox. To cap the climax of novelty, he carried a huge ebony cane, with agold head the size of an egg. In these, to him, strange habiliments, helooked so miserably uncomfortable that I could not help pitying him.Reaching the platform, his discomfort was visibly increased by notknowing what to do with hat and cane; and so he stood there, the targetfor ten thousand eyes, holding his cane in one hand and his hat in theother, the picture of helpless embarrassment. After some hesitation, hepushed the cane into a corner of the railing, but could not find a placefor the hat, except on the floor, where I could see he did not like torisk it. Douglas, who fully took in the situation, came to the rescue ofhis old friend and rival, and held the precious hat until the ownerneeded it again; a service which, if predicted two years before, wouldprobably have astonished him. The oath of office was administered byChief Justice Taney, whose black robes, attenuated figure, andcadaverous countenance reminded me of a galvanized corpse. Then thePresident came forward and read his inaugural address in a clear anddistinct voice. It was attentively listened to by all; but the closestlistener was Douglas, who leaned forward as if to catch every word,nodding his head emphatically at those passages which most pleased him.I must not forget to mention the presence of a Mephistopheles in theperson of Senator Wigfall of Texas, who stood with folded arms leaningagainst the doorway of the Capitol, looking down upon the crowd and theceremony with a contemptuous air which sufficiently indicated hisopinion of the whole performance. To him, the Southern Confederacy wasalready an accomplished fact.""Under the shadow of the great Eastern portico of the Capitol," saysGeneral John A. Logan, "with the retiring President and Cabinet, theSupreme Court Justices, the Foreign Diplomatic Corps, and hundreds ofSenators, Representatives, and other distinguished persons filling thegreat platform on either side and behind them, Abraham Lincoln stoodbareheaded before full thirty thousand people, upon whose uplifted facesthe unveiled glory of the mild Spring sun now shone--stood reverentlybefore that far greater and mightier Presence termed by himself, 'Myrightful masters, the American people'--and pleaded in a manly,earnest, and affectionate strain with 'such as were dissatisfied' tolisten to the 'better angels' of their nature. 'Temperate, reasonable,kindly persuasive'--it seems strange that Lincoln's inaugural addressdid not disarm at least the personal resentment of the South toward him,and sufficiently strengthen Union-loving people there against thered-hot Secessionists, to put the 'brakes' down on rebellion."The address was devoted almost exclusively to the great absorbing topicof the hour--the attempt of the Southern States to withdraw from theUnion and erect an independent republic. The calm, firm, moderate,judicious spirit which pervaded Lincoln's address is apparent in thefollowing quotations, which contain its most significant and memorablepassages:     _Fellow-Citizens of the United States_:--In compliance with a     custom as old as the Government itself, I appear before you to     address you briefly, and to take in your presence the oath     prescribed by the Constitution of the United States to be taken by     the President "before he enters on the execution of his office."     ... Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern     States, that by the accession of a Republican Administration their     property and their peace and personal security are to be     endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such     apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has     all the while existed and been open to their inspection. It is     found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses     you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that     "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the     institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I     have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do     so." Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge     that I had made this and many similar declarations, and have never     recanted them.... I now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing     so, I only press upon the public attention the most conclusive     evidence of which the case is susceptible, that the property,     peace, and security of no section are to be in anywise endangered     by the now incoming Administration. I add, too, that all the     protection which, consistently with the Constitution and the laws,     can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the States, when     lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--as cheerfully to one section     as to another.... I hold that, in contemplation of universal law,     and of the Constitution, _the Union of these States is perpetual_.     Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of     all National Governments. It is safe to assert that no Government     proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own     termination. Continue to execute all the express provisions of our     National Constitution, and the Union will endure forever.... I     therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,     the Union is unbroken, and to the extent of my ability I shall take     care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that     the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.     Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part; and I shall     perform it, so far as practicable, unless my rightful masters, the     American people, shall withhold the requisite means, or, in some     authoritative manner, direct the contrary. I trust this will not be     regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the Union     that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself. In doing     this, there need be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be     none, unless it be forced upon the national authority. The power     confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the     property and places belonging to the Government, and to collect the     duties and imposts; but beyond what may be but necessary for these     objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or     among the people anywhere.... Physically speaking, we cannot     separate. We cannot remove our respective sections from each other,     nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may     be divorced, and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of     each other; but the different parts of our country cannot do this.     They cannot but remain face to face; and intercourse, either     amicable or hostile, must continue between them. It is impossible,     then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more     satisfactory after separation than before. Can aliens make treaties     easier than friends can make law? Can treaties be more faithfully     enforced between aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go     to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both     sides and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old     questions, as to terms of intercourse, are again upon you.... This     country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit     it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they     can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or their     revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it. I cannot be     ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are     desirous of having the National Constitution amended. While I make     no recommendation of amendments, I fully recognize the rightful     authority of the people over the whole subject, to be exercised in     either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself; and I     should, under existing circumstances, favor rather than oppose a     fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it.... The     Chief Magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and     they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation     of the States. The people themselves can do this also, if they     choose; but the Executive, as such, has nothing to do with it. His     duty is to administer the present Government as it came to his     hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him, to his successor....     By the frame of the Government under which we live, the same people     have wisely given their public servants but little power for     mischief; and have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of     that little to their own hands at very short intervals. While the     people retain their virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any     extreme of wickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the     Government in the short space of four years.     My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon this whole     subject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be     an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you     would never take deliberately, that object will be frustrated by     taking time; but no good can be frustrated by it. Such of you as     are now dissatisfied still have the old Constitution unimpaired,     and, on the sensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it;     while the new administration will have no immediate power, if it     would, to change either. If it were admitted that you who are     dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute, there still is no     single good reason for precipitate action. Intelligence,     patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who has never     yet forsaken this favored land, are still competent to adjust, in     the best way, all our present difficulty.     In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine,     is the momentous issue of civil war. The Government will not assail     you. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the     aggressors. You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the     Government; while I shall have the most solemn one to "preserve,     protect, and defend" it.     I am loth to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be     enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break, our     bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from     every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and     hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of     the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the     better angels of our nature.At the close of the address, which was delivered with the utmostearnestness and solemnity, Lincoln, "with reverent look and impressiveemphasis, repeated the oath to preserve, protect, and defend theConstitution of his country. Douglas, who knew the conspirators andtheir plots, with patriotic magnanimity then grasped the hand of thePresident, gracefully extended his congratulations, and the assurancethat in the dark future he would stand by him, and give to him hisutmost aid in upholding the Constitution and enforcing the laws of hiscountry.""At the inauguration," says Congressman Riddle, "I stood within a yardof Mr. Lincoln when he pronounced his famous address. How full of lifeand power it then was, with the unction of his utterance! Surely, wethought, the South, which rejected the concessions of Congress, wouldaccept him. How dry and quaint, yet ingenious, much of that inauguralappears to me now, when the life and soul seem to have gone out of it! Asad thing--a spectre of the day--will forever haunt my memory: Poor oldPresident Buchanan, short, stout, pale, white-haired, yet bearinghimself resolutely throughout, linked by the arm to the new President,into whom from himself was passing the qualifying unction of theConstitution, jostled hither and thither, as already out of men's sight,yet bravely maintaining the shadow of dignity and place. How glad hemust have been to take leave of his successor at the White House whenall was ended!"The formalities of the inauguration concluded, Lincoln passed backthrough the Senate Chamber, and, again escorted by Mr. Buchanan, wasconducted to the White House, where the cares and anxieties of hisposition immediately descended upon him. "Strange indeed," says GeneralLogan, "must have been the thoughts that crowded through the brain andoppressed the heart of Abraham Lincoln that night--his first at theWhite House. The City of Washington swarmed with rebels and rebelsympathizers, and all the departments of Government were honeycombedwith treason and shadowed with treachery and espionage. Every stepproposed or contemplated by the Government would be known to theso-called Government of the Confederate States almost as soon as thoughtof. All means to thwart and delay the carrying out of the Government'spurposes that the excuses of routine and red tape admitted of would beused by the traitors within the camp to aid the traitors without. No oneknew all this better than Mr. Lincoln. With no army, no navy, not even arevenue cutter left--with forts and arsenals, ammunition and arms, inpossession of the South, with no money in the National Treasury, and theNational credit blasted--the position must, even to his hopeful nature,have seemed desperate. Yet even in this awful hour, he was sustained byconfidence in the good effects of his conciliatory message to the South,and by his trust in the patriotism of the people and the Providence ofGod."Mr. Welles, the incoming Secretary of the Navy, in writing of the periodimmediately following the inauguration, says: "A strange state of thingsexisted at that time in Washington. The atmosphere was thick withtreason. Party spirit and old party differences prevailed amidst theaccumulating dangers. Secession was considered by most persons as apolitical party question, not as rebellion. Democrats to a large extentsympathized with the Rebels more than with the Administration. TheRepublicans, on the other hand, were scarcely less partisan andunreasonable ... clamorous for the removal of all Democrats,indiscriminately, from office."The President's first official act was the announcement of his Cabinet,which was composed of the following persons: William H. Seward,Secretary of State; Simon Cameron, Secretary of War; Salmon P. Chase,Secretary of the Treasury; Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy; CalebB. Smith, Secretary of the Interior; Montgomery Blair, PostmasterGeneral; and Edward Bates, Attorney General. Lincoln had selected thesecounselors with grave deliberation. In reply to the remonstrances urged,on political grounds, against the appointment of one or two of them, hehad said: "The times are too grave and perilous for ambitious schemesand personal rivalries. I need the aid of all of these men. They enjoythe confidence of their several States and sections, and they willstrengthen the administration." On another occasion he remarked: "Itwill require the utmost skill, influence, and sagacity of all of us, tosave the country; let us forget ourselves, and join hands like brothersto save the Republic. If we succeed, there will be glory enough forall."Speculations have been almost endless as to how the Cabinet came to bemade up as it was. But the truth is, according to Secretary Welles, thatit was practically made up in Springfield almost as soon as Lincolnfound himself elected. In Lincoln's own words, as given by Mr. Welles:"On the day of the Presidential election the operator of the telegraphin Springfield placed his instrument at my disposal. I was there withoutleaving, after the returns began to come in, until we had enough tosatisfy us how the election had gone. This was about two in the morningof Wednesday. I went home, but not to get much sleep; for I then felt,as I never had before, the responsibility that was upon me. I began atonce to feel that I needed support,--others to share with me the burden.This was on Wednesday morning, and before the sun went down I had madeup my Cabinet. It was almost the same that I finally appointed."The only two members of the Cabinet who served from the beginning to theend of Lincoln's administration were Welles and Seward. Stanton was notappointed until January 13, 1862, succeeding Simon Cameron. Chase leftthe Treasury Department to become Chief Justice, and was succeeded inthe Treasury Department by ex-Governor Fessenden of Vermont, who in histurn was succeeded by Hugh McCulloch. The Attorney General's chair wasfilled successively by Bates and Speed. Caleb B. Smith was the firstSecretary of the Interior, succeeded (January 1, 1863) by John P. Usher.The first Postmaster General was Montgomery Blair, who was followed(September 4, 1864) by ex-Governor Dennison of Ohio. The appointmentthat gave the greatest surprise of any in the Cabinet was that ofStanton as Secretary of War. Stanton had been in Buchanan's cabinet asAttorney General. He had been outspoken, almost brutal, in his scornfulhostility to Lincoln, and the appointment by him was as great a surpriseto Stanton as his acceptance of it was to everyone. When asked, somewhatincredulously, what he would do as War Secretary Stanton replied, "_Iwill make Abe Lincoln President of the United States_." Of the characterof this remarkable man, Mr. Alonzo Rothschild, in his interesting studyof the relations between Lincoln and Stanton ("Lincoln, Master of Men,"p. 229), says: "Intense earnestness marked Stanton's every act. Sosharply were all his faculties focused upon the purpose of the hourthat he is to be classed among the one-idea men of history. Whatevercame between him and his goal encountered an iron will.... Quick topenetrate through the husks of fraud into the very nubbin of things, hewas even more swiftly moved by relentless wrath to insist upon exposureand punishment. The brief career [as Attorney General] in Buchanan'scabinet had been long enough to demonstrate his almost savage hostilitytoward official dishonesty, as well as his moral courage to grapple withtreason in high places. Above all, he evinced a loyalty to the Unionthat rose above the party creed of a lifetime--that might demand of himany sacrifice however great."The first weeks of President Lincoln's residence in the ExecutiveMansion were occupied with the arduous work of selecting loyal andcapable men for responsible positions in the Government service. Thedepartments at Washington were filled with disloyal men, who used themeans and influence pertaining to their places to aid the rebelliousStates. It was of vital importance that these faithless officials shouldbe removed at the earliest moment, and their positions filled with menof tried integrity. Lincoln desired to appoint for this purpose stanch,competent, and trustworthy citizens, regardless of party distinctions.But the labor involved in this duty was enormous and exhausting. Therewas a multitude of vacant places, there were difficult questions to beconsidered in a majority of cases, and there was a host of applicantsand their friends to be satisfied. Mr. Charles A. Dana relates acircumstance which hints at the troubles encountered by Lincoln in thisprovince of his Presidential duties. "The first time I saw Mr. Lincoln,"says Mr. Dana, "was shortly after his inauguration. He had appointed Mr.Seward to be his Secretary of State; and some of the Republican leadersof New York, who had been instrumental in preventing Mr. Seward'snomination to the Presidency and in securing that of Mr. Lincoln, hadbegun to fear that they would be left out in the cold in thedistribution of the offices. Accordingly several of them determined togo to Washington, and I was asked to go with them. We all went up to theWhite House together, except Mr. Stanton, who stayed away because he washimself an applicant for office. Mr. Lincoln received us in the largeroom upstairs in the east wing of the White House, where the Presidenthad his working office, and stood up while General Wadsworth, who wasour principal spokesman, stated what was desired. After the interviewwas begun, a big Indianian, who was a messenger in attendance in theWhite House, came into the room and said to the President, 'She wantsyou.' 'Yes, yes,' said Mr. Lincoln, without stirring. Soon afterward themessenger returned again, exclaiming, 'I say she wants you.' ThePresident was evidently annoyed, but instead of going out after themessenger he remarked to us: 'One side shall not gobble up everything.Make out a list of the places and men you want, and I will endeavor toapply the rule of give and take.' General Wadsworth answered: 'Our partywill not be able to remain in Washington, but we will leave such a listwith Mr. Carroll, and whatever he agrees to will be agreeable to us.'Mr. Lincoln continued, 'Let Mr. Carroll come in to-morrow, and we willsee what can be done.'"Lincoln was regarded with violent animosity by all who were in sympathywith the peculiar prejudices of the slave States. The inhabitants of theDistrict of Columbia looked upon him with especial dislike. He was tothem an odious embodiment of the abhorred principles of Abolitionism. Asan illustration of this bitter feeling, Mr. Arnold narrates thefollowing anecdote: "A distinguished South Carolina lady--one of theHowards--the widow of a Northern scholar, called upon him out ofcuriosity. She was very proud and aristocratic, and was curious to see aman who had been represented to her as a monster, a mixture of the apeand the tiger. She was shown into the room where were Mr. Lincoln andSenators Seward, Hale, Chase, and other prominent members of Congress.As Mr. Seward, whom she knew, presented her to the President, she hissedin his ear: 'I am a South Carolinian.' Instantly reading her character,he turned and addressed her with the greatest courtesy, and dignifiedand gentlemanly politeness. After listening a few moments, astonished tofind him so different from what he had been described to her, she said:'Why, Mr. Lincoln, you look, act, and speak like a kind, good-hearted,generous man.' 'And did you expect to meet a savage?' said he.'Certainly I did, or even something worse,' replied she. 'I am glad Ihave met you,' she continued, 'and now the best way to preserve peace isfor you to go to Charleston and show the people what you are, and tellthem you have no intention of injuring them.' Returning home, she founda party of Secessionists, and on entering the room she exclaimed, 'Ihave seen him! I have seen him!' 'Who?' they inquired. 'That terriblemonster, Lincoln, and I found him a gentleman, and I am going to hisfirst levee after his inauguration.' At his first reception, this talldaughter of South Carolina, dressing herself in black velvet, with twolong white plumes in her hair, repaired to the White House. She wasnearly six feet high, with black eyes and black hair, and in her velvetand white feathers she was a striking and majestic figure. As sheapproached the President he recognized her immediately. 'Here I amagain,' said she, 'that South Carolinian.' 'I am glad to see you,'replied he, 'and to assure you that the first object of my heart is topreserve peace, and I wish that not only you but every son and daughterof South Carolina were here, that I might tell them so.' Mr. Cameron,Secretary of War, came up, and after some remarks he said, 'SouthCarolina [which had already seceded] is the prodigal son.' 'Ah, Mr.Secretary,' said she, 'if South Carolina is the prodigal son, Uncle Sam,our father, ought to divide the inheritance, and let her go; but theysay you are going to make war upon us; is it so?' 'Oh, come back,' saidLincoln, 'tell South Carolina to come back now, and we will kill thefatted calf.'"The impression which Lincoln made on those who met him at the outset ofhis career as President, and their varied comments and descriptions, arematters of peculiar interest. At first, many people did not understandhim--hardly knew what to make of a personality so unlike any they hadever seen in high places before. But he soon began to show thosequalities of calm self-reliance, quickness to grasp the essentialfactors of a situation and readiness to meet it, courage, patience,firmness, breadth of view and kindliness, practical tact and wisdom,which were a surprise to all who knew him, and are now seen to be but arapid and logical unfolding, under the stimulus of his enormousresponsibilities, of his great natural powers. The test had come, thecrisis was upon him; and he met them marvelously well.General W.T. Sherman contributes an interesting reminiscence at thispoint. "One day," says General Sherman, "my brother, Senator Sherman,took me with him to see Mr. Lincoln. We found the room full of people.Mr. Lincoln sat at the end of a table, talking with three or fourgentlemen, who soon left. John walked up, shook hands, and took a chairnear him, holding in his hand some papers referring to minorappointments in the State of Ohio, which formed the subject ofconversation. Mr. Lincoln took the papers, said he would refer them tothe proper heads of departments, and would be glad to make theappointments asked for, if not already promised. John then turned to me,and said, 'Mr. President, this is my brother, Colonel Sherman, who isjust up from Louisiana; he may give you some information you want.''Ah!' said Mr. Lincoln, 'how are they getting along down there?' I said,'They think they are getting along swimmingly--they are preparing forwar.' 'Oh, well!' said he, '_I guess we'll manage to keep house_.' I wassilenced, said no more to him, and we soon left. I was sadlydisappointed, and remember that I broke out on John, cursing thepoliticians generally, saying, 'You have got things in a ---- of a fix,and you may get them out as best you can,' adding that the country wassleeping on a volcano that might burst forth at any minute, but that Iwas going to St. Louis to take care of my family, and would have no moreto do with it. John begged me to be more patient, but I said I wouldnot; that I had no time to wait, that I was off for St. Louis; and off Iwent."The apartment which Lincoln used as an office in which to transact dailybusiness and to receive informal visits was on the second floor of theWhite House. Its simple equipments are thus described by Mr. Arnold: "Itwas about twenty-five by forty feet in size. In the centre, on the west,was a large white marble fireplace, with big old-fashioned brassandirons, and a large and high brass fender. A wood fire was burning incool weather. The large windows opened on the beautiful lawn to thesouth, with a view of the unfinished Washington Monument, theSmithsonian Institution, the Potomac, Alexandria, and on down the rivertoward Mt. Vernon. Across the Potomac were Arlington Heights andArlington House, late the residence of Robert E. Lee. On the hillsaround, during nearly all Lincoln's administration, were the white tentsof soldiers, field fortifications and camps, and in every directioncould be seen the brilliant colors of the national flag. The furnitureof this room consisted of a large oak table covered with cloth,extending north and south; and it was around this table that the Cabinetsat when it held its meetings. Near the end of the table, and betweenthe windows, was another table, on the west side of which the Presidentsat in a large armchair, and at this table he wrote. A tall desk withpigeon-holes for papers stood against the south wall. The only booksusually found in this room were the Bible, the United States Statutes,and a copy of Shakespeare. There were a few chairs and two plainhair-covered sofas. There were two or three map frames, from which hungmilitary maps on which the position and movements of the armies weretraced. On the mantel was an old and discolored engraving of GeneralJackson and a later photograph of John Bright. Doors opened into thisroom from the room of the Secretary, and from the outside hall runningeast and west across the House. A bell cord within reach of his handextended to the Secretary's office. A messenger who stood at the dooropening from the hall took in the cards and names of visitors. Here, inthis plain room, Lincoln spent most of his time while President. Here hereceived everyone, from the Chief Justice and Lieutenant-General to theprivate soldier and humblest citizen. Custom had fixed certain rules ofprecedence, and the order in which officials should be received. Membersof the Cabinet and the high officers of the army and navy weregenerally promptly admitted. Senators and members of Congress werereceived in the order of their arrival. Sometimes there would be a crowdof them waiting their turn. While thus waiting, the loud ringing laughof Mr. Lincoln would be heard by the waiting and impatient crowd. Here,day after day, often from early morning to late at night, Lincoln sat,listened, talked, and decided. He was patient, just, considerate, andhopeful. The people came to him as to a father. He saw everyone, andmany wasted his precious time. Governors, Senators, Congressmen,officers, clergymen, bankers, merchants--all classes approached him withfamiliarity. This incessant labor, the study of the great problems hehad to decide, the worry of constant importunity, the quarrels ofofficers of the army, the care, anxiety, and responsibility of hisposition, wore upon his vigorous frame."Mr. Ben. Perley Poore states that "the White House, while Mr. Lincolnoccupied it, was a fertile field for news, which he was always ready togive those correspondents in whom he had confidence; but thesurveillance of the press--first by Secretary Seward, and then bySecretary Stanton--was as annoying as it was inefficient.... Often whenMr. Lincoln was engaged, correspondents would send in their cards,bearing requests for some desired item of news or for the verificationof some rumor. He would either come out and give the covetedinformation, or he would write it on the back of the card and send it tothe owner. He wrote a legible hand, slowly and laboriously perfectinghis sentences before he placed them on paper. The long epistles that hewrote to his generals he copied himself, not wishing anyone else to seethem, and these copies were kept in pigeon-holes for reference.... Mr.Lincoln used to wear at the White House in the morning, and afterdinner, a long-skirted faded dressing-gown, belted around his waist, andslippers. His favorite attitude when listening--and he was a goodlistener--was to lean forward, and clasp his left knee with both hands,as if fondling it, and his face would then wear a sad and wearied look.But when the time came for him to give an opinion on what he had heard,or to tell a story which something 'reminded him of,' his face wouldlighten up with its homely, rugged smile, and he would run his fingersthrough his bristly black hair, which would stand out in every directionlike that of an electric experiment doll."John G. Nicolay, afterward Lincoln's private secretary, says: "Thepeople beheld in the new President a man six feet four inches in height,a stature which of itself would be hailed in any assemblage as one ofthe outward signs of leadership; joined to this was a spare but muscularframe, and large strongly-marked features corresponding to his unusualstature. Quiet in demeanor but erect in bearing, his face even in reposewas not unattractive; and when lit up by his open, genial smile, orilluminated in the utterance of a strong or stirring thought, hiscountenance was positively handsome. His voice, pitched in rather a highkey, but of great clearness and penetration, made his public remarksaudible to a wide circle of listeners."Henry Champion Deming says of Lincoln's appearance at this time:"Conceive a tall and giant figure, more than six feet in height, notonly unencumbered with superfluous flesh, but reduced to the minimumworking standard of cord and sinew and muscle, strong and indurated byexposure and toil, with legs and arms long and attenuated, but notdisproportionately to the long and attenuated trunk; in posture andcarriage not ungraceful, but with the grace of unstudied and carelessease rather than of cultivated airs and high-bred pretensions. His dressis uniformly of black throughout, and would attract but little attentionin a well-dressed circle, if it hung less loosely upon him, and if theample white shirt collar were not turned over his cravat in Westernstyle. The face that surmounts this figure is half Roman and halfIndian, bronzed by climate, furrowed by life struggles, seamed withhumor; the head is massive and covered with dark, thick, andunmanageable hair; the brow is wide and well developed, the nose largeand fleshy, the lips full, cheeks thin and drawn down in strong, cordedlines, which, but for the wiry whiskers, would disclose the machinerywhich moves the broad jaw. The eyes are dark gray, sunk in deep sockets,but bright, soft and beautiful in expression, sometimes lost and halfabstracted, as if their glance was reversed and turned inward, or as ifthe soul which lighted them was far away. The teeth are white andregular, and it is only when a smile, radiant, captivating, and winningas was ever given to mortal, transfigures the plain countenance, thatyou begin to realize that it is not impossible for artists to admire andwomen to love it."Mr. John Bigelow, who was appointed consul to Paris in 1861, and wasafterwards minister to France, describes in his "Retrospections of anActive Life" his first visit to Lincoln and the impressions gained byhim at that early period in Lincoln's official career. "The dayfollowing my arrival in Washington Preston King, Senator from New York,invited me to go with him to be presented to President Lincoln, aninvitation which of course I embraced with alacrity; for as yet I hadnot met him, and knew him only by his famous senatorial campaign againstDouglas in Illinois and the masterly address which he delivered at theCooper Institute shortly before his nomination in New York.... The newPresident received us in his private room at an early hour of themorning; another gentleman was with him at the time, a member of theSenate, I believe. We were with him from a half to three-quarters of anhour. The conversation, in which I took little or no part, turned uponthe operations in the field. I observed no sign of weakness in anythingthe President said; neither did I hear anything that particularlyimpressed me, which, under the circumstances, was not surprising. Whatdid impress me, however, was what I can only describe as a certain lackof sovereignty. He seemed to me, nor was it in the least strange that hedid, like a man utterly unconscious of the space which the President ofthe United States occupied that day in the history of the human race,and of the vast power for the exercise of which he had become personallyresponsible. This impression was strengthened by Mr. Lincoln's modesthabit of disclaiming knowledge of affairs and familiarity with duties,and frequent avowals of ignorance, which, even where it exists, it is aswell for a captain as far as possible to conceal from the public. Theauthority of an executive officer largely consists in what hisconstituents think it is. Up to that time Mr. Lincoln had had fewopportunities of showing the nation the qualities which won all heartsand made him one of the most conspicuous and enduring historiccharacters of the century."Some uncommonly vivid "first impressions" of Lincoln are given in theJournals of Ralph Waldo Emerson, who early in February of 1862 made avisit to Washington for the purpose of delivering a lecture before theSmithsonian Institution--a lecture which Lincoln is said to haveattended. A day or two afterwards Emerson was taken by Senator Sumner ofMassachusetts to call at the White House. "The President impressed me,"says Emerson, "more favorably than I had hoped. A frank, sincere,well-meaning man, with a lawyer's habit of mind, good clear statement ofhis facts; correct enough, not vulgar, as described, but with a sort ofboyish cheerfulness, or that kind of sincerity and jolly good meaningthat our class-meetings on Commencement Days show, in telling our oldstories over. When he has made his remark he looks up at you with greatsatisfaction, and shows all his white teeth, and laughs.... When I wasintroduced to him he said, 'Oh, Mr. Emerson, I once heard you say in alecture that a Kentuckian seems to say by his air and manners, "Here amI; if you don't like me, the worse for you."'" (The point of this ofcourse is that Lincoln was himself a Kentuckian.) A day or two laterEmerson again called on the President, this time in the company ofSecretary Seward. It being Sunday evening, Seward asked the President ifhe had been to church, to which the latter answered that he hadnot--that he had been reading, for the first time, Senator Sumner'sspeech in the Senate on the Trent affair. This was followed by somegeneral conversation on the Trent affair, in which the Presidentexpressed his gratification at the friendly attitude taken in the matterby France and Spain.Private Secretary Hay thus writes of Lincoln's character anddisposition: "All agree that the most marked characteristic of Mr.Lincoln's manners was his simplicity and artlessness; this immediatelyimpressed itself upon the observation of those who met him for the firsttime, and each successive interview deepened the impression. Peopleseemed delighted to find in the ruler of the nation freedom frompomposity and affectation, mingled with a certain simple dignity whichnever forsook him. Though oppressed with the weight of responsibilityresting upon him as President of the United States, he shrank fromassuming any of the honors, or even the titles, of the position. Afteryears of intimate acquaintance with Mr. Lincoln, the writer cannot nowrecall a single instance in which he spoke of himself as President, orused that title for himself except when acting in an official capacity.He always spoke of his position and office vaguely, as, 'this place,''here,' or other modest phrase. Once, speaking of the room in theCapitol used by the Presidents of the United States during the close ofa session of Congress, he said, 'That room, you know, that theycall'--dropping his voice and hesitating--'the President's room.' To anintimate friend who addressed him always by his own proper title, hesaid, 'Now call me Lincoln, and I'll promise not to tell of the breachof etiquette--if _you_, won't--and I shall have a resting-spell from"Mister President."' With all his simplicity and unacquaintance withcourtly manners, his native dignity never forsook him in the presence ofcritical polished strangers; but mixed with his angularities and_bonhomie_ was something which spoke the fine fiber of the man; andwhile his sovereign disregard of courtly conventionalities was somewhatludicrous, his native sweetness and straightforwardness of manner servedto disarm criticism and impress the visitor that he was before a manpure, self-poised, collected, and strong in unconscious strength. Ofhim, an accomplished foreigner, whose knowledge of the courts was moreperfect than that of the English language, said, 'He seems to me onegrand _gentilhomme_ in disguise.'" Mr. Hay adds that Lincoln'ssimplicity of manner "was marked in his total lack of consideration ofwhat was due his exalted station. He had an almost morbid dread of whathe called 'a scene'--that is, a demonstration of applause, such asalways greeted his appearance in public. The first sign of a cheersobered him; he appeared sad and oppressed, suspended conversation, andlooked out into vacancy; and when it was over, resumed the conversationjust where it was interrupted, with an obvious feeling of relief....Speaking of an early acquaintance who was an applicant for an officewhich he thought him hardly qualified to fill, the President said,'Well, now, I never thought M---- had any more than average ability,when we were young men together; really I did not.' [A pause.] 'But,then, I suppose he thought just the same about me; he had reason to,and--here I am!'"General Carl Schurz says: "In the White House, as in his simple home inSpringfield, Mr. Lincoln was the same plain, unaffected, unpretentiouscitizen. He won the admiration and affection of even the mostpunctilious of the foreign diplomats by the tenderness of his nature andthe touching simplicity of his demeanor.... He was, in mind and heart,the very highest type of development of a plain man. He was a bornleader of men, and the qualities that made him a leader were of theplain, common-sense type.... Lincoln had one great advantage over allthe chief statesmen of his day. He had a thorough knowledge of the plainpeople. He knew their habits, their modes of thought, their unfailingsense of justice and right. He relied upon the popular feeling, in greatmeasure, for his guidance."Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe said of the qualities which Lincoln exhibitedin the White House: "Lincoln is a strong man, but his strength is of apeculiar kind; it is not aggressive so much as passive; and amongpassive things, it is like the strength not so much of a stone buttressas of a wire cable. It is strength swaying to every influence, yieldingon this side and on that, to popular needs, yet tenaciously andinflexibly bound to carry its great end.... Slow and careful in comingto resolutions, willing to talk with every person who has anything toshow on any side of a disputed subject, long in weighing and pondering,attached to constitutional limits and time-honored landmarks, Lincolncertainly was the _safest_ leader a nation could have at a time when the_habeas corpus_ must be suspended and all the constitutional and minorrights of citizens be thrown into the hands of their military leader. Areckless, bold, theorizing, dashing man of genius might have wrecked ourConstitution and ended us in a splendid military despotism."The fear lest the virulent enemies of the administration should attemptto assassinate Lincoln was so wide-spread that military measures wereenforced to protect him from secret assault. General Charles P. Stone,to whom the duty was entrusted of establishing the necessaryprecautions, has furnished a brief report on the subject. "From thefirst," says General Stone, "I took, under the orders of theGeneral-in-chief, especial care in guarding the ExecutiveMansion--without, however, doing it so ostentatiously as to attractpublic attention. It was not considered advisable that it should appearthat the President of the United States was, for his personal safety,obliged to surround himself by armed guards. Mr. Lincoln was notconsulted in the matter. But Captain Todd, formerly an officer of theregular army, who was, I believe, the brother-in-law of Mr. Lincoln, wasthen residing in the Presidential Mansion, and with him I was daily andnightly in communication, in order that in case of danger one person inthe President's household should know where to find the main body of theguard, to the officer commanding which Captain Todd was each nightintroduced. Double sentries were placed in the shrubbery all around themansion, and the main body of the guard was posted in a vacantbasement-room, from which a staircase led to the upper floors. A personentering by the main gate and walking up to the front door of theExecutive Mansion during the night could see no sign of a guard; butfrom the moment anyone entered the grounds by any entrance, he was underthe view of at least two riflemen standing silent in the shrubbery, andany suspicious movement on his part would have caused his immediatearrest; while inside, the call of Captain Todd would have been promptlyanswered by armed men. The precautions were taken before Fort Sumter wasfired on, as well as afterward. One night near midnight," continuesGeneral Stone, "I entered the grounds for the purpose of inspecting theguard, and was surprised to see a bright light in the East room. As Ientered the basement I heard a loud noise, as of many voices talkingloudly, mingled with the ringing of arms, coming from the greatreception room. On questioning the commander of the guard, I learnedthat many gentlemen had entered the house at a late hour, but they hadcome in boldly; no objection had been made from within, but on thecontrary Captain Todd had told him all was right. I ascended theinterior staircase and entered the East room, where I found more thanfifty men, among whom were Hon. Cassius M. Clay and General Lane. Allwere armed with muskets, which they were generally examining, and it wasthe ringing of many rammers in the musket barrels which had caused thenoise I had heard. Mr. Clay informed me that he and a large number ofpolitical friends, _deeming it very improper that the President's personshould in such times be unguarded_, had formed a voluntary guard whichwould remain there every night and see to it that Mr. Lincoln was wellprotected. I applauded the good spirit exhibited, but did not, however,cease the posting of the outside guards, nor the nightly inspectionsmyself as before, until the time came when others than myself becameresponsible for the safety of the President."It is stated that Lincoln "had an almost morbid dislike to an escort, orguard, and daily exposed himself to the deadly aim of an assassin." Tothe remonstrances of friends, who feared his constant exposure todanger, he had but one answer: "If they kill me, the next man will bejust as bad for them; and in a country like this, where our habits aresimple, and must be, assassination is always possible, and will come ifthey are determined upon it." A cavalry guard was once placed at thegates of the White House for a while, and Lincoln said that he "worrieduntil he got rid of it." He once remarked to Colonel Halpine: "It wouldnever do for a President to have guards with drawn sabers at his door,as if he fancied he were, or were trying to be, or were assuming to be,an emperor." While the President's family were at their summer-house,near Washington, he rode into town of a morning, or out at night,attended by a mounted escort; but if he returned to town for a whileafter dark, he rode in unguarded, and often alone, in his open carriage.On more than one occasion, the same writer tells us, he "has gonethrough the streets of Washington at a late hour of the night with thePresident, without escort, or even the company of a servant, walking allthe way, going and returning. Considering the many open and secretthreats to take his life, it is not surprising that Lincoln had manythoughts about his coming to a sudden and violent end. He once said thathe felt the force of the expression, 'To take one's life in his hand';but that he would not like to face death suddenly. He said that hethought himself a great coward physically, and was sure that he wouldmake a poor soldier, for unless there was something inspiriting in theexcitement of a battle he was sure that he would drop his gun and run atthe first symptom of danger. That was said sportively, and he added,'Moral cowardice is something which I think I never had.'"CHAPTER XVI     Civil War--Uprising of the Nation--The President's First Call for     Troops--Response of the Loyal North--The Riots in     Baltimore--Loyalty of Stephen A.

Lincoln had thus farmaintained a conciliatory policy toward the States in rebellion, hopingto the last that good sense and reason prevailing over rash and violentimpulses would induce them to resume their allegiance to the Government.Their resort to arms and capture of forts and property of the UnitedStates decided the course of the administration; and on the 15th ofApril--forty-two days after his accession to the Presidency--Lincolnissued a proclamation asking for the immediate enlistment of 75,000volunteers,[C] and summoning Congress to convene in an extra session onthe 4th of July. The call was sent forth in the following form:     PROCLAMATION.     _By the President of the United States_.     WHEREAS, the laws of the United States have been for some time past     and now are opposed and the execution thereof obstructed in the     States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi,     Louisiana and Texas, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed     by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers     vested in the marshals by law; now, therefore, I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN,     President of the United States, in virtue of the power in me vested     by the Constitution and the laws, have thought fit to call forth,     and hereby do call forth, the militia of the several States of the     Union, to the aggregate number of seventy-five thousand, in order     to suppress said combinations and to cause the laws to be duly     executed.     The details of this object will be immediately communicated to the     State authorities through the War Department. I appeal to all loyal     citizens to favor, facilitate, and aid this effort to maintain the     honor, the integrity and existence of our National Union, and the     perpetuity of popular government, and to redress wrongs already     long enough endured. I deem it proper to say that the first service     assigned to the forces hereby called forth will probably be to     repossess the forts, places, and property which have been seized     from the Union; and in every event the utmost care will be     observed, consistently with the objects aforesaid, to avoid any     devastation, any destruction of, or interference with, property, or     any disturbance of peaceful citizens of any part of the country;     and I hereby command the persons composing the combinations     aforesaid to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective     abodes, within twenty days from this date.     Deeming that the present condition of public affairs presents an     extraordinary occasion, I do hereby, in virtue of the power in me     vested by the Constitution, convene both Houses of Congress. The     Senators and Representatives are, therefore, summoned to assemble     at their respective chambers, at twelve o'clock, noon, on Thursday,     the fourth day of July next, then and there to consider and     determine such measures as, in their wisdom, the public safety and     interest may seem to demand.     In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal     of the United States to be affixed.     Done at the City of Washington, this fifteenth day of April, in the     year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and of     the independence of the United States the eighty-fifth.     _By the President_, ABRAHAM LINCOLN.     WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.The issue of this proclamation created the wildest enthusiasm throughoutthe North. Scarcely a voice was raised against it, as it was seen to bea measure of absolute necessity and of self-defense on the part of theGovernment. "Every Northern State," says Mr. Henry I. Raymond,"responded promptly to the President's demand, and from private persons,as well as by the Legislatures, men, arms, and money were offered inunstinted profusion, and with the most zealous alacrity, in support ofthe Government. Massachusetts was first in the field, and on the firstday after the issue of the proclamation her Sixth regiment, completelyequipped, started from Boston for the national capital. Two moreregiments were also made ready, and took their departure withinforty-eight hours."The Sixth Massachusetts regiment was attacked on its way to Washington,on the 19th of April, by a mob in Baltimore, carrying a Confederateflag, and several of its members were killed or severely wounded."This," continues Mr. Raymond, "inflamed to a still higher point theexcitement which already pervaded the country. The whole Northernsection of the Union felt outraged that troops should be assailed andmurdered on their way to protect the capital of the nation. In Maryland,where the secession party was strong, there was also great excitement,and the Governor of the State and the Mayor of Baltimore united inurging, for prudential reasons, that no more troops should be broughtthrough that city." In answer to the remonstrances of Governor Hicks anda committee from Maryland, who presented their petition in person,Lincoln, intent on avoiding every cause of offense, and with aforbearance that now seems incredible, replied: "Troops must be broughthere; but I make no point of bringing them through Baltimore. Withoutany military knowledge myself, of course I must leave details to GeneralScott. He hastily said this morning, in the presence of these gentlemen,'March them around Baltimore, and not through it.' I sincerely hope theGeneral, on fuller reflection, will consider this practical and proper,and that you will not object to it. By this, a collision of the peopleof Baltimore with the troops will be avoided, unless they go out oftheir way to seek it. I hope you will exert your influence to preventthis. Now and ever, I shall do all in my power for peace, consistentlywith the maintenance of the Government."One of the most encouraging incidents of this opening chapter of the warwas the announcement that Stephen A. Douglas, the great leader of theDemocracy and the life-long political opponent of Lincoln, had declaredhis purpose to stand by the Government. The effect of this action, atthis crisis, was most salutary; it ranged the Northern Democrats withthe defenders of the Union, and gave Lincoln a united North as the actof no other individual could have done. From that time until his deathDouglas never faltered in his loyalty, and stood by the Government witha zeal and patriotism which were above all lower considerations ofperson or of party. On Sunday, the 14th of April, when Washington wasthrilling with excitement over the fall of Fort Sumter, Douglas calledon the President and after a brief conversation authorized a statementto be telegraphed throughout the country that he was "fully prepared tosustain the President in the exercise of all his Constitutionalfunctions, to preserve the Union, maintain the Government, and defendthe Federal capital. A firm policy and prompt action were necessary. Thecapital was in danger, and must be defended at all hazards, and at anyexpense of men and money." Faithful to his pledge, Douglas immediatelyset out upon a tour through the Northwest, to strengthen, by his wordsand presence, the spirit of loyalty among the people. He made a seriesof eloquent speeches on his journey to Chicago, where he arrived wornand spent with the fatigue and excitement of his undertaking. It was thelast and noblest service of his life. Illness ensued, and after a fewweeks of suffering he passed away, June 3, at the age of forty-eight.His death was an irreparable loss, mourned by the President and thenation.The President's call for troops was succeeded on the 19th of April by aproclamation declaring a blockade of Southern ports. The text of thisdocument is historically important, as definitely formulating theattitude and policy of the Government.     _Whereas_, An insurrection against the Government of the United     States has broken out in the States of South Carolina, Georgia,     Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, and the laws     of the United States for the collection of the revenue cannot be     efficiently executed therein, conformably to that provision of the     Constitution which requires duties to be uniform throughout the     United States:     _And whereas_, A combination of persons, engaged in such     insurrection, have threatened to grant pretended letters of marque     to authorize the bearers thereof to commit assaults on the lives,     vessels, and property of good citizens of the country lawfully     engaged in commerce on the high seas, and in waters of the United     States:     _And whereas_, An Executive Proclamation has already been issued,     requiring the persons engaged in these disorderly proceedings to     desist therefrom, calling out a militia force for the purpose of     repressing the same, and convening Congress in extraordinary     session to deliberate and determine thereon:     Now, therefore, I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States,     with a view to the same purposes before mentioned, and to the     protection of the public peace, and the lives and property of quiet     and orderly citizens pursuing their lawful occupations, until     Congress shall have assembled and deliberated on the said unlawful     proceedings, or until the same shall have ceased, have further     deemed it advisable to set on foot a blockade of the ports within     the States aforesaid, in pursuance of the laws of the United     States, and of the laws of nations in such cases provided. For this     purpose a competent force will be posted so as to prevent entrance     and exit of vessels from the ports aforesaid. If, therefore, with a     view to violate such blockade, a vessel shall approach or shall     attempt to leave any of the said ports, she shall be duly warned by     the commander of one of the blockading vessels, who shall indorse     on her register the fact and date of such warning; and if the same     vessel shall again attempt to enter or leave the blockaded port,     she will be captured and sent to the nearest convenient port, for     such proceedings against her and her cargo, as prize, as may be     deemed advisable.     And I hereby proclaim and declare, that if any person, under the     pretended authority of said States, or under any other pretense,     shall molest a vessel of the United States, or the persons or cargo     on board of her, such person will be held amenable to the laws of     the United States for the prevention and punishment of piracy.     _By the President_, ABRAHAM LINCOLN.     WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.     WASHINGTON, April 19, 1861.On the 27th of April the President issued a proclamation by which theblockade of Southern ports was extended to the ports of North Carolinaand Virginia. And on the 16th of May, by another proclamation, thePresident directed the commander of the United States forces in Floridato "permit no person to exercise any office or authority upon theislands of Key West, Tortugas, and Santa Rosa, which may be inconsistentwith the laws and Constitution of the United States; authorizing him, atthe same time, if he shall find it necessary, to suspend the writ of_habeas corpus_, and to remove from the vicinity of the United Statesfortresses all dangerous and suspected persons."The Virginia Convention which passed the ordinance of secession (April17) having appointed a committee to wait upon the President and"respectfully ask him to communicate to this Convention the policy whichthe Federal Executive intends to pursue in regard to the ConfederateStates," Lincoln in reply thus clearly outlined the policy and purposesof the Government:     In answer I have to say, that having at the beginning of my     official term expressed my intended policy as plainly as I was     able, it is with deep regret and mortification I now learn there is     great and injurious uncertainty in the public mind as to what that     policy is and what course I intend to pursue. Not having as yet     seen occasion to change, it is now my purpose to pursue the course     marked out in the Inaugural Address. I commend a careful     consideration of the whole document as the best expression I can     give to my purposes. As I then and therein said, I now repeat: "The     power confided in me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess     property and places belonging to the Government, and to collect the     duties and imposts; but beyond what is necessary for these objects     there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the     people anywhere." By the words "property and places belonging to     the Government," I chiefly allude to the military posts and     property which were in possession of the Government when it came     into my hands. But if, as now appears to be true, in pursuit of a     purpose to drive the United States authority from these places, an     unprovoked assault has been made upon Fort Sumter, I shall hold     myself at liberty to repossess, if I can, like places which had     been seized before the Government was devolved upon me; and in any     event I shall, to the best of my ability, repel force by force. In     case it proves true that Fort Sumter has been assaulted, as is     reported, I shall, perhaps, cause the United States mails to be     withdrawn from all the States which claim to have seceded,     believing that the commencement of actual war against the     Government justifies and possibly demands it. I scarcely need to     say that I consider the military posts and property situated within     the States which claim to have seceded, as yet belonging to the     Government of the United States as much as they did before the     supposed secession. Whatever else I may do for the purpose, I shall     not attempt to collect the duties and imposts by any armed invasion     of any part of the country; not meaning by this, however, that I     may not land a force deemed necessary to relieve a fort upon the     border of the country. From the fact that I have quoted a part of     the Inaugural Address, it must not be inferred that I repudiate any     other part, the whole of which I reaffirm, except so far as what I     now say of the mails may be regarded as a modification.     ABRAHAM LINCOLN.In the early period of Lincoln's administration he was hopeful that manyserious phases of the threatened trouble might be averted, and that thebetter judgment of the citizens of the South might prevail. "For morethan a month after his inauguration," says Secretary Welles, "PresidentLincoln indulged the hope, I may say felt a strong confidence, thatVirginia would not secede but would adhere to the Union.... That thereshould be no cause of offense, no step that would precipitate or justifysecession, he enjoined forbearance from all unnecessary exercise ofpolitical party authority." But he was very decided and determined as towhat his duty was and what his action would be if the secessionists anddisunionists pressed their case. He said: "The disunionists did not wantme to take the oath of office. I have taken it, and I intend toadminister the office for the benefit of the people, in accordance withthe Constitution and the law." He was especially anxious that Kentuckyshould not be plunged into a rebellious war, as he saw that this Statewould be of the utmost importance to the Union cause. Soon after thebombardment of Fort Sumter a conference was held between the Presidentand a number of prominent Kentuckians then in Washington, at whichLincoln expressed himself in the most earnest words. Kentucky, hedeclared, "must not be precipitated into secession. She is the key tothe situation. With her faithful to the Union, the discord in the otherStates will come to an end. She is now in the hands of those who do notrepresent the people. The sentiment of her State officials must becounteracted. We must arouse the young men of the State to action forthe Union. We must know what men in Kentucky have the confidence of thepeople, and who can be relied on for good judgment, that they may bebrought to the support of the Government at once." He paid a hightribute to the patriotism of the Southern men who had stood up againstsecession. "But," said he, "they are, as a rule, beyond the meridian oflife, and their counsel and example do not operate quickly, if at all,on the excitable nature of young men who become inflamed by thepreparations for war, and who in such a war as this will be, if it goeson, are apt to go in on the side that gives the first opportunity. Theyoung men must not be permitted to drift away from us. I know that themen who voted against me in Kentucky will not permit this Government tobe swept away by any such issue as that framed by the disunionists."As Mr. Markland, a prominent Kentuckian, relates, in his reminiscencesof the period: "Immediately a campaign for the Union was begun inKentucky. The State could not be dragooned into open secession,therefore the neutrality policy was adopted. That policy was morerigidly observed by Mr. Lincoln than it was by his opponents, but he wasnot misled by it. Judge Joseph Holt made eloquent appeals for the Unionthrough the columns of the press and from the forum, as did the Speeds,the Goodloes, and many others of prominence. Rousseau, Jacobs,Poundbaker, and others, stood guard in the Legislature, and by theireloquence stayed the tide of disunion there. The labors of Judge Holt,the Speeds, the Goodloes, Cassius M. Clay, and their followers, hadbrought forth fruit for the Union. The patriotic men in the Legislaturehad done their work well. The men in the camps on the north side of theOhio river moved over into Kentucky, and the invasion of Confederateswhich was to sweep Kentucky into secession was at an end. Kentucky wassaved to the Union by the wise counsel and pacific policy of AbrahamLincoln."A special session of Congress convened on the 4th of July, in obedienceto the summons of the President in his proclamation of April 15. Thefollowing day the message of the Executive rehearsed to the joint Housesthe circumstances which had rendered their assembling necessary. Itportrayed in clear and succinct words the situation of affairs, theaggressive acts of the States aiming to disrupt the Federal Union, andthe measures adopted by the administration to frustrate their attempts.The assailants of the Government, said the President, "have forced uponthe country the distinct issue, 'immediate dissolution or blood.' Andthis issue embraces more than the fate of these United States. Itpresents to the whole family of man the question whether aconstitutional Republic or Democracy--a Government of the people by thesame people--can or cannot maintain its territorial integrity againstits own domestic foes. It presents the question whether discontentedindividuals, too few in numbers to control administration according toorganic law in any case, can always, upon the pretenses made in thiscase, or on any other pretenses, or arbitrarily, without any pretense,break up their Government, and thus practically put an end to freegovernment upon the earth. It forces us to ask, 'Is there, in allRepublics, this inherent and fatal weakness? Must a Government, ofnecessity, be too strong for the liberties of its own people, or tooweak to maintain its own existence?'" The message requested of Congress"the legal means for making this contest a short and decisive one; thatyou place at the control of the Government, for the work, at least fourhundred thousand men and 400,000,000. That number of men is aboutone-tenth of those of proper ages within the regions where, apparently,all are willing to engage; and the sum is less than a twenty-third partof the money value owned by the men who seem ready to devote the whole.A debt of 600,000,000 now is a less sum per head than was the debt ofour Revolution when we came out of that struggle; and the money value inthe country now bears even a greater proportion to what it was then thandoes the population. Surely each man has as strong a motive now topreserve our liberties as each had then to establish them." The messagedwelt upon the encouraging facts "that the free institutions we enjoyhave developed the powers and improved the condition of our whole peoplebeyond any example in the world. Of this we now have a striking and animpressive illustration. So large an army as the Government has now onfoot was never before known without a soldier in it but had taken hisplace there of his own free choice. But more than this; there are manysingle regiments whose members, one and another, possess full practicalknowledge of all the arts, sciences, professions, and whatever else,whether useful or elegant, is known in the world; and there is scarcelyone from which there could not be selected a President, a Cabinet, aCongress, and perhaps a Court, abundantly competent to administer theGovernment itself." Finally, and eloquently, the message demonstratedthe significance of the war in its effect upon the liberties andprayers of all mankind. This message again illustrates Lincoln'ssingular power of stating clearly and convincingly the nature andexigencies of the struggle for the Preservation of the Union. Said he:     This is essentially a people's contest. On the side of the Union it     is a struggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance     of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of     men; to lift artificial weights from all shoulders; to clear the     paths of laudable pursuits for all; to afford all an unfettered     start and a fair chance in the race of life. Yielding to partial     and temporary departures, from necessity, this is the leading     object of the Government for whose existence we contend. I am most     happy to believe that the plain people understand and appreciate     this. It is worthy of note that while, in this the Government's     hour of trial, large numbers of those in the army and navy who have     been favored with the offices have resigned and proved false to the     hand which had pampered them, not one common soldier or common     sailor is known to have deserted his flag. Great honor is due to     those officers who remained true, despite the example of their     treacherous associates; but the greatest honor, and most important     fact of all, is the unanimous firmness of the common soldiers and     common sailors. To the last man, so far as known, they have     successfully resisted the traitorous efforts of those whose     commands but an hour before they obeyed as absolute law. This is     the patriotic instinct of plain people. They understand, without an     argument, that destroying the Government which was made by     Washington means no good to them. Our popular Government has often     been called an experiment. Two points in it our people have already     settled--the successful establishing and the successful     administering of it. One still remains--its successful maintenance     against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it. It is now     for them to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly     carry an election can also suppress a rebellion; that ballots are     the rightful and peaceful successors of bullets; and that when     ballots have fairly and constitutionally decided, there can be no     successful appeal back to bullets; that there can be no successful     appeal, except to ballots themselves, at succeeding elections. Such     will be a great lesson of peace: teaching men that what they cannot     take by an election, neither can they take by a war; teaching all     the folly of being the beginners of a war.Through the early summer of 1861 Washington was alive with preparationsfor a military movement against the enemy in Virginia. Troops from theNorth were constantly arriving, and as rapidly as possible were assignedto different organizations and drilled in the art of war. "Fewcomparatively know or can appreciate the actual condition of things andthe state of feeling of the members of the Administration in thosedays," says Secretary Welles. "Nearly sixty years of peace had unfittedus for any war; but the most terrible of all wars, a civil war, was uponus, and it had to be met. Congress had adjourned without making anyprovision for the storm, though aware it was at hand and soon to burstupon the country. A new Administration, its members scarcely acquaintedwith each other, and differing essentially in the past, was compelled toact, promptly and decisively." The burden upon the President began togrow tremendous; but he did not shrink or falter.    Upon his back a more than Atlas-load,      The burden of the Commonwealth, was laid;    He stooped, and rose up to it, though the road      Shot suddenly downwards, not a whit dismayed.He labored incessantly in urging forward the preparations for the greatstruggle which, however he might regret it, he now saw was inevitable.He was in daily conference with the officers of the army and of the WarDepartment, and was present at innumerable reviews and parades of thesoldiers. The 4th of July was memorable for a grand review of all theNew York troops in and about the city. It was a brilliant and impressivescene. Says a spectator, Hon. A.G. Riddle: "As they sweptpast--twenty-five thousand boys in blue--their muskets flashing, bandsplaying, and banners waving, I stood near a distinguished groupsurrounding the President, and noted his countenance as he turned to themassive moving column. All about him were excited, confident, exultant.He stood silent, pale, profoundly sad, as though his prophetic soul sawwhat was to follow. He seemed to be gazing beyond the splendid pageantbefore him, upon things hidden from other eyes. Was there presaged tohim a vision of that grander review of our victorious armies at theclose of the war, which he was not to see?"A few days later, all the troops in Washington crossed the Long Bridgeand marched, gallant and exultant, straight toward the enemy inVirginia. The advance of our army resulted, on the 21st of July, in theshameful disaster at Bull Run. The North was filled with surprise anddismay, and even the stoutest hearts were burdened with anxiety for thefuture. Lincoln at first shared somewhat in the general depression, buthis elastic spirits quickly rallied from the shock. Three or four daysafter the battle, some gentlemen who had been on the field called uponhim. He inquired very minutely regarding all the circumstances of theaffair, and after listening with the utmost attention, said, with atouch of humor: "So it's your notion that we _whipped the rebels_, andthen _ran away from them_!" Not long after this, the President made apersonal visit to the army in Virginia. General Sherman, at that timeconnected with the Army of the Potomac, says: "I was near theriver-bank, looking at a block-house which had been built for thedefense of the aqueduct, when I saw a carriage coming by the road thatcrossed the Potomac river at Georgetown by a ferry. I thought Irecognized in the carriage the person of President Lincoln. I hurriedacross a bend, so as to stand by the roadside as the carriage passed. Iwas in uniform, with a sword on, and was recognized by Mr. Lincoln andMr. Seward, who rode side by side in an open hack. I inquired if theywere going to my camp, and Mr. Lincoln said: 'Yes; we heard that you hadgot over the big scare, and we thought we would come over and see theboys.' The roads had been much changed and were rough. I asked if Imight give directions to his coachman; he promptly invited me to jumpin, and to tell the coachman which way to drive. Intending to begin onthe right and follow round to the left, I turned the driver into aside-road which led up a very steep hill, and, seeing a soldier, calledto him and sent him up hurriedly to announce to the Colonel whose campwe were approaching that the President was coming. As we slowly ascendedthe hill, I discovered that Mr. Lincoln was full of feeling, and wantedto encourage our men. I asked if he intended to speak to them, and hesaid he would like to. I asked him then to please discourage allcheering, noise, or any sort of confusion; that we had had enough of itbefore Bull Run to ruin any set of men, and that what we needed werecool, thoughtful, hard-fighting soldiers--no more hurrahing, no morehumbug. He took my remarks in the most perfect good-nature. Before wehad reached the first camp, I heard the drum beating the 'assembly,' sawthe men running for their tents, and in a few minutes the regiment wasin line, arms presented, and then brought to an 'order' and 'paraderest.' Mr. Lincoln stood up in the carriage, and made one of theneatest, best, and most feeling addresses I ever listened to, referringto our late disaster at Bull Run, the high duties that still devolved onus, and the brighter days yet to come. At one or two points the soldiersbegan to cheer, but he promptly checked them, saying: 'Don't cheer,boys. I confess I rather like it myself, but Colonel Sherman here saysthat it is not military; and I guess we had better defer to hisopinion.' In winding up, he explained that, as President, he wascommander-in-chief; that he was resolved that the soldiers should haveeverything that the law allowed; and he called on one and all to appealto him personally in case they were wronged. The effect of this speechwas excellent. We passed along in the same manner to all the camps of mybrigade; and Mr. Lincoln complimented me highly for the order,cleanliness, and discipline that he observed. Indeed, he and Mr. Sewardboth assured me that it was the first bright moment that they hadexperienced since the battle.""In the crowd at Fort Corcoran," continues General Sherman, "I saw anofficer with whom I had had a little difficulty that morning. His facewas pale and his lips were compressed. I foresaw a scene, but sat on thefront seat of the carriage as quiet as a lamb. This officer forced hisway through the crowd to the carriage, and said: 'Mr. President, I havea cause of grievance. This morning I went to speak to Colonel Sherman,and he threatened to shoot me.' Mr. Lincoln, who was still standing,said, 'Threatened to _shoot you_?' 'Yes, sir, he threatened to shootme.' Mr. Lincoln looked at him, then at me; and stooping his tall, spareform toward the officer, said to him in a loud stage-whisper, easilyheard for some yards around: 'Well, if I were you, and he threatened toshoot, _I would not trust him_, for _I believe he would do it_.' Theofficer turned about and disappeared, and the men laughed at him. Soonthe carriage drove on, and as we descended the hill I explained thefacts to the President, who answered, 'Of course I didn't know anythingabout it, but I thought you knew your own business best.' I thanked himfor his confidence, and assured him that what he had done would go farto enable me to maintain good discipline; and it did."The days following the Bull Run disaster were full of depression anddiscouragement, but Lincoln bore up bravely. He began to feel theterrible realities of his position, and saw himself brought face to facewith the most awful responsibilities that ever rested upon humanshoulders. A disrupted Union, the downfall of the great AmericanRepublic, so long predicted by envious critics of our institutions,seemed about to be accomplished. At the best, the Union could be savedonly by the shedding of seas of priceless blood and the expenditure ofuntold treasures. And _he_ must act, control, choose, and direct themeasures of the Government and the movements of its vast armies. Andwhat if all should fail? What if the resources of the Government shouldprove inadequate, and its enemies too powerful to be subdued by force?No wonder he was appalled and well-nigh overwhelmed by the dark prospectbefore him.Rev. Robert Collyer tells of seeing Lincoln in the summer of 1861, onthe steps of the White House, "answering very simply and kindly to themarks of respect some soldiers had come to pay him, who stood in deepranks on the grass, that had been top-dressed with compost enough tocover the whole District of Columbia, as the chairman of the committeethat had to pass the account told me. And once, curiously, I saw _onlyhis feet_. It was soon after the battle of Bull Run, when some say that_we_ ran, and some say that _they_ ran. And all was quiet on thePotomac; but the nation was stamping and champing the bit. And passingthe White House one day, I saw three pairs of feet on the sill of anopen window; and pausing for a moment, a good-natured fellow said,'_That's the Cabinet a sittin_', and _them big feet's old Abe's.'_ So,lecturing in Boston not long after, I said, like a fool as I was,'That's about all they are good for in Washington, to point their feetout o' window and talk, but go nowhere and do nothing.' When, indeed,the good President's heart was even then breaking with anxiety andtrouble.""One day," says Mr. A.G. Riddle, "I called at the White House to presenta distinguished stranger, who had important matters to bring to Mr.Lincoln's notice. It was evening--cold, rainy, and cheerless. TheExecutive Mansion was gloomy and silent. At Mr. Lincoln's door we weretold by the attendant to enter. We found the room quite dark, andseemingly vacant. I advanced a step or two, to determine if anyone werepresent, and was arrested by a strange apparition, at first notdistinguishable: the long, seemingly lifeless, limbs of a man, as ifthrown upon a chair and left to sprawl in unseemly disorder. A stepfurther, and the fallen head disclosed the features of the President. Iturned back; a word from my companion reached the drooping figure, and asepulchral voice bade us advance. We came upon a man, in some respectsthe most remarkable of any time, in the hour of his prostration andweakness--in the depths of that depression to which his inheritedmelancholy at times reduced him, now perhaps coming to overwhelm him ashe thought of the calamities of his country."An old and intimate friend from Springfield, who visited Lincoln at thisperiod, found the door of his office in the White House locked; butgoing through a private room and a side entrance, he found the Presidentlying on a sofa, evidently greatly disturbed and much excited,manifestly displeased with the outlook. Jumping up from his recliningposition, he advanced, saying: "You know better than any man living thatfrom my boyhood up my ambition was to be President. I am President ofone part of this divided country at least; but look at me! I wish I hadnever been born! I've a white elephant on my hands, one hard to manage.With a fire in my front and rear, having to contend with the jealousiesof the military commanders, and not receiving that cordial co-operationand support from Congress that could reasonably be expected, with anactive and formidable enemy in the field threatening the very life-bloodof the Government, my position is anything but a bed of roses."But in the darkest hours of the nation's peril, Lincoln never wavered inhis purpose. Anxious and careworn, his heart bleeding with grief for thelosses of our brave soldiers, and harassed by the grave dutiesconstantly demanding his attention, he had but one purpose,--to go onunfalteringly and unhesitatingly in his course until the supremacy ofthe Government was restored in every portion of its territory. He wrotein a private letter: "I expect to maintain this contest untilsuccessful, or till I die, or am conquered, or my term expires, orCongress or the country forsake me."Besides his invincible will and courage, Lincoln had one importantresource in his dark hours, an ever-ready relief for his overchargedemotions. Byron said that he sometimes laughed in order that he mightnot weep. Lincoln's life-long solace was his love of story-telling. Hon.Hugh McCulloch, afterward Secretary of the Treasury, relates that abouta week after the battle of Bull Run he called at the White House, incompany with a few friends, and was amazed when, referring to somethingwhich had been said by one of the company about the battle that was sodisastrous to the Union forces, the President remarked, in his usualquiet manner, "That reminds me of a story," which he told in a manner sohumorous as almost to lead his listeners to believe that he was freefrom care and apprehension. Mr. McCulloch could not then understand howthe President could feel like telling a story, when Washington was indanger of being captured and the whole North was dismayed. He learnedhis mistake afterwards, however, and perceived that his estimate ofLincoln before his election was well grounded, and that he possessedeven higher qualities than he had been given credit for; that he was "aman of sound judgment, great singleness and tenacity of purpose, andextraordinary sagacity; that story-telling was to him a safety-valve,and that he indulged in it, not only for the pleasure it afforded him,but for a temporary relief from oppressing cares." It is related that onthe morning after the battle at Fredericksburg, Hon. I.N. Arnold, then amember of Congress from Illinois, called on the President, and to hisamazement found him engaged in reading "Artemus Ward." Making noreference to that which occupied the universal thought, he asked Mr.Arnold to sit down while he read to him Artemus' description of hisvisit to the Shakers. Shocked at this proposition, Mr. Arnold said: "Mr.President, is it possible that with the whole land bowed in sorrow andcovered with a pall in the presence of yesterday's fearful reverse, youcan indulge in such levity?" Throwing down the book, with the tearsstreaming down his cheeks and his huge frame quivering with emotion,Lincoln answered: "Mr. Arnold, if I could not get momentary respite fromthe crushing burden I am constantly carrying, my heart would break!"Ralph Waldo Emerson said: "His broad good humor, running easily intojocular talk, in which he delighted, and in which he excelled, was arich gift to this wise man. It enabled him to keep his secret, to meetevery kind of man, and every rank in society; to take off the edge ofthe severest decisions, to mask his own purpose and sound his companion,and to catch, with true instinct, the temper of every company headdressed. And, more than all, it is to a man of severe labor, inanxious and exhausting crises, the natural restorative, good as sleep,and is the protection of the overdriven brain against rancor andinsanity."Even amidst the stern realities of war, Lincoln was keenly appreciativeof anything that disclosed the comic or grotesque side of men orhappenings,--largely, doubtless, for the relief afforded him. At thebeginning of Lee's invasion of Pennsylvania, in June, 1863, when theUnion forces under Colonel Milroy were driven out of Harper's Ferry bythe Confederates, great consternation and alarm were caused by reportsthat the Army of the Potomac had been routed and was retreating beforeLee, who was pressing forward toward Harrisburg, the capital ofPennsylvania. Mr. Welles records in his Diary (June 17, 1863) that hewas at the War Department with the President and Secretary Stanton, when"a messenger came in from General Schenck, declaring that thestragglers and baggage-trains of Milroy had run away in affright, andsquads of them on different parallel roads had alarmed each other, andeach fled in terror with all speed to Harrisburg. This alone wasasserted to be the basis of the great panic which had alarmedPennsylvania and the country. The President," continues Mr. Welles, "wasin excellent humor. He said this flight would be a capital joke forOrpheus C. Kerr[D] to get hold of. He could give scope to hisimagination over the terror of broken squads of panic-strickenteamsters, frightened at each other and alarming all Pennsylvania.General Meigs, who was present, inquired with great simplicity who thisperson (Orpheus C. Kerr) was. 'Why,' said the President, 'have you notread those papers? They are in two volumes; anyone who has not read themis a heathen.' He said he had enjoyed them greatly--except when theyattempted to play their wit on him, which did not strike him as verysuccessful, but rather disgusted him. 'Now, the hits that are given toyou, Mr. Welles, or to Chase,' he said, 'I can enjoy; but I daresay theymay have disgusted you while I was laughing at them. So _vice versa_ asregards myself.'"Hon. Lawrence Weldon relates that on one occasion he called upon thePresident to inquire as to the probable outcome of a conflict betweenthe civil and military authorities for the possession of a quantity ofcotton in a certain insurrectionary district. As soon as the inquiry hadbeen made, Lincoln's face began lighting up, and he said: "What hasbecome of our old friend Bob Lewis, of DeWitt County? Do you remember astory that Bob used to tell us about his going to Missouri to look upsome Mormon lands that belonged to his father? You know that whenRobert became of age he found among the papers of his father a number ofwarrants and patents for lands in Northeast Missouri, and he concludedthe best thing he could do was to go to Missouri and investigate thecondition of things. It being before the days of railroads, he startedon horseback, with a pair of old-fashioned saddlebags. When he arrivedwhere he supposed his land was situated, he stopped, hitched his horse,and went into a cabin standing close by the roadside. He found theproprietor, a lean, lank, leathery looking man, engaged in the pioneerbusiness of making bullets preparatory to a hunt. On entering, Mr. Lewisobserved a rifle suspended in a couple of buck-horns above the fire. Hesaid to the man, 'I am looking up some lands that I think belong to myfather,' and inquired of the man in what section he lived. Withouthaving ascertained the section, Mr. Lewis proceeded to exhibit his titlepapers in evidence, and, having established a good title, as he thought,said to the man, 'Now, that is my title. What is yours?' The pioneer,who had by this time become somewhat interested in the proceedings,pointed his long finger toward the rifle. Said he, 'Young man, do yousee that gun?' Mr. Lewis frankly admitted that he did. 'Well,' said he,'that is my title, and if you don't get out of here pretty d----d quickyou will feel the force of it.' Mr. Lewis very hurriedly put his titlepapers in his saddlebags, mounted his pony and galloped down the road,and, as Bob says, the old pioneer snapped his gun twice at him before hecould turn the corner. Lewis said that he had never been back to disturbthat man's title since. 'Now,' said Mr. Lincoln, 'the militaryauthorities have the same title against the civil authorities thatclosed out Bob's Mormon title in Missouri.'" Judge Weldon says thatafter this anecdote he understood what would be the policy of theGovernment in the matter referred to as well as though a proclamationhad been issued.The tedium of meetings of the Cabinet was often relieved, andtroublesome matters before it were illuminated, by some apt and pithystory. Secretary Welles tells of such an occasion when "Seward wasembarrassed about the Dominican [_sic_] question. To move either waythreatened difficulty. On one side was Spain, on the other side thenegro. The President remarked that the dilemma reminded him of theinterview between two negroes, one of whom was a preacher endeavoring toadmonish and enlighten the other. 'There are,' said Josh the preacher,'two roads for you, Joe. Be careful which you take. One ob dem leadsstraight to hell, de odder go right to damnation.' Joe opened his eyesunder the impressive eloquence and visions of an awful future, andexclaimed, 'Josh, take which road you please; I go troo de wood.' 'I amnot disposed to take any new trouble,' said the President, 'just at thistime, and shall neither go for Spain nor the negro in this matter, butshall take to the woods.'"It is related that Charles Sumner, who was a very tall man, and proud ofhis height, once worried the President about some perplexing matter,when Lincoln sought to change the subject by abruptly challenging hisvisitor to measure backs. "Sumner," said Mr. Lincoln, "declined to standup with me, back to back, to see which was the tallest man, and made afine speech about this being the time for uniting our fronts against theenemy, and not our backs. But I guess he was afraid to measure, thoughhe is a good piece of a man. I have never had much to do with Bishopswhere I live, but, do you know, Sumner is _my idea of a Bishop_."A good story of President Lincoln and General Scott is reported byMajor-General Keyes, who at the beginning of the war was on the staff ofGeneral Scott, then commander-in-chief of the armies of the UnitedStates. "I was sent," says General Keyes, "by my chief to the Presidentwith a message that referred to a military subject, and that led to adiscussion. Finding that Mr. Lincoln's observations were beginning totangle my arguments, I said, 'That is the opinion of General Scott, andyou know, Mr. President, he is a very able military man.' 'Well,' saidthe President, 'if he is as _able_ a military man as he is _unable_ as apolitician, I give up.' This was said with an expression of the eye,which he turned on me, that was peculiar to him, and which signified agreat deal. The astounding force of Mr. Lincoln's observation was not atall diminished by the fact that I had long suspected that my chieflacked something which is necessary to make a successful politician."Among the numerous delegations which thronged Washington in the earlypart of the war was one from New York, which urged very strenuously thesending of a fleet to the southern cities--Charleston, Mobile, andSavannah--with the object of drawing off the rebel army from Washington.Lincoln said the object reminded him of the case of a girl in New Salem,who was greatly troubled with a "singing" in her head. Various remedieswere suggested by the neighbors, but nothing seemed to afford anyrelief. At last a man came along--"a common-sense sort of man," said he,inclining his head towards his callers pleasantly,--"who was asked toprescribe for the difficulty. After due inquiry and examination, he saidthe cure was very simple. 'What is it?' was the question. 'Make aplaster of _psalm-tunes_, and apply to her feet, and draw the singing_down_,' was the rejoinder." Still better was his reply to anotherdelegation of New York millionaires who waited upon him in 1862, afterthe appearance of the rebel ram "Merrimac," and represented to him thatthey were very uneasy about the unprotected situation of their city,which was exposed to attack and bombardment by rebel rams; and theyrequested him to detail a gun-boat to defend the city. The gentlemenwere fifty in number, very dignified and respectable in appearance, andstated that they represented in their own right 100,000,000. Lincolndid not wish to offend these gentlemen, and yet he intended to give thema little lesson. He listened with great attention, and seemed to be muchimpressed by their presence and their statements. Then he replied, verydeliberately: "Gentlemen, I am by the Constitution commander-in-chief ofthe army and navy of the United States; and, as a matter of law, canorder anything done that is practicable to be done. But, as a matter offact, I am not in command of the gun-boats or ships of war; as a matterof fact, I do not know exactly where they are, but presume they areactively engaged. It is impossible for me, in the present condition ofthings, to furnish you a gun-boat. The credit of the Government is at avery low ebb; greenbacks are not worth more than forty or fifty cents onthe dollar; and in this condition of things, if I was worth half as muchas you, gentlemen, are represented to be, and as badly scared as youseem to be, I _would build a gun-boat and give it to the Government._" Agentleman who accompanied the delegation says he never saw one hundredmillions sink to such insignificant proportions, as the committeerecrossed the threshold of the White House, sadder but wiser men."Mr. Lincoln had his joke and his 'little story' over the disruption ofthe Democracy. He once knew, he said, a sound churchman, of the name ofBrown, who was the member of a very sober and pious committee, havingin charge the erection of a bridge over a dangerous and rapid river.Several architects had failed, and at last Brown said he had a friendnamed Jones who had built several bridges, and could undoubtedly buildthat one. So Mr. Jones was called in. 'Can you build this bridge?'inquired the committee. 'Yes,' replied Jones, 'or any other. I couldbuild a bridge to h--l, if necessary.' The committee were shocked, andBrown felt called upon to defend his friend. 'I know Jones so well,'said he, 'and he is so honest a man, and so good an architect, that ifhe states soberly and positively that he can build a bridge to ... to... the infernal regions, why, I believe it; but I feel bound to saythat I have my doubts about the abutment on the other side.' 'So,' saidMr. Lincoln, 'when politicians told me that the Northern and Southernwings of the Democracy could be harmonized, why, I believed them, ofcourse; but I always had my _doubts about the abutment on the otherside._'"A delegation once called on Lincoln to ask the appointment of agentleman as commissioner to the Sandwich Islands. They presented theircase as earnestly as possible, and, besides his fitness for the place,they urged that he was in bad health and a residence in that balmyclimate would be of great benefit to him. The President closed theinterview with the good-humored remark: "Gentlemen, I am sorry to saythat there are eight other applicants for that place, and they are _allsicker than your man._"CHAPTER XVII     Lincoln's Wise Statesmanship--The Mason and Slidell     Affair--Complications with England--Lincoln's "Little Story" on the     Trent Affair--Building of the "Monitor"--Lincoln's Part in the     Enterprise--The President's First Annual Message--Discussion of the     Labor Question--A President's Reception in War Time--A Great     Affliction--Death in the White House--Chapters from the Secret     Service--A Morning Call on the President--Goldwin Smith's     Impressions of Lincoln--Other Notable Tributes.In November of 1861 occurred one of the most important and perilousepisodes of the war; one whose full significance was not understood,except by a few cool heads, until long afterwards. Two influentialSouthern politicians, Mason and Slidell, had been sent by theConfederate Government as Commissioners to Great Britain and France, totry to secure the recognition of the Confederacy; and while on board theBritish steamer "Trent" they were taken prisoners by the U.S. steamer"San Jacinto," and were brought to Washington. Great Britain loudlyprotested against what she regarded as an unwarrantable seizure ofpassengers under the British flag, and for a time excitement ran highand war with England seemed almost inevitable. Fortunately for ourcountry, the controversy was amicably settled by the surrender of theprisoners, without any sacrifice of the dignity of the Government of theUnited States. As stated by "Hosea Biglow,"--    We gave the critters back, John,      Cos Abraham thought 't was right;    It wa'nt your bullyin' clack, John,      Provokin' us to fight.The statesmanship displayed by our Government throughout this difficultaffair was of the highest order. Credit for it has been given to Mr.Seward, the Secretary of State, by whom the correspondence andnegotiations were conducted. Few men could have managed these detailsbetter; yet the course that was so happily determined on was undoubtedlydue to the good sense and shrewd wisdom of the President. He not onlydictated the policy to be followed by Mr. Seward in his despatches tothe American Minister in London, but the more important documents wererevised and materially altered by Lincoln's own hand. His management ofthe Trent affair alone, it has been said, would suffice to establish hisreputation as the ablest diplomatist of the war. Coming, as it did, at atime when Lincoln was overwhelmed with the burden of home affairs, itshowed the surprising resources of his character. The readiness andability with which he met this perilous emergency, in a field in whichhe had had absolutely no experience or preparation, was equaled only byhis cool courage and self-reliance in following a course radicallyopposed to the prevailing public sentiment, to the views of Congress,and to the advice of his own Cabinet. The Secretary of the Navy hadhastened to approve officially the act of Captain Wilkes, commander ofthe "San Jacinto," and Secretary Stanton "cheered and applauded" it.Even Mr. Seward, cautious and conservative diplomat as he was, at-first"opposed any concession or surrender of the prisoners." But Lincoln saidsignificantly, "_One war at a time_." Events have long since affordedthe most ample vindication of his course in this important matter. Heavoided a foreign war, while at the same time, by committing GreatBritain to the doctrine of "peace between neutrals," gained asubstantial diplomatic victory over that government.An excellent account of the circumstances of the Trent affair is givenby Benson J. Lossing, the author and historian, who was in Washingtonwhen the events occurred. "The act of Captain Wilkes," says Mr. Lossing,"was universally applauded by all loyal Americans, and the land wasfilled with rejoicings because two of the most mischievous men among theenemies of the Government were in custody. For the moment, men did notstop to consider the law or the expediency involved in the act. Publichonors were tendered to Captain Wilkes, and resolutions of thanks werepassed by public bodies. The Secretary of the Navy wrote him acongratulatory letter on the 'great public services' he had rendered in'capturing the rebel emissaries, Mason and Slidell,' and assured himthat his conduct had 'the emphatic approval of the department.' TheHouse of Representatives tendered him their thanks for the service hehad done. But there was one thoughtful man in the nation, in whom wasvested the tremendous executive power of the Republic at that time, andwhose vision was constantly endeavoring to explore the mysteries of thenear future, who held calmer and wiser thoughts than most men at thatcritical moment, because his feelings were kept in subjection to hisjudgment by a sense of heavy responsibility. That man was AbrahamLincoln. The writer was in the office of the Secretary of War when thetelegraphic despatch announcing the capture of Mason and Slidell wasbrought in and read. He can never forget the scene that ensued. Led bySecretary Stanton, who was followed by Governor Andrew of Massachusettsand others who were present, cheer after cheer was heartily given by thecompany. A little later, the writer was favored with a brief interviewwith the President, when the clear judgment of that far-seeing andsagacious statesman uttered through his lips the words which formed thesuggestion of, and the keynote to, the judicious action of the Secretaryof State afterwards. 'I fear the traitors will prove to be whiteelephants,' said Mr. Lincoln. 'We must stick to American principlesconcerning the rights of neutrals,' he continued. 'We fought GreatBritain for insisting, by theory and practise, on the right to do justwhat Captain Wilkes has just done. If Great Britain shall now protestagainst the act, and demand their release, we must give them up,apologize for the act as a violation of our own doctrines, and thus_forever bind her over to keep the peace in relation to neutrals_, andso acknowledge that she has been wrong for sixty years.' Great Britaindid protest and make the demand, and at the same time made preparationsfor war against the United States. On the same day that Lord JohnRussell sent the protest and demand to Lord Lyons, the British Ministerat Washington, Secretary Seward forwarded a despatch to Minister Adamsin London, informing him that this Government disclaimed the act ofCaptain Wilkes, and giving assurance that it was ready to make asatisfactory arrangement of all difficulties arising out of theunauthorized act. These despatches passed each other in mid-ocean. TheGovernment, in opposition to popular sentiment, decided at once torestore Mason and Slidell to the protection of the British flag. It wassoon afterwards done, war between the two nations was averted, and, inthe language of President Lincoln, the British Government was 'foreverbound to keep the peace in relation to neutrals.' The wise statesmanshipexhibited at that critical time was originated by Abraham Lincoln."Lincoln once confessed that the Trent affair, occurring as it did at avery critical period of the war, had given him great uneasiness. Whenasked whether it was not a great trial to surrender the two capturedCommissioners, he said: "Yes, that was a pretty bitter pill to swallow,but I contented myself with believing that England's triumph in thematter would be short-lived, and that after ending our war successfullywe could if we wished call England to account for the embarrassments shehad inflicted upon us. I felt a good deal like the sick man in Illinoiswho was told he probably hadn't many days longer to live, and that heought to make peace with any enemies he might have. He said the man hehated worst of all was a fellow named Brown, in the next village, and heguessed he had better begin on him. So Brown was sent for, and when hecame the sick man began to say, in a voice as meek as Moses', that hewanted to die at peace with all his fellow-creatures, and hoped he andBrown could now shake hands and bury all their enmity. The scene wasbecoming altogether too pathetic for Brown, who had to get out hishandkerchief and wipe the gathering tears from his eyes. It wasn't longbefore he melted and gave his hand to his neighbor, and they had aregular love-feast. After a parting that would have softened the heartof a grindstone, Brown had about reached the room door, when the sickman rose up on his elbow and said, 'But, see here, Brown, if I _should_happen to get well, mind _that old grudge stands_!' So I thought if thisnation should happen to get well, we might want that old grudge againstEngland to stand."Other controversies with England arose during the progress of thewar--over the fitting out of Confederate cruisers at English ports toprey upon the commerce of the United States, over captured mails,etc.--in which all of Lincoln's sagacity and patience were needed toavert an open rupture with the British government. That the strain wassevere and the danger great is made clear by an entry in Mr. Welles'sDiary, in which he says: "We are in no condition for a foreign war. Tornby dissensions, an exhausting civil war on our hands, we have a gloomyprospect, but a righteous cause that will ultimately succeed. God aloneknows through what trials, darkness, and suffering we are to pass."Again, in dealing with the French invasion of Mexico, Lincoln--as Mr.John Bigelow (then minister to France) puts it--"wisely limited himselfto a firm repetition of the views and principles held by the UnitedStates in relation to foreign invasion," and thereby gained a diplomaticvictory. How well "the old grudge against England" stood is shown by thesubstantial damages obtained from her, some years after the war, on theclaims against the Alabama and other privateers, the foundations ofwhich had been wisely laid by President Lincoln.In the autumn of 1861 was originated the plan of a new naval vessel,which became the "Monitor"--the forerunner of the modern iron-clad, andthe formidable little craft that beat back the "Merrimac" ram at HamptonRoads, March 9, 1862, saved the Federal Navy, and revolutionized navalarchitecture. The interesting story of the project, and of Lincoln'srelation to it, is thus told: "The invention belongs to Captain JohnEricsson, a man of marvelous ability and most fertile brain; but thecreation of the 'Monitor' belongs to two distinguished iron-masters ofthe State of New York, viz.: the Hon. John F. Winslow and his partner inbusiness, the Hon. John A. Griswold. These two gentlemen were inWashington in the autumn of 1861, for the adjustment of some claimsagainst the Government for iron plating furnished by them for thewar-ship 'Galena.' There, through Mr. C.S. Bushnell, the agent ofCaptain Ericsson, they learned that the plans and specifications for anaval machine, or a floating iron battery, presented by CaptainEricsson, found no favor with the special board appointed by Congress in1861 to examine and report upon the subject of iron-clad ships of war.Ericsson and his agent, Mr. Bushnell, were thoroughly disheartened anddemoralized at this failure to interest the Government in their plans.The papers were placed in the hands of Messrs. Winslow and Griswold,with the earnest request that they would examine them, and, if theythought well of them, use their influence with the Government for theirfavorable consideration. Mr. Winslow carefully read the papers andbecame satisfied that Ericsson's plan was both feasible and desirable.After conference with his friend and partner, Mr. Griswold, it wasdetermined to take the whole matter to President Lincoln. Accordingly,an interview was arranged with Mr. Lincoln, to whom the plans of CaptainEricsson were presented, with all the unction and enthusiasm of anhonest and mastering conviction, by Mr. Winslow and Mr. Griswold, whohad now become thoroughly interested in the undertaking. The Presidentlistened with attention and growing interest. When they were done, Mr.Lincoln said, 'Gentlemen, why do you bring this matter to me? Why nottake it to the Department having these things in charge?' 'It has beentaken already to the Department, and there met with a repulse, and wecome now to you with it, Mr. President, to secure your influence. We arehere not simply as business men, but as lovers of our country, and webelieve most thoroughly that here is something upon which we can enterthat will be of vast benefit to the Republic,' was the answer. Mr.Lincoln was roused by the terrible earnestness of Mr. Winslow and hisfriend Griswold, and said, in his inimitable manner, 'Well, I don't knowmuch about ships, though I once contrived a canal-boat--the model ofwhich is down in the Patent Office--the great merit of which was that itcould run where there was no water. But I think there is something inthis plan of Ericsson's. I'll tell you what I will do. I will meet youto-morrow at ten o'clock, at the office of Commodore Smith, and we willtalk it all over.' The next morning the meeting took place according tothe appointment. Mr. Lincoln was present. The Secretary of the Navy,with many of the influential men of the Navy Department, also werethere. The office where they met was rude in its belongings. Mr. Lincolnsat upon a rough box. Mr. Winslow, without any knowledge of navalaffairs other than that which general reading would give, entered uponhis task with considerable trepidation, but his whole heart was in it,and his showing was so earnest, practical, and patriotic, that aprofound impression was made. 'Well,' said Mr. Lincoln, after Mr.Winslow had finished, 'well, Commodore Smith, what do you think of it?'The Commodore made some general and non-committal reply, whereupon thePresident, rising from the box, added, 'Well, I think there is somethingin it. Good morning, gentlemen,' and went out. From this interview grewa Government contract with Messrs. Winslow and Griswold for theconstruction of the 'Monitor,' the vessel to be placed in the hands ofthe Government within a hundred days at a cost of 275,000. The work waspushed with all diligence till the 30th of January, 1862, when the shipwas launched at Greenpoint, one hundred and one days from the executionof the contract, thus making the work probably the most expeditious ofany recorded in the annals of mechanical engineering."At the assembling of Congress in December, 1861, Lincoln presented hisfirst Annual Message. Among its most noteworthy passages was that whichtouched upon the relations between labor and capital--a subject soprominent in our later day. It was alluded to in its connection with theevident tendency of the Southern Confederacy to discriminate in itslegislation in favor of the moneyed class and against the laboringpeople. On this point the President said:     In my present position, I could scarcely be justified were I to     omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning     despotism. It is not needed nor fitting here, that a general     argument should be made in favor of popular institutions; but there     is one point, with its connections, not so hackneyed as most     others, to which I ask a brief attention. It is the effort to place     _capital_ on an equal footing with, if not above, _labor_, in the     structure of government. It is assumed that labor is available only     in connection with capital; that nobody labors unless somebody     else, owning capital, somehow, by the use of it, induces him to     labor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is best that     capital shall _hire_ laborers, and thus induce them to work by     their own consent, or _buy_ them, and drive them to it without     their consent. Having proceeded so far, it is naturally concluded     that all laborers are either hired laborers or what we call slaves.     And further, it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer is     fixed in that condition for life. Now, there is no such relation     between capital and labor as assumed; nor is there any such thing     as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired     laborer. Both these assumptions are false, and all inferences from     them are groundless. Labor is prior to and independent of capital.     Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if     labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and     deserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its rights,     which are as worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it     denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation     between labor and capital, producing mutual benefits. The error is     in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that     relation. A few men own capital, and those few avoid labor     themselves, and, with their capital, hire or buy another few to     labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class--neither     work for others, nor have others working for them. In most of the     Southern States, a majority of the whole people of all colors are     neither slaves nor masters; while in the North, a large majority     are neither hirers nor hired. Men, with their families--wives,     sons, and daughters--work for themselves, on their farms, in their     houses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves,     and asking no favors of capital on the one hand, nor of hired     laborers or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a     considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with     capital--that is, they labor with their own hands, and also buy or     hire others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed, not a     distinct class. No principle stated is disturbed by the existence     of this mixed class. Again, as has already been said, there is not,     of necessity, any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed     to that condition for life. Many independent men everywhere in     these States, a few years back in their lives, were hired laborers.     The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for wages     awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for     himself; then labors on his own account another while, and at     length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and     generous and prosperous system, which opens the way to all, gives     hope to all, and consequent energy and progress and improvement of     condition to all. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than     those who toil up from poverty--none less inclined to take, or     touch, aught which they have not honestly earned. Let them beware     of surrendering a political power which they already possess, and     which, if surrendered, will surely be used to close the door of     advancement against such as they, and to fix new disabilities and     burdens upon them till all of liberty shall be lost.     The struggle _of_ to-day is not altogether _for_ to-day--it is for     a vast future also. With a reliance on Providence, all the more     firm and earnest, let us proceed in the great task which events     have devolved upon us.The reception given at the White House on New Year's day, 1862, was abrilliant and memorable affair. It was attended by distinguished armyofficers, prominent men from civil life, and the leading ladies ofWashington society. "Army uniforms preponderated over black dress coats,and the young Germans of Blenker's division were gorgeously arrayed intunics embroidered with gold on the collars and cuffs, sword-belts ofgold lace, high boots, and jingling spurs." It was such a scene as thatbefore the battle of Waterloo, when the    ... capital had gathered then    Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright    The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;    A thousand hearts beat happily; and when    Music arose, with its voluptuous swell,    Soft eyes looked love to eyes that spake again,    And all went merry as a marriage bell.How many of these brave men were destined never to see another NewYear's day; and how many of those soft eyes would soon be dimmed withtears! Something of this feeling must have come over the sad soul ofLincoln. An eye-witness says that he "looked careworn and thoughtful, ifnot anxious; yet he had a pleasant word for all."Early in 1862 an event occurred which added to the sorrow that seemedto enshroud the life of Lincoln, and afforded a glimpse into the depthsof his tender and sorrowful nature. It was the death of his son Willie,a bright and promising boy, to whom his father was devotedly attached."This," says Dr. J.G. Holland, "was a new burden; and the visitationwhich, in his firm faith in Providence, he regarded as providential, wasalso inexplicable. Why should he, with so many burdens upon him, andwith such necessity for solace in his home and his affections, bebrought into so tender a trial? It was to him a trial of faith, indeed.A Christian lady of Massachusetts, who was officiating as nurse in oneof the hospitals, came in to attend the sick children. She reports thatMr. Lincoln watched with her about the bedside of the sick ones, andthat he often walked the room, saying sadly: 'This is the hardest trialof my life. Why is it? Why is it?' In the course of conversations withher, he questioned her concerning her situation. She told him she was awidow, and that her husband and two children were in heaven; and addedthat she saw the hand of God in it all, and that she had never loved Himso much before as she had since her affliction. 'How is that broughtabout?' inquired Mr. Lincoln. 'Simply by trusting in God, and feelingthat He does all things well,' she replied. 'Did you submit fully underthe first loss?' he asked. 'No,' she answered, 'not wholly; but as blowcame upon blow, and all were taken, I could and did submit, and was veryhappy.' He responded, 'I am glad to hear you say that. Your experiencewill help me to bear my afflictions.' On being assured that manyChristians were praying for him on the morning of the funeral, he wipedaway the tears that sprang in his eyes, and said, 'I am glad to hearthat. I want them to pray for me. I need their prayers.' As he wasgoing out to the burial, the good lady expressed her sympathy with him.He thanked her gently, and said, 'I will try to go to God with mysorrows.' A few days afterward she asked him if he could trust God. Hereplied, 'I think I can. I will try. I wish I had that childlike faithyou speak of, and I trust He will give it to me.' And then he spoke ofhis mother, whom so many years before he had committed to the dust amongthe wilds of Indiana. In this hour of his great trial, the memory of herwho had held him upon her bosom and soothed his childish griefs cameback to him with tenderest recollections. 'I remember her prayers,' saidhe, 'and they have always followed me. They have clung to me all mylife.'"An interesting passage in the secret history of the war at this periodis narrated by one of the chief actors, Mr. A.M. Ross, a distinguishedornithologist of Canada, whose contribution embodies also so manyinteresting details of Lincoln's daily life that it seems worth givingrather fully. A few months after the inauguration of President Lincoln,Mr. Ross received a letter from the Hon. Charles Sumner, requesting himto come to Washington at his earliest convenience. "The day after myarrival in Washington," says Mr. Ross, "I was introduced to thePresident. Mr. Lincoln received me very cordially, and invited me todine with him. After dinner he led me to a window, distant from the restof the party, and said: 'Mr. Sumner sent for you at my request; we needa confidential person in Canada to look after our interests, and keep usposted as to the schemes of the Confederates in Canada. You have beenstrongly recommended to me for the position. Your mission shall be asconfidential as you please; no one here but your friend Mr. Sumner andmyself shall have any knowledge of your position. Think it overtonight, and if you can accept the mission come up and see me at nineo'clock tomorrow morning.' When I took my leave of him, he said, 'I hopeyou will decide to serve us.' The position thus offered was one notsuited to my tastes, but, as Mr. Lincoln appeared very desirous that Ishould accept it, I concluded to lay aside my prejudices and accept theresponsibilities of the mission. I was also persuaded to this conclusionby the wishes of my friend, Mr. Sumner."At nine o'clock next morning, I waited upon the President, andannounced my decision. He grasped my hand in a hearty manner, and said:'Thank you, thank you; I am glad of it. You must help us to circumventthe machinations of the rebel agents in Canada. There is no doubt theywill use your country as a communicating link with Europe, and also withtheir friends in New York. It is quite possible, also, that they maymake Canada a base from which to harass and annoy our people along thefrontier.'"After a lengthy conversation relative to private matters connected withmy mission, I rose to leave, when he said, 'I will walk down toWillard's with you; the hotel is on my way to the Capitol, where I havean engagement at noon.' Before we reached the hotel a man came up to thePresident and thrust a letter into his hand, at the same time applyingfor some office in Wisconsin. I saw that the President was offended atthe rudeness, for he passed the letter back without looking at it,saying, 'No, sir! I am not going to open shop here.' This was said in amost emphatic manner, but accompanied by a comical gesture which causedthe rejected applicant to smile. As we continued our walk, the Presidentspoke of the annoyances incident to his position, saying: 'Theseoffice-seekers are a curse to the country; no sooner was my electioncertain, than I became the prey of hundreds of hungry, persistentapplicants for office, whose highest ambition is to feed at theGovernment crib.' When he bade me good-bye, he said, 'Let me hear fromyou once a week at least.' As he turned to leave me, a young armyofficer stopped him and made some request, to which the Presidentreplied with a good deal of humor, 'No, I can't do that; I must notinterfere; they would scratch my eyes out if I did. You must go to theproper department.'"Some time later," says Mr. Ross, "I again visited Washington. On myarrival there (about midnight) I went direct to the Executive Mansion,and sent my card to the President, who had retired. In a few minutes theporter returned and requested me to accompany him to the President'soffice, where Mr. Lincoln would shortly join me. The room into which Iwas ushered was the same in which I had spent several hours with thePresident on the occasion of my first interview with him. Scatteredabout the floor and lying open on the table were several military mapsand documents, indicating recent use. In a few minutes the Presidentcame in and welcomed me in a most friendly manner; I expressed my regretat disturbing him at such an hour. He replied in a good-humored manner,saying, 'No, no! You did right; you may waken me up whenever you please.I have slept with one eye open ever since I came to Washington; I neverclose both, except when an office-seeker is looking for me.' I then laidbefore the President the 'rebel mail.' He carefully examined the addressof each letter, making occasional remarks. At length he found oneaddressed to Franklin Pierce, ex-President of the United States, thenresiding in New Hampshire; and another to ex-Attorney-General Cushing, aresident of Massachusetts. He appeared much surprised, and remarkedwith a sigh, but without the slightest tone of asperity, 'I will havethese letters enclosed in official envelopes, and sent to theseparties.' When he had finished examining the addresses, he tied up allthose addressed to private individuals, saying, 'I won't bother withthem; but these look like official letters; I guess I'll go through themnow.' He then opened them, and read their contents, slowly andcarefully. While he was thus occupied, I had an excellent opportunity ofstudying this extraordinary man. A marked change had taken place in hiscountenance since my first interview with him. He looked much older, andbore traces of having passed through months of painful anxiety andtrouble. There was a sad and serious look in his eyes that spoke louderthan words of the disappointments, trials, and discouragements he hadencountered since the war began. The wrinkles about the eyes andforehead were deeper; the lips were firmer, but indicative of kindnessand forbearance. The great struggle had brought out the hidden riches ofhis noble nature, and developed virtues and capacities which surprisedhis oldest and most intimate friends. He was simple, but astute; hepossessed the rare faculty of seeing things just as they are. He was ajust, charitable, and honest man."When Mr. Lincoln finished reading the letters, I rose to go, sayingthat I would go to Willard's, and have a rest. 'No, no,' said thePresident, 'it is now three o'clock; you shall stay with me while youare in town; I'll find you a bed'; and leading the way, he took me intoa bedroom, saying, 'Take a good sleep; you shall not be disturbed.'Bidding me 'good night,' he left the room to go back and pore over therebel letters until daylight, as he afterwards told me. I did not awakenfrom my sleep until eleven o'clock in the forenoon, soon after which Mr.Lincoln came into my room, and laughingly said, 'When you are ready,I'll pilot you down to breakfast,' which he did. Seating himself at thetable near me, he expressed his fears that trouble was brewing on theNew Brunswick border; he said he had gathered further information onthat point from the correspondence, which convinced him that such wasthe case. He was here interrupted by a servant, who handed him a card,upon reading which he arose, saying, 'The Secretary of War has receivedimportant tidings; I must leave you for the present; come to my roomafter breakfast and we'll talk over this New Brunswick affair.""On entering his room again, I found him busily engaged in writing, atthe same time repeating in a low voice the words of a poem which Iremembered reading many years before. When he stopped writing I askedhim who was the author of that poem. He replied, 'I do not know. I havewritten the verses down from memory, at the request of a lady who ismuch pleased with them.' He passed the sheet, on which he had writtenthe verses, to me, saying, 'Have you ever read them?' I replied that Ihad, many years previously, and that I should be pleased to have a copyof them in his handwriting, when he had time and an inclination for suchwork. He said, 'Well, you may keep that copy, if you wish.'"Hon. William D. Kelly, a Member of Congress from Pennsylvania, relatesthat during the time of McClellan's Peninsular campaign he called at theWhite House one morning, and while waiting to see the President, SenatorWilson of Massachusetts entered the chamber, having with him fourdistinguished-looking Englishmen. The President, says Mr. Kelly, "hadevidently had an early appointment, and had not completed his toilet. Hewas in slippers, and his pantaloons, when he crossed one knee over theother, disclosed the fact that he wore heavy blue woollen stockings. Itwas an agreeable surprise to learn that the chief of the visiting partywas Professor Goldwin Smith of Canada, one of the firmest of our Britishfriends. As the President rose to greet them, he was the veryimpersonation of easy dignity, notwithstanding the negligence of hiscostume. With a tact that never deserted him, he opened the conversationwith an inquiry as to the health of his friend John Bright, whom he saidhe regarded as a friend of our country and of freedom everywhere. Thevisitors having been seated, the magnitude of recent battles wasreferred to by Professor Smith as preliminary to the question whetherthe enormous losses which were so frequently occurring would not soreduce the industrial resources of the North as to affect seriously theprosperity of individual citizens and consequently the revenue of thecountry. He justified the question by proceeding to recite the number ofkilled, wounded, and missing, reported after some of the great battlesrecently fought. There were two of Mr. Lincoln's official friends wholived in dread of his little stories. Neither of them was gifted withhumor, and both could understand his propositions, which were alwaysdistinct and clean cut, without such familiar illustrations as those inwhich he so often indulged; and they were chagrined whenever they werecompelled to hear him resort to his stories in the presence ofdistinguished strangers. They were Senator Wilson of Massachusetts andMr. Stanton, Secretary of War; and, as Professor Smith closed hisarithmetical statement, the time came for the Massachusetts Senator tobite his lips, for the President, crossing his legs in such a manner asto show that his blue stockings were long as well as thick, said that,in settling such matters as that, we must resort to 'darkey arithmetic.''To darkey arithmetic!' exclaimed the dignified representative of thelearning and higher thought of Great Britain and her American Dominion.'I did not know, Mr. President, that you have two systems of arithmetic''Oh, yes,' said the President; 'I will illustrate that point by a littlestory. Two young contrabands, as we have learned to call them, wereseated together, when one said to the other, "Jim, do you know'rithmetic?" Jim answered, "No; what is 'rithmetic?" "Well," said theother, "it's when you add up things. When you have one and one, and youput dem togedder, dey makes two. And when you subtracts things, when ifyou have two things and you takes one away, only one remains." "Is dat'rithmetic?" "Yah." "Well, 'tain't true, den. It's no good!" Here adispute arose, when Jim said, "Now, you 'spose three pigeons sit on thatfence, and somebody shoot one of dem; do t'other two stay dar? I guessnot! dey flies away quickern odder feller falls." And, Professor,trifling as the story seems, it illustrates the arithmetic you must usein estimating the actual losses resulting from our great battles. Thestatements you have referred to give the killed, wounded, and missing atthe first roll-call after the battle, which always exhibits a greatlyexaggerated total, especially in the column of missing.'"Mr. Goldwin Smith, the gentleman referred to in the foregoing anecdote,has summarized his impressions of Lincoln in the following paragraph:"Such a person as Abraham Lincoln is quite unknown to our officialcircles or to those of Continental nations. Indeed, I think his place inhistory will be unique. He has not been trained to diplomacy oradministrative affairs, and is in all respects one of the people. Buthow wonderfully he is endowed and equipped for the performance of theduties of the chief executive officer of the United States at this time!The precision and minuteness of his information on all questions towhich we referred was a succession of surprises to me."Still terser, but hardly less expressive, is Emerson's characterizationof Lincoln as one who had been "permitted to do more for America thanany other American man."A striking passage by Mr. Norman Hapgood should have place among thesetributes. "Lincoln had no artificial aids. He merely proved the weaponof finest temper in the fire in which he was tested. In the struggle forsurvival in a national upheaval, he not only proved the living power ofintegrity and elasticity, but he easily combined with his feats ofstrength and shrewdness some of the highest flights of taste. As we lookback across the changes of his life,--see him passing over the highplaces and the low, and across the long stretches of the prairie;spending years in the Socratic arguments of the tavern, and anon holdingthe rudder of state in grim silence; choosing jests which have thefreshness of earth, and principles of eternal right; judging potentatesand laborers in the clear light of nature, and at ease with both; aloneby virtue of a large and melancholy soul, at home with every man byvirtue of love and faith,--this figure takes its place high in our mindsand hearts, not solely through the natural right of strength andsuccess, but also because his strength is ours, and the success won byhim rested on the fundamental purity and health of the popular will ofwhich he was the leader and the servant. Abraham Lincoln was in a deepand lasting sense the first American."Mr. John Bigelow, already quoted in these pages, summarized Lincoln'scharacter and achievements in a passage of singular eloquence and force."Lincoln's greatness must be sought for in the constituents of his moralnature. He was so modest by nature that he was perfectly content towalk behind any man who wished to walk before him. I do not know thathistory has made a record of the attainment of any correspondingeminence by any other man who so habitually, so constitutionally, did toothers as he would have them do to him. Without any pretensions toreligious excellence, from the time he first was brought under theobservation of the nation he seemed, like Milton, to have walked 'asever in his great Taskmaster's eye.' St. Paul hardly endured moreindignities and buffetings without complaint. He was not a learned man.He was not even one who would deserve to be called in our day aneducated man--knew little rather than much of what the world is proudof. He had never been out of the United States, or seen much of theportion of them lying east of the Alleghany Mountains. But the spiritualside of his nature was so highly organized that it rendered superfluousmuch of the experience which to most men is indispensable--the choicestprerogative of genius. It lifted him unconsciously above the world,above most of the men who surrounded him, and gave him a wisdom inemergencies which is bestowed only on those who love their fellow-man asthemselves.... In the ordinary sense of the word, Mr. Lincoln was not astatesman. Had he come to power when Van Buren did, or when Clevelanddid, he would probably have left Washington at the close of his term asobscure as either of them. The issues presented to the people of theUnited States at the Presidential election of 1860 were to a largerextent moral questions, humanly speaking, than were those presented atany other Presidential election. They were: first, the right of themajority to rule; second, the right of eight millions, more or less, ofour fellow-beings to their freedom; and, third, the institutions andtraditions which Washington planted and Jefferson watered, with thesacrifices necessary for their preservation. These questionssubordinated all other political issues, and appealed more directly andforcibly to the moral sentiments of this nation than any issues they hadever before been called to settle either at the ballot-box or by forceof arms. A President was needed at Washington to represent these moralforces. Such a President was providentially found in Lincoln ... aPresident who walked by faith and not by sight; who did not rely uponhis own compass, but followed a cloud by day and a fire by night, whichhe had learned to trust implicitly."A very graphic summing-up of Lincoln in person and character is that ofMr. John G. Nicolay, one of his private secretaries, who knew himintimately and understood him well. "President Lincoln was of unusualstature, six feet four inches, and of spare but muscular build," saysMr. Nicolay. "He had been in youth remarkably strong and skilful in theathletic games of the frontier, where, however, his popularity andrecognized impartiality oftener made him an umpire than a champion. Hehad regular and prepossessing features, dark complexion, broad, highforehead, prominent cheek bones, gray, deep-set eyes, and bushy, blackhair, turning to gray at the time of his death. Abstemious in hishabits, he possessed great physical endurance. He was almost astender-hearted as a woman. 'I have not willingly planted a thorn in anyman's bosom,' he was able to say. His patience was inexhaustible. He hadnaturally a most cheerful and sunny temper, was highly social andsympathetic, loved pleasant conversation, wit, anecdote, and laughter.Beneath this, however, ran an undercurrent of sadness; he wasoccasionally subject to hours of deep silence and introspection thatapproached a condition of trance. In manner he was simple, direct, voidof the least affectation, and entirely free from awkwardness, oddity,or eccentricity. His mental qualities were a quick analytic perception,strong logical powers, a tenacious memory, a liberal estimate andtolerance of the opinions of others, ready intuition of human nature;and perhaps his most valuable faculty was rare ability to divest himselfof all feeling or passion in weighing motives of persons or problems ofstate. His speech and diction were plain, terse, forcible. Relatinganecdotes with appreciating humor and fascinating dramatic skill, heused them freely and effectively in conversation and argument. He lovedmanliness, truth, and justice. He despised all trickery and selfishgreed. In arguments at the bar he was so fair to his opponent that hefrequently appeared to concede away his client's case. He was ever readyto take blame on himself and bestow praise on others. 'I claim not tohave controlled events,' he said, 'but confess plainly that events havecontrolled me.' The Declaration of Independence was his political chartand inspiration. He acknowledged a universal equality of human rights.'Certainly the negro is not our equal in color,' he said, 'perhaps notin many other respects; still, in the right to put into his mouth thebread that his own hands have earned, he is the equal of every otherman, white or black.' He had unchanging faith in self-government. 'Thepeople,' he said, 'are the rightful masters of both congresses andcourts, not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men whopervert the Constitution.' Yielding and accommodating in non-essentials,he was inflexibly firm in a principle or position deliberately taken.'Let us have faith that right makes might,' he said, 'and in that faithlet us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it.' ..."CHAPTER XVIII     Lincoln and his Cabinet--An Odd Assortment of     Officials--Misconceptions of Rights and Duties--Frictions and     Misunderstandings--The Early Cabinet Meetings--Informal     Conversational Affairs--Queer Attitude toward the War--Regarded as     a Political Affair--Proximity to Washington a Hindrance to Military     Success--Disturbances in the Cabinet--A Senate Committee Demands     Seward's Removal from the Cabinet--Lincoln's Mastery of the     Situation--Harmony Restored--Stanton becomes War Secretary--Sketch     of a Remarkable Man--Next to Lincoln, the Master-mind of the     Cabinet--Lincoln the Dominant Power.President Lincoln's Cabinet, while containing men of marked ability andfitness for their positions, was in some respects about as ill-assortedand heterogeneous a body of men as were ever called to serve together asministers and advisers of a great government. Its selection was asurprise to the country. Mr. John Bigelow said it "had the appearance ofbeing selected from a grab-bag." "Not one of the members," continues Mr.Bigelow, "was a personal or much of a political friend of Mr. Lincoln;not one of them had ever had any experience or training in any executiveoffice, except Welles of Connecticut, if he could be claimed as anexception because of having served three years in a bureau of the Navyin Washington. Of military administration, still less of actual war, nomember knew anything by experience. The heads of the two most importantdepartments, the Secretaries of State and the Treasury, were bothdisappointed candidates for the chair occupied by Mr. Lincoln. It wasnothing less than Providential that the President was so happilyconstituted as neither to share nor to provoke any of the jealousies orenvies of either of them, and by his absolute freedom from every selfishimpulse gradually compelled them all to look up to him as the one personin whose singleness of eye they could all and always confide. Notimmediately, but in the course of two or three years, they got into thehabit of turning to him like quarrelling children to their mother tosettle all the questions that temporarily divided them."These Cabinet ministers were a devoted and patriotic body of men, buttheir misconceptions of their respective rights and duties were at firstgrotesque. Mr. Seward, a man of far greater administrative experiencethan Lincoln, assumed that he, rather than the President, was to be themaster mind of the new administration. "Premier" he at first calledhimself. Mr. Stanton, the Secretary of War, thought the Navy should be asort of adjunct to the War Department--an error of which SecretaryWelles of the Navy Department speedily relieved him. These two men werealtogether too unlike to get on well together. The cold and somewhatstately Welles was repelled by Stanton's impulsiveness and violence,while Stanton was exasperated by Welles's calmness and lack ofexcitability. "Lincoln's ministers had no idea that he towered abovethem," says Mr. John T. Morse, Jr., "and no one of them was at alloverawed by him in those days. Presiding over them at the Cabinet,casually meeting them, chatting with them or lounging as was his habitin Stanton's room, Lincoln seemed only officially superior to them. Oneof them had expected to be President, and another meant to be; a thirddared to be insolent and unruly; it seemed to be only by a chance ofpolitics that these men stood to him as junior partners to a senior, orlike a board of directors to the president of a corporation."The unfriendly feeling existing between members of the Cabinet comesout in many entries in Welles's Diary. "Pressing, assuming, violent,impatient, intriguing, harsh, and arbitrary," are examples of the termsin which Stanton is spoken of by Welles His contempt for the Committeeon the Conduct of the War is expressed in no less stinging words. Themembers of this committee "are most of them narrow and prejudicedpartisans, mischievous busybodies, and a discredit to Congress. Mean andcontemptible partisanship colors all their acts." It is amusing to notethat while Secretary Welles was thus outspoken in his criticisms ofothers, he himself did not escape calumny. One critic (Thurlow Weed,who, it may be remembered, had objected to Welles's appointment to aCabinet position when Lincoln suggested it to him in their consultationat Springfield before the inauguration) declared that "It is worse thana fault, it is a crime, to keep that old imbecile at the head of theNavy Department." And another critic expressed the uncomplimentaryopinion that "If Lincoln would send old Welles back to Hartford, itwould be better for the Navy and for the country."The accounts of the earliest Cabinet meetings, as given by SecretaryWelles, who was nearly always present, are full of interest. "Cabinetmeetings, which at that exciting period should have been daily, wereinfrequent, irregular, and without system," says Mr. Welles. "TheSecretary of State notified his associates when the President desired ameeting of the heads of Departments. It seemed unadvisable to thePremier--as he liked to be called and considered--that the membersshould meet often, and they did not. Consequently there was very littleconcerted action. At the earlier meetings there was little or noformality; the Cabinet meetings were a sort of privy council orgathering of equals, much like a Senatorial caucus, where there was norecognized leader and the Secretary of State put himself in advance ofthe President. No seats were assigned or regularly taken. The Secretaryof State was invariably present some little time before the Cabinetassembled, and from his former position as the chief executive of thelargest State in the Union as well as from his recent place as aSenator, and from his admitted experience and familiarity with affairs,assumed, and was allowed, as was proper, to take the lead inconsultations and also to give tone and direction to the manner and modeof proceedings. The President, if he did not actually wish, readilyacquiesced in, this. Mr. Lincoln, having never had experience inadministering the Government, State or National, deferred to thesuggestions and course of those who had. Mr. Seward was not slow intaking upon himself to prescribe action and to do most of the talking,without much regard to the modest chief, but often to the disgust of hisassociates, particularly Mr. Bates, who was himself always courteous andrespectful, and to the annoyance of Mr. Chase, who had had, like Mr.Seward, experience as a chief magistrate. Discussions were desultory andwithout order or system; but in the summing-up and conclusions thePresident, who was a patient listener and learner, concentrated results,and often determined questions adverse to the Secretary of State,regarding him and his opinions, as he did those of his other advisers,for what they were worth and generally no more."It was perhaps natural, in a country so long free from wars as ours hadbeen, that the Civil War should be regarded as a sort of politicalaffair to be directed from Washington rather than by commanders in thefield. For the first year or so the feeling was quite general thatmilitary affairs should be directed by Congress, acting through itsCommittee on the Conduct of the War, and by the Secretary of War, whocomplained bitterly that he was not allowed to assume control ofmilitary movements and that his plans were thwarted by McClellan (whomhe especially hated). The President himself did not escape thiscondemnation. The feeling at this time is expressed in a sentence inStanton's complaint, reflected through Chase, that "the President takescounsel of none but army officers in army matters." Chase declared toWelles, according to the latter, that the Treasury as well as otherdepartments "ought to be informed of the particulars of every movement."The generals engaged in planning the campaigns and fighting the battlesof the war, and their commander-in-chief the President, could hardlyfail to find their task an uphill one when ideas so naive and fatuous asthese prevailed. It is no wonder that General Grant recorded in hisMemoirs the opinion that the great difficulty with the Army of thePotomac during the first year of the war was its proximity toWashington; that the conditions made success practically impossible; andthat neither he, nor General Sherman, nor any officer known to him,could have succeeded in General McClellan's place, under the conditionsthat then existed. Gradually, and by slow and often painful experience,a clearer conception of the meaning and methods of war prevailed. Inthis, as in so many things, Lincoln's insight was first and surest. Bypatience, tact, shrewdness, firmness, and diplomatic skill, he held theCabinet together and stimulated its members to their best efforts forthe common cause.But the personal frictions and dissensions in the Cabinet, and the moreor less meddlesome attitude of leaders in the Senate and the House, attimes sorely tried the strength and patience of the harassed President,compelling him to act the part of peacemaker, and sometimes of judge andarbiter as well. At one time Secretary Stanton threatened to resign; andChase declared that in that case he should go with him. Stanton andWelles were in frequent antagonism, Welles stating in his Diary thatStanton assumed, or tried to assume, that the Navy should be subject tothe direction of the War Department. Seward was "meddlesome" towardother departments; "runs to the President two or three times a day;wants to be Premier," etc., says Welles. "Between Seward and Chase therewas perpetual rivalry and mutual but courtly distrust; they entered theCabinet as rivals, and in cold courtesy so continued." The most seriousof these Cabinet embroglios occurred late in December of 1862, whileLincoln was well-nigh overwhelmed by Burnside's dreadful repulse atFredericksburg. The gist of the affair, as given by Mr. Welles, is thatthe opposition to Seward in the Senate grew to such a point that acommittee was appointed to wait on the President and request Seward'sremoval from the office of Secretary of State. The President, Mr. Wellestells us, was "shocked and grieved" at this demonstration. He asked allthe members of his Cabinet to meet the Senate committee with him. Allthe members of the Cabinet were present except Seward, who had alreadysent the President his resignation. The meeting was attended also bySenators Collamer, Fessenden, Harris, Trumbull, Grimes, Howard, Sumner,and Pomeroy. The President, says Mr. Welles, opened the subject forwhich the meeting was called, taking a conciliatory tone toward theSenators, and requesting from each in turn an expression of opinion asto the wisdom of dropping Seward from the Cabinet. Most of them werestrongly of the opinion that Seward ought to go. The President presentedhis own views, which were, in effect, that it would be a mistake to letSeward leave the Cabinet at that particular time. "He managed his owncase," says Mr. Welles, "speaking freely, and showing great tact,shrewdness, and ability." The meeting continued until nearly midnight,and the matter was left still in the President's hands. The next morningMr. Welles called early at the White House and found Lincoln practicallydecided not to accept Seward's resignation, saying that it would neverdo to take the course prescribed by the Senators; that "the Governmentwould cave in; it could not stand--would not hold water; the bottomwould be out," etc. He requested Welles to go at once to Seward and askhim not to press his resignation. Lincoln's intuitional mind seemed atonce to connect Secretary Chase with the attack on Seward. Before Wellesleft the room, the President rang a bell and directed that a message besent to Chase requesting him to come at once to the White House. WhenWelles returned from his interview with Seward, who readily promised towithdraw his resignation at the President's request, he found both Chaseand Seward waiting for the President. The latter soon came in, and hisfirst words were to ask Welles if he "had seen the man," to which Wellesanswered that he had, and that he assented to what had been asked ofhim. The dramatic scene that followed is thus described by Mr. Welles inhis Diary: "The President turned to Chase and said, 'I sent for you, forthis matter is giving me great trouble.' Chase said he had beenpainfully affected by the meeting last evening, which was a totalsurprise to him; and, after some not very explicit remarks as to how hewas affected, informed the President he had prepared his resignation ofthe office of Secretary of the Treasury. 'Where is it?' said thePresident quickly, his eye lighting up in a moment. 'I brought it withme,' said Chase, taking the paper from his pocket; 'I wrote it thismorning.' 'Let me have it,' said the President, reaching his long armand fingers toward Chase, who held on, seemingly reluctant to part withthe letter, which was sealed, and which he apparently hesitated tosurrender. Something further he wished to say; but the President waseager and did not perceive it, and took and hastily opened the letter.'This,' said he, looking toward me with a triumphant air, 'cuts theGordian Knot. I can now dispose of this subject without difficulty, Isee my way clear.' Chase sat by Stanton, fronting the fire; thePresident beside the fire, his face toward them, Stanton nearest him. Iwas on the sofa, near the east window. 'Mr. President,' said Stanton,with solemnity, 'I informed you day before yesterday that I was ready totender you my resignation. I wish you, sir, to consider my resignationat this time in your possession.' 'You may go to your department,' saidthe President; 'I don't want yours. This,' holding out Chase's letter,'is all I want; this relieves me; my way is clear; the trouble is ended.I will detain neither of you longer.' We all rose to leave," concludesMr. Welles. "Chase and myself came downstairs together. He was moody andtaciturn. Someone stopped him on the lower stairs, and I passed on."A few days later, the President requested both Seward and Chase towithdraw their resignations and resume their duties. This was done, andthe trouble was ended for the time. Both Secretaries had got theirlessons, and profited by them. By the exercise of tact and patience,with firmness and decision when required, the President had let it beknown that he was the head and chief of the Administration.Next to the President, it was not Secretary Seward, the "Premier" as hewished to be regarded, but the War Secretary, Stanton, who was themaster-mind of the Cabinet. He was the incarnation of energy, theembodiment of patriotic zeal. With all his faults of temper anddisposition, he was a man of singular fitness for the responsibleposition he occupied, and his services to the Government can hardly beoverestimated. He had been a Democrat, a member of Buchanan's Cabinet,and was, says Dr. Holland, "the first one in that Cabinet to protestagainst the downright treason into which it was drifting. He was a manof indomitable energy, devoted loyalty, and thorough honesty.Contractors could not manipulate him, traitors could not deceive him.Impulsive, perhaps, but true; wilful, it is possible, but placable;impatient, but persistent and efficient,--he became at once one of themost marked and important of the members of the Cabinet." Lincoln andStanton together were emphatically "a strong team."Stanton was not a member of Lincoln's first Cabinet, but came into it atthe beginning of 1862, in place of Simon Cameron, who had just beenappointed Minister to Russia. A very interesting account of Cameron'spersonal relations with Lincoln, the causes that led to his retirementfrom the Cabinet, and the appointment of Stanton in his place, is givenby Cameron himself. He had been the choice of the Pennsylvaniadelegation for President, at the Chicago Convention in 1860, and it waslargely due to him that Lincoln received the nomination. "After theelection," said Mr. Cameron, "I made a trip to the West at Mr. Lincoln'srequest. He had, by letter, tendered me the position of either Secretaryof War or Secretary of the Treasury; but when I went to see him he saidthat he had concluded to make Mr. Seward Secretary of State, and hewanted to give a place to Mr. Chase. 'Salmon P. Chase,' said he, 'is avery ambitious man.' 'Very well,' said I, 'then the War Department isthe place for him. We are going to have an armed conflict over yourelection, and the place for an ambitious man is in the War Department.There he will have lots of room to make a reputation.' These thoughts ofmine, that we were to have war, disturbed Mr. Lincoln very much, and heseemed to think I was entirely too certain about it. Finally, when hecame to make up his Cabinet, doubtless remembering what I had said aboutthe War Department, he appointed me Secretary of War.""There has been," continues Mr. Cameron, "a great deal of misstatementas to Mr. Stanton's appointment as my successor. Stanton had been myattorney from the time I went into the War Department until he took myplace as Secretary. I had hardly made a move in which the legality ofany question could arise. I had taken his advice. I believed in thevigorous prosecution of the war from the start, while Mr. Sewardbelieved in dallying and compromising, and Mr. Chase was constantlyagitated about the expenditure of money; therefore it was that I wascareful to have the advice of an able lawyer. When the question ofchanging me from the War Department to the Russian mission came up, Mr.Lincoln said to me, 'Whom shall I appoint in your place?' My promptresponse was, 'Edwin M. Stanton.' 'But,' said he, 'I had thought ofgiving it to Holt.' 'Mr. Lincoln,' said I, 'if I am to retire in thepresent situation of affairs, it seems but proper that a friend of mine,or at least a man not unfriendly to me, should be appointed in my place.If you give Mr. Stanton the position, you will not only accomplish thisobject but will please the State of Pennsylvania and also get anexcellent officer.' 'Very well,' said Mr. Lincoln, 'you go and see him,and if he will accept the place he shall have it.' I left the WhiteHouse and started to find Stanton, passing through the TreasuryDepartment on my way. As I passed Mr. Chase's office, I stepped in andtold him what had occurred between the President and myself. He said,'Let's send for Stanton; bring him here and talk it over.' 'Very well,'said I, and a messenger was at once sent. Stanton came immediately, andI told him of the conference between the President and myself. He agreedto accept. We walked to the White House, and the matter was settled."One of the troubles in the Cabinet which brought about this change wasthat I had recommended in my annual report, in the fall of 1861, thatthe negroes should be enlisted as soldiers after they left theirmasters. This advanced step was regarded by most of the Cabinet withalarm. Mr. Lincoln thought it would frighten the border States out ofthe Union, and Mr. Seward and Mr. Chase thought it would never do atall."Just before the retirement of Mr. Cameron, a number of influentialSenators waited upon the President and represented to him that inasmuchas the Cabinet had not been chosen with reference to the war and hadmore or less lost the confidence of the country, and since the Presidenthad decided to select a new war minister, they thought the occasion wasopportune to change the whole seven Cabinet ministers. They thereforeearnestly advised him to make a clean sweep, select seven new men, andso restore the waning confidence of the country. The President listenedwith patient courtesy, and when the Senators had concluded, he said,with a characteristic gleam of humor in his eye: "Gentlemen, yourrequest for a change of the whole Cabinet because I have made onechange, reminds me of a story I once heard in Illinois of a farmer whowas much troubled by skunks. They annoyed his household at night, andhis wife insisted that he should take measures to get rid of them. Onemoonlight night he loaded his old shot-gun and stationed himself in theyard to watch for the intruders, his wife remaining in the houseanxiously awaiting the result. After some time she heard the shotgun gooff, and in a few minutes the farmer entered the house. 'What luck hadyou?' said she. 'I hid myself behind the woodpile,' said the old man,'with the shot-gun pointed toward the hen-roost, and before long thereappeared, not one skunk, but _seven_. I took aim, blazed away, andkilled one--and he raised such a fearful smell I concluded it was bestto let the other six alone.'" The Senators retired, and nothing more washeard from them about Cabinet reconstruction.Of the character and abilities of Secretary Stanton, and the relationsbetween him and the President, General Grant has admirably said: "I hadthe fullest support of the President and Secretary of War. No Generalcould want better backing; for the President was a man of great wisdomand moderation, the Secretary a man of enormous character and will. Veryoften where Lincoln would want to say _Yes_, his Secretary would makehim say _No_; and more frequently, when the Secretary was driving on ina violent course, the President would check him. United, Lincoln andStanton made about as perfect a combination as I believe could, by anypossibility, govern a great nation in time of war.... The two men werethe very opposite of each other in almost every particular, except thateach possessed great ability. Mr. Lincoln gained influence over men bymaking them feel that it was a pleasure to serve them. He preferredyielding his own wish to gratify others, rather than to insist uponhaving his own way. It distressed him to disappoint others. In mattersof public duty, however, he had what he wished, but in the leastoffensive way. Mr. Stanton never questioned his own authority tocommand, unless resisted. He cared nothing for the feeling of others."In a further comparison of the two men, General Grant said: "Lincoln wasnot timid, and he was willing to trust his generals in making andexecuting plans. The Secretary [Stanton] was very timid, and it wasimpossible for him to avoid interfering with the armies covering thecapital when it was sought to defend it by an offensive movement againstthe army guarding the Confederate capital. He could see our weakness,but he could not see that the enemy was in danger. The enemy would nothave been in danger if Mr. Stanton had been in the field."With all his force of character, and his overbearing disposition,Stanton did not undertake to rule the President--though this hassometimes been asserted. He would frequently overawe and browbeatothers, but he was never imperious in dealing with Lincoln. Mr. Watson,for some time Assistant Secretary of War, and Mr. Whiting, Solicitor ofthe War Department, with many others in a position to know, have bornepositive testimony to this fact. Hon. George W. Julian, a member of theHouse Committee on the Conduct of the War, says: "On the 24th of March,1862, Secretary Stanton sent for the Committee for the purpose of havinga confidential conference as to military affairs. Stanton was thoroughlydiscouraged. He told us the President had gone back to his first love,General McClellan, and that it was needless for him or for us to laborwith him." This language clearly shows that Lincoln, not Stanton, wasthe dominant mind.Wherever it was possible, Lincoln gave Stanton his own way, and did notoppose him. But there were occasions when, in a phrase used by Lincolnlong before, it was "necessary to _put the foot down firmly_." Such anoccasion is described by General J.B. Fry, Provost Marshal of the UnitedStates during the war. An enlistment agent had applied to the Presidentto have certain credits of troops made to his county, and the Presidentpromised him it should be done. The agent then went to SecretaryStanton, who flatly refused to allow the credits as described. The agentreturned to the President, who reiterated the order, but again withouteffect. Lincoln then went in person to Stanton's office. General Fry wascalled in by Stanton to state the facts in the case. After he concluded,Stanton remarked that Lincoln must see, in view of such facts, that hisorder could not be executed. What followed is thus related by GeneralFry: "Lincoln sat upon a sofa, with his legs crossed, and did not say aword until the Secretary's last remark. Then he said, in a somewhatpositive tone, 'Mr. Secretary, I reckon you'll have to execute theorder.' Stanton replied, with asperity, 'Mr. President, I cannot do it.The order is an improper one, and I cannot execute it.' Lincoln fixedhis eye upon Stanton, and in a firm voice and with an accent thatclearly showed his determination, he said, 'Mr. Secretary, _it will haveto be done_.' Stanton then realized that he was overmatched. He had madea square issue with the President, and had been defeated. Upon anintimation from him, I withdrew, and did not witness his surrender. Afew minutes after I reached my office I received instructions from theSecretary to carry out the President's order."Vice-President Wheeler relates a characteristic incident illustratingthe relations between Lincoln and Stanton. The President had promisedMr. Wheeler an appointment for an old friend as army paymaster, statingthat the Secretary of War would instruct the gentleman to report forduty. Hearing nothing further from the matter, Mr. Wheeler at lengthcalled upon the Secretary and reminded him of the appointment. Mr.Stanton denied all knowledge of the matter, but stated, in his brusquemanner, that the name would be sent in, with hundreds of others, to theSenate for its consideration. Mr. Wheeler argued that his friend hadbeen appointed by the Commander-in-chief of the Army, and that it wasunjust to ask him to wait for the tardy action of the Senate upon thenomination, and that he was entitled to be mustered in at once. But allin vain; the only reply that could be got from the iron Secretary was,"You have my answer; no argument." Mr. Wheeler went to the chief clerkof the department, and asked for the President's letter directing theappointment. Receiving it, he proceeded to the White House, although itwas after executive hours. "I can see Mr. Lincoln now," says Mr.Wheeler, "as he looked when I entered the room. He wore a long calicodressing-gown, reaching to his heels; his feet were encased in a pair ofold-fashioned leathern slippers, such as we used to find in the old-timecountry hotels, and which had evidently seen much service inSpringfield. Above these appeared the home-made blue woollen stockingswhich he wore at all seasons of the year. He was sitting in a splintrocking-chair, with his legs elevated and stretched across his officetable. He greeted me warmly. Apologizing for my intrusion at thatunofficial hour, I told him I had called simply to ascertain which wasthe paramount power in the Government, he or the Secretary of War.Letting down his legs and straightening himself up in his chair, heanswered, 'Well, it is generally supposed _I am_. What's the matter?' Ithen briefly recalled the facts attending Sabin's appointment, when,without comment, he said, 'Give me my letter.' Then, taking his pen, heindorsed upon it:     Let the within named J.A. Sabin be mustered AT ONCE. It is due to     him and to Mr. W., under the circumstances.     A. LINCOLN."Armed with this peremptory order, Mr. Wheeler called on Stanton the nextmorning. The Secretary was furious. He charged Mr. Wheeler withinterfering with his prerogatives. Mr. Wheeler remarked that he wouldcall the next morning for the order to muster in. He called accordingly,and, handing him the order, in a rage, Stanton said, "I hope I shallnever hear of this matter again."It is related by Hon. George W. Julian, already quoted, that on acertain occasion a committee of Western men, headed by Mr. Lovejoy,procured from the President an important order looking to the exchangeand transfer of Eastern and Western soldiers, with a view to moreeffective work. "Repairing to the office of the Secretary, Mr. Lovejoyexplained the scheme, as he had before done to the President, but wasmet with a flat refusal. 'But we have the President's order, sir,' saidLovejoy. 'Did Lincoln give you an order of that kind?' said Stanton. 'Hedid, sir.' 'Then he is a d----d fool,' said the irate Secretary. 'Do youmean to say the President is a d----d fool?' asked Lovejoy, inamazement. 'Yes, sir, if he gave you such an order as that.' Thebewildered Illinoisan betook himself at once to the President, andrelated the result of his conference. 'Did Stanton say I was a d----dfool?' asked Lincoln, at the close of the recital. 'He did, sir, andrepeated it.' After a moment's pause, and looking up, the Presidentsaid, 'If Stanton said I was a d----d fool, then _I must be one_, for heis nearly always right, and generally says what he means. _I will stepover and see him_.'" The two men met, and the matter was easilyadjusted. It was this rare combination of good-humor and firmness withan understanding of the other's trials and appreciation of his goodqualities, that reduced the friction of official life and enabledLincoln and Stanton to work together, in the main harmoniously andefficiently, in their great task of prosecuting the war and maintainingthe integrity of the Union.CHAPTER XIX     Lincoln's Personal Attention to the Military Problems of the     War--Efforts to Push forward the War--Disheartening     Delays--Lincoln's Worry and Perplexity--Brightening     Prospects--Union Victories in North Carolina and     Tennessee--Proclamation by the President--Lincoln Wants to See for     Himself--Visits Fortress Monroe--Witnesses an Attack on the Rebel     Ram "Merrimac"--The Capture of Norfolk--Lincoln's Account of the     Affair--Letter to McClellan--Lincoln and the Union Soldiers--His     Tender Solicitude for the Boys in Blue--Soldiers Always Welcome at     the White House--Pardoning Condemned Soldiers--Letter to a Bereaved     Mother--The Case of Cyrus Pringle--Lincoln's Love of Soldiers'     Humor--Visiting the Soldiers in Trenches and Hospitals--Lincoln at     "The Soldiers' Rest."Early in 1862 Lincoln began giving more of his personal attention tomilitary affairs. He was dissatisfied with the slow movements and smallachievements of our armies, and sought to infuse new zeal and energyinto the Union commanders. He also began a careful study of the greatmilitary problems pressing for solution; and he seemed resolved toassume the full responsibilities of his position, not only as the civilhead of the Government but as the commander-in-chief of the armies andnavies of the United States. In this he was influenced by no desire forpersonal control of the commanders in the field or interference withtheir plans; he always preferred to leave them the fullest liberty ofaction. But he felt that the situation demanded a single head, ready andable to take full responsibility for the most important steps; and, trueto himself and his habits of a lifetime, he neither soughtresponsibility nor flinched from it.The leading officers of the Union army were mostly young andinexperienced men, and none of them had as yet demonstrated the capacityof a great commander. At best it was a process of experiment, to seewhat generals and what strategic movements were most likely to succeed.In order to be able to judge correctly of measures and men, Lincolnundertook to familiarize himself with the practical details of militaryaffairs and operations. Here was developed a new and unsuspected phaseof his character. The plain country lawyer, unversed in the art of war,was suddenly transformed into the great civil ruler and militarychieftain. "He was already," says Mr. A.G. Riddle, "one of the wariest,coolest, and most skilful managers of men. _A born strategist_, he wasnow rapidly mastering the great outline ideas of the art of war." "Theelements of selfishness and ferocity which are not unusual withfirst-class military chiefs," said General Keyes, a prominent officer ofthe Union army, "were wholly foreign to Lincoln's nature. Nevertheless,_there was not one of his most trusted warlike counselors in thebeginning of the war who equaled him in military sagacity_." Hisreliance, in the new duties and perils that confronted him, was upon hissimple common-sense, his native power of judgment and discernment."Military science," says a distinguished officer, "is common-senseapplied to the affairs of war." While Lincoln made no claim to technicalknowledge in this sphere, and preferred to leave details to hissubordinates, he yet developed an insight into military problems and anunderstanding of practical operations in the field which enabled him notonly to approve or disapprove judiciously, but to direct and plan. Astriking confirmation of this is given by Mr. J.M. Winchell, who thusrelates what happened in a personal interview with the President:     "I was accompanied by one of Mr. Lincoln's personal friends; and     when we entered the well-known reception-room, a very tall, lanky     man came quickly forward to meet us. His manner seemed to me the     perfection of courtesy. I was struck with the simplicity, kindness,     and dignity of his deportment, so different from the clownish     manners with which it was then customary to invest him. His face     was a pleasant surprise, formed as my expectations had been from     the poor photographs then in vogue, and the general belief in his     ugliness. I remember thinking how much better-looking he was than I     had anticipated, and wondering that anyone should consider him     ugly. His expression was grave and care-worn, but still enlivened     with a cheerfulness that gave me instant hope. After a brief     interchange of commonplaces, he entered on a description of the     situation, giving the numbers of the contending armies, their     movements, and the general strategical purposes which should govern     them both. Taking from the wall a large map of the United States,     and laying it on the table, he pointed out with his long finger the     geographical features of the vicinity, clearly describing the     various movements so far as known, reasoning rigidly from step to     step, and creating a chain of probabilities too strong for serious     dispute. His apparent knowledge of military science, and his     familiarity with the special features of the present campaign, were     surprising in a man who had been all his life a civilian, engrossed     with politics and the practise of the law, and whose attention must     necessarily be so much occupied with the perplexing detail of     duties incident to his position. It was clear that he made the     various campaigns of the war a subject of profound and intelligent     study, forming opinions thereon as positive and clear as those he     held in regard to civil affairs."Toward the end of January, 1862, Lincoln sought to overcome the inertiathat seemed settling upon the Union forces by issuing the "President'sGeneral Order, No. I," directing that, on the 22d day of Februaryfollowing, "a general movement of the land and naval forces of theUnited States" be made against the insurgent forces, and giving warningthat "the heads of departments, and especially the Secretaries of Warand of the Navy, with all their subordinates, and the General-in-Chief,with all other commanders and subordinates of land and naval forces,will severally be held to their strict and full responsibilities forprompt execution of this order." This order, while it doubtless servedto infuse activity into commanders and officials, did not result in anysubstantial successes to our arms. The President, worn by his ceaselessactivities and anxieties, seems to have been momentarily disheartened atthe situation. Admiral Dahlgren, who was in command of the Washingtonnavy-yard in 1862, narrates that one day, at this period, "the Presidentdrove down to see the hundred-and-fifty-pounder cannon fired. For thefirst time I heard the President speak of the bare possibility of ourbeing two nations--as if alluding to a previous suggestion. He could notsee how the two could exist so near each other. He was evidently muchworried at our lack of military success, and remarked that '_no oneseemed ready_.'"It is difficult to portray the worry and perplexity that beset Lincoln'slife, and the incessant demands upon his attention, in his efforts tofamiliarize himself, as he felt compelled to do, with the practicaloperations of the war. Admiral Dahlgren, who saw him almost daily,relates that one morning the President sent for him, and said, "Well,Captain, here's a letter about some new powder." He read the letter andshowed the sample of powder,--adding that he had burned some of it andit did not seem a good article; there was too much residuum. "Now I'llshow you," said he. So he got a small sheet of paper and placed some ofthe powder on it, then went to the fire, and with the tongs picked up acoal, which he blew, with his spectacles still on his nose; then heclapped the coal to the powder, and after the explosion, remarked:"There is too much left there." There is something almost grotesque, buttouching and pathetic as well, in this picture of the President of theUnited States, with all his enormous cares and responsibilities, engagedin so petty a matter as testing a sample of powder. And yet so great washis anxiety for the success of the armies and navies under his controlthat he wished to become personally satisfied as to every detail. He didnot wish our armies or our war-vessels to lose battles on account of badpowder. "At another time," Admiral Dahlgren has related, "the Presidentsent for me regarding some new invention. After the agent of theinventor left, the President began on army matters. 'Now,' said he, 'Iam to have a sweat of five or six days'" (alluding to an impendingbattle, for the result of which he was very anxious). Again: "ThePresident sent for me. Some man in trouble about arms; President holdinga breech-loader in his hand. He asked me about the iron-clads, andCharleston." And again: "Went to the Department and found the Presidentthere. He looks thin, and is very nervous. Said they were doing nothingat Charleston, only asking for one iron-clad after another. The canal atVicksburg was of no account, and he wondered how any sensible man couldfavor it. He feared the favorable state of public expectation would passaway before anything was done. Then he leveled a couple of jokes at thedoings at Vicksburg and Charleston." No wonder the sympatheticDahlgren, witnessing the sufferings of the tortured President, shouldexclaim: "_Poor gentleman_! How thin and wasted he is!"The gloomy outlook in the Spring of 1862 was relieved by the substantialvictories of General Burnside in North Carolina and of General Grant inTennessee. The President was cheered and elated by these successes. Itis related that General Burnside, visiting Washington at this time,called on the President, and that "the meeting was a grand spectacle.The two stalwart men rushed into each other's arms, and warmly claspedeach other for some minutes. When General Burnside was about to leave,the President inquired, 'Is there anything, my dear General, that I cando for you?' 'Yes! yes!' was the quick reply, 'and I am glad you askedme that question. My three brigadiers, you know; everything depended onthem, and they did their duty grandly!--Oh, Mr. President, we owe somuch to them! I should so much like, when I go back, to take them theirpromotions.' 'It shall be done!' was Lincoln's hearty response, and onthe instant the promotions were ordered, and General Burnside had thepleasure of taking back with him to Foster, Reno, and Parke theircommissions as Major-Generals."Our brightening prospects impelled the President to issue, on the 10thof April, the following proclamation, breathing his deeply religiousspirit:     It has pleased Almighty God to vouchsafe signal victories to the     land and naval forces engaged in suppressing an internal rebellion,     and at the same time to avert from our country the dangers of     foreign intervention and invasion. It is therefore recommended to     the people of the United States that at their next weekly     assemblages in their accustomed places of public worship which     shall occur after the notice of this Proclamation shall have been     received, they especially acknowledge and render thanks to our     Heavenly Father for these inestimable blessings; that they then and     there implore spiritual consolation in behalf of all those who have     been brought into affliction by the casualties and calamities of     sedition and civil war; and that they reverently invoke the Divine     guidance for our national counsels, to the end that they may     speedily result in the restoration of peace, harmony, and unity     throughout our borders, and hasten the establishment of fraternal     relations among all the countries of the earth.     ABRAHAM LINCOLN.Early in May the President determined on a personal visit to FortressMonroe, in order to learn what he could from his own observation ofaffairs in that region. The trip was a welcome respite from the caresand burdens of official life, and he gave himself up, as far as hecould, to its enjoyment. The Secretary of War (Stanton) and theSecretary of the Treasury (Chase) accompanied the President. A mostinteresting account of the expedition is given by General Viele, who wasa member of the party and thus had an opportunity to observe Lincolnclosely. "When on the afternoon of May 4," says General Viele, "I wasrequested by the Secretary of War to meet him within an hour at thenavy-yard, with the somewhat mysterious caution to speak to no one of mymovements, I had no conception whatever of the purpose or intention ofthe meeting. It was quite dark when I arrived there simultaneously withthe Secretary, who led the way to the wharf on the Potomac, to which asteamer was moored that proved to be a revenue cutter, the 'Miami.' Wewent on board and proceeded at once to the cabin, where to my surprise Ifound the President and Mr. Chase, who had preceded us. The vesselimmediately got under way and steamed down the Potomac.... After supperthe table was cleared, and the remainder of the evening was spent in ageneral review of the situation, which lasted long into the night. Thepositions of the different armies in the field, the last reports fromtheir several commanders, the probabilities and possibilities as theyappeared to each member of the group, together with many other topics,relevant and irrelevant, were discussed, interspersed with the usualnumber of anecdotes from the never-failing supply with which thePresident's mind was stored. It was a most interesting study to seethese men relieved for the moment from the surroundings of their onerousofficial duties. The President, of course, was the centre of thegroup--kind, genial, thoughtful, tender-hearted, magnanimous AbrahamLincoln! It was difficult to know him without knowing him intimately,for he was as guileless and single-hearted as a child; and no man everknew him intimately who did not recognize and admire his greatabilities, both natural and acquired, his large-heartedness andsincerity of purpose.... He would sit for hours during the trip,repeating passages of Shakespeare's plays, page after page of Browning,and whole cantos of Byron. His inexhaustible stock of anecdotes gave tosuperficial minds the impression that he was not a thoughtful andreflecting man; whereas the fact was directly the reverse. Theseanecdotes formed no more a part of Mr. Lincoln's mind than a smile formsa part of the face. They came unbidden, and, like a forced smile, wereoften employed to conceal a depth of anxiety in his own heart, and todissipate the care that weighed upon the minds of his associates. BothMr. Chase and Mr. Stanton were under great depression of spirits when westarted, and Mr. Chase remarked with a good deal of seriousness that hehad forgotten to write a very important letter before leaving. It wastoo late to remedy the omission, and Mr. Lincoln at once drove thethought of it from his mind by telling him that a man was sometimeslucky in forgetting to write a letter, for he seldom knew what itcontained until it appeared again some day to confront him with anindiscreet word or expression; and then he told a humorous story of asad catastrophe that happened in a family, which was ascribed tosomething that came in a letter--a catastrophe so far beyond the regionof possibility that it set us all laughing, and Mr. Chase lost hisanxious look. That reminded Mr. Stanton of the dilemma he had beenplaced in, just before leaving, by the receipt of a telegram fromGeneral Mitchell, who was in Northern Alabama. The telegram wasindistinct, and could not be clearly understood; there was no time forfurther explanation, and yet an immediate answer was required; so theSecretary took the chances and answered back, 'All right; go ahead.''Now, Mr. President,' said he, 'if I have made a mistake, I mustcountermand my instructions.' 'I suppose you meant,' said Mr. Lincoln,'that it was all right if it was good for him, and all wrong if it wasnot. That reminds me,' said he, 'of a story about a horse that was soldat the cross-roads near where I once lived. The horse was supposed to befast, and quite a number of people were present at the time appointedfor the sale. A small boy was employed to ride the horse backward andforward to exhibit his points. One of the would-be buyers followed theboy down the road and asked him confidentially if the horse had asplint. 'Well, mister,' said the boy, 'if it's good for him he's got it,but if it isn't good for him he hasn't.' 'And that's the position,' saidthe President, 'you seem to have left General Mitchell in. Well,Stanton, I guess he'll come out right; but at any rate you can't helphim now.' ... Mr. Lincoln always had a pleasant word to say the lastthing at night and the first thing in the morning. He was always thefirst one to awake, although not the first to rise. The day-time wasspent principally upon the quarter-deck, and the President entertainedus with numerous anecdotes and incidents of his life, of the mostinteresting character. Few were aware of the physical strength possessedby Mr. Lincoln. In muscular power he was one in a thousand. One morning,while we were sitting on deck, he saw an axe in a socket on thebulwarks, and taking it up, he held it at arm's length at the extremityof the helve with his thumb and forefinger, continuing to hold it therefor a number of minutes. The most powerful sailors on board tried invain to imitate him. Mr. Lincoln said he could do this when he waseighteen years of age, and had never seen a day since that time when hecould not.[E]"It was late in the evening," continues General Viele, "when we arrivedat Fortress Monroe.... Answering the hail of the guard-boats, we made alanding, and the Secretary of War immediately despatched a messenger forGeneral Wool, the commander of the fort; on whose arrival it wasdecided to consult at once with Admiral Goldsborough, the commander ofthe fleet, whose flag-ship, the 'Minnesota,' a superb model of navalarchitecture, lay a short distance off the shore. The result of thisconference was a plan to get up an engagement the next day between the'Merrimac' and the 'Monitor,' so that during the fight the 'Vanderbilt,'which had been immensely strengthened for the purpose, might put on allsteam and run her down. Accordingly, the next morning, the President andparty went over to the Rip Raps to see the naval combat. The 'Merrimac'moved out of the mouth of the Elizabeth river, quietly and steadily,just as she had come out only a few weeks before when she had sunk the'Congress' and the 'Cumberland.' She wore an air of defiance anddetermination even at that distance. The 'Monitor' moved up and waitedfor her. All the other vessels got out of the way to give the'Vanderbilt' and the 'Minnesota' room to bear down upon the rebel terroras soon as she should clear the coast line. It was a calm Sabbathmorning, and the air was still and tranquil. Suddenly the stillness wasbroken by the cannon from the vessels and the great guns from the RipRaps, that filled the air with sulphurous smoke and a terrific noisethat reverberated from the fortress and the opposite shore like thunder.The firing was maintained for several hours, but all to no purpose; the'Merrimac' moved sullenly back to her position. It was determined thatnight that on the following day vigorous offensive operations should beundertaken. The whole available naval force was to bombard Sewall'sPoint, and under cover of the bombardment the available troops fromFortress Monroe were to be landed at that point and move on Norfolk.Accordingly, the next morning a tremendous cannonading of Sewall'sPoint took place. The wooden sheds at that place were set on fire andthe battery was silenced. The 'Merrimac,' coated with mail and lying lowin the water, looked on but took no part. Night came on, and thecannonading ceased. It was so evident that the 'Merrimac' intended toact only on the defensive, and that as long as she remained where shewas no troops could be landed in that vicinity, that they were orderedto disembark. That night the President, with the Secretary of War andthe Secretary of the Treasury, went over on the 'Miami' to the Virginiashore, and by the light of the moon landed on the beach and walked upand down a considerable distance to assure himself that there could beno mistake in the matter. How little the Confederacy dreamed what avisitor it had that night to the 'sacred soil.'"The following morning an advance was made upon Norfolk by the routeproposed by General Viele. The attempt was successful, and before nightour forces were in control of the captured city. Some time aftermidnight, as General Viele records, "with a shock that shook the city,and with an ominous sound that could not be mistaken, the magazine ofthe 'Merrimac' was exploded, the vessel having been cut off fromsupplies and deserted by the crew; and thus this most formidable engineof destruction, that had so long been a terror, not only to HamptonRoads, but to the Atlantic coast, went to her doom, a tragic andglorious _finale_ to the trip of the 'Miami.'"Secretary Chase had accompanied the expedition against Norfolk,returning to Fortress Monroe with General Wool immediately after thesurrender of the city. The scene which ensued on the announcement of thegood tidings they brought back to the anxious parties awaiting news ofthem was thus described by the President himself: "Chase and Stanton hadaccompanied me to Fortress Monroe. While we were there, an expeditionwas fitted out for an attack on Norfolk. Chase and General Wooldisappeared about the time we began to look for tidings of the result,and after vainly waiting their return till late in the evening, Stantonand I concluded to retire. My room was on the second floor of theCommandant's house, and Stanton's was below. The night was verywarm,--the moon shining brightly,--and, too restless to sleep, I sat forsome time by the table, reading. Suddenly hearing footsteps, I lookedout of the window, and saw two persons approaching, whom I knew by theirrelative size to be the missing men. They came into the passage, and Iheard them rap at Stanton's door and tell him to get up and comeupstairs. A moment afterward they entered my room. 'No time forceremony, Mr. President,' said General Wool; 'Norfolk is ours!' Stantonhere burst in, just out of bed, clad in a long night-gown which nearlyswept the floor, his ear catching, as he crossed the threshold, Wool'slast words. Perfectly overjoyed, he rushed at the General, whom hehugged most affectionately, fairly lifting him from the floor in hisdelight. The scene altogether must have been a comical one, though atthe time we were all too greatly excited to take much note of mereappearances."Lincoln's general grasp of military strategy, and his keen understandingof the specific problems confronting the Army of the Potomac in thecritical autumn of 1862, are well indicated in the followingcommunication to General McClellan:     EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,     October 13, 1862     MY DEAR SIR:--You remember my speaking to you of what I called your     over-cautiousness. Are you not over-cautious when you assume that     you cannot do what the enemy is constantly doing? Should you not     claim to be at least his equal in prowess, and act upon the claim?     As I understand, you telegraphed General Halleck that you cannot     subsist your army at Winchester unless the railroad from Harper's     Ferry to that point be put in working order. But the enemy does now     subsist his army at Winchester, at a distance nearly twice as great     from railroad transportation as you would have to do, without the     railroad last named. He now wagons from Culpepper Court-House,     which is just about twice as far as you would have to do from     Harper's Ferry. He is certainly not more than half as well provided     with wagons as you are. I certainly should be pleased for you to     have the advantage of the railroad from Harper's Ferry to     Winchester; but it wastes all the remainder of autumn to give it to     you, and, in fact, ignores the question of _time_, which cannot and     must not be ignored.     Again, one of the standard maxims of war, as you know, is, "to     operate upon the enemy's communications as much as possible,     without exposing your own." You seem to act as if this applies     _against_ you, but cannot apply in your _favor_. Change positions     with the enemy, and think you not he would break your communication     with Richmond within the next twenty-four hours? You dread his     going into Pennsylvania. But if he does so in full force, he gives     up his communications to you absolutely, and you have nothing to do     but to follow and ruin him; if he does so with less than full     force, fall upon and beat what is left behind all the easier.     Exclusive of the water line, you are now nearer Richmond than the     enemy is, by the route that you _can_ and he _must_ take. Why can     you not reach there before him, unless you admit that he is more     than your equal on the march? His route is the _arc_ of a circle,     while yours is the _chord_. The roads are as good on yours as on     his.     You know I desired, but did not order, you to cross the Potomac     below instead of above the Shenandoah and Blue Ridge. My idea was,     that this would at once menace the enemy's communications, which I     would seize if he would permit. If he should move northward, I     would follow him closely, holding his communications. If he should     prevent our seizing his communications, and move toward Richmond, I     would press closely to him, fight him if a favorable opportunity     should present, and at least try to beat him to Richmond on the     inside track. I say "try," for if we never try, we shall never     succeed. If he make a stand at Winchester, moving neither north nor     south, I would fight him there, on the idea that if we cannot beat     him when he bears the wastage of coming to us, we never can when we     bear the wastage of going to him. This proposition is a simple     truth, and is too important to be lost sight of for a moment. In     coming to us, he tenders us an advantage which we should not waive.     We should not so operate as to merely drive him away. As we must     beat him somewhere, or fail finally, we can do it, if at all,     easier near to us than far away. If we cannot beat the enemy where     he now is, we never can, he again being within the intrenchments of     Richmond. Recurring to the idea of going to Richmond on the inside     track, the facility of supplying from the side away from the enemy     is remarkable, as it were, by the different spokes of a wheel,     extending from the hub toward the rim, and this whether you move     directly by the chord, or on the inside arc, hugging the Blue Ridge     more closely. The chord-line, as you see, carries you by Aldie,     Haymarket, and Fredericksburg, and you see how turnpikes,     railroads, and finally the Potomac by Aquia Creek, meet you at all     points from Washington. The same, only the lines lengthened a     little, if you press closer to the Blue Ridge part of the way. The     gaps through the Blue Ridge I understand to be about the following     distances from Harper's Ferry, to wit: Vestal's, five miles;     Gregory's, thirteen; Snicker's, eighteen; Ashby's, twenty-eight;     Manassas, thirty-eight; Chester, forty-five; and Thornton's,     fifty-three. I should think it preferable to take the route nearest     the enemy, disabling him to make an important move without your     knowledge, and compelling him to keep his forces together for dread     of you. The gaps would enable you to attack if you should wish. For     a great part of the way you would be practically between the enemy     and both Washington and Richmond, enabling us to spare you the     greatest number of troops from here. When, at length, running to     Richmond ahead of him enables him to move this way, if he does so,     turn and attack him in the rear. But I think he should be engaged     long before such point is reached. It is all easy if our troops     march as well as the enemy, and it is unmanly to say they cannot do     it. This letter is in no sense an order.     Yours truly, A. LINCOLN.     MAJOR-GENERAL MCCLELLAN.Throughout the entire war President Lincoln was always keenly solicitousfor the welfare of the Union soldiers. He knew that upon them everythingdepended; and he felt bound to them not only by official relations, butby the tenderer ties of human interest and love. In all hisproclamations and public utterances he gave the fullest credit to thebrave men in the field, and claimed for them the country's thanks andgratitude. His sympathy for the soldiers was as tender as that of awoman, and his tears were ever ready to start at the mention of theirhardships, their bravery, their sufferings and losses. Nothing that hecould do was left undone to minister to their comfort in field or campor hospital. His most exacting cares were never permitted to divert histhoughts from them, and his anxious and tender sympathy included allwhom they held dear. Said Mr. Riddle, in a speech in Congress in 1863:"Let not the distant mother, who has given up a loved one to fearfuldeath, think that the President does not sympathize with her sorrow, andwould not have been glad--oh, how glad--to so shape events as to sparethe sacrifices. And let not fathers and mothers and wives anywhere thinkthat as he sees the long blue regiments of brave ones marching away,stepping to the drum-beat, he does not contemplate them and feel hisresponsibility as he thinks how many of them shall go to namelessgraves, unmarked save by the down-looking eyes of God's pitying angels."The feeling of the soldiers toward Lincoln was one of filial respect andlove. He was not only the President, the commander-in-chief of all thearmies and navies of the United States, but their good "Father Abraham,"who loved every man, even the humblest, that wore the Union blue.Of Lincoln's personal relations with the soldiers, enough interestinganecdotes could be collected to fill a volume. He saw much of them inWashington, as they marched through that city on their way to the front,or returned on furlough or discharge, or filled the overcrowdedhospitals of the capital. Often they called upon him, singly or withcompanions; and he always had for them a word, however brief, ofsympathy and cheer. He was always glad to see them at the White House.They were the one class of visitors who seldom came to ask for favors,and never to pester him with advice. It was a real treat for the harriedPresident to escape from the politicians and have a quiet talk with aprivate soldier. Among the innumerable petitioners for executiveclemency or favor, none were so graciously received as those whoappeared in behalf of soldiers. It was half a victory to say that theperson for whom the favor was desired was a member of the Union army.As he wrote the pardon of a young soldier, sentenced to be shot forsleeping while on sentinel duty, the President remarked to a friendstanding by: "I could not think of going into eternity with the blood ofthat poor young man on my hands. It is not to be wondered at that a boyraised on a farm, probably in the habit of going to bed at dark, should,when required to watch, fall asleep; and I cannot consent that he beshot for such an act." The youth thus reprieved was afterwards foundamong the slain on the field of Fredericksburg, with a photograph ofLincoln, on which he had written, "God bless President Lincoln," wornnext his heart.Rev. Newman Hall, of London, has repeated in a sermon an anecdote toldhim by a Union general. "The first week of my command," said theofficer, "there were twenty-four deserters sentenced by court martial tobe shot, and the warrants for their execution were sent to the Presidentto be signed. He refused. I went to Washington and had an interview. Isaid: 'Mr. President, unless these men are made an example of, the armyitself is in danger. Mercy to the few is cruelty to the many.' Hereplied: 'Mr. General, there are already too many weeping widows in theUnited States. For God's sake, don't ask me to add to the number, for _Iwon't do it_.'"It came to the knowledge of Lincoln that a widow living in Boston--aMrs. Bixby--had lost five sons in the service of their country. Withoutdelay he addressed to the bereaved mother the following touching note:     I have been shown on the file of the War Department a statement of     the Adjutant-General of Massachusetts, that you are the mother of     five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. I feel     how weak and fruitless must be any word of mine which should     attempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming;     but I cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may     be found in the thanks of the Republic they died to save. I pray     that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your     bereavements, and leave only the cherished memory of the loved and     lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so     costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.     Yours, very sincerely and respectfully,     A. LINCOLN.A case of unusual interest is that of Cyrus Pringle, a Vermont Quakerwho was drafted into the military service in 1863, and refused to serveon the ground that his religion and his conscience would not permit himto bear arms. His story, as recorded in his diary, was given to theworld after his death ("Atlantic Monthly," February, 1913). In spite ofhis protests, Pringle was taken South and forced to wear a uniform andcarry a gun, though he refused to use it or even to clean it. Hisobstinacy, as it was supposed to be, caused him much suffering,sometimes even physical punishment, all of which he bore patiently,believing that if he was steadfast in his faith relief would somehowcome. It did come, but not until--after five months of hardship anddistress of mind and body--his case, with that of other Quakers, finallyreached the President. "I want you to go and tell Stanton," said Lincolnto the gentleman who had presented the case to him, "that it is my wishthat all those young men be sent home at once." The gentleman went toStanton with the message, but Stanton was unwilling to obey it. Whilethey were arguing the matter, the President entered the room. "_It is myurgent wish_," said he. Stanton yielded, and the unfortunate Quakerswere given permission to return to their homes--none too soon to savethe life of Pringle, who records in his diary: "Upon my arrival in NewYork I was seized with delirium, from which I only recovered after manyweeks, through the mercy and favor of Him who in all this trial had beenour guide and strength and comfort."Anything that savored of the wit and humor of the soldiers wasespecially relished by Lincoln. Any incident that showed that "the boys"were mirthful and jolly amidst their privations seemed to commend itselfto him. There was a story of a soldier in the Army of the Potomac,carried to the rear of battle with both legs shot off, who, seeing apie-woman hovering about, asked, "Say, old lady, are them pies _sewed_or _pegged_?" And there was another one of a soldier at the battle ofChancellorsville, whose regiment, waiting to be called into the fight,was taking coffee. The hero of the story put to his lips a crockery mugwhich he had carried, with infinite care, through several campaigns. Astray bullet, just missing the coffee-drinker's head, dashed the muginto fragments and left only its handle on his finger. Turning his headin that direction, the soldier angrily growled, "Johnny, you can't dothat again!" Lincoln, relating these two stories together, said, "Itseems as if neither death nor danger could quench the grim humor of theAmerican soldier."A juvenile "brigadier" from New York, with a small detachment ofcavalry, having imprudently gone within the rebel lines near FairfaxCourt House, was captured by "guerillas." Upon the fact being reportedto Lincoln, he said that he was very sorry to lose the horses. "What doyou mean?" inquired his informant. "Why," rejoined the President, "I canmake a 'brigadier' any day; but those horses cost the government ahundred and twenty-five dollars a head!"Lincoln was especially fond of a joke at the expense of some highmilitary or civil dignitary. He was intensely amused by a story told bySecretary Stanton, of a trip made by him and General Foster up theBroad river in North Carolina, in a tug-boat, when, reaching ouroutposts on the river bank, a Federal picket yelled out, "Who have yougot on board that tug?" The severe and dignified answer was, "TheSecretary of War and Major-General Foster." Instantly the picket roaredback: "We've got Major-Generals enough up here--_why don't you bring usup some hardtack?_"On one occasion, when the enemy were threatening the defenses ofWashington, the President made a personal visit to the men in thetrenches, for the purpose, as he stated, of "encouraging the boys." Hewalked about among them, telling them to hold their ground and he wouldsoon give them reinforcements. His presence had a most inspiring effect,and the trenches were held by a few hundred soldiers of the InvalidCorps until the promised help came and the enemy withdrew.On a visit to City Point, Lincoln called upon the head surgeon at thatplace and said he wished to visit all the hospitals under his charge.The surgeon asked if he knew what he was undertaking; there were five orsix thousand soldiers at that place, and it would be quite a tax uponhis strength to visit all the wards. Lincoln answered, with a smile,that he guessed he was equal to the task; at any rate he would try, andgo as far as he could; he should never, probably, see the boys again,and he wanted them to know that he appreciated what they had done fortheir country. Finding it useless to try to dissuade him, the surgeonbegan his rounds with the President, who walked from bed to bed,extending his hand and saying a few words of sympathy to some, makingkind inquiries of others, and welcomed by all with the heartiestcordiality. After some hours the tour of the various hospitals was made,and Lincoln returned with the surgeon to his office. They had scarcelyentered, however, when a messenger came saying that one ward had beenoverlooked, and "the boys" wanted to see the President. The surgeon, whowas thoroughly tired, and knew Lincoln must be, tried to dissuade himfrom going; but the good man said he must go back; "the boys" would beso disappointed. So he went with the messenger, accompanied by thesurgeon, shook hands with the gratified soldiers, and then returned tothe office. The surgeon expressed the fear that the President's armwould be lamed with so much hand-shaking, saying that it certainly mustache. Lincoln smiled, and saying something about his "strong muscles,"stepped out at the open door, took up a very large heavy axe which laythere by a log of wood, and chopped vigorously for a few moments,sending the chips flying in all directions; and then, pausing, heextended his right arm to its full length, holding the axe outhorizontally, without its even quivering as he held it. Strong men wholooked on--men accustomed to manual labor--could not hold the axe inthat position for a moment.In summer Lincoln's favorite home was at "The Soldiers' Rest," a place afew miles out of Washington, on the Maryland side, where old anddisabled soldiers of the regular army found a refuge. It was a lovelyspot, situated on a beautifully wooded hill, reached by a winding road,shaded by thick-set branches. On his way there he often passed longlines of ambulances, laden with the suffering victims of a recentbattle. A friend who met him on such an occasion, says: "When I met thePresident, his attitude and expression spoke the deepest sadness. Hepaused, and, pointing his hand-towards the wounded men, he said: 'Lookyonder at those poor fellows. I cannot bear it! This suffering, thisloss of life, is dreadful!' Recalling a letter he had written yearsbefore to a suffering friend whose grief he had sought to console, Ireminded him of the incident, and asked him: 'Do you remember writing toyour sorrowing friend these words: "And this too shall pass away. Neverfear. Victory will come."' 'Yes,' replied he, '_victory will come, butit comes slowly_.'"CHAPTER XX     Lincoln and McClellan--The Peninsular Campaign of 1862--Impatience     with McClellan's Delay--Lincoln Defends McClellan from Unjust     Criticism--Some Harrowing Experiences--McClellan Recalled from the     Peninsula--His Troops Given to General Pope--Pope's Defeat at     Manassas--A Critical Situation--McClellan again in Command--Lincoln     Takes the Responsibility--McClellan's Account of his     Reinstatement--The Battle of Antietam--The President     Vindicated--Again Dissatisfied with McClellan--Visits the Army in     the Field--The President in the Saddle--Correspondence between     Lincoln and McClellan--McClellan's Final Removal--Lincoln's     Summing-up of McClellan--McClellan's "Body-guard."President Lincoln's relations with no other person have been so muchdiscussed as those with General McClellan. Volumes have been written onthis subject; many heated and intemperate words have been uttered andwrong conclusions reached. Whatever defects may have marked McClellan'squalities as a soldier, he must remain historically one of the mostconspicuous figures of the war. He organized the largest and mostimportant of the Union armies, and was its first commander in the field.He was one of the two out of the five commanders of the Army of thePotomac, before Grant, who led that army to victory; the other threehaving led it only to disastrous defeat. Great things were expected ofhim; and when he failed to realize the extravagant expectations of thosewho thought the war should be ended within a year, he received equallyextravagant condemnation. It is noticeable that this condemnation camechiefly from civilians--from politicians, from Congress, from the press:not the best judges of military affairs. His own army--the men who werewith him on the battlefield and risked their lives and their cause underhis leadership--never lost faith in him. Of all the commanders of theArmy of the Potomac, he was the one most believed in by his troops. Evenafter his removal, at a grand review of the army by the President, afterthe battle of Fredericksburg, it was not for the new commander,Burnside, but the old commander, McClellan, that the troops gave theirheartiest cheers. It is worth remembering also that the war was notended until two and a half years after McClellan's retirement, and untiltrial after trial had been made and failure after failure had been metin the effort to find a successful leader for our armies. The initialtask of organization, of creating a great army in the field, fell uponhim--a task so well performed that General Meade, his first efficientsuccessor, said, "Had there been no McClellan there could have been noGrant, for the army [organization] made no essential improvements underany of his successors." And Grant, the last and finally victorious ofthese successors--who was at one time criticized as being "as great adiscouragement as McClellan"--recorded in his Memoirs the conviction(already quoted in these pages) that the conditions under whichMcClellan worked were fatal to success, and that he himself could nothave succeeded in his place under those conditions.It is not in the province of the present narrative to enter into aconsideration of the merits or demerits of McClellan as a soldier, butto treat of his personal relations with President Lincoln. Between thetwo men, notwithstanding many sharp differences of opinion and ofpolicy, there seems to have been a feeling of warm personal friendshipand sincere respect. Now that both have passed beyond the reach ofearthly praise or blame, we may well honor their memory and credit eachwith having done the best he could to serve his country.McClellan was appointed to the command of the Union armies upon theretirement of the veteran General Scott, in November of 1861. He hadbeen but a captain in the regular army, but his high reputation andbrilliant soldierly qualities had led to his being sent abroad to studythe organization and movements of European armies; and this brought himinto prominence as a military man. It was soon after McClellan tookcommand that President Lincoln began giving close personal attention tothe direction of military affairs. He formed a plan of operationsagainst the Confederate army defending Richmond, which differed entirelyfrom the plan proposed by McClellan. The President's plan was, ineffect, to repeat the Bull Run expedition by moving against the enemy inVirginia at or hear Manassas. McClellan preferred a transference of thearmy to the region of the lower Chesapeake, thence moving up thePeninsula by the shortest land route to Richmond. (This was a movement,it may be remarked, which was finally carried out before Richmond fellin 1865.) The President discussed the relative merits of the two plansin the following frank and explicit letter to McClellan:     EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.C.,     February 3, 1862.     MAJOR-GENERAL MCCLELLAN.     MY DEAR SIR: You and I have distinct and different plans for a     movement of the Army of the Potomac; yours to be done by the     Chesapeake, up the Rappahannock to Urbana, and across to the     terminus of the railroad on the York river; mine to move directly     to a point on the railroad southwest of Manassas. If you will give     me satisfactory answers to the following questions, I shall gladly     yield my plan to yours:     1st. Does your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure of _time_     and _money_ than mine?     2d. Wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than mine?     3d. Wherein is a victory _more valuable_ by your plan than mine?     4th. In fact, would it not be _less_ valuable in this, that it     would break no great line of the enemy's communication, while mine     would?     5th. In case of a disaster, would not a retreat be more difficult     by your plan than mine?     Yours truly, ABRAHAM LINCOLN.To this communication McClellan made an elaborate reply, discussing thesituation very fully, and answering the inquiries apparently to thesatisfaction of the President, who consented to the plan submitted byMcClellan and concurred in by a council of his division commanders, bywhich the base of the Army of the Potomac should be transferred fromWashington to the lower Chesapeake. Yet Lincoln must have had misgivingsin the matter, for some weeks later he wrote to McClellan: "You will dome the justice to remember I always insisted that going down the bay insearch of a field, instead of fighting at or near Manassas, was onlyshifting, and not surmounting, a difficulty; that we would find the sameenemy, and the same or equal intrenchments, at either place."After the transfer of the Army of the Potomac to the Peninsula there wasgreat impatience at the delays in the expected advance on Richmond. ThePresident shared this impatience, and his despatches to McClellan tookan urgent and imperative though always friendly tone. April 9 he wrote:"Your despatches, complaining that you are not properly sustained, whilethey do not offend me, do pain me very much. I suppose the whole forcewhich has gone forward for you is with you by this time. And, if so, Ithink it is the precise time for you to _strike a blow_. By delay, theenemy will relatively gain upon you--that is, he will gain faster byfortifications and reinforcements than you can by reinforcements alone.And once more let me tell you, it is indispensable to you that you_strike a blow_.... I beg to assure you that I have never written to youor spoken to you in greater kindness of feeling than now, nor with afuller purpose to sustain you, so far as, in my most anxious judgment, Iconsistently can. But you _must act_."While Lincoln was thus imperative toward McClellan, he would not permithim to be unjustly criticized. Considerable ill-feeling having beendeveloped between McClellan and Secretary Stanton, which was made worseby certain meddlesome persons in Washington, the President tookoccasion, at a public meeting, to express his views in these frank andmanly words: "There has been a very wide-spread attempt to have aquarrel between General McClellan and the Secretary of War. Now, Ioccupy a position that enables me to observe that these two gentlemenare not nearly so deep in the quarrel as some pretending to be theirfriends. General McClellan's attitude is such that, in the veryselfishness of his nature, he cannot but wish to be successful, as Ihope he will be; and the Secretary of War is in precisely the samesituation. If the military commanders in the field cannot be successful,not only the Secretary of War but myself, for the time being the masterof them both, cannot but be failures. I know General McClellan wishes tobe successful, and I know he does not wish it any more than theSecretary of War wishes it for him, and both of them together no morethan I wish it. Sometimes we have a dispute about how many men GeneralMcClellan has had, and those who would disparage him say he has had avery large number, and those who would disparage the Secretary of Warinsist that General McClellan has had a very small number. The basis forthis is, there is always a wide difference, and on this occasion perhapsa wider one than usual, between the grand total on McClellan's rolls andthe men actually fit for duty; and those who would disparage him talk ofthe grand total on paper, and those who would disparage the Secretary ofWar talk of those at present fit for duty. General McClellan hassometimes asked for things that the Secretary of War did not give him.General McClellan is not to blame for asking what he wanted and needed,and the Secretary of War is not to blame for not giving when he had noneto give."The summer of 1862 was a sad one for the country, and peculiarly sad forLincoln. The Army of the Potomac fought battle after battle, often withtemporary successes, but without apparent substantial results; whilemany thousands of our brave soldiers perished on the field, or filledthe hospitals from the fever-swamps of the Chickahominy. The terriblerealities of that dreadful summer, and their strain on Lincoln, are wellshown in the following incident: Colonel Scott, of a New Hampshireregiment, had been ill, and his wife nursed him in the hospital. Afterhis convalescence, he received leave of absence, and started for home;but by a steamboat collision in Hampton Roads, his noble wife wasdrowned. Colonel Scott reached Washington, and learning, a few dayslater, of the recovery of his wife's body, he requested permission ofthe Secretary of War to return for it. A great battle was imminent, andthe request was denied. Colonel Scott thereupon sought the President. Itwas Saturday evening; and Lincoln, worn with the cares and anxieties ofthe week, sat alone in his room, coat thrown off, and seemingly lost inthought, perhaps pondering the issue of the coming battle. Silently helistened to Colonel Scott's sad story; then, with an unusual irritation,which was probably a part of his excessive weariness, he exclaimed: "AmI to have no rest? Is there no hour or spot when or where I may escapethese constant calls? Why do you follow me here with such business asthis? Why do you not go to the War-office, where they have charge of allthis matter of papers and transportation?" Colonel Scott told of Mr.Stanton's refusal; and the President continued: "Then probably you oughtnot to go down the river. Mr. Stanton knows all about the necessities ofthe hour; he knows what rules are necessary, and rules are made to beenforced. It would be wrong for me to override his rules and decisionsin cases of this kind; it might work disaster to important movements.And then, you ought to remember that I have other duties to attendto--heaven knows, enough for one man!--and I can give no thought toquestions of this kind. Why do you come here to appeal to my humanity?Don't you know that we are in the midst of war? That suffering and deathpress upon all of us? That works of humanity and affection, which wewould cheerfully perform in days of peace, are all trampled upon andoutlawed by war? That there is no room left for them? There is but oneduty now--_to fight_. The only call of humanity now is to conquer peacethrough unrelenting warfare. War, and war alone, is the duty of all ofus. Your wife might have trusted you to the care which the Governmenthas provided for its sick soldiers. At any rate, you must not vex mewith your family troubles. Why, every family in the land is crushed withsorrow; but they must not each come to me for help. I have all theburden I can carry. Go to the War Department. Your business belongsthere. If they cannot help you, then bear your burden, as we all must,until this war is over. Everything must yield to the paramount duty offinishing the war." Colonel Scott withdrew, crushed and overwhelmed. Thenext morning, as he sat in his hotel pondering upon his troubles, heheard a rap at his door, and opening it found to his surprise thePresident standing before him. Grasping his hands impulsively andsympathetically, Lincoln broke out: "My dear Colonel, I was a brute lastnight. I have no excuse for my conduct. Indeed, I was weary to the lastextent; but I had no right to treat a man with rudeness who had offeredhis life for his country, much more a man who came to me in greataffliction. I have had a regretful night, and come now to beg yourforgiveness." He added that he had just seen Secretary Stanton, and allthe details were arranged for sending the Colonel down the Potomac andrecovering the body; then, taking him in his carriage, he drove to thesteamer's wharf, where, again pressing his hand, he wished him God-speedon his sad errand.Such were Lincoln's harrowing experiences; and thus did his noble andsympathetic nature assert itself over his momentary weakness anddepression.In August of 1862 General McClellan was ordered to withdraw his armyfrom the Peninsula. "With a heavy heart," says McClellan, "Irelinquished the position gained at the cost of so much time and blood."Without being removed from his command, his troops were taken away fromhim and sent to join General Pope, who had been placed in command of aconsiderable force in Virginia, for the purpose of trying thePresident's favorite plan of an advance on Richmond by way of Manassas.Either from a confusion of orders or a lack of zeal in executing them,the Union forces failed to co-operate; and Pope's expected victory(Manassas, August 30) proved a disastrous and humiliating defeat. Hisarmy was beaten and driven back on Washington in a rout little lessdisgraceful than that of Bull Run a year before. This battle came to beknown as the "Second Bull Run."Thus the autumn of 1862 set in amidst gloom, disorder, and dismay. Ourarmies in and around the national capital were on the defensive; whilethe victorious Lee, following up his successes at Manassas, was invadingMaryland and threatening Washington and the North. The President wasanxious; the Cabinet and Congress were alarmed. The troops had lostconfidence in General Pope, and there was practically no one in chiefcommand. The situation was most critical; but Lincoln faced it, as healways did, unflinchingly. He took what he felt to be the wisest and atthe same time the most unpopular step possible under the circumstances:he placed McClellan in command of all the troops in and aroundWashington. It was a bold act, and required no ordinary amount of moralcourage and self-reliance. Outside the army, it was about the mostunpopular thing that could have been done. McClellan was disliked by allthe members of the Cabinet and prominent officials, and with especialbitterness by Secretary Stanton. Secretary Welles speaks, in his Diary,of "Stanton's implacable hostility to McClellan," and records his beliefthat "Stanton is determined to destroy McClellan." Welles relates thaton the very day of Pope's defeat at Manassas, Secretary Stanton,accompanied by Secretary Chase, called on him and asked him to join insigning a communication to the President demanding McClellan's immediatedismissal from command of the Army of the Potomac, saying all themembers of the Cabinet would sign it. The document was in Stanton'shandwriting. Welles, though far from friendly toward McClellan, refusedto sign the paper, and the matter was dropped. Welles adds the comment,"There was a fixed determination to remove, and, if possible, todisgrace, McClellan."When it was rumored in Washington that McClellan was to be reinstated,everyone was thunderstruck. A Cabinet meeting was held on the second dayof September, at which the President, without asking anyone's opinion,announced that he had reinstated McClellan. Regret and surprise wereopenly expressed. Mr. Stanton, with some excitement, remarked that nosuch order had issued from the War Department. The President then said,with great calmness, "No, Mr. Secretary, _the order was mine, and I willbe responsible for it to the country_." He added, by way of explanation,that, with a retreating and demoralized army tumbling in upon thecapital, and alarm and panic in the community, something had to be done,and as there did not appear to be anyone else to do it he took theresponsibility on himself. He remarked that McClellan had the confidenceof the troops beyond any other officer, and could, under thecircumstances, more speedily and effectually reorganize them and putthem in fighting trim than any other general. "This is what is nowwanted most," said he, "and these were my reasons for placing McClellanin command."Perhaps at no other crisis of the war did Lincoln's strength ofcharacter and power of making quick and important decisions in the faceof general opposition, come out more clearly than on this occasion.Secretary Welles, who was present at the dramatic and stormy Cabinetmeeting referred to, says: "In stating what he had done, the Presidentwas deliberate, but firm and decisive. His language and manner were kindand affectionate, especially toward two of the members, who were greatlydisturbed; but every person present felt that he was truly the chief,and every one knew his decision was as fixed and unalterable as ifgiven out with the imperious command and determined will of AndrewJackson. A long discussion followed, closing with acquiescence in thedecision of the President. In this instance the President, unaided byothers, put forth with firmness and determination the executivewill--the _one-man_ power--against the temporary general sense of thecommunity, as well as of his Cabinet, two of whom, it has been generallysupposed, had with him an influence almost as great as the Secretary ofState. They had been ready to make issue and resign their places unlessMcClellan was dismissed; but knowing their opposition, and in spite ofit and of the general dissatisfaction in the community, the Presidenthad in that perilous moment exalted him to new and important trusts."It appears from the statement of General McClellan, made shortly beforehis death, that on the morning of his reinstatement (before the Cabinetmeeting just described) the President visited him at his headquarters,near Washington, to ask if he would again assume command. "While atbreakfast, at an early hour," says McClellan, "I received a call fromthe President, accompanied by General Halleck. The President informed methat Colonel Kelton had returned and represented the condition ofaffairs as much worse than I had stated to Halleck on the previous day;that there were 30,000 stragglers on the roads; that the army wasentirely defeated and falling back to Washington in confusion. He thensaid that he regarded Washington as lost, and asked me if I would, underthe circumstances, consent to accept command of all the forces. Withouta moment's hesitation, and without making any conditions whatever, I atonce said that I would accept the command, and would stake my life thatI would save the city. Both the President and Halleck again assertedtheir belief that it was impossible to save the city, and I repeated myfirm conviction that I could and would save it. They then left, thePresident verbally placing me in entire command of the city and of thetroops falling back upon it from the front."The result of the reappointment of McClellan soon vindicated the wisdomof the step. He possessed the confidence of the army beyond any othergeneral at that time, and was able to inspire it with renewed hope andcourage. Leaving Washington on the 7th of September, in command ofPope's beaten and disintegrated forces which he had to reorganize on themarch, he within two weeks met the flushed and lately victorious troopsof Lee and Jackson and fought the bloody but successful battle ofAntietam (September 17, 1862), which compelled Lee to retreat to thesouthern side of the Potomac, and relieved Washington of any immediatedanger.After the Antietam campaign, the Army of the Potomac rested awhile fromits exhausting and disorganizing labors. Supplies and reinforcementswere necessary before resuming active operations. This delay gave riseto no little dissatisfaction in Washington, where a clamor arose thatMcClellan should have followed up his successes at Antietam byimmediately pursuing Lee into Virginia. In this dissatisfaction thePresident shared to some extent. He made a personal visit to the armyfor the purpose of satisfying himself of its condition. Of this occasionMcClellan says: "On the first day of October, his Excellency thePresident honored the Army of the Potomac with a visit, and remainedseveral days, during which he went through the different encampments,reviewed the troops, and went over the battle-field of South Mountainand Antietam. I had the opportunity, during this visit, to describe tohim the operations of the army since it left Washington, and gave himmy reasons for not following the enemy after he recrossed the Potomac."Before the grand review that was to be made by the President, some ofMcClellan's staff, knowing that the General was a man of great enduranceand expertness in the saddle, laughed at the idea of Lincoln'sattempting to keep up with him in the severe ordeal of "riding down thelines." "They rather hinted," says a narrator, "that the General wouldmove somewhat rapidly, to test Mr. Lincoln's capacity as a rider. Therewere those on the field, however, who had seen Mr. Lincoln in the saddlein Illinois; and they were confident of his staying powers. A splendidblack horse, very spirited, was selected for the President to ride. Whenthe time came, Mr. Lincoln walked up to the animal, and the instant heseized the bridle to mount, it was evident to horsemen that he 'knew hisbusiness.' He had the animal in hand at once. No sooner was he in thesaddle than the coal-black steed began to prance and whirl and dance asif he was proud of his burden. But the President sat as unconcerned andfixed to the saddle as if he and the horse were one. The test ofendurance soon came. McClellan, with his magnificent staff, approachedthe President, who joined them, and away they dashed to a distant partof the field. The artillery began to thunder, the drums beat, and thebands struck up 'Hail to the Chief,' while the troops cheered. Mr.Lincoln, holding the bridle-rein in one hand, lifted his tall hat fromhis head, and much of the time held it in the other hand. Grandly didLincoln receive the salute, appearing as little disturbed by the dashingmovements of the proud-spirited animal as if he had passed through suchan ordeal with the same creature many times before. Next came a furthertest of endurance--a long dash over very rough untraveled ground, withhere and there a ditch or a hole to be jumped or a siding to be passed.But Mr. Lincoln kept well up to McClellan, who made good time. Finally,the 'riding down the lines' was performed, amidst the flaunting ofstandards, the beating of drums, the loud cheering of the men and rapiddischarges of artillery, startling even the best-trained horses. Lincolnsat easily to the end, when he wheeled his horse into position towitness the vast columns march in review. McClellan was surprised at soremarkable a display of horsemanship. Mr. Lincoln was a great lover ofthe horse, and a skilled rider. His awkwardness of form did not show inthe saddle. He always looked well when mounted."After the President's return to Washington he began urging McClellan toresume active operations; desiring him to "cross the Potomac, and givebattle to the enemy or drive him south." On the 13th of October headdressed to him the long letter quoted at the end of the precedingchapter. Subsequent communications from the President to McClellanshowed more and more impatience. On the 25th he telegraphed: "I havejust read your despatch about sore-tongue and fatigued horses. Will youpardon me for asking what the horses of your army have done since thebattle of Antietam that fatigues anything?" And the next day, afterreceiving McClellan's answer to his inquiry, he responded: "Mostcertainly I intend no injustice to anyone, and if I have done any Ideeply regret it. To be told, after more than five weeks' total inactionof the army, and during which period we had sent to that army everyfresh horse we possibly could, amounting in the whole to 7,918, that thecavalry horses were too much fatigued to move, presented a verycheerless, almost hopeless, prospect for the future, and it may haveforced something of impatience into my despatches. If not recruited andrested then, when could they ever be? _I suppose the river is rising,and I am glad to believe you, are crossing._" But McClellan did notcross; his preparations for a new campaign were not yet complete; andthe President, at last losing patience, removed him from command, andput Burnside in his place, November 5, 1862. And a disastrous step thisproved to be. Burnside was under peremptory orders from Washington tomove immediately against the Confederate forces. The result was theill-advised attack upon Fredericksburg (December 12, 1862) andBurnside's bloody repulse. The movement was made against the judgment ofthe army officers then, and has been generally condemned by militarycritics since. Secretary Welles thus guardedly commented upon it in hisDiary: "It appears to me a mistake to fight the enemy in so strong aposition. They have selected their own ground, and we meet them there."But it was McClellan's unwillingness to do the very thing that Burnsideis censured for having done, and that proved so overwhelming a disaster,that was the occasion for McClellan's removal.A good illustration of Lincoln's disappointed, perhaps unreasonable,state of mind before McClellan's removal is furnished by Hon. O.M.Hatch, a former Secretary of State of Illinois and an old friend ofLincoln's. Mr. Hatch relates that a short time before McClellan'sremoval from command he went with President Lincoln to visit the army,still near Antietam. They reached Antietam late in the afternoon of avery hot day, and were assigned a special tent for their occupancyduring the night. "Early next morning," says Mr. Hatch, "I was awakenedby Mr. Lincoln. It was very early--daylight was just lighting theeast--the soldiers were all asleep in their tents. Scarce a sound couldbe heard except the notes of early birds, and the farm-yard voices fromdistant farms. Lincoln said to me, 'Come, Hatch, I want you to take awalk with me.' His tone was serious and impressive. I arose without aword, and as soon as we were dressed we left the tent together. He ledme about the camp, and then we walked upon the surrounding hillsoverlooking the great city of white tents and sleeping soldiers. Verylittle was spoken between us, beyond a few words as to the pleasantnessof the morning or similar casual observations. Lincoln seemed to bepeculiarly serious, and his quiet, abstract way affected me also. It didnot seem a time to speak. We walked slowly and quietly, meeting here andthere a guard, our thoughts leading us to reflect on that wonderfulsituation. A nation in peril--the whole world looking at America--amillion men in arms--the whole machinery of war engaged throughout thecountry, while I stood by that kind-hearted, simple-minded man who mightbe regarded as the Director-General, looking at the beautiful sunriseand the magnificent scene before us. Nothing was to be said, nothingneeded to be said. Finally, reaching a commanding point where almostthat entire camp could be seen--the men were just beginning theirmorning duties, and evidences of life and activity were becomingapparent--we involuntarily stopped. The President, waving his handtowards the scene before us, and leaning towards me, said in an almostwhispering voice: 'Hatch--Hatch, what is all this?' 'Why, Mr. Lincoln,'said I, 'this is the Army of the Potomac' He hesitated a moment, andthen, straightening up, said in a louder tone: 'No, Hatch, no. This is_General McClellan's body-guard_.' Nothing more was said. We walked toour tent, and the subject was not alluded to again."CHAPTER XXI     Lincoln and Slavery--Plan for Gradual Emancipation--Anti-slavery     Legislation in 1862--Pressure Brought to Bear on the Executive--The     Delegation of Quakers--A Visit from Chicago Clergymen--Interview     between Lincoln and Channing--Lincoln and Horace Greeley--The     President's Answer to "The Prayer of Twenty Millions of     People"--Conference between Lincoln and Greeley--Emancipation     Resolved on--The Preliminary Proclamation--Lincoln's Account of     It--Preparing for the Final Act--The Emancipation     Proclamation--Particulars of the Great Document--Fate of the     Original Draft--Lincoln's Outline of his Course and Views regarding     Slavery.The emancipation of slaves in America--the crowning act of Lincoln'seventful career and the one with which his fame is most indissolublylinked--is a subject of supreme interest in a study of his life andcharacter. For this great act all his previous life and training hadbeen but a preparation. From the first awakening of his convictions ofthe moral wrong of human slavery, through all his public and privateutterances, may be traced one logical and consistent development of theprinciples which at last found sublime expression in the Proclamation ofEmancipation. In this, as always, he was true to his own innerpromptings. He would not be hurried or worried or badgered intopremature and impracticable measures. He bided his time; and when thattime came the deed was done, unalterably and irrevocably: approved bythe logic of events, and by the enlightened conscience of the world.The final Emancipation Proclamation was issued on the first day ofJanuary, 1863. The various official measures that preceded it may bebriefly sketched, together with closely related incidents. As early asthe autumn of 1861 the problem of the relation of the war to slavery wasbrought forcibly to the President's attention by the action of GeneralJ.C. Fremont, the Union commander in Missouri, who issued an orderdeclaring the slaves of rebels in his department free. The order waspremature and unauthorized, and the President promptly annulled it.General Fremont was thus, in a sense, the pioneer in militaryemancipation; and he lived to see the policy proposed by him carriedinto practical operation by all our armies. Lincoln afterwards said: "Ihave great respect for General Fremont and his abilities, but the factis that the pioneer in any movement is not generally the best man tocarry that movement to a successful issue. It was so in old times; Mosesbegan the emancipation of the Jews, but didn't take Israel to thePromised Land after all. He had to make way for Joshua to complete thework. It looks as if the first reformer of a thing has to meet such ahard opposition and gets so battered and bespattered that afterward whenpeople find they have to accept his reform they will accept it moreeasily from another man."Lincoln at first favored a policy of gradual emancipation. In a specialmessage to Congress, on the 6th of March, 1862, he proposed such a planfor the abolition of slavery. "In my judgment," he remarked, "gradual,and not sudden, emancipation is better for all." He suggested toCongress the adoption of a joint resolution declaring "that the UnitedStates ought to co-operate with any State which may adopt a gradualabolition of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid to compensatefor the inconvenience, public and private, produced by such change ofsystem." In conclusion he urged: "In full view of my greatresponsibility to my God and to my country, I earnestly beg theattention of Congress and the people to this subject."On the 16th of April of this year, Congress passed a bill abolishingslavery in the District of Columbia--a measure for which Lincoln hadhimself introduced a bill while a member of Congress. In confirming theact as President, he remarked privately: "Little did I dream in 1849,when as a member of Congress I proposed to abolish slavery at thiscapital, and could scarcely get a hearing for the proposition, that itwould be so soon accomplished."Emancipation measures moved rapidly in 1862. On June 19 Congress enacteda measure prohibiting slavery forever in all present and futureterritories of the United States. July 17 a law was passed authorizingthe employment of negroes as soldiers, and conferring freedom on all whoshould render military service, and on the families of all such asbelonged to disloyal owners. Two days later, in a conference appointedby him at the Executive Mansion, the President submitted to the membersof Congress from the Border States a written appeal, in which he said:     Believing that you, in the border States, hold more power for good     than any other equal number of members, I feel it a duty which I     cannot justifiably waive, to make this appeal to you.... I intend     no reproach or complaint when I assure you that, in my opinion, if     you all had voted for the resolution in the gradual emancipation     message of last March, the war would now be substantially ended.     And the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most potent and     swift means of ending it. Let the States which are in rebellion see     definitely and certainly that in no event will the States you     represent ever join their proposed confederacy, and they cannot     much longer maintain the contest.... If the war continues long, as     it must if the object be not sooner attained, the institution in     your States will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion, by     the mere incidents of the war. It will be gone, and you will have     nothing valuable in lieu of it. Much of its value is gone already.     How much better for you and for your people to take the step which     at once shortens the war and secures substantial compensation for     that which is sure to be wholly lost in any other event! How much     better to thus save the money which else we sink forever in the     war! How much better to do it while we can, lest the war ere long     render us pecuniarily unable to do it! How much better for you as     seller, and the nation as buyer, to sell out and buy out that     without which the war could never have been, than to sink both the     thing to be sold and the price of it in cutting one another's     throats!... I do not speak of emancipation _at once_, but of a     _decision_ to emancipate _gradually_.... Upon these considerations     I have again begged your attention to the message of March last.     Before leaving the capital, consider and discuss it among     yourselves. You are patriots and statesmen, and as such I pray you     consider this proposition, and at the least commend it to the     consideration of your States and people. As you would perpetuate     popular government for the best people in the world, I beseech you     that you do in nowise omit this. Our common country is in great     peril, demanding the loftiest views and boldest action to bring a     speedy relief. Once relieved, its form of government is saved to     the world, its beloved history and cherished memories are     vindicated, and its happy future fully assured and rendered     inconceivably grand. To you, more than any others, the privilege is     given to assure that happiness and swell that grandeur, and to link     your own names therewith forever.In an interview with Mr. Lovejoy and Mr. Arnold, of Illinois, the dayfollowing this conference, Lincoln exclaimed: "Oh, how I wish theborder States would accept my proposition! Then you, Lovejoy, and you,Arnold, and all of us, would not have lived in vain! The labor of yourlife, Lovejoy, would be crowned with success. You would live to see theend of slavery."The first occasion on which the President definitely discussedemancipation plans with members of his Cabinet, according to SecretaryWelles, was on the 13th of July, 1862. On that day, says Mr. Welles,"President Lincoln invited me to accompany him in his carriage to thefuneral of an infant child of Mr. Stanton. Secretary Seward and Mrs.Frederick Seward were also in the carriage. Mr. Stanton occupied at thattime for a summer residence the house of a naval officer, some two orthree miles west or northwest of Georgetown. It was on this occasion andon this ride that he first mentioned to Mr. Seward and myself thesubject of emancipating the slaves by proclamation in case the Rebelsdid not cease to persist in their war on the Government and the Union,of which he saw no evidence. He dwelt earnestly on the gravity,importance, and delicacy of the movement; said he had given it muchthought, and had about come to the conclusion that it was a militarynecessity absolutely essential for the salvation of the Union; that wemust free the slaves or be ourselves subdued, etc.... This was, thePresident said, the first occasion when he had mentioned the subject toanyone, and wished us to frankly state how the proposition struck us.Mr. Seward said the subject involved consequences so vast and momentousthat he should wish to bestow on it mature reflection before giving adecisive answer; but his present opinion inclined to the measure asjustifiable, and perhaps he might say expedient and necessary. Thesewere also my views. Two or three times on that ride the subject, whichwas of course an absorbing one for each and all, was adverted to; andbefore separating, the President desired us to give the question specialand deliberate attention, for he was earnest in the conviction thatsomething must be done. It was a new departure for the President, foruntil this time, in all our previous interviews, whenever the questionof emancipation or the mitigation of slavery had been in any way alludedto, he had been prompt and emphatic in denouncing any interference bythe General Government with the subject. This was, I think, thesentiment of every member of the Cabinet, all of whom, including thePresident, considered it a local, domestic question, appertaining to theStates respectively, who had never parted with their authority over it.But the reverses before Richmond, and the formidable power anddimensions of the insurrection, which extended through all the SlaveStates, and had combined most of them in a confederacy to destroy theUnion, impelled the Administration to adopt extraordinary measures topreserve the national existence. The slaves, if not armed anddisciplined, were in the service of those who were, not only as fieldlaborers and producers, but thousands of them were in attendance uponthe armies in the field, employed as waiters and teamsters, and thefortifications and intrenchments were constructed by them."It has been shown again and again, by the words of Lincoln and by thetestimony of his friends, that he heartily detested the practice ofslavery, and would joyfully have set every bondman free. Before hisnomination for the Presidency--indeed, from the very beginning of hispublic life--he had repeatedly put himself on record as opposed toslavery, but perhaps nowhere more tersely and unequivocally than inthese words: "There is no reason in the world why the negro is notentitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration ofIndependence--the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness._I hold that he is as much entitled to them as the white man._" But hisrespect for the laws of the land deterred him from measures that mightseem of doubtful constitutionality, and he waited patiently until theright hour had struck before he issued the edict of emancipation soeagerly demanded by a large class of earnest and loyal people at theNorth. Many of these people, misunderstanding his views and intentions,were very impatient; and their criticisms and expostulations were aconstant burden to the sorely tried Executive.In June of this year (1862) the President was waited on by a deputationof Quakers, or Friends, fifteen or twenty in number, who had beencharged by the Yearly Meeting of their association to present a "minute"to the President on the subject of slavery and the duty of immediateemancipation. The visit of these excellent people was not altogethertimely. Bad news had been received from McClellan's army on thePeninsula, and Lincoln was harassed with cares and anxieties. But hegave the deputation a cordial though brief greeting, as he announcedthat he was ready to hear from the Friends. In the reading of theminute, it appeared that the document took occasion to remind thePresident that, years before, he had said, "I believe that thisGovernment cannot permanently endure half slave and half free," and fromthis was implied a suggestion of his failure to perform his duty as hehad then seen it. Lincoln was decidedly displeased with this criticism;and after the document had been read to the close, he received it fromthe speaker, then drawing himself up, he said, with unusual severity ofmanner: "It is true that on the 17th of June, 1858, I said, 'I believethat this Government cannot permanently endure half slave and halffree,' but I said it in connection with other things from which itshould not have been separated in an address discussing moralobligations; for this is a case in which the repetition of half a truth,in connection with the remarks just read, produces the effect of a wholefalsehood. What I did say was, 'If we could first know where we are, andwhither we are tending, we could better judge what to do and how to doit. We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated withthe avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to the slaveryagitation. Under the operation of that policy this agitation has notonly not ceased but has constantly augmented. In my opinion it will notcease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. "A housedivided against itself cannot stand." I believe that this Governmentcannot permanently endure half slave and half free. I do not expect theUnion to be dissolved--I do not expect the house to fall--but I doexpect that it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing orall the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the furtherspread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in thebelief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocateswill push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all theStates, old as well as new, North as well as South.' Take this statementas a whole, and it does not furnish a text for the homily to which thisaudience has listened."As Lincoln concluded, he was turning away, when another member of thedelegation, a woman, requested permission to detain him with a fewwords. Somewhat impatiently he said, "I will hear the Friend." Herremarks were a plea for the emancipation of the slaves, urging that hewas the appointed minister of the Lord to do the work, and enforcing herargument by many Scriptural citations. At the close he asked, "Has theFriend finished?" and receiving an affirmative answer, he said: "I haveneither time nor disposition to enter into discussion with the Friend,and end this occasion by suggesting for her consideration the questionwhether, if it be true that the Lord has appointed me to do the work shehas indicated, it is not probable that He would have communicatedknowledge of the fact to me as well as to her?"Something like the same views were expressed by Lincoln, on anotheroccasion, when, in response to a memorial presented by a delegationrepresenting most of the religious organizations of Chicago, he said,respectfully but pointedly: "I am approached with the most oppositeopinions and advice, and by religious men who are certain they representthe Divine Will.... I hope it will not be irreverent in me to say thatif it be probable that God would reveal His will to others, on a pointso closely connected with my duty, it might be supposed he would revealit directly to me.... If I can learn His will, I will do it. These,however, are not the days of miracles, and I suppose I am not to expecta direct revelation. I must study the plain physical facts of the case,and learn what appears to be wise and right.... Do not misunderstand mebecause I have mentioned these objections. They indicate thedifficulties which have thus far prevented my action in some such way asyou desire. I have not decided against a proclamation of emancipation,but hold the matter in advisement. The subject is in my mind by day andby night. Whatever shall appear to be God's will, I will do."About this period the President had a very interesting conversation withRev. William Henry Channing, in which the question of emancipation wasfrankly discussed. Mr. M.D. Conway, who was present at the interview,says: "Mr. Channing having begun by expressing his belief that theopportunity of the nation to rid itself of slavery had arrived, Mr.Lincoln asked how he thought they might avail themselves of it. Channingsuggested emancipation, with compensation for the slaves. The Presidentsaid he had for years been in favor of that plan. When the Presidentturned to me, I asked whether we might not look to him as the comingdeliverer of the nation from its one great evil? What would not that manachieve for mankind who should free America from slavery? He said,'Perhaps we may be better able to do something in that direction after awhile than we are now.' I said: 'Mr. President, do you believe themasses of the American people would hail you as their deliverer if, atthe end of this war, the Union should be surviving and slavery still init?' 'Yes, if they were to see that slavery was on the down hill.' Iventured to say: 'Our fathers compromised with slavery because theythought it on the down hill; hence war to-day.' The President said: 'Ithink the country grows in this direction daily, and I am not withouthope that something of the desire of you and your friends may beaccomplished. When the hour comes for dealing with slavery, _I trust Ishall be willing to do my duty, though it costs my life_. And,gentlemen, lives will be lost.' These last words were said with a smile,yet with a sad and weary tone. During the conversation Mr. Lincolnrecurred several times to Channing's suggestion of pecuniarycompensation for emancipated slaves, and professed profound sympathywith the Southerners who, by no fault of their own, had become sociallyand commercially bound up with their peculiar institution. Being aVirginian myself, with many dear relatives and beloved companions of myyouth in the Confederate ranks, I responded warmly to his kindlysentiments toward the South, albeit feeling more angry than he seemedto be against the institution preying upon the land like a ghoul. Iforget whether it was on this occasion or on a subsequent one when I waspresent that he said, in parting: 'We shall need all the anti-slaveryfeeling in the country, and more; you can go home and try to bring thepeople to your views; and you may say anything you like about me, ifthat will help. Don't spare me!' This was said with some laughter, butstill in earnest."One of the severest opponents of President Lincoln's policy regardingslavery was Horace Greeley. He criticized Lincoln freely in the New York"Tribune," of which he was editor, and said many harsh and bitter thingsof the administration. Lincoln took the abuse good-naturedly, saying onone occasion: "It reminds me of the big fellow whose little wife waswont to beat him over the head without resistance. When remonstratedwith, the man said, 'Let her alone. It don't hurt me, and it does her apower of good.'"In August, 1862, Mr. Greeley published a letter in the New York"Tribune," headed "The prayer of twenty millions of people," in which heurged the President, with extreme emphasis, to delay the act ofemancipation no longer. Lincoln answered the vehement entreaty in thefollowing calm, firm, and explicit words:     EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,     Friday, Aug. 22, 1862.     HON. HORACE GREELEY.     DEAR SIR: I have just read yours of the 19th instant, addressed to     myself, through the New York Tribune.     If there be in it any statements or assumptions of fact, which I     may know to be erroneous, I do not now and here controvert them. If     there be any inferences which I believe to be falsely drawn, I do     not now and here argue against them. If there be perceptible in it     an impatient and dictatorial tone, I waive it, in deference to an     old friend whose heart I have always supposed to be right.     As to the policy I "seem to be pursuing," as you say, I have not     meant to leave anyone in doubt. I would save the Union. I would     save it in the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the     national authority can be restored, the nearer the Union will     be--the Union as it was. If there be those who would not save the     Union unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not     agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union     unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree     with them. _My paramount object is to save the Union, and not     either to save or destroy slavery._ If I could save the Union     without freeing any slave, I would do it. And if I could save it by     freeing all the slaves, I would do it. And if I could save it by     freeing some, and leaving others alone, I would do that.     What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I     believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear     because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall     do less whenever I believe what I am doing hurts the cause; and     shall do more whenever I believe doing more will help the cause. I     shall try to correct errors, when shown to be errors; and I shall     adopt new views, so fast as they shall appear to be true views.     I have here stated my purpose, according to my view of official     duty, and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal     wish that all men everywhere could be free.     Yours,     A. Lincoln.Mr. Greeley being dissatisfied with Lincoln's explanation, and the"Tribune" still teeming with complaints and criticisms of theadministration, Lincoln requested Mr. Greeley to come to Washington andmake known in person his complaints, to the end that they might beobviated if possible. The editor of the "Tribune" came. Lincoln said:"You complain of me. What have I done, or omitted to do, which hasprovoked the hostility of the 'Tribune'?" The reply was, "You shouldissue a proclamation abolishing slavery." Lincoln answered: "Suppose Ido that. There are now twenty thousand of our muskets on the shouldersof Kentuckians, who are bravely fighting our battles. Every one of themwill be thrown down or carried over to the rebels." The reply was: "Letthem do it. The cause of the Union will be stronger if Kentucky shouldsecede with the rest than it is now." Lincoln answered, "Oh, I can'tthink that."It is evident that these solicitations and counsellings from outsidepersons were unnecessary and idle. Lincoln's far-seeing and practicalmind had already grasped, more surely than had his would-be advisers,the ultimate wisdom and justice of the emancipation of the slaves. Buthe was resolved to do nothing rashly. He would wait till the time wasripe, and then abolish slavery on grounds that would be approvedthroughout the world: he would destroy slavery as a necessary step tothe preservation of the Union. In the first year of the war he had saidto a Southern Unionist, who warned him against meddling with slavery,"_You must not expect me to give up this Government without playing mylast card._" This "last card" was undoubtedly the freeing of the slaves;and when the time came, Lincoln played it unhesitatingly andtriumphantly. How strong a card it was may be judged by a statement madein Congress by Mr. Ashmore, a Representative from South Carolina, whosaid shortly before the war: "The South can sustain more men in thefield than the North can. _Her four millions of slaves alone will enableher to support an army of half a million._" This view makes the issueplain. If the South could maintain armies in the field supported, orpartly supported, by slave labor, it was as much the right and the dutyof the Government to destroy that support as to destroy an establishmentfor the manufacture of arms or munitions of war for the Southern armies.The logic of events had demonstrated the necessity and justice of themeasure, and Lincoln now had with him a Cabinet practically united inits favor. The case was well stated by Secretary Welles--perhaps themost cool-headed and conservative member of Lincoln's Cabinet--at aCabinet meeting held six or eight weeks after the Emancipation measurehad been brought forward by the President. Mr. Welles, as he relates inhis Diary, pointed out "the strong exercise of power" involved in theproposal, and denied the power of the Executive to take such a stepunder ordinary conditions. "But," said Mr. Welles, "the Rebelsthemselves had invoked war on the subject of slavery, had appealed toarms, and must abide the consequences." Mr. Welles admitted that it was"an extreme exercise of war powers" which he believed justifiable "underthe circumstances, and in view of the condition of the country and themagnitude of the contest. The slaves were now an element of strength tothe Rebels--were laborers, producers, and army attendants; they wereconsidered as _property_ by the Rebels, and _if property_ they weresubject to confiscation; if not property, but _persons_ residing in theinsurrectionary region, we should invite them as well as the whites tounite with us in putting down the Rebellion." This view was in the mainconcurred in by the Cabinet members present, and greatly heartened thePresident in his course. On the 22d of September, 1862, he issued whatis known as the "Preliminary Proclamation." The text of this momentousdocument is as follows:     I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, and     Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, do hereby proclaim     and declare that hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be     prosecuted for the object of practically restoring the     constitutional relations between the United States and each of the     States and the people thereof, in which States that relation is or     may be suspended or disturbed.     That it is my purpose, upon the next meeting of Congress, to again     recommend the adoption of a practical measure tendering pecuniary     aid to the free acceptance or rejection of all slave States, so     called, the people whereof may not then be in rebellion against the     United States, and which States may then have voluntarily adopted,     or thereafter may voluntarily adopt, immediate or gradual     abolishment of slavery within their respective limits; and that the     effort to colonize persons of African descent, with their consent,     upon this continent or elsewhere, with the previously obtained     consent of the governments existing there, will be continued.     That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one     thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves     within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof     shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be     then, thenceforward, and forever FREE; and the Executive government     of the United States, including the military and naval authority     thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons,     and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them,     in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.     That the Executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid, by     proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in     which the people thereof respectively shall then be in rebellion     against the United States; and the fact that any State, or the     people thereof, shall on that day be, in good faith, represented in     the Congress of the United States by members chosen thereto at     elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such State     shall have participated, shall, in the absence of strong     countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such     State, and the people thereof, are not in rebellion against the     United States.     That attention is hereby called to an act of Congress entitled "An     act to make an additional article of war," approved March 13, 1862,     and which act is in the words and figures following:     _Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the     United States of America in Congress assembled_, That hereafter the     following shall be promulgated as an additional article of war, for     the government of the army of the United States, and shall be     obeyed and observed as such.     ARTICLE.--All officers or persons in the military or naval service     of the United States are prohibited from employing any of the     forces under their respective commands for the purpose of returning     fugitives from service or labor who may have escaped from any     persons to whom such service or labor is claimed to be due, and any     officer who shall be found guilty by a court-martial of violating     this article shall be dismissed from the service.     SEC. 2. _And be it further enacted_, That this act shall take     effect from and after its passage.Also to the ninth and tenth sections of an act entitled "An act tosuppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion, to seize andconfiscate property of rebels, and for other purposes," approved July17, 1862, and which sections are in the words and figures following:     SEC. 9. _And be it further enacted_, That all slaves of persons who     shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the government of     the United States or who shall in any way give aid or comfort     thereto, escaping from such persons and taking refuge within the     lines of the army; and all slaves captured from such persons or     deserted by them, and coming under the control of the government of     the United States; and all slaves of such persons found _on_ [or]     being within any place occupied by rebel forces, and afterwards     occupied by the forces of the United States, shall be deemed     captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and     not again held as slaves.     SEC. 10. _And be it further enacted_, That no slave, escaping into     any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, from any other     State, shall be delivered up, or in any way impeded or hindered of     his liberty, except for crime, or some offense against the laws,     unless the person claiming said fugitive shall first make oath that     the person to whom the labor or service of such fugitive is alleged     to be due is his lawful owner, and has not borne arms against the     United States in the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid     and comfort thereto; and no person engaged in the military or naval     service of the United States shall, under any pretense whatever,     assume to decide on the validity of the claim of any person to the     service or labor of any other person, or surrender up any such     person to the claimant, on pain of being dismissed from the     service.     And I do hereby enjoin upon and order all persons engaged in the     military and naval service of the United States to observe, obey,     and enforce, within their respective spheres of service, the act     and sections above recited.     And the Executive will in due time recommend that all the citizens     of the United States who shall have remained loyal thereto     throughout the rebellion, shall (upon the restoration of the     constitutional relation between the United States and their     respective States and people, if that relation shall have been     suspended or disturbed) be compensated for all losses by acts of     the United States, including the loss of slaves.     In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the     seal of the United States to be affixed.     Done at the city of Washington, this twenty-second day of     September, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and     sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States the     eighty-seventh.     _By the President_: ABRAHAM LINCOLN.     WILLIAM H. SEWARD, _Secretary of State_.Lincoln's own account of this proclamation, and of the steps that ledto it, is given as reported by Mr. F.B. Carpenter. "It had," saidLincoln, "got to be midsummer, 1862. Things had gone on from bad toworse, until I felt that we had reached the end of our rope on the planof operations we had been pursuing; that we must change our tactics andplay our last card, or lose the game. I now determined upon the adoptionof the emancipation policy; and, without consultation with, or theknowledge of, the Cabinet, I prepared the original draft of theproclamation, and, after much anxious thought, called a Cabinet meetingupon the subject. This was the last of July, or the first part of themonth of August, 1862. This Cabinet meeting took place, I think, upon aSaturday. All were present excepting Mr. Blair, the Postmaster general,who was absent at the opening of the discussion, but came insubsequently. I said to the Cabinet that I had resolved upon this step,and had called them together, not to ask their advice, but to lay thesubject-matter of a proclamation before them; suggestions as to whichwould be in order, after they had heard it read. Mr. Lovejoy was inerror when he informed you that it excited no comment, excepting on thepart of Secretary Seward. Various suggestions were offered. SecretaryChase wished the language stronger in reference to the arming of theblacks. Mr. Blair, after he came in, deprecated the policy, on theground that it would cost the administration the fall elections.Nothing, however, was offered that I had not already fully anticipatedand settled in my own mind, until Secretary Seward spoke. He said insubstance: 'Mr. President, I approve of the proclamation, but I questionthe expediency of its issue at this juncture. The depression of thepublic mind, consequent upon our repeated reverses, is so great that Ifear the effect of so important a step. It may be viewed as the lastmeasure of an exhausted government, a cry for help; the governmentstretching forth its hands to Ethiopia, instead of Ethiopia stretchingforth her hands to the government.' 'His idea,' said the President, 'wasthat it would be considered our last _shriek_ on the retreat.' (This washis precise expression.) 'Now,' continued Mr. Seward, 'while I approvethe measure, I suggest, sir, that you postpone its issue until you cangive it to the country supported by military success, instead of issuingit, as would be the case now, upon the greatest disasters of the war!'"Lincoln continued: "The wisdom of the view of the Secretary of Statestruck me with very great force. It was an aspect of the case that, inall my thought upon the subject, I had entirely overlooked. The resultwas that I put the draft of the proclamation aside, waiting for avictory. From time to time I added or changed a line, touching it uphere and there, anxiously waiting the progress of events. Well, the nextnews we had was of Pope's disaster at Bull Run. Things looked darkerthan ever. Finally, came the week of the battle of Antietam. Idetermined to wait no longer.[F] The news came, I think, on Wednesday,that the advantage was on our side. I was then staying at the Soldiers'Home (three miles out of Washington). Here I finished writing the seconddraft of the preliminary proclamation; came up on Saturday; called theCabinet together to hear it; and it was published the following Monday."Another interesting incident occurred at this Cabinet meeting inconnection with Secretary Seward. The President had written theimportant part of the proclamation in these words: "That on the firstday of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred andsixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or designatedpart of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion againstthe United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever FREE; andthe Executive Government of the United States, including the militaryand naval authority thereof, will _recognize_ the freedom of suchpersons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any ofthem, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom." "When Ifinished reading this paragraph," remarked Lincoln, "Mr. Seward stoppedme, and said, 'I think, Mr. President, that you should insert after theword "_recognize_" "_and maintain_."' I replied that I had already fullyconsidered the import of that expression in this connection, but I hadnot introduced it, because it was not my way to promise what I was notentirely _sure_ that I could perform, and I was not prepared to say thatI thought we were exactly able to maintain this. But Seward insistedthat we ought to take this ground, and the words finally went in."The special Cabinet meeting to which Lincoln here refers was one ofuncommon interest even in that day of heroic things. An account of it isgiven by Secretary Welles, who was present. "At the Cabinet meeting ofSeptember 22," says Mr. Welles in his Diary, "the special subject wasthe Proclamation for emancipating the slaves after a certain date, inStates that shall then be in rebellion. For several weeks the subjecthas been suspended, but the President says never lost sight of. Intaking up the Proclamation, the President stated that the question wasfinally decided, the act and the consequences were his, but that hefelt it due to us to make us acquainted with the fact and to invitecriticism on the paper which he had prepared. There were, he had found,not unexpectedly, some differences in the Cabinet, but he had, afterascertaining in his own way the views of each and all, individually andcollectively, formed his own conclusions and made his own decisions. Inthe course of the discussion on this paper, which was long, earnest,and, on the general principle involved, harmonious, he remarked that hehad made a vow, a covenant, that if God gave us the victory in theapproaching battle, he would consider it an indication of Divine will,and that it was his duty to move forward in the cause of emancipation.It might be thought strange, he said, that he had in this way submittedthe disposal of important matters when the way was not clear to his mindwhat he should do. God had decided his questions in favor of the slaves.He was satisfied it was right; and he was confirmed and strengthened inhis action by the vow and the results. His mind was fixed, his decisionmade, but he wished his paper announcing his course to be as correct interms as it could be made without any change in his determination. Heread the document. One or two unimportant amendments suggested by Sewardwere approved. It was then handed to the Secretary of State to publishto-morrow."The discussion of Emancipation brought up at once the problem of whatshould be done with the freed negroes. The very next day after thepreliminary proclamation was issued (September 23, 1862), the Presidentpresented the matter to the assembled Cabinet. Deportation wasconsidered, and some of those present urged that this should becompulsory. The President, however, would not consider this; theemigration of the negroes, he said, must be voluntary, and withoutexpense to themselves. It was proposed to deport the freedmen to CostaRica, where a large tract of land (known as the Chiriqui Grant) had beenobtained from the government of Central America. Lincoln favored this ina general way. He "thought it essential to provide an asylum for a racewhich we had emancipated but which could never be recognized or admittedto be our equals," says Mr. Welles. But there was some doubt as to thevalidity of the title to the Costa Rica lands, and the matter wasdropped.In his second annual message to Congress, transmitted to that body inDecember, 1862, Lincoln touched, in conclusion, upon the great subjectof Emancipation, in these words of deep import:     I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper     addressed to the Congress of the nation by the Chief Magistrate of     the nation. Nor do I forget that some of you are my seniors, nor     that many of you have more experience than I in the conduct of     public affairs. Yet I trust that in view of the great     responsibility resting upon me, you will perceive no want of     respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness I may seem to     display.... The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the     stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we     must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think     anew and act anew.     Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and     this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No     personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another     of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down, in     honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. We say we are for the     Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We know how to     save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We--even     we here--hold the power and bear the responsibility. In giving     freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free--honorable alike     in what we give and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or     meanly lose, the last best hope of earth. Other means may succeed,     this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just--a     way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God     must forever bless.An immense concourse attended the reception at the White House on thefirst day of 1863, and the President stood for several hours shakinghands with the endless train of men and women who pressed forward togreet him. The exhausting ceremonial being ended, the proclamation whichfinally and forever abrogated the institution of slavery in the UnitedStates was handed to him for his signature. "Mr. Seward," remarked thePresident, "I have been shaking hands all day, and my right hand isalmost paralyzed. If my name ever gets into history, it will be for thisact, and my whole soul is in it. If my hand trembles when I sign theproclamation, those who examine the document hereafter will say Ihesitated." Then, resting his arm a moment, he turned to the table, tookup the pen, and slowly and firmly wrote, ABRAHAM LINCOLN. He smiled as,handing the paper to Mr. Seward, he said, "That will do." A few hoursafter, he remarked: "The signature looks a little tremulous, for my handwas tired; but my resolution was firm. I told them in September that ifthey did not return to their allegiance I would strike at this pillar oftheir strength. And now the promise shall be kept, and not one word ofit will I ever recall."The text of the great Emancipation Proclamation is as follows:     Whereas, on the 22d day of September, in the year of our Lord one     thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, a proclamation was issued by     the President of the United States, containing, among other things,     the following, to-wit:        That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord        one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons        held as slaves within any States or designated part of a        State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion        against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward        and forever free; and the Executive Government of the        United States, including the military and naval authority        thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such        persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such        persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for        their actual freedom.        That the Executive will, on the first day of January        aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States and        parts of States, if any, in which the people thereof        respectively shall then be in rebellion against the        United States; and the fact that any State, or the people        thereof, shall on that day be in good faith represented        in the Congress of the United States, by members chosen        thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified        voters of such State shall have participated, shall, in        the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed        conclusive evidence that such State, and the people        thereof, are not then in rebellion against the United        States.     Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United     States, by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-Chief     of the Army and Navy of the United States in time of actual armed     rebellion against the authority and Government of the United     States, and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing     said rebellion, do, on this first day of January, in the year of     our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and in     accordance with my purpose so to do, publicly proclaimed for the     full period of one hundred days, from the day first above     mentioned, order and designate as the States and parts of States     wherein the people thereof respectively are this day in     rebellion against the United States, the following, to-wit:     Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana (except the parishes of St. Bernard,     Plaquemines, Jefferson, St. John, St. Charles, St. James,     Ascension, Assumption, Terre Bonne, Lafourche, Ste. Marie, St.     Martin, and Orleans, including the city of New Orleans),     Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North     Carolina, and Virginia (except the forty-eight counties     designated as West Virginia, and also the counties of Berkeley,     Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth City, York, Princess Anne, and     Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth), and     which excepted parts are for the present left precisely as if     this proclamation were not issued.     And by virtue of the power and for the purpose aforesaid, I do     order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said     designated States and parts of States are and henceforward shall     be FREE; and that the Executive Government of the United States,     including the military and naval authorities thereof, will     recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons.     And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to     abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defense; and     I recommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor     faithfully for reasonable wages.     And I further declare and make known that such persons, of     suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of     the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and     other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.     And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice,     warranted by the Constitution, upon military necessity, I invoke     the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of     Almighty God.     In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my name, and caused the     seal of the United States to be affixed.     Done at the City of Washington, this first day of January, in     the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three,     and of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh.     _By the President_: ABRAHAM LINCOLN.     WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.It is stated that Lincoln gave the most earnest study to the compositionof the Emancipation Proclamation. He realized, as he afterwards said,that the proclamation was the central act of his administration and thegreat event of the nineteenth century. When the document was completed aprinted copy of it was placed in the hands of each member of theCabinet, and criticisms and suggestions were invited. Mr. Chaseremarked: "This paper is of the utmost importance, greater than anystate paper ever made by this Government. A paper of so much importance,and involving the liberties of so many people, ought, I think, to makesome reference to Deity. I do not observe anything of the kind in it."Lincoln said: "No, I overlooked it. Some reference to Deity must beinserted. Mr. Chase, won't you make a draft of what you think ought tobe inserted?" Mr. Chase promised to do so, and at the next meetingpresented the following: "And upon this act, sincerely believed to be anact of justice, warranted by the Constitution, upon military necessity,I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor ofAlmighty God." When Lincoln read the paragraph, Mr. Chase said: "You maynot approve it, but I thought this, or something like it, would beappropriate." Lincoln replied: "I do approve it; it cannot be bettered,and I will adopt it in the very words you have written."To a large concourse of people who, two days after the proclamation wasissued, assembled before the White House, with music, the Presidentsaid: "What I did, I did after a very full deliberation, and under aheavy and solemn sense of responsibility. I can only trust in God I havemade no mistake." That he realized to the full the gravity of the stepbefore taking it is shown again in an incident related by Hon. JohnCovode, who, calling on the President a few days before the issue of thefinal proclamation, found him walking his room in considerableagitation. Reference being made to the forthcoming proclamation, Lincolnsaid with great earnestness: "I have studied that matter well; my mindis made up--it _must be done_. I am driven to it. There is to me noother way out of our troubles. But although my duty is plain, it is insome respects painful, and I trust the people will understand that I actnot in anger but in expectation of a greater good."Mr. Ben. Perley Poore makes the interesting statement that "Mr. Lincolncarefully put away the pen which he had used in signing the document,for Mr. Sumner, who had promised it to his friend, George Livermore, ofCambridge, the author of an interesting work on slavery. It was a steelpen with a wooden handle, the end of which had been gnawed by Mr.Lincoln--a habit that he had when composing anything that requiredthought."In response to a request of the ladies in charge of the NorthwesternFair for the Sanitary Commission, which was held in Chicago in theautumn of 1863, Lincoln conveyed to them the original draft of theproclamation; saying, in his note of presentation, "I had some desire toretain the paper; but if it shall contribute to the relief or comfort ofthe soldiers, that will be better." The document was purchased at theFair by Mr. Thomas B. Bryan, and given by him to the Chicago HistoricalSociety. It perished in the great fire of October, 1871.More than a year after the issue of the Emancipation Proclamation,Lincoln, in writing to a prominent Kentucky Unionist, gave a synopsis ofhis views and course regarding slavery, which is so clear in statement,and so forceful and convincing in logic, that a place must be given itin this chapter.     I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is     wrong. I cannot remember when I did not so think and feel; and yet     I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an     unrestricted, right to act officially upon this judgment and     feeling. It was in the oath I took that I would, to the best of my     ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the     United States. I could not take the office without taking the oath.     Nor was it my view that I might take an oath to get power, and     break the oath in using the power. I understood, too, that in     ordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me to     practically indulge my primary abstract judgment on the moral     question of slavery. I had publicly declared this many times and in     many ways. And I aver that, to this day, I have done no official     act in mere deference to my abstract judgment and feeling on     slavery. I did understand, however, that my oath to preserve the     Constitution to the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty of     preserving, by every indispensable means, that Government--that     Nation of which that Constitution was the organic law. Was it     possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution? By     general law, life _and_ limb must be protected; yet often a limb     must be amputated to save a life; but a life is never wisely given     to save a limb. I felt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional,     might become lawful, by becoming indispensable to the preservation     of the Constitution, through the preservation of the nation. Right     or wrong, I assumed this ground, and now avow it. I could not feel     that, to the best of my ability, I had even tried to preserve the     Constitution, if, to save slavery, or any minor matter, I should     permit the wreck of government, country, and constitution,     altogether. When, early in the war, General Fremont attempted     military emancipation, I forbade it, because I did not then think     it an indispensable necessity. When a little later, General     Cameron, then Secretary of War, suggested the arming of the blacks,     I objected, because I did not yet think it an indispensable     necessity. When, still later, General Hunter attempted military     emancipation, I again forbade it, because I did not yet think the     indispensable necessity had come. When, in March and May and July,     1862, I made earnest and successive appeals to the border States to     favor compensated emancipation, I believed the indispensable     necessity for military emancipation and arming the blacks would     come, unless averted by that measure. They declined the     proposition; and I was, in my best judgment, driven to the     alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it the     Constitution, or of laying strong hand upon the colored element. I     chose the latter. In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than     loss; but of this I was not entirely confident. More than a year of     trial now shows no loss by it in our foreign relations, none in our     home popular sentiment, none in our white military force, no loss     by it anyhow or anywhere. On the contrary, it shows a gain of quite     a hundred and thirty thousand soldiers, seamen, and laborers. These     are palpable facts, about which, as facts, there can be no     cavilling. We have the men; and as we could not have had them     without the measure.     And now let any Union man who complains of the measure, test     himself by writing down in one line that he is for subduing the     rebellion by force of arms; and in the next, that he is for taking     three hundred and thirty thousand men from the Union side, and     placing them where they would be but for the measure he condemns.     If he cannot face his case so stated, it is only because he cannot     face the truth.     I attempt no compliment to my own sagacity. I claim not to have     controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled     me. Now, at the end of three years' struggle, the nation's     condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected.     God alone can claim it. Whither it is tending seems plain. If God     now wills the removal of a great wrong, and wills also that we of     the North, as well as you of the South, shall pay fairly for our     complicity in that wrong, impartial history will find therein new     causes to attest and revere the justice and goodness of God.

Lincoln's life asPresident was by no means made up of Cabinet meetings, official messagesand proclamations, or reviews of armies; interspersed with theseconspicuous acts was a multitude of less heroic but scarcely lessinteresting details, with incidents and experiences humorous or sad, butall, even the most trivial, being expressions of the life and characterof the man whom we are seeking to portray."Society," as now understood at the national capital, had but littleexistence during the war. At the White House there were the usualPresident's receptions, which were quite public in character and werelargely attended. Aside from these democratic gatherings there waslittle enough of gaiety. The feeling that prevailed is shown by anincident that occurred during the winter of 1862-3, when a good deal ofclamor was raised over a party given by Mrs. Lincoln, at which, it wasasserted, dancing was indulged in; and Mrs. Lincoln was severelycensured for what was regarded as inexcusable frivolity. Hon. A.G.Riddle, who was present on the occasion referred to, states positivelythat there was no dancing; the party was a quiet one, intended only torelieve the rather dull and formal receptions. But the President waspained by the rumors that "fashionable balls" were permitted at theWhite House in war-time; and the party was not repeated.It was the custom of President Lincoln to open, twice a week, the doorsof his office in the Executive Mansion for the admission of all visitorswho might wish to speak with him. These brief interviews, quite devoidof ceremony, seemed to reveal the man in his true character, and to setforth the salient traits that fitted him for his great position, andendeared him so greatly to the popular heart. They showed how easilyaccessible he was to all classes of citizens, how readily he could adapthimself to people of any station or degree, how deep and true were hishuman sympathies, how quickly and keenly he could discriminatecharacter, and how heartily he detested meanness and all unworthy actsand appliances to compass a selfish or sordid end. On these occasions,as may well be imagined, many curious incidents occurred. Lincoln wasusually clad "in a black broadcloth suit, nothing in his dressbetokening disregard of conventionality, save perhaps his neat clothslippers, which were doubtless worn for comfort. He was seated beside aplain cloth-covered table, in a commodious arm-chair." As each visitorapproached the President he was greeted with an encouraging nod andsmile, and a few moments were cordially given him in which to state theobject of the visit; the President listening with the most respectfuland patient attention, and deciding each case with tact, sympathy, andgood humor. "His _Yes_," says Mr. Riddle, "was most gracious andsatisfactory; his _No_, when reached, was often spoken by thepetitioner, and left only a soothed disappointment. He saw the point ofa case unerringly. He had a confidence in the homely views and speech ofthe common people, with whom his heart and sympathies ever were."At these informal meetings with people who usually wanted some favorfrom him, no case was too trivial to receive his attention. Takingadvantage of the opportunity, there came one day, says Mr. C. VanSantvoord, "a sturdy, honest-looking German soldier, minus a leg, whohobbled up to the President on crutches. In consideration of hisdisabled condition, he wanted some situation about Washington, theduties of which he might be able to discharge; and he had come to thePresident, hoping that he would provide the desired situation for him.On being interrogated as to how he had lost his leg, he answered that itwas the effect of a wound received in battle, mentioning the time andthe place. 'Let me look at your papers,' said Mr. Lincoln. The manreplied that he had none, and that he supposed his word would besufficient. 'What!' exclaimed the President, 'no papers, no credentials,nothing to show how you lost your leg! How am I to know that you did notlose it by a trap after getting into somebody's orchard?' This wasspoken with a droll expression which amused the bystanders, all exceptthe applicant, who with a very solemn visage earnestly protested thetruth of his statement, muttering something about the reasons for notbeing able to produce his papers. 'Well, well,' said the President, 'itis a little risky for an army man to be wandering around without papersto show where he belongs and what he is, but I will see what can bedone for you.' And taking a blank card from a little pile of similarblanks on the table, he wrote some lines upon it, addressed it, andhanding it to the man bade him deliver it to a certain quartermaster,who would attend to his case."The President could, however, be emphatic and even severe when necessaryon such occasions. One day, we are told, "he was approached by a manapparently sixty years of age, with dress and manner which showed thathe was acquainted with the usages of good society, whose whole exterior,indeed, would have favorably impressed people who form opinions fromappearances. The object of his visit was to solicit aid in somecommission project, for the success of which Mr. Lincoln's favor wasregarded as essential. The President heard him patiently, but demurredagainst being connected with or countenancing the affair, suggestingmildly that the applicant would better set up an office of the kinddescribed, and run it in his own way and at his own risk. The manpleaded his advanced years and obscurity as a reason for not attemptingthis, but said if the President would only let him use his name toadvertise and recommend the enterprise, he would then, he thought, neednothing more. At this the eyes of the President flashed with suddenindignation, and his whole aspect and manner underwent a portentouschange. 'No!' he broke forth, with startling vehemence, springing fromhis seat under the impulse of his emotion. 'No! I'll have nothing to dowith this business, nor with any man who comes to me with such degradingpropositions. What! Do you take the President of the United States to bea commission broker? You have come to the wrong place; and for you andevery one who comes for such purposes, there is the door!' The man'sface blanched as he cowered and slunk away confounded, without utteringa word. The President's wrath subsided as speedily as it had risen."Another example of Lincoln's power to dispose summarily of people whotried his patience too far is given by Secretary Welles, who recordsthat a Mrs. White--a sister or half-sister of Mrs. Lincoln--made herselfso obnoxious as a Southern sympathizer in Washington in 1864, that thePresident sent her word that "if she did not leave forthwith she mightexpect to find herself within twenty-four hours in the Old CapitolPrison."With all his kindness and desire to do what was asked of him, Lincolncould not be persuaded to consent to anything which he felt to bedistinctly wrong, regardless of any unfavorable consequences which hisrefusal might bring upon himself. When the members of Congress fromMinnesota, late in 1862, called on him in a body to urge him to orderthe execution of three hundred Indian prisoners, captured in their Stateand charged with great atrocities, he positively refused, althoughrealizing that it might cost him the support of those members of theHouse, which he greatly needed at that time."The President is always disposed to mitigate punishments and grantfavors," says a member of his Cabinet. "As a matter of duty andfriendship, I one day mentioned to him the case of Laura Jones, a younglady residing in Richmond and there engaged to be married, who came upthree years ago to attend her sick mother and had been unable to passthrough the lines and return. A touching appeal was made by the poorgirl, who truly says her youth is passing. The President at once said hewould give her a pass. I told him her sympathies were with thesecessionists. But he said he would let her go; the war had depopulatedthe country and prevented marriages enough, and if he could do akindness of this sort he would do it."Another applicant for a pass through the lines was less fortunate thanthe one just noted. One day, in the spring of 1862, a gentleman fromsome Northern city entered Lincoln's private office, and earnestlyrequested a pass to Richmond. "A pass to Richmond!" exclaimed thePresident. "Why, my dear sir, if I should give you one it would do youno good. You may think it very strange, but there's a lot of fellowsbetween here and Richmond who either can't read or are prejudicedagainst every man who totes a pass from me. I have given McClellan andmore than two hundred thousand others passes to Richmond, _and not asingle one of 'em has got there yet!_"Lincoln sometimes had a very effective way of dealing with men who askedtroublesome or improper questions. A visitor once asked him how many menthe rebels had in the field. The President replied, very seriously,"_Twelve hundred thousand_, according to the best authority." Theinterrogator blanched in the face, and ejaculated, "Good heavens!" "Yes,sir, twelve hundred thousand--no doubt of it. You see, all of ourgenerals, when they get whipped, say the enemy outnumbered them fromthree or five to one, and I must believe them. We have four hundredthousand men in the field, and three times four makes twelve. Don't yousee it?"Among the many illustrations of the sturdy sense and firmness ofLincoln's character, the following should be recorded: During the earlypart of 1863 the Union men in Missouri were divided into two factions,which waged a bitter controversy with each other. General Curtis,commander of the military district comprising Missouri, Kansas, andArkansas, was at the head of one faction, while Governor Gamble led theother. Their differences were a source of great embarrassment to theGovernment at Washington, and of harm to the Union cause. The Presidentwas in constant receipt of remonstrances and protests from thecontesting parties, to one of which he made the following curt reply:     Your despatch of to-day is just received. It is very painful to me     that you, in Missouri cannot, or will not, settle your factional     quarrel among yourselves. I have been tormented with it beyond     endurance, for months, by both sides. Neither side pays the least     respect to my appeals to reason. I am now compelled to take hold of     the case.     A. LINCOLN.The President promptly followed up this warning by removing GeneralCurtis, and appointing in his place General Schofield, to whom he soonafter addressed the following letter:     EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,     May 27, 1863.     GENERAL J.M. SCHOFIELD.     DEAR SIR: Having removed General Curtis and assigned you to the     command of the Department of the Missouri, I think it may be of     some advantage to me to state to you why I did it. I did not remove     General Curtis because of my full conviction that he had done wrong     by commission or omission. I did it because of a conviction in my     mind that the Union men of Missouri, constituting, when united, a     vast majority of the people, have entered into a pestilent,     factious quarrel among themselves; General Curtis, perhaps not of     choice, being the head of one faction, and Governor Gamble that of     the other. After months of labor to reconcile the difficulty, it     seemed to grow worse and worse, until I felt it my duty to break it     up somehow, and as I could not remove Governor Gamble, I had to     remove General Curtis. Now that you are in the position, I wish you     to undo nothing merely because General Curtis or Governor Gamble     did it, but to exercise your own judgment, and do right for the     public interest. Let your military measures be strong enough to     repel the invaders and keep the peace, and not so strong as to     unnecessarily harass and persecute the people. It is a difficult     _role_, and so much greater will be the honor if you perform it     well. If both factions, or neither, shall abuse you, you will     probably be about right. Beware of being assailed by one and     praised by the other.     Yours truly, A. LINCOLN.Firm and unyielding as he was when necessity compelled him to be,Lincoln was by nature a peace-maker, and was ever anxious that personaldifferences be adjusted happily. In his efforts to this end he neverfailed to show tact and shrewdness, and would if necessary sacrifice hisown preferences in the interests of peace and harmony. A characteristicinstance of the exercise of these traits occurred in connection with theMissouri troubles just referred to. General Schofield's course incommand of his department proved satisfactory, and he had been nominatedfor a Major-General's commission. He was, however, a somewhatconservative man, and in spite of his efforts to carry out thePresident's injunctions of impartiality, he had given offense to certainMissouri radicals, who now opposed his promotion, and were able to exertsufficient influence in the Senate to prevent the confirmation of hisappointment as a Major-General. The Missouri delegation appealed to themore radical Senators, and the nomination was "hung up" for about sixweeks. Lincoln was very desirous that it should be confirmed, and theMissouri Congressmen were equally bent on its defeat. In this dilemma,Lincoln sent for Senator Zack Chandler of Michigan, and proposed acompromise. "General Rosecrans," said he, "has a great many friends; hefought the battle of Stone River and won a brilliant victory, and hisadvocates begin to grumble about his treatment. Now, I will tell youwhat I have been thinking about. If you will confirm Schofield in theSenate, I will remove him from the command in Missouri and send him downto Sherman. That will satisfy the radicals. Then I will send Rosecransto Missouri, and that will please the latter's friends. In this way thewhole thing can be harmonized." As soon as the Senate grasped the planof the President there was no longer any opposition to the confirmationof Schofield. He was sent to join Sherman in the South, Rosecrans wasappointed to the command in Missouri, and everything worked harmoniouslyand pleasantly as the President had predicted and desired.Secretary Welles remarks that "the President was a much more shrewd andaccurate observer of the characteristics of men--better and morecorrectly formed an estimate of their power and capabilities--than theSecretary of State or most others. Those in the public service heclosely scanned, but was deliberate in forming a conclusion adverse toany one he had appointed. In giving or withdrawing confidence he wasdiscriminating and just in his final decision, careful never to woundunnecessarily the sensibilities of any of their infirmities, alwaysready to praise, but nevertheless firm and resolute in discharging theto him always painful duty of censure, reproof, or dismissal." As aninstance of this sure judgment of the abilities and characters of men,Mr. Welles gives an anecdote relating to the naval movement underAdmiral Du Pont, against Charleston, S.C. "One day," says Mr. Welles,"the President said to me that he had but slight expectation that weshould have any great success from Du Pont. 'He, as well as McClellan,'said Mr. Lincoln, 'hesitates--has _the slows_. McClellan always wantedmore regiments; Du Pont is everlastingly asking for moregun-boats--more iron-clads. He will do nothing with any. He hasintelligence and system and will maintain a good blockade. You did wellin selecting him for that command, but he will never take Sumter or getto Charleston. He is no Farragut, though unquestionably a good routineofficer, who obeys orders and in a general way carries out hisinstructions.'" The outcome of events proved the soundness of Lincoln'sjudgment.Loyalty to his friends was always a strong trait of Lincoln's character.It was put to the proof daily during his life in Washington. Mr. GurdonS. Hubbard, in a brief but interesting memorial, relates one or twointerviews held with the President, in which the simplicity of hischaracter and his fidelity to old friendships appear very conspicuously.Mr. Hubbard's acquaintance with Lincoln was of long standing. "I calledon him in Washington the year of his inauguration," says Mr. Hubbard,"and was alone with him for an hour or more. I found him greatlychanged, his countenance bearing an expression of great mental anxiety.The whole topic of our conversation was the war, which affected himdeeply.... Two years after, I again visited Washington, and went to theWhite House to pay my respects, in company with my friend Thomas L.Forrest. It was Saturday; and, as usual, about six o'clock the band fromthe navy-yard appeared and began to play. The President, withAdjutant-General Thomas, was seated on the balcony. The crowd was great,marching compactly past the President, the men raising their hats insalutation. As my friend and myself passed he said to me, 'The Presidentseems to notice you--turn toward him.' 'No,' I said, 'I don't care to berecognized.' At that instant Mr. Lincoln started from his seat,advancing quickly to the iron railing, and leaning over, beckoning withhis long arm, called: 'Hubbard! Hubbard! come here!' I left the ranksand ascended the stone steps to the gate of the balcony, which waslocked, General Thomas saying, 'Wait a moment, I will get the key.''Never mind, General,' said Mr. Lincoln, 'Hubbard is used to jumping--hecan scale that fence.' I climbed over, and for about an hour weconversed and watched the large crowd, the rebel flag being in sight onArlington Heights. This was the last time I ever saw his face in life."It was noted by those about Lincoln during his residence at the WhiteHouse that he usually avoided speaking of himself as President or makingany reference to the office which he held. He used some such roundaboutphrase as "since I came into this place," instead of saying "since Ibecame President." The war he usually spoke of as "this great trouble,"and he almost never alluded to the enemy as "Confederates" or "theConfederate Government." He had an unconquerable reluctance to appear tolead public opinion, and often spoke of himself as the "attorney for thepeople." Once, however, when a Senator was urging on him a certaincourse which the President was not disposed to pursue, the Senator said,"You say you are the people's attorney. Now, you will admit that thiscourse would be most popular." "But I am not going to let my clientmanage the case against my judgment," Lincoln replied quickly. "As longas I am attorney for the people I shall manage the case to the best ofmy ability. They will have a chance to put me out by and by if mymanagement is not satisfactory."The President was so tormented by visitors seeking interviews for everysort of frivolous and impertinent matter, that he resorted sometimes, indesperation, to curious and effective inventions to rid himself of theintolerable nuisance. At one time, when he was importuned by someinfluential people to interfere to prevent the punishment of certainpersons convicted of fraudulent dealings with the government--a class ofcases too common at that time--the President wrote Secretary Welles thathe desired to see the records of the case before it was disposed of.Upon Mr. Welles calling upon him with the desired information, thePresident said, as if by way of apology, "There was no way to get rid ofthe crowd that was upon me but by sending you a note." On anotheroccasion, when he had been quite ill, and therefore less inclined thanusual to listen to these bores, one of them had just seated himself fora long visit, when the President's physician happened to enter the room,and Lincoln said, holding out his hands, "Doctor, what are theseblotches?" "That's varioloid, or mild small-pox," said the doctor."They're all over me. It is contagious, I believe," said Lincoln. "Verycontagious, indeed!" replied the doctor. "Well, I can't stop, Mr.Lincoln; I just called to see how you were," said the visitor. "Oh,don't be in a hurry, sir!" placidly remarked the Executive. "Thank you,sir; I'll call again," replied the visitor, executing a masterly retreatfrom the White House. "Some people," said the President, looking afterhim, "said they could not take very well to my proclamation; but now, Iam happy to say, I have _something that everybody can take_."Among the innumerable nuisances and "cranks" who called on Lincoln atthe White House, were the many who sought to win his favor by claimingto have been the first to suggest his nomination as President. One ofthese claimants, who was the editor of a weekly paper published in alittle village in Missouri, called one day, and was admitted toLincoln's presence. He at once began explaining that he was the man whofirst suggested Lincoln's name for the Presidency, and pulling from hispocket an old, worn, defaced copy of his paper, exhibited to thePresident an item on the subject. "Do you really think," said Lincoln,"that announcement was the occasion of my nomination?" "Certainly," saidthe editor, "the suggestion was so opportune that it was at once takenup by other papers, and the result was your nomination and election.""Ah, well," said Lincoln, with a sigh, and assuming a rather gloomycountenance, "I am glad to see you and to know this; but you will haveto excuse me, I am just going to the War Department to see Mr. Stanton.""Well," said the editor, "I will walk over with you." The President,with that apt good nature so characteristic of him, took up his hat andsaid, "Come along." When they reached the door of the Secretary'soffice, Mr. Lincoln turned to his companion and said, "I shall have tosee Mr. Stanton alone, and you must excuse me," and taking him by thehand he continued, "Good-bye. I hope you will feel perfectly easy abouthaving nominated me; don't be troubled about it; _I forgive you_."A gentleman who, after the dreadful disaster at Fredericksburg, calledat the White House with news direct from the front, says that Lincolnappeared so overwhelmed with grief that he was led to remark, "Iheartily wish I might be a welcome messenger of good news instead,--thatI could tell you how to conquer or get rid of these rebellious States."Looking up quickly, with a marked change of expression, Lincoln said:"That reminds me of two boys in Illinois who took a short cut across anorchard, and did not become aware of the presence of a vicious dog untilit was too late to reach either fence. One was spry enough to escape theattack by climbing a tree; but the other started around the tree, withthe dog in hot pursuit, until by making smaller circles than it waspossible for his pursuer to make, he gained sufficiently to grasp thedog's tail, and held with desperate grip until nearly exhausted, when hehailed his companion and called to him to come down. 'What for?' saidthe boy. 'I want you to help me let this dog go.' If I could only letthem go!" said the President, in conclusion; "but that is the trouble. Iam compelled to hold on to them and make them stay."In speaking of Lincoln's fortitude under his trials and sufferings, Mrs.Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote: "Although we believe he has never made anyreligious profession, we see evidence that in passing through thisdreadful national crisis he has been forced by the very anguish of thestruggle to look upward, where any rational creature must look forsupport. No man has suffered more and deeper, albeit with a dry, weary,patient pain, that seemed to some like insensibility. 'Whichever way itends,' he said to the writer, 'I have the impression that I sha'n't lastlong after it's over.' After the dreadful repulse of Fredericksburg, hisheavy eyes and worn and weary air told how our reverses wore upon him;and yet there was a never-failing fund of patience at bottom thatsometimes rose to the surface in some droll, quaint saying or story,that forced a laugh even from himself."The care and sorrow which Lincoln was called upon to endure in theresponsibilities of his high position graved their melancholy marks oneach feature of his face. He was a changed man. A pathetic picture ofhis appearance at this time is given by his old friend, Noah Brooks,whose description of him as he appeared in 1856, on the stump in OgleCounty, has already been given a place in these pages. "I did not seeLincoln again," says Mr. Brooks, "until 1862, when I went to Washingtonas a newspaper correspondent from California. When Lincoln was on thestump in 1856, his face, though naturally sallow, had a rosy flush. Hiseyes were full and bright, and he was in the fulness of health andvigor. I shall never forget the shock which the sight of him gave me sixyears later in 1862, I took it for granted that he had forgotten theyoung man whom he had met five or six times during the Fremont andDayton Campaign. He was now President, and was, like Brutus, 'vexed withmany cares.' The change which a few years had made was simply appalling.His whiskers had grown and had given additional cadaverousness to hisface as it appeared to me. The light seemed to have gone out of hiseyes, which were sunken far under his enormous brows. But there was overhis whole face an expression of sadness, and a far-away look in theeyes, which were utterly unlike the Lincoln of other days. I wasintensely disappointed. I confess that I was so pained that I couldalmost have shed tears."CHAPTER XXIII     Lincoln's Home-life in the White House--Comfort in the     Companionship of his Youngest Son--"Little Tad" the Bright Spot in     the White House--The President and his Little Boy Reviewing the     Army of the Potomac--Various Phases of Lincoln's Character--His     Literary Tastes--Fondness for Poetry and Music--His Remarkable     Memory--Not a Latin Scholar--Never Read a Novel--Solace in     Theatrical Representation--Anecdotes of Booth and     McCullough--Methods of Literary Work--Lincoln as an Orator--Caution     in Impromptu Speeches--His Literary Style--Management of his     Private Correspondence--Knowledge of Woodcraft--Trees and Human     Character--Exchanging Views with Professor Agassiz--Magnanimity     toward Opponents--Righteous Indignation--Lincoln's Religious     Nature.Of the two sons left to Lincoln after the death of Willie in 1862,Robert, the older, was a student in Harvard College until appointed toservice on the staff of General Grant; and "Little Tad," or Thomas, theyoungest, was the only one remaining in the White House during the lasthard years. He was ten years old in 1863, a bright and lovable child,with whom his father was associated in constant and affectionatecompanionship. The boy was much with him in his walks and journeys aboutWashington, and even in his visits to the army in the field. The fatherwould often gain a brief respite from his heavy cares by sharing in thesports and frolics of the light-hearted boy, who was a general favoriteat the White House, where he was free to go and come at will. No matterwho was with the President, or how intently he might be absorbed, littleTad was always welcome. "It was an impressive and affecting sight," saysMr. Carpenter, an inmate of the White House for several months, "to seethe burdened President lost for the time being in the affectionateparent, as he would take the little fellow in his arms upon thewithdrawal of visitors, and caress him with all the fondness of a motherfor the babe upon her bosom." Hon. W.D. Kelley, a member of Congress atthat time, says: "I think no father ever loved his children more fondlythan he. The President never seemed grander in my sight than when,stealing upon him in the evening, I would find him with a book openbefore him, with little Tad beside him. There were, of course, a greatmany curious books sent to him, and it seemed to be one of the specialdelights of his life to open those books at a time when his boy couldstand beside him, and they could talk as he turned over the pages, thefather thus giving to the son a portion of that care and attention ofwhich he was ordinarily deprived by the heavy duties pressing upon him."Tad lived to be eighteen years old, dying in Chicago in 1871. It waswell said of him that he "gave to the sad and solemn White House theonly comic relief it knew."When President Lincoln visited General Hooker's headquarters with theArmy of the Potomac, just before the battle of Chancellorsville, littleTad went with him, and rode with his father and General Hooker throughthe grand reviews that were held. "Over hill and dale," says a member ofthe Presidential party, "dashed the brilliant cavalcade of theGeneral-in-Chief, surrounded by a company of officers in gay attire andsparkling with gold lace, the party being escorted by the PhiladelphiaLancers, a showy troop of soldiers. In the midst, or at the head, roseand fell, as the horses galloped afar, the form of Lincoln, conspicuousby his height and his tall black hat. And ever on the flanks of thehurrying column flew, like a flag or banneret, Tad's little grayriding-cloak. The soldiers soon learned of Tad's presence in the army,and wherever he went on horseback he easily divided the honors with hisfather. The men cheered and shouted and waved their hats when they sawthe dear face and tall figure of the good President, then thebest-beloved man in the world; but to these men of war, far away fromhome and children, the sight of that fresh-faced and laughing boy seemedan inspiration. They cheered like mad."There were various phases of Lincoln's character, as manifested duringhis life in the White House, that afford material for an interestingstudy. It has been said of him that he lacked imagination. This wascertainly not one of the faculties of his mind which had been largelycultivated. He relied more upon the exercise of reason and logic, in allhis intellectual processes, than upon fancy or imagination. Still, thereare often striking figures of speech to be met with in his writings, andhe had a great fondness for poetry and music. He had studied Shakespearediligently in his youth, and portions of the plays he repeated withsingular accuracy. He had a special liking for the minor poems of ThomasHood and of Oliver Wendell Holmes. Dr. Holmes, writing in July, 1885,says that of all the tributes received by him, the one of which he wasmost proud was from "good Abraham Lincoln," who had a great liking forthe poem of "The Last Leaf," and "repeated it from memory to GovernorAndrew, as the Governor himself told me." Mr. Arnold says: "He had agreat love for poetry and eloquence, and his taste and judgment wereexcellent. Next to Shakespeare among the poets, his favorite was Burns.There was a lecture of his upon Burns full of favorite quotations andsound criticisms." His musical tastes, says Mr. Brooks, who knew himwell, "were simple and uncultivated, his choice being old airs, songs,and ballads, among which the plaintive Scotch songs were best liked.'Annie Laurie,' 'Mary of Argyle,' and especially 'Auld Robin Gray,'never lost their charm for him; and all songs which had for their themethe rapid flight of time, decay, the recollections of early days, weresure to make a deep impression. The song which he liked best, above allothers, was one called 'Twenty Years Ago'--a simple air, the words towhich are supposed to be uttered by a man who revisits the playground ofhis youth. I remember that one night at the White House, when a fewladies were with the family, singing at the piano-forte, he asked for alittle song in which the writer describes his sensations when revisitingthe scenes of his boyhood, dwelling mournfully on the vanished joys andthe delightful associations of forty years ago. It is not likely thatthere was much in Lincoln's lost youth that he would wish to recall; butthere was a certain melancholy and half-morbid strain in that song whichstruck a responsive chord in his heart. The lines sank into his memory,and I remember that he quoted them, as if to himself, long afterward."Lincoln's memory was extraordinarily retentive, and he seemed, withoutconscious effort, to have stored in his mind almost every whimsical orludicrous narrative which he had read or heard. "On several occasions,"says Mr. Brooks, "I have held in my hand a printed slip while he wasrepeating its contents to somebody else, and the precision with which hedelivered every word was marvellous." He was fond of the writings of"Orpheus C. Kerr" and "Petroleum V. Nasby," who were famous humorists atthe time of the Civil War; and he amused himself and others in thedarkest hours by quoting passages from these now forgotten authors.Nasby's letter from "Wingert's Corners, Ohio," on the threateningprospects of a migration of the negroes from the South, and thePresident's "evident intenshun of colonizin' on 'em in the North," heespecially relished. After rehearsing a portion of this letter to hisguests at the Soldiers' Home one evening, a sedate New England gentlemanexpressed surprise that he could find time for memorizing such things."Oh," said Lincoln, "I don't. If I like a thing, it _just sticks_ afteronce reading it or hearing it." He once recited a long and dolefulballad, something like "Vilikins and his Dinah," the production of arural Kentucky bard, and when he had finished he added with a laugh, "Idon't believe I have thought of that before for forty years." Mr. Arnoldtestifies that "although his reading was not extensive, yet his memorywas so retentive and so ready that in history, poetry, and in generalliterature, few if any marked any deficiency. As an illustration of thepowers of his memory, may be related the following: A gentleman calledat the White House one day, and introduced to him two officers servingin the army, one a Swede and the other a Norwegian. Immediately herepeated, to their delight, a poem of some eight or ten versesdescriptive of Scandinavian scenery, and an old Norse legend. He said hehad read the poem in a newspaper some years before, and liked it, but ithad passed out of his memory until their visit had recalled it. The twobooks which he read most were the Bible and Shakespeare. With these hewas perfectly familiar. From the Bible, as has before been stated, hequoted frequently, and he read it daily, while Shakespeare was hisconstant companion. He took a copy with him almost always whentravelling, and read it at leisure moments."Lincoln was never ashamed to confess the deficiencies in his earlyeducation. A distinguished party, comprising George Thompson, theEnglish anti-slavery orator, Rev. John Pierpont, Oliver Johnson, andHon. Lewis Clephane, once called upon him, and during the conversationMr. Pierpont turned to Mr. Thompson and repeated a Latin quotation fromthe classics. Mr. Lincoln, leaning forward in his chair, looked from oneto the other inquiringly, and then remarked, with a smile, "_Which_, Isuppose you are both aware, _I_ do not understand."While Edwin Forrest was playing an engagement at Ford's Theatre, Mr.Carpenter spoke to the President one day of the actor's fineinterpretation of the character of Richelieu, and advised him to witnessthe performance. "Who wrote the play?" asked the President of Mr.Carpenter. "Bulwer," was the reply. "Ah!" he rejoined; "well, I knewBulwer wrote novels, but I did not know he was a play-writer also. Itmay seem somewhat strange to say," he continued, "but _I never read anentire novel in my life_. I once commenced 'Ivanhoe,' but never finishedit."Among the few diversions which Lincoln allowed himself in Washington wasan occasional visit to the theater to witness a representation of somegood play by a favorite actor. He felt the necessity of some relaxationfrom the terrible strain of anxiety and care; and while seated behindthe screen in a box at the theatre he was secure from the everlastingimportunities of politicians and office-seekers. He could forget himselfand his problems while watching the scenes on the mimic stage beforehim. He enjoyed the renditions of Booth with great zest; yet afterwitnessing "The Merchant of Venice" he remarked on the way home: "It wasa good performance, but I had a thousand times rather read it at home,if it were not for Booth's playing. A farce or a comedy is best_played_; a tragedy is best _read_ at home." He was much pleased onenight with Mr. McCullough's delineation of the character of "Edgar,"which the actor played in support of Edwin Forrest's "Lear." He wishedto convey his approval to the young actor, and asked Mr. Brooks, hiscompanion at the moment, with characteristic simplicity, "Do you supposehe would come to the box if we sent word?" Mr. McCullough was summoned,and, standing at the door of the box in his stage attire, received thethanks of the President, accompanied with words of discriminating praisefor the excellence of his delineation.With his keen sense of humor, Lincoln appreciated to the utmost theinimitable presentation of "Falstaff" by a well-known actor of the time.His desire to accord praise wherever it was merited led him to expresshis admiration in a note to the actor. An interchange of slightcivilities followed, ending at last in a singular situation. Enteringthe President's office late one evening, Mr. Brooks noticed the actorsitting in the waiting-room. Lincoln inquired anxiously if there wereanyone outside. On being told, he said, half sadly, almost desperately,"Oh, I can't see him; I can't see him! I was in hopes he had gone away."Then he added, "Now, this illustrates the difficulty of having pleasantfriends in this place. You know I liked him as an actor, and that Iwrote to tell him so. He sent me a book, and there I thought the matterwould end. He is a master of his place in the profession, I suppose, andwell fixed in it. But just because we had a little friendlycorrespondence, such as any two men might have, he wants something. Whatdo you suppose he wants?" I could not guess, and Lincoln added, "Well,he wants to be consul at London. Oh, dear!"Lincoln was not a ready writer, and when preparing documents or speechesof special importance he altered and elaborated his sentences withpatient care. His public utterances were so widely reported and somercilessly discussed that he acquired caution in expressing himselfwithout due preparation. It is stated, on what seems sufficientauthority, that his Gettysburg speech, brief and simple as it is, wasrewritten many times before it finally met his approval. He began alsoto be guarded in responding to demands for impromptu speeches, whichwere constantly being called for. Mr. Brooks relates that "once, beingnotified that he was to be serenaded, just after some notable militaryor political event, he asked me to come to dinner, 'so as to be on handand see the fun afterward,' as he said. He excused himself as soon as wehad dined, and while the bands were playing, the crowds cheering and therockets bursting outside the house, he made his reappearance in theparlor with a roll of manuscript in his hand. Perhaps noticing a look ofsurprise on my face, he said, 'I know what you are thinking about. Youthink it mighty queer that an old stump-speaker like myself should notbe able to address a crowd like this outside without a written speech.But you must remember that in a certain way I am talking to the country,and I have to be mighty careful. Now, the last time I made an off-handspeech, in answer to a serenade, I used the phrase, as applied to therebels, "turned tail and ran." Some very nice Boston folks, I am grievedto hear, were very much outraged by that phrase, which they thoughtimproper. So I resolved to make no more impromptu speeches if I couldhelp it.'"In all Lincoln's writings, even his most important state papers, hischief desire was to make himself clearly understood by the commonreader. He had a great aversion to what he called "machine writing," andused the fewest words possible to express his meaning. He neverhesitated to employ a homely expression when it suited his purpose. Inhis first message the phrase "sugar-coated" occurred; and when it wasprinted, Mr. Defrees, the Public Printer, being on familiar terms withthe President, ventured an objection to the phrase--suggesting thatLincoln was not now preparing a campaign document or delivering a stumpspeech in Illinois, but constructing an important state paper that wouldgo down historically to all coming time; and that therefore he did notconsider the phrase "sugar-coated" as entirely a becoming and dignifiedone. "Well, Defrees," replied Lincoln, good-naturedly, "if you think thetime will ever come when the people will not understand what'sugar-coated' means, I'll alter it; otherwise, I think I'll let it go."On the same subject, Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe says: "Our ownpoliticians were somewhat shocked with his state papers at first. 'Whynot let _us_ make them a little more conventional, and file them to aclassical pattern?' 'No,' was his reply, 'I shall write them myself._The people will understand them_.' 'But this or that form of expressionis not elegant, not classical.' '_The people will understand it_,' hasbeen his invariable reply. And whatever may be said of his state papersas compared with the classic standards, it has been a fact that theyhave always been wonderfully well understood by the people, and thatsince the time of Washington the state papers of no President have morecontrolled the popular mind. One reason for this is that they have beeninformal and undiplomatic. They have more resembled a father's talk tohis children than a state paper. They have had that relish and smack ofthe soil that appeal to the simple human heart and head, which is agreater power in writing than the most artful devices of rhetoric.Lincoln might well say with the apostle, 'But though I be rude inspeech, yet not in knowledge, but we have been thoroughly _made manifestamong you_ in all things.' His rejection of what is called 'finewriting' was as deliberate as St. Paul's, and for the samereason--because he felt that he was speaking on a subject which must bemade clear to the lowest intellect, though it should fail to captivatethe highest. But we say of Lincoln's writing, that for all true manlypurposes there are passages in his state papers that could not be betterput; they are absolutely perfect. They are brief, condensed, intense,and with a power of insight and expression which make them worthy to beinscribed in letters of gold."Hon. William J. Bryan, certainly a competent judge of oratory, says ofLincoln as an orator: "Brevity is the soul of wit, and a part ofLincoln's reputation for wit lies in his ability to condense a greatdeal into a few words. He was epigrammatic. His Gettysburg speech is theworld's model in eloquence, elegance, and condensation. He was apt inillustration--no one more so. A simple story or simile drawn fromevery-day life flashed before his hearers the argument that he wanted topresent. He made frequent use of Bible language, and of illustrationsdrawn from Holy Writ. It is said that when he was preparing hisSpringfield speech of 1858 he spent hours in trying to find languagethat would express the central idea--that a republic could notpermanently endure part free and part slave. Finally a Bible passageflashed through his mind, and he exclaimed, 'I have found it--_a housedivided against itself cannot stand_.' Probably no other Bible passageever exerted as much influence as this one in the settlement of a greatcontroversy."Lincoln was a tireless worker, and delegated no duties to others whichhe could perform himself. His health seemed to bear the strain of histerrible burdens wonderfully well. There are but few references anywhereto his being incapacitated by illness. One such reference occurs inWelles's Diary, dated March 14, 1865: "The President was somewhatindisposed, but not seriously ill. The members [of the Cabinet] met inhis bedroom." His correspondence was extensive and burdensome, and as arule he wrote his most important letters with his own hand, frequentlygoing to the trouble of taking copies, which were filed with carefulorder in a cabinet, the interior of which was divided into pigeon-holes.These pigeon-holes, as Mr. Brooks tells us, "were lettered inalphabetical order, but a few were devoted to individuals. HoraceGreeley had a pigeon-hole by himself; so did each of several generalswho wrote often to him. One compartment, labelled 'W. & W.,' excitedmuch curiosity, but I never asked what it meant, and one night, beingsent to the cabinet for a letter which the President wanted, he said, 'Isee you looking at my "W. & W." Can you guess what that stands for?' Ofcourse it was useless to guess. 'Well,' said he, with a roguish twinkleof the eye, 'that's Weed and Wood--Thurlow and Fernandy.' Then he added,with an indescribable chuckle, 'That's a pair of 'em.' When asked why hedid not have a letter-book and copying-press, he said, 'A letter-bookmight be easily stolen and carried off, but that stock of filed letterswould be a _back-load_.'"A lady who once rode with Lincoln, in the Presidential carriage, to theSoldiers' Home, gives some interesting details concerning his knowledgeof woodcraft. "Around the 'Home,'" says this lady, "grows every varietyof tree, particularly of the evergreen class. Their branches brushedinto the carriage as we passed along, and left with us that pleasantwoodsy smell belonging to fresh leaves. One of the ladies, catching abit of green from one of these intruding branches, said it was cedar,and another thought it spruce. 'Let me discourse on a theme Iunderstand,' said the President. 'I know all about trees, by right ofbeing a backwoodsman. I'll show you the difference between spruce,pine, and cedar, and this shred of green, which is neither one nor theother, but a kind of illegitimate cypress.' He then proceeded to gatherspecimens of each, and explain the distinctive formation of foliagebelonging to every species. 'Trees,' he said, 'are as deceptive in theirlikeness to one another as are certain classes of men, amongst whom nonebut a physiognomist's eye can detect dissimilar moral features untilevents have developed them. Do you know it would be a good thing if inall the schools proposed and carried out by the improvement of modernthinkers, we could have _a school of events_?' 'A school of events?'repeated the lady addressed. 'Yes,' he continued, 'since it is only bythat active development that character and ability can be tested.Understand me, I now mean men, not trees; _they_ can be tried, and ananalysis of their strength obtained less expensive to life and humaninterests than man's. What I say now is a mere whim, you know; but whenI speak of a school of events, I mean one in which, before entering reallife, students might pass through the mimic vicissitudes and situationsthat are necessary to bring out their powers and mark the calibre towhich they are assigned. Thus, one could select from the graduates aninvincible soldier, equal to any position, with no such word as fail; amartyr to right, ready to give up life in the cause; a politician toocunning to be outwitted; and so on. These things have all to be tried,and their sometime failure creates confusion as well as disappointment.There is no more dangerous or expensive analysis than that whichconsists of _trying a man_.'"Among Lincoln's callers one Sunday evening, was the distinguishedscientist Louis Agassiz. The two men were somewhat alike in theirsimple, shy, and unpretending nature, and at first felt their way witheach other like two bashful schoolboys. Lincoln began conversation bysaying to Agassiz, "I never knew how to pronounce your name properly;won't you give me a little lesson at that, please?" Then he asked if thename were of French or Swiss derivation, to which the Professor repliedthat it was partly of each. That led to a discussion of differentlanguages, the President speaking several words in different languageswhich had the same root as similar words in our own tongue; then heillustrated that by one or two anecdotes. But he soon returned to hisgentle cross-examination of Agassiz, and found out how the Professorstudied, how he composed, and how he delivered his lectures; how hefound different tastes in his audiences in different portions of thecountry. When afterwards asked why he put such questions to his learnedvisitor, he said, "Why, what we got from him isn't printed in the books;the other things are." But Lincoln did not do all the questioning. Inhis turn, Agassiz asked Lincoln if he had ever engaged in lecturing.Lincoln gave the outline of a lecture, which he had partly written yearsbefore, to show the origin of inventions and prove that there is nothingnew under the sun. "I think I can show," said he, "at least, in afanciful way, that all the modern inventions were known centuries ago."Agassiz begged that Lincoln would finish the lecture sometime. Lincolnreplied that he had the manuscript somewhere in his papers, "and," saidhe, "when I get out of this place, I'll finish it up, perhaps."So great was Lincoln's magnanimity, and so keen his sense of justice,that he never allowed personal considerations to influence his officialacts. It is probably true that it was easy for him to forgive an injury;but he was incapable of using his position as President to gratify hisprivate resentments. It was once represented to him that a recentappointee to an important office had been bitterly opposed to himpolitically. "I suppose," said he, "the Judge did behave pretty ugly;but that wouldn't make him any less fit for this place, and I have aScriptural authority for appointing him. You recollect that while theLord on Mount Sinai was getting out a commission for Aaron, that sameAaron was at the foot of the mountain making a false god, a golden calf,for the people to worship; yet Aaron got his commission, you know." Atanother time, when remonstrated with upon the appointment to place ofone of his former opponents, he said: "Nobody will deny that he is afirst-rate man for the place, and I am bound to see that his oppositionto me personally shall not interfere with my giving the people a goodofficer." And on another similar occasion, when remonstrated with bymembers of his Cabinet, he said: "Oh, I can't afford to punish everyperson who has seen fit to oppose my election. We want a competent manin this office, and I know of no one who could perform the duties betterthan the one proposed."With all his self-abnegation, Lincoln could be stern when the occasionwarranted it. As an illustration the following incident is related: Anofficer who had been cashiered from the service, forced himself severaltimes into Lincoln's presence, to plead for a reversal of his sentence.Each time he read a long argument attempting to prove that he hadreceived unjust treatment. The President listened to him patiently; butthe facts, on their most favorable showing, did not seem to him tosanction his interference. In the last interview, the man became angry,and turning abruptly said: "Well, Mr. President, I see you aredetermined not to do me justice!" This was too much, even for thelong-suffering Lincoln. Manifesting, however, no more feeling than thatindicated by a slight compression of the lips, he quietly arose, laiddown a package of papers he held in his hands, and then, suddenlyseizing the disgraced officer by the coat collar, he marched himforcibly to the door, saying, as he ejected him into the passage, "Sir,I give you fair warning never to show yourself in this room again. I canbear censure, but not insult!" In a whining tone the man begged for hispapers, which he had dropped. "Begone, sir," said the President, "yourpapers will be sent to you. I wish never to see your face again!"Much has been said about Lincoln's views on religion. Like many othergreat men, he was not what might technically be called a Christian. Hewas a religious man in spirit and by nature; yet he never joined achurch. Mrs. Lincoln says that he had no religious faith, in the usualacceptation of the word, but that religion was a sort of poetry in hisnature. "Twice during his life," she said, "he seemed especially tothink about it. Once was when our boy Willie died. Once--and this timehe thought of it more deeply--was when he went to Gettysburg." Butwhatever his inner thoughts may have been, no man on earth had a firmerfaith in Providence than Abraham Lincoln. Perhaps he did not himselfknow just where he stood. He believed in God--in immortality. He did notbelieve in eternal punishment, but was confident of rest and peace afterthis life was over. He may not have felt certain of the divine origin ofall parts of the Bible, but he valued its precepts, and his whole lifegave evidence of faith in a higher power than that of man. Mr. Nicolay,his secretary, testifies that "his nature was deeply religious, but hebelonged to no denomination; he had faith in the eternal justice andboundless mercy of Providence, and made the Golden Rule of Christ hispractical creed." And Dr. Phillips Brooks, in an eloquent and expressivepassage, calls him "Shepherd of the people--that old name that the bestrulers ever craved. What ruler ever won it like this President of ours?He fed us faithfully and truly. He fed us with counsel when we were indoubt, with inspiration when we sometimes faltered, with caution when wewould be rash, with calm, clear, trustful cheerfulness through many anhour when our hearts were dark. He fed hungry souls all over the countrywith sympathy and consolation. He spread before the whole land feasts ofgreat duty and devotion and patriotism on which the land grew strong. Hefed us with solemn, solid truths. He taught us the sacredness ofgovernment, the wickedness of treason. He made our souls glad andvigorous with the love of Liberty that was in his. He showed us how tolove truth, and yet be charitable; how to hate wrong and all oppression,and yet not treasure one personal injury or insult. He fed all hispeople, from the highest to the lowest, from the most privileged down tothe most enslaved. 'He fed them with a faithful and true heart.'"CHAPTER XXIV     Trials of the Administration in 1863--Hostility to War     Measures--Lack of Confidence at the North--Opposition in     Congress--How Lincoln felt about the "Fire in the Rear"--Criticisms     from Various Quarters--Visit of "the Boston Set"--The Government on     a Tight-rope--The Enlistment of Colored Troops--Interview between     Lincoln and Frederick Douglass--Reverses in the Field--Changes of     Military Leaders--From Burnside to Hooker--Lincoln's First Meeting     with "Fighting Joe"--The President's Solicitude--His Warning Letter     to Hooker--His Visit to the Rappahannock--Hooker's Self-confidence     the "Worst Thing about Him"--The Defeat at Chancellorsville--The     Failure of our Generals--"Wanted, a Man."It is impossible, without a close study of the inner history of the warand of the acts of the administration, to conceive of the harassing andbaffling difficulties which beset President Lincoln's course in everydirection, and of the jealous, narrow, and bitter opposition which hismore important measures provoked. As the struggle advanced he found inhis front a solid and defiant South, behind him a divided anddistrustful North. What might be called the party of action and ofextreme measures developed a sharp hostility to the President. He wouldnot go fast enough to suit them; they thought him disposed tocompromise. They began by criticizing his policy, and his methods ofprosecuting the war; from this they passed rapidly to a criticism of thePresident himself. In the affectionate admiration felt for him now,people have forgotten how weak and poor and craven they found him then.So far had this disapproval and hostility gone, that early in 1863 wefind Mr. Greeley searching everywhere for a fitting successor to Lincolnfor the Presidency at the next term. There were but few men in highofficial station in Washington who at that time unqualifiedly sustainedhim. In the House of Representatives there were but two members whocould make themselves heard, who stood actively by him. This matter,long since forgotten, must be recalled to show clearly the President'sstraits, and his action and bearing amidst his difficulties. It shouldbe remembered that party lines, which disappeared at the beginning ofthe war, were again clearly drawn; and the Democratic wing of Congress,under the leadership of Vallandigham of Ohio, actively opposed many ofthe necessary measures for the prosecution of the war. The cry hadalready been raised in Congress, "The South cannot be subjugated"; andevery fresh disaster to the national arms was hailed as proof of theassertion.The effect of this abuse and opposition was exceedingly painful toLincoln. He said: "I have been caused more anxiety, I have _passed moresleepless nights_, on account of the temper and attitude of theDemocratic party in the North regarding the suppression of the rebellionthan by the rebels in the South. I have always had faith that our armieswould ultimately and completely triumph; but these enemies in the Northcause me a great deal of anxiety and apprehension. Can it be that thereare opposing opinions in the North as to the necessity of putting downthis rebellion? How can men hesitate a moment as to the duty of theGovernment to restore its authority in every part of the country? It isincomprehensible to me that men living in their quiet homes under theprotection of laws, in possession of their property, can sympathize withand give aid and comfort to those who are doing their utmost tooverthrow that Government which makes life and everything they possessvaluable."In January, 1863, a party of distinguished gentlemen from Bostonvisited the national capital, in order to confer with the President onthe workings of the emancipation policy. They made the visit chiefly atthe suggestion of Ralph Waldo Emerson, who during all the trying yearsof the war never lost faith in Lincoln's honesty and sense of justice.Secretary Stanton made no secret of his opposition to these gentlemen,who were spoken of rather slightingly as "that Boston set." The "Bostonset" were uncompromising abolitionists, and nothing would satisfy thembut immediate and aggressive measures for enforcing the policy ofemancipation. As it was the President's instinct to feel his way slowlyin pushing on the great measures necessary to the safe guidance of thenation in its perilous crisis, they were naturally dissatisfied with hisconservative methods and tendencies. The visitors--including SenatorWilson, Wendell Phillips, Francis W. Bird, Elizur Wright, J.H.Stephenson, George L. Stearns, Oakes Ames, and Moncure D. Conway--calledon the President one Sunday evening, at the White House. "The Presidentmet us," says Mr. Conway, "laughing like a boy, saying that in themorning one of his children had come to inform him that the cat hadkittens, and now another had just announced that the dog had puppies,and the White House was in a decidedly sensational state. Some of ourparty looked a little glum at this hilarity; but it was pathetic to seethe change in the President's face when he presently resumed his burdenof care. We were introduced by Senator Wilson, who began to speak of usseverally, when Mr. Lincoln said he knew perfectly who we were, andrequested us to be seated. Nothing could be more gracious than hismanner, or more simple. The conversation was introduced by WendellPhillips, who, with all his courtesy, expressed our gratitude and joyat the Proclamation of Emancipation, and asked how it seemed to beworking. The President said that he had not expected much from it atfirst, and consequently had not been disappointed; he had hoped, andstill hoped, that something would come of it after awhile. Phillips thenalluded to the deadly hostility which the proclamation had naturallyexcited in pro-slavery quarters, and gently hinted that the Northernpeople, now generally anti-slavery, were not satisfied that it was beinghonestly carried out by all of the nation's agents and Generals in theSouth. 'My own impression, Mr. Phillips,' said the President, 'is thatthe masses of the country generally are dissatisfied chiefly at our lackof military successes. Defeat and failure in the field make everythingseem wrong.' His face was now clouded, and his next words were somewhatbitter. 'Most of us here present,' he said, 'have been nearly all ourlives working in minorities, and many have got into a habit of beingdissatisfied.' Several of those present having deprecated this, thePresident said, 'At any rate, it has been very rare that an opportunityof "running" this administration has been lost.' To this Mr. Phillipsanswered, in his sweetest voice: 'If we see this administrationearnestly working to free the country from slavery and its rebellion, wewill show you how we can "run" it into another four years of power.' ThePresident's good humor was restored by this, and he said: 'Oh, Mr.Phillips, I have ceased to have any personal feeling or expectation inthat matter--I do not say I never had any--so abused and borne upon as Ihave been.' ... On taking our leave we expressed to the President ourthanks for his kindly reception, and for his attention to statements ofwhich some were naturally not welcome. The President bowed graciously atthis, and, after saying he was happy to have met gentlemen known to himby distinguished services, if not personally, and glad to listen totheir views, added, 'I must bear this load which the country hasintrusted to me as well as I can, and do the best I can with it.'"To another self-constituted delegation--this time from the West--whocalled at the White House one day, excited and troubled about some ofthe commissions or omissions of the administration, the President, afterhearing them patiently, replied: "Gentlemen, suppose all the propertyyou were worth was in gold, and you had put it in the hands of Blondinto carry across the Niagara river on a rope; would you shake the cable,or keep shouting out to him, 'Blondin, stand up a littlestraighter!--Blondin, stoop a little more--go a little faster--lean alittle more to the north--lean a little more to the south'? No! youwould hold your breath as well as your tongue, and keep your hands offuntil he was safe over. The Government is carrying an immense weight.Untold treasures are in their hands. They are doing the very best theycan. Don't badger them. Keep silence, and we'll get you safe across."In 1863 the Government, following logically the policy of theEmancipation act, began the experiment of introducing colored soldiersinto our armies. This caused not only intense anger at the South, butmuch doubt and dissatisfaction at the North. To discuss some of thepractical and difficult questions growing out of this measure, FrederickDouglass, the most distinguished representative of the race whichAmerica had so long held in chains, was presented to the President. Theaccount of the conference, given by Douglass, is singularly interesting.He says: "I was never more quickly or more completely put at ease in thepresence of a great man than in that of Abraham Lincoln. He was seated,when I entered, in a low arm-chair, with his feet extended on thefloor, surrounded by a large number of documents and several busysecretaries. The room bore the marks of business, and the persons in it,the President included, appeared to be much overworked and tired. Longlines of care were already deeply written on Mr. Lincoln's brow, and hisstrong face, full of earnestness, lighted up as soon as my name wasmentioned. As I approached and was introduced to him, he arose andextended his hand, and bade me welcome. I at once felt myself in thepresence of an honest man--one whom I could love, honor, and trust,without reserve or doubt. Proceeding to tell him who I was and what Iwas doing, he promptly but kindly stopped me, saying: 'I know who youare, Mr. Douglass; Mr. Seward has told me all about you. Sit down; I amglad to see you.' I urged, among other things, the necessity of grantingthe colored soldiers equal pay and promotion with white soldiers, andretaliation for colored prisoners killed by the enemy. Mr. Lincolnadmitted the justice of my demand for equal pay and promotion of coloredsoldiers, but on the matter of retaliation he differed from me entirely.I shall never forget the benignant expression of his face, the tearfullook of his eye, and the quiver in his voice, when he deprecated aresort to retaliatory measures. 'Once begun,' said he, 'I do not knowwhere such a measure would stop.' He said he could not take men out andkill them in cold blood for what was done by others. If he could gethold of the persons who were guilty of killing the colored prisoners incold blood, the case would be different; but he could not kill theinnocent for the guilty. Afterwards we discussed the means mostdesirable to be employed outside the army to induce the slaves in therebel States to come within the Federal lines. The increasing oppositionto the war in the North, and the mad cry against it because it wasbeing made an abolition war, alarmed Mr. Lincoln, and made himapprehensive that a peace might be forced upon him which would leavestill in slavery all who had not come within our lines. What he wantedwas to make his proclamation as effective as possible in the event ofsuch a peace. He said, in a regretful tone, 'The slaves are not cominginto our lines as rapidly and numerously as I had hoped.' I replied thatthe slaveholders knew how to keep such things from their slaves, andprobably very few knew of his proclamation. 'Well,' he said, 'I want youto set about devising some means of making them acquainted with it, andfor bringing them into our lines.' What he said showed a deeper moralconviction against slavery than I had ever seen before in anythingspoken or written by him. I listened with the deepest interest andprofoundest satisfaction, and, at his suggestion, agreed to undertakethe organizing of a band of scouts, composed of colored men, whosebusiness should be, somewhat after the original plan of John Brown, togo into the rebel States beyond the lines of our armies, carry the newsof emancipation, and urge the slaves to come within our boundaries."Frederick Douglass once remarked that Lincoln was one of the few whitemen he ever passed an hour with who failed to remind him in some way,before the interview terminated, that he was a negro. "He alwaysimpressed me as a strong, earnest man, having no time or disposition totrifle; grappling with all his might the work he had in hand. Theexpression of his face was a blending of suffering with patience andfortitude. Men called him homely, and homely he was; but it wasmanifestly a human homeliness. His eyes had in them the tenderness ofmotherhood, and his mouth and other features the highest perfection of agenuine manhood."As though the political difficulties that beset President Lincoln inthe first half of 1863 were not discouragement enough, they wereattended by disheartening reverses to our arms. It will be rememberedthat on the removal of General McClellan from command of the Army of thePotomac, in November, 1862, General Burnside succeeded him. The changeproved an unfortunate one. General Burnside was an earnest and gallantsoldier, but was not equal to the vast responsibilities of his newposition. It is said, to his credit, that he was three times offered thecommand of the Army of the Potomac, and three times he declined. Finallyit was pressed upon him by positive orders, and he could no longer,without insubordination, refuse it. In addressing General Halleck, afterhis appointment, he said: "Had I been asked to take it, I should havedeclined; but being ordered, I cheerfully obey." After his fearfuldefeat at Fredericksburg (December 13, 1862), he said: "_The fault wasmine_. The entire responsibility of failure must rest on my shoulders."By his manly and courageous bearing, and the strong sincerity of hischaracter, he retained the respect and sympathy of the President and ofthe country. He immediately retired from command of the Army of thePotomac, which, under his brief leadership, had fought the most bloodyand disastrous battle in its history.General Joseph Hooker, the fourth commander of the heroic butunfortunate Army of the Potomac, was appointed to that position byPresident Lincoln in January, 1863. The two men had met briefly early inthe war, when Hooker, then living in California, hastened to Washingtonto offer his services to the Government; but for some reason GeneralScott disliked him, and his offer was not accepted. After some months,Hooker, giving up the idea of getting a command, decided to return toCalifornia; but before leaving he called to pay his respects to thePresident. He was introduced as "Captain Hooker." The President, beingpressed for time, was about to dismiss him with a few civil phrases;when, to his surprise, Hooker began the following speech: "Mr.President, my friend makes a mistake. I am not 'Captain Hooker,' but wasonce 'Lieutenant-Colonel Hooker' of the regular army. I was lately afarmer in California. Since the rebellion broke out I have been tryingto get into the service; but I find I am not wanted. I am about toreturn home; but before going, I was anxious to pay my respects to you,and to express my wishes for your personal welfare and success inquelling this rebellion. And I want to say one word more. I was at BullRun the other day, Mr. President, and it is no vanity in me to say _am ad----d sight better general than you had on that field_." This was said,not in the tone of a braggart, but of a man who knew what he was talkingabout; and, as the President afterward said, he appeared at that momentas if perfectly able to make good his words. Lincoln seized his hand,making him sit down, and began an extended chat. The result was thatHooker did not return to California, but in a few weeks _Captain_ Hookerwas _Brigadier-General_ Hooker. He served with distinction underMcClellan in the Peninsular campaign and at Antietam, and commanded theright wing of the army at Fredericksburg. He had come to be known as"Fighting Joe Hooker," and was generally regarded as one of the mostvigorous and efficient Generals of the Union army.Such was the man who, in one of the darkest hours of the Union cause,was selected to lead once more the Army of the Potomac against theenemy. This army, since its defeat at Fredericksburg, had remaineddisorganized and ineffective. Its new commander, unlike his predecessorBurnside, was full of confidence. The President, made cautious byexperience, deemed it his duty to accompany the appointment by sometimely words of warning; and accordingly he addressed to General Hookerthe following frank, manly, and judicious letter.     EXECUTIVE MANSION WASHINGTON, D.C.     January 26, 1863.     MAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER.     GENERAL:--I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac.     Of course, I have done this upon what appear to me to be sufficient     reasons; and yet I think it best for you to know that there are     some things in regard to which I am not satisfied with you. I     believe you to be a brave and skilful soldier, which of course I     like. I also believe that you do not mix politics with your     profession, in which you are right. You have confidence in     yourself, which is a valuable if not indispensable quality. You are     ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds, does good rather than     harm; but I think that during General Burnside's command of the     army you have taken counsel with your ambition, and thwarted him as     much as you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country     and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer. I have     heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying that     both the army and the Government needed a dictator. Of course, it     was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you the     command. Only those generals who gain success can be dictators.     What I now ask from you is military success, and I will risk the     dictatorship. The Government will support you to the utmost of its     ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done and will     do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit which you have     aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their commander and     withholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall     assist you, as far as I can, to pull it down. Neither you nor     Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an     army while such a spirit prevails in it. And now, beware of     rashness. _Beware of rashness_; but with energy and sleepless     vigilance, go forward and give us victories.     Yours very truly,     A. LINCOLN.In all Lincoln's writings there are few things finer than this letter.In its candor and friendliness, its simplicity and deep wisdom, and itsclearness of expression, it is almost perfect; and the President's deepsolicitude for the safety of the army and anxiety for its success give apathetic touch to the closing sentences. This solicitude found partialrelief in a personal inspection of the Army of the Potomac, which wasmade in April, just before the battle of Chancellorsville, and occupiedfive or six days. The President was accompanied by Attorney-GeneralBates, Mrs. Lincoln, his son Tad, and Mr. Noah P. Brooks. The firstnight out was spent on the little steamer which conveyed the party totheir destination. After all had retired to rest except the anxiousPresident and one or two others, Lincoln gave utterance to hisdeep-seated apprehensions in the whispered query to his friend, "Howmany of our monitors will you wager are at the bottom of CharlestonHarbor?" "I essayed," writes Mr. Brooks, "to give a cheerful view of theCharleston situation. But he would not be encouraged. He then went on tosay that he did not believe that an attack by water on Charleston couldever possibly succeed. He talked a long time about his 'notions,' as hecalled them; and at General Halleck's headquarters next day, the firstinquiries were for 'rebel papers,' which were usually brought in fromthe picket lines. These he examined with great anxiety, hoping that hemight find an item of news from Charleston. One day, having looked allover a Richmond paper several times without finding a paragraph which hehad been told was in it, he was mightily pleased to have it pointed outto him, and said, 'It is plain that newspapers are made for newspapermen; being only a layman, it was impossible for me to find that.'"The out-door life, the constant riding, and the respite from themonstrous burdens at the capital, appeared to afford mental and physicalbenefit to the worn President. But in answer to a remark expressing thisconviction, he replied sadly, "I don't know about 'the rest' as you callit. I suppose it is good for the body. But the tired part of me is_inside_ and out of reach." "He rode a great deal," says Mr. Brooks,"while with the army, always preferring the saddle to the elegantambulance which had been provided for him. He sat his horse well, but herode hard, and during his stay I think he regularly used up at least onehorse each day. Little Tad invariably followed in his father's train;and, mounted on a smaller horse, accompanied by an orderly, theyoungster was a conspicuous figure, as his gray cloak flew in the windwhile we hung on the flanks of Hooker and his generals."General Hooker was now planning his great movement against Richmond, andtalked freely of the matter with the President, In the course of aconversation, Lincoln casually remarked, "If you get to Richmond,General." But Hooker interrupted him with--"Excuse me, Mr. President,but there is no 'if' in the case. _I am going straight to Richmond, if Ilive_!" Later in the day, Lincoln, privately referring to thisself-confidence of the General, said to Mr. Brooks, rather mournfully,"It is about the worst thing I have seen since I have been down here."In further illustration of Hooker's confidence in himself, Mr. Brookssays: "One night, Hooker and I being alone in his hut, the Generalstanding with his back to the fireplace, alert, handsome, full ofcourage and confidence, said laughingly, 'The President says you knowabout that letter he wrote me on taking command.' I acknowledged thatthe President had read it to me. The General seemed to think that theadvice was well-meant, but unnecessary. Then he added, with thatcharming assurance which became him so well, 'After I have been toRichmond, I am going to have that letter printed.'" But all that came ofHooker's confidence, after three months of elaborate preparation, was agrand forward movement into Virginia and another bloody and humiliatingdefeat for the heroic but unfortunate army under his command.The first of May, 1863, the Army of the Potomac under Hooker met theArmy of Northern Virginia under Lee and Jackson, near Chancellorsville,Virginia. It was here that Jackson executed his brilliant and successfulflank movement around the Union right, ensuring a victory for his sidebut losing his own life. After a contest of several days, involving thefruitless sacrifice of thousands of gallant soldiers, Hooker's army fellback and recrossed the Rappahannock.[G]The news of this fresh disaster was an almost stunning shock toPresident Lincoln. During the progress of the battle he was under acruel strain of anxiety and suspense. Secretary Welles, who was withhim a part of the time, says: "He had a feverish eagerness for facts;was constantly up and down, for nothing reliable came from the front."Mr. Noah Brooks relates that in company with an old friend of Lincoln'she was waiting in one of the family rooms of the White House. "A dooropened and Lincoln appeared, holding an open telegram in his hand. Thesight of his face and figure was frightful. He seemed stricken withdeath. Almost tottering to a chair, he sat down; and then I mechanicallynoticed that his face was of the same color as the wall behind him--notpale, not even sallow, but gray, like ashes. Extending the despatch tome, he said, with a hollow, far-off voice, 'Read it--news from thearmy.' The telegram was from General Butterfield, I think, then chief ofstaff to Hooker. It was very brief, simply saying that the Army of thePotomac had 'safely recrossed the Rappahannock,' and was now at its oldposition on the north bank of that stream. The President's friend, Dr.Henry, an old man and somewhat impressionable, burst into tears,--not somuch, probably, at the news as on account of its effect upon Lincoln.The President regarded the old man for an instant with dry eyes, andsaid, '_What will the country say? Oh, what will the country say_?' Heseemed hungry for consolation and cheer, and sat a little while talkingabout the failure. Yet it did not seem that he was disappointed so muchfor himself, but that he thought the country would be."Lincoln's anxiety regarding the effect at the North of these repeatedreverses was not without sufficient cause. Aside from those who werepositively opposed to the war, the loyal people were wearying of theuseless slaughter, the unavailing struggles, of the gallant soldiers.The growing distrust of the capacity of their military leaders was alsokeenly felt. The feeling of that time is so well expressed in a stirringpoem entitled "Wanted, a Man," written by Mr. E.C. Stedman, that it isgiven place here. It has an additional personal interest connected withPresident Lincoln in the fact that he was so impressed with the piecethat he read it aloud to his assembled Cabinet.    Back from the trebly crimsoned field      Terrible words are thunder-tost;    Full of the wrath that will not yield,      Full of revenge for battles lost!      Hark to their echo, as it crost    The Capital, making faces wan:      End this murderous holocaust;    Abraham Lincoln, give us a MAN!    Give us a man of God's own mould,      Born to marshal his fellow-men;    One whose fame is not bought and sold      At the stroke of a politician's pen;      Give us the man of thousands ten,    Fit to do as well as to plan;      Give us a rallying-cry, and then,    Abraham Lincoln, give us a MAN!    No leader to shirk the boasting foe,      And to march and countermarch our brave    Till they fall like ghosts in the marshes low,      And swamp-grass covers each nameless grave;      Nor another, whose fatal banners wave    Aye in Disaster's shameful van;      Nor another, to bluster, and lie, and rave,--    Abraham Lincoln, give us a MAN!    Hearts are mourning in the North,      While the sister rivers seek the main,    Red with our life-blood flowing forth--      Who shall gather it up again?    Though we march to the battle-plain    Firmly as when the strife began,      Shall all our offerings be in vain?--    Abraham Lincoln, give us a MAN!    Is there never one in all the land,      One on whose might the Cause may lean?    Are all the common ones so grand,      And all the titled ones so mean?      What if your failure may have been    In trying to make good bread from bran,      From worthless metal a weapon keen?--    Abraham Lincoln, find us a MAN!    O, we will follow him to the death,      Where the foeman's fiercest columns are!    O, we will use our latest breath,      Cheering for every sacred star!      His to marshal us high and far;    Ours to battle, as patriots can      When a Hero leads the Holy War!--    Abraham Lincoln, give us a MAN!CHAPTER XXV     The Battle-summer of 1863--A Turn of the Tide--Lee's Invasion of     Pennsylvania--A Threatening Crisis--Change of Union     Commanders--Meade succeeds Hooker--The Battle of     Gettysburg--Lincoln's Anxiety during the Fight--The Retreat of     Lee--Union Victories in the Southwest--The Capture of     Vicksburg--Lincoln's Thanks to Grant--Returning     Cheerfulness--Congratulations to the Country--Improved State of     Peeling at the North--State Elections of 1863--The Administration     Sustained--Dedication of the National Cemetery at     Gettysburg--Lincoln's Address--Scenes and Incidents at the     Dedication--Meeting with Old John Burns--Edward Everett's     Impressions of Lincoln.Midsummer of 1863 brought a turn in the tide of military affairs. Itcame none too soon for the safety of the nation. The repeated reversesto the Union arms ending with the shocking disasters at Fredericksburgand Chancellorsville--although slightly relieved by the costly successof Stone River--had seemed to throw the chances of war in favor of theSouth; and the Union cause was at the crisis of its fate. But nowfortune smiled upon the North, and its lost hope and lost ground wereregained at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. These great battles are justlyregarded as marking the turning-point of the war. It was yet far fromfinished; there remained nearly two years of desperate fighting, withheroic struggles and terrible sacrifice of life, before the end shouldcome. But from this time the character of the struggle seemed to change.The armies of the South fought, not less desperately, but more on thedefensive; and their final overthrow was in all human probabilitychiefly a question of time.Emboldened by his success at Chancellorsville in May, General Lee againassumed the offensive, and recrossed the Potomac river into Maryland.Late in June he invaded Pennsylvania, and occupied a positionthreatening Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington. The situation wasmost critical. If Lee could once more beat the Army of the Potomac, ashe had done so many times, these three great cities, and even New York,might be at his mercy. The feeling in Washington is reflected in entriesmade at the time in Mr. Welles's Diary. "Something of a panic pervadesthe city," says Mr. Welles. "Singular rumors reach us of Rebel advancesinto Maryland. It is said they have reached Hagerstown, and some of themhave penetrated as far as Chambersburg in Pennsylvania.... The city isfull of strange, wild rumors of Rebel raids in the vicinity and oftrains seized in sight of the Capital. The War Department is whollyunprepared for an irruption here, and J.E.B. Stuart might have dashedinto the city to-day [June 28] with impunity.... I have a panictelegraph from Governor Curtin of Pennsylvania, who is excitable andeasily alarmed, entreating that guns and gunners may be sent from theNavy Yard at Philadelphia to Harrisburg without delay.... I went again,at a late hour, to the War Department, but could get no facts orintelligence from the Secretary. All was vague, opaque, thick darkness.I really think Stanton is no better posted than myself, and from whatStanton says am afraid Hooker does not comprehend Lee's intentions norknow how to counteract them. It looks to me as if Lee was putting forthhis whole energy and force in one great and desperate struggle whichshall be decisive."Following Lee, the Army of the Potomac, under General Hooker, alsorecrossed the Potomac, and pursued the enemy by a somewhat parallelroute, but keeping carefully between him and Washington. The occasionwas one calling for the best resources of a great military commander;and General Hooker, realizing his unfitness for the responsibility,asked to be relieved of the command. Thus was thrown upon the Presidentthe hazardous necessity of changing commanders upon the very eve of agreat battle. It was a terrible emergency. Even the stout-heartedStanton was appalled. He afterward stated that when he received thedespatch from Hooker, asking to be relieved, his heart sank within him,and he was more depressed than at any other moment of the war. "I couldnot say," said Mr. Stanton, "that any other officer knew GeneralHooker's plans, or the position even of the various divisions of thearmy. I sent for the President to come at once to the War Office. It wasin the evening, but the President soon appeared. I handed him thedespatch. As he read it his face became like lead, and I said, 'Whatshall be done?' He replied instantly, '_Accept his resignation._'"Immediately an order was sent to Major-General George G. Meade, one ofthe most efficient of the corps commanders of the Army of the Potomac,appointing him to the chief command. Meade was a quiet, unassuming man,very unlike Hooker. Three days after assuming command, he led his armyagainst the Southern host at Gettysburg, where, after a most bloody andmemorable battle of three days' duration (July 1, 2, and 3, 1863), waswon the first decisive victory in the history of the gallant Army of thePotomac. Lee retired, with disastrous losses, across the Potomac toVirginia; and Washington and the North breathed free again.Senator Chandler of Michigan, speaking of the terrible strain on Lincolnduring the progress of the battle of Gettysburg, said: "I shall neverforget the painful anxiety of those few days when the fate of the nationseemed to hang in the balance; nor the restless solicitude of Mr.Lincoln, as he paced up and down the room, reading despatches,soliloquizing, and often stopping to trace the position of thecontending armies on the map which hung on the wall; nor the relief weall felt when the fact was established that victory, though gained atsuch fearful cost, was indeed on the side of the Union."Amidst the murk and gloom of those dark days in Washington, when thesuspense was breathless and the heart of the nation responded in muffledbeats to the dull booming of the cannon of Meade and Lee at Gettysburg,an episode occurred, with Lincoln as the central figure, which revealsperhaps more poignantly than any other in his whole career the depths offeeling in that tender and reverential soul. On Sunday evening, July4,--the fourth day of that terrible battle, with nothing definite yetknown of the result,--the President drove out in a carriage, in companywith two daughters of Secretary Stanton, to the line of defenses nearArlington. It was toward sundown; and a brigade of troops were formingin position for an evening parade or review. The commander of thebrigade, General Tannatt, recognizing the President and his party, rodeup to the carriage and invited them to witness the parade. The Presidentassented. His face was drawn and haggard in its expression of anxietyand sorrow. As it was Sunday evening, some of the regimental bandsplayed familiar religious pieces. The President, hearing them, inquiredof General Tannatt if any of his bands could play "Lead Kindly Light."Then in a low voice and with touching accents he repeated, as if tohimself, the familiar lines--never more expressive or appropriate thannow,--    Lead, kindly light, amid the encircling gloom,        Lead thou me on.           *       *       *       *       *    Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see    The distant scene,--one step enough for me.As the sweet strains of the familiar hymn floated on the evening air,Lincoln's sad face became sadder still, and tears were seen coursingdown his cheeks. What emotions were his, who can tell, as he thought ofthat great battle-field not far away, its issues yet unknown, its groundstill covered with dead and wounded soldiers whose heroic deeds--to usehis noble words spoken a few months later on that historic field--"haveconsecrated it far above our power to add or detract."General Tannatt, who knew Lincoln well and had spoken with him manytimes, never saw him again; and his view of that tragic, tear-wet faceremains to him a vivid and precious memory.[H]While the eyes of the nation were fastened upon the great drama beingenacted near the capital, events scarcely less momentous were occurringin the Southwest. The campaign against Vicksburg, the great Confederatestronghold on the Mississippi river, had been in active progress, underthe personal command of General Grant, for several months. Theimportance of this strategic point was fully understood by the enemy,and it was defended most stubbornly. At first Grant's plans provedunsuccessful; the cutting of canals and opening of bayous failed--asPresident Lincoln had expected and predicted. But these failures onlyserved to develop the unsuspected energy of Grant's character and theextent of his military resources. He boldly changed his entire plan ofoperations, abandoned his line of communication, removed his army to apoint _below_ Vicksburg and attacked the city in the rear. With doggedpersistence he pressed forward, gaining point by point, beating offGeneral Johnston's forces on one side and driving Pemberton before himinto Vicksburg; until finally, by the aid of Admiral Porter's gunboatson the Mississippi, he had entirely invested the city. Gradually andpersistently his lines closed in, pushed forward by assault and siege;until Vicksburg accepted its doom, and on the 4th of July, 1863,--theday of Lee's retreat from Gettysburg,--the city and garrison surrenderedto the victorious Grant.Lincoln's exuberant joy over the capture of Vicksburg is revealed in anentry made at the time in Mr. Welles's Diary. "I was handed a despatchfrom Admiral Porter, communicating the fall of Vicksburg on the Fourthof July," says Mr. Welles. "I immediately returned to the ExecutiveMansion. The President was detailing certain points relative to Grant'smovements on the map to Chase and two or three others, when I gave himthe tidings. Putting down the map he rose at once, said he would dropthese topics, and added, 'I myself will telegraph this news to GeneralMeade.' He seized his hat, but suddenly stopped, his countenance beamingwith joy; he caught my hand, and throwing his arm around me, exclaimed,'What can we do for the Secretary of the Navy for this gloriousintelligence? He is always giving us good news. I cannot, in words, tellyou my joy over this result. It is great, Mr. Welles, it is great!' ...We walked the lawn together. 'This,' said he, 'will relieve Banks. Itwill inspire me.'"The Union victories at Vicksburg and Gettysburg caused great rejoicingat the North, and gave added zest to the celebration of the nationalpatriotic holiday. President Lincoln, mindful of the "almostinestimable services," as he termed them, of General Grant, and as itwas his wont to do in such circumstances, made haste to acknowledge hisown and the country's indebtedness to the man who had accomplished agreat deed. He addressed to the conqueror of Vicksburg the followingletter:     EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, D.C.     July 13, 1863.     MAJOR-GENERAL GRANT.     MY DEAR GENERAL:--I do not remember that you and I ever met     personally. I write this now as a grateful acknowledgment for the     almost inestimable services you have done the country. I write to     say a word further. When you first reached the vicinity of     Vicksburg, I thought you should do what you finally did--march the     troops across the neck, run the batteries with the transports, and     thus go below; and I never had any faith, except a general hope     that you knew better than I, that the Yazoo Pass expedition, and     the like, could succeed. When you got below, and took Port Gibson,     Grand Gulf, and vicinity, I thought you should go down the river,     and join General Banks, and when you turned northward, east of the     Big Black, I feared it was a mistake. I now wish to make the     personal acknowledgment that you were right and I was wrong.     Yours truly, A. LINCOLN.An officer who was the first from Grant's army to reach Washington afterthe surrender of Vicksburg, has recorded the circumstances of hisinterview with the President. "Mr. Lincoln received me very cordially,"says this officer, "and drawing a chair near to himself and motioning meto be seated said, 'Now I want to hear all about Vicksburg.' I gave himall the information I could, though he appeared to be remarkably wellposted himself. He put to me a great many questions in detail touchingthe siege, the losses, the morale of the army, its sanitary condition,the hospital service, and General Grant. Said he: 'I guess I was rightin standing by Grant, although there was great pressure made afterPittsburg Landing to have him removed. I thought I saw enough in Grantto convince me that he was one on whom the country could depend. That'unconditional surrender' message to Buckner at Donelson suited me. Itindicated the spirit of the man."It is interesting to note that before the capture of Vicksburg theprotracted campaign had occasioned no little dissatisfaction withGeneral Grant; the President had been importuned to remove him, and hadmuch formidable opposition to encounter in his determination to stand byhim. Only a few days before the capitulation of the beleaguered city,Senator Wade of Ohio--"Bluff Ben Wade," as he was termed--called uponthe President and urged Grant's dismissal; to which Lincolngood-naturedly replied, "Senator, that reminds me of a story." "Yes,yes," rejoined Wade petulantly, "that is the way it is with you, sir,all _story--story_! You are the father of every military blunder thathas been made during the war. You are on your road to h--l, sir, withthis Government, and you are not a mile off this minute." Lincoln calmlyretorted, "Senator, that is just about the distance from here to theCapitol, is it not?" The exasperated Wade grabbed his hat and rushedangrily from the White House.It is not pleasant to record that the cordial and generouscongratulations to Grant for his achievements at Vicksburg were inmarked contrast to the rather grudging recognition of Meade's much moreimportant and hard-won victory at Gettysburg. In the latter case thedespatches from Washington took the form not so much of acknowledgmentsof what had been done as of complaints at what had not been done. It ishard to believe that the President dictated, or even authorized, theill-timed and peevish despatch sent to General Meade[I] by theinopportune Halleck, a few days after the battle of Gettysburg, in whichthe victor on that desperate field is officially informed that "theescape of Lee's army has created great dissatisfaction in the mind ofthe President, and it will require an active and energetic pursuit toremove the impression that it has not been sufficiently active before."To this extraordinary message Meade at once made a simple and manlyrejoinder in which he said: "Having performed my duty conscientiouslyand to the best of my ability, the censure of the President, as conveyedin your despatch, is in my judgment so undeserved that I feel compelledmost respectfully to ask to be immediately relieved from the command ofthis army." Halleck replied, rather ineptly, that his despatch had notbeen intended as a censure, but as a "stimulus," and was not regarded asa sufficient cause for Meade's request to be relieved. When one thinksof the ill-fortunes of the Army of the Potomac under previouscommanders, and of the unlikelihood of finding a successor to Meade ascapable as he had shown himself to be, one shudders at the chances ofwhat might have happened had another change of leaders been forced uponthat long-suffering and now victorious army. General Meade did not presshis resignation after Halleck's conciliatory telegrams, and remained inimmediate command of the Army of the Potomac until the close of thewar--Grant's accession to the chief command of all the armies havingmarked the end of the well-meant but often ill-advised and troublesomeinterference with military affairs from Washington.Mr. Isaac R. Pennypacker, in his Life of General Meade, speaks ofHalleck and other prominent officials in Washington in these terms:"Possessing much of the skill of the lawyer and disputant, Halleck waswithout military ability. The Secretary of War, like many other men whoexercise vast power, was not great enough to refrain from the use of hisauthority in matters where his knowledge and experience did not qualifyhim to form the soundest views. Acting with these military authoritieswere men like Wade and Chandler, whose patriotism was of the exuberantkind, whose judgment in military affairs was without value, but whosepersonal energy impelled them to have a controlling hand, if possible,in the conduct of the war."Lincoln's dissatisfaction with General Meade after the battle ofGettysburg was due, as we now see, to his elation over the splendidvictory for the Union, his intense desire for further and overwhelmingsuccesses, and his failure (a quite natural one) to realize that whatmight seem desirable and feasible viewed from Washington might look verydifferent to the practical and experienced men actually on the groundand familiar as he could not be with all the factors in thesituation.[J] "He thought," wrote General Halleck in an explanatoryletter sent to Meade two weeks after his despatch of censure, "thatLee's defeat was so certain that he felt no little impatience at hisunexpected escape." Among military authorities, such a retreat as thatof Lee after Gettysburg is hardly regarded as an "escape." If it were,then great must be the fault of Lee as a general in allowing thedefeated armies of Burnside and Hooker to "escape" after the battles ofFredericksburg and Chancellorsville, where their repulse was much worsethan was Lee's at Gettysburg. That Lincoln's first feelings ofdisappointment and dissatisfaction with General Meade were greatlymodified with fuller knowledge of the actual situation after the battleof Gettysburg is shown by a remark made by him to Senator Cameron,referring to Meade: "Why should we censure a man who has done so muchfor his country because he did not do a little more?" And if any debtof recognition or of gratitude yet remained due from him, it was morethan paid a few months later in the unsurpassed tribute at Gettysburg to"the brave men, living and dead," who gained the victory on thathallowed field.The improved condition of public affairs, and the increasingcheerfulness of the President, after the victories at Gettysburg andVicksburg, are exhibited in a letter written by him a few weeks later tofriends at Springfield, Illinois, who had urgently invited him to attend"a mass-meeting of Unconditional Union men" at his old home. In thisletter he took occasion to declare his sentiments on various questionsparamount at the time. Among these was the subject of a compromise withthe South, against which he argued with great force and feeling. Again,he defended the Emancipation Proclamation, a measure to which many Unionmen were still unreconciled. He referred also to the arming of thenegroes as a just and wise expedient; finally concluding with theseexpressive and felicitous words:     The signs look better. The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to     the sea. Thanks to the great Northwest for it; nor yet wholly to     them. Three hundred miles up they met New England, Empire,     Keystone, and Jersey, hewing their way right and left. The sunny     South, too, in more colors than one, also lent a helping hand. On     the spot, their part of the history was jotted down in black and     white. The job was a great national one, and let none be slighted     who bore an honorable part in it. And while those who have cleared     the great river may well be proud, even that is not all. It is hard     to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than at     Antietam, Murfreesboro, Gettysburg, and on many fields of less     note. Nor must Uncle Sam's web-feet be forgotten. At all the     watery margins they have been present, not only on the deep sea,     the broad bay, and the rapid river, but also up the narrow, muddy     bayou, and wherever the ground was a little damp they have been and     made their tracks. Thanks to all. For the great Republic--for the     principle it lives by and keeps alive--for man's vast     future--thanks to all. Peace does not appear so distant as it did.     I hope it will come soon and come to stay; and so come as to be     worth the keeping in all future time. It will then have been proved     that among freemen there can be no successful appeal from the     ballot to the bullet, and that they who take such appeal are sure     to lose their case and pay the cost. And there will be some black     men who can remember that, with silent tongue, and clinched teeth,     and steady eye, and well-poised bayonet, they have helped mankind     on to this great consummation; while I fear there will be some     white ones unable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful     speech they have striven to hinder it. Still, let us not be     over-sanguine of a speedy final triumph. Let us be quite sober. Let     us diligently apply the means, never doubting that a just God, in     His own good time, will give us the rightful result.In a public proclamation, issued October 3, the President gives moreformal expression to his satisfaction and gratitude, and calls upon theloyal people of the Union to unite in a day of thanksgiving for theimproved prospects of the country.     The year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the     blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these     bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to     forget the source from which they come, others have been added     which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to     penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible     to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God. In the midst of a     civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes     seemed to invite and provoke the aggressions of foreign states,     peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been     maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony     has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military     conflict, while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the     advancing armies and navies of the Union. The needful diversion of     wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the     national defense has not arrested the plough, the shuttle, or the     ship. The axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the     mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have     yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has     steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in     the camp, the siege, and the battle-field; and the country,     rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is     permitted to expect a continuance of years with large increase of     freedom. No human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand     worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the     Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins,     hath nevertheless remembered mercy. It has seemed to me fit and     proper that they should be solemnly, reverently, and gratefully     acknowledged, as with one heart and voice, by the whole American     people. I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every part of     the United States, and also those who are at sea, and those who are     sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last     Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and prayer to     our beneficent Father, who dwelleth in the heavens. And I recommend     to them that, while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him     for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with     humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience,     commend to His tender care all those who have become widows,     orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in     which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the     interposition of the Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of the     nation, and to restore it, as soon as may be consistent with the     divine purposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony,     tranquility, and union.The brightening prospects of the Union cause quickly produced a betterstate of feeling at the North. In the fall elections of 1863, everyState except New Jersey gave solid majorities on the Republican side,thus strengthening the administration and giving the President welcomeassurances of popular approval. He had awaited with special anxiety thereturns from Ohio, where the contest was fraught with peculiarsignificance. The Democrats had chosen for their candidate the notoriouspeace-at-any-price Vallandigham, against whom the Republicans had placedJohn Brough of Cleveland. On the night of the election, about teno'clock, a message clicked on the wires in the telegraph office of thelatter city, saying, "Where is John Brough? A. Lincoln." Brough was athand, and directly the electric voice inquired, "Brough, about what isyour majority now?" Brough replied, "Over 30,000." Lincoln requestedBrough to remain at the office during the night. A little past midnightthe question came again from Lincoln, "Brough, what is your majority bythis time?" Brough replied, "Over 50,000." And the question was thusrepeated and answered several times, with rapidly increasing majorities,till five o'clock in the morning, when the question came again, "Brough,what is your majority now?" The latter was able to respond, "Over100,000." As soon as the words could be flashed back over the wire,there came: "_Glory to God in the highest. Ohio has saved the Nation. A.Lincoln_."The day after the election in Ohio (October 14, 1863) Lincoln said toSecretary Welles that he had felt more anxiety in regard to the resultsthan he had in 1860 when he was chosen President. He could not havebelieved four years ago, he said, that one genuine American would orcould be induced to vote for such a man as Vallandigham. Yet he had beenmade the candidate of a large party, and received a vote that is adiscredit to the country. Mr. Welles adds: "The President showed a gooddeal of emotion as he dwelt on this subject."After the battle of Gettysburg, a portion of the ground on which theengagement was fought was purchased by the State of Pennsylvania for aburial-place for the Union soldiers who were slain in that bloodyencounter. The tract included seventeen and a half acres adjoining thetown cemetery. It was planned to consecrate the ground with imposingceremonies, in which the President, accompanied by his Cabinet and alarge body of the military, was invited to assist. The day appointed wasthe 19th of November; and the chief orator selected was Massachusetts'eloquent son, Hon. Edward Everett. Following him it was expected thatthe President would add some testimonials in honor of the dead.Lincoln and Everett were representatives of two contrasting phases ofAmerican civilization: the one, an outgrowth of the rough pioneer lifeof the West; the other, the product of the highest culture of the East.They had met for the first time on this memorable day. Everett's orationwas a finished literary production. Smooth, euphonious, and elegant, itwas delivered with the silvery tones and the graceful gestures of atrained and consummate speaker. When he had finished, and the applausethat greeted him had died away, the multitude called vociferously for anaddress from Lincoln. With an unconscious air, the President cameforward at the call, put his spectacles on his nose, and read, in aquiet voice which gradually warmed with feeling, while his careworn facebecame radiant with the light of genuine emotion, the following briefaddress:     Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this     continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the     proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a     great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so     conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great     battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of     that field as a final resting-place of those who here gave their     lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and     proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense we cannot     dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The     brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated     it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will     little note nor long remember what we _say_ here, but it can never     forget what they _did_ here. It is for us, the living, rather, to     be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here     have thus far so nobly carried on. It is rather for us to be here     dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these     honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which     they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly     resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this     nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that     government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not     perish from the earth.The simple and sublime words of this short address shook the hearts ofthe listeners, and before the first sentence was ended they were underthe spell of a mighty magician. They stood hushed, awed, and melted, asthe speaker enforced the solemn lesson of the hour, and brought home tothem, in plain unvarnished terms, the duty which remained for them todo--to finish the work which the dead around them had given their livesto carry on. It was one of the briefest of the many speeches with whichLincoln had swayed the impulses and opinions of crowds of hisfellow-men, but it is the one which will be remembered above all othersas hallowed by the truest and loftiest inspiration. As the finalsentence ended, amid the tears and sobs and cheers of the excitedthrong, the President turned to Mr. Everett, and, grasping his hand,exclaimed with sincerity, "I congratulate you on your success." Mr.Everett responded in the fervor of his emotion, "Ah, Mr. President, howgladly would I exchange all my hundred pages to have been the author ofyour twenty lines!"Of all Lincoln's public utterances, this is unquestionably the mostremarkable. The oration, brief and unpretending as it is, will remain aclassic of the English language. "The Westminster Review," one of theforemost of the great English quarterlies, said of it: "It has but oneequal, in that pronounced upon those who fell in the first year of thePeloponnesian War; and in one respect it is superior to that greatspeech. It is not only more natural, fuller of feeling, more touchingand pathetic, but we know with absolute certainty that _it was reallydelivered_. Nature here takes precedence of art--even though it be theart of Thucydides.""An illustration of the difference between oratory and inspiration" isMr. John Bigelow's happy characterization of the Gettysburg address. "Itwas," he adds, "one of the most momentous incidents in the history ofthe Civil War. It may be doubted whether anything had then, or hassince, been said of that national strife conceived upon a higher andwiser spiritual plane.... It is perhaps, on the whole, the most enduringbit of eloquence that has ever been uttered on this continent; and yetone finds in it none of the tricks of the forum or the stage, nor anytrace of the learning of the scholar, nor the need of it."Major Harry T. Lee, who was himself a participant in the battle ofGettysburg and occupied a seat on the platform at the dedication, saysthat the people listened with marked attention through the two hours ofEverett's noble and scholarly oration; but that when Lincoln cameforward, and in a voice burdened with emotion uttered his simple andtouching eulogy on "the brave men, living and dead, who struggled here,"there was scarcely a dry eye in the whole vast audience.Mr. John Russell Young, afterwards U.S. Minister to China, was presentat the Gettysburg dedication, and says: "I sat behind Mr. Lincoln whileMr. Everett delivered his oration. I remember the great orator had a wayof raising and dropping his handkerchief as he spoke. He spoke for twohours, and was very impressive, with his white hair and venerablefigure. He was a great orator, but it was like a bit of Greeksculpture--beautiful, but cold as ice. It was perfect art, but withoutfeeling. The art and beauty of it captured your imagination andjudgment. Mr. Everett went over the campaign with resonant, clear,splendid rhetoric. There was not a word or a sentence or a thought thatcould be corrected. You felt that every gesture had been carefullystudied out beforehand. It was like a great actor playing a greatpart.... Mr. Lincoln rose, walked to the edge of the platform, took outhis glasses, and put them on. He was awkward. He bowed to the assemblagein his homely manner, and took out of his coat pocket a page offoolscap. In front of Mr. Lincoln was a photographer with his camera,endeavoring to take a picture of the scene. We all supposed that Mr.Lincoln would make rather a long speech--a half-hour at least. He tookthe single sheet of foolscap, held it almost to his nose, and in hishigh tenor voice, without the least attempt at effect, delivered thatmost extraordinary address which belongs to the classics of literature.The photographer was bustling about, preparing to take the President'spicture while he was speaking, but Mr. Lincoln finished before thephotographer was ready."It is stated that when President Lincoln reached the town of Gettysburg,on his way to attend the exercises at the cemetery, he inquired for "OldJohn Burns," the hero of the battle of Gettysburg, who left his farm andfought with the Union soldiers upon that bloody field. The veteran wassent for; and on his arrival the President showed him marked attention,taking him by the arm and walking with him in the procession through thestreets to the cemetery.Edward Everett, who was associated with Lincoln during these two orthree days, says of the impression the President made on him: "Irecognized in the President a full measure of the qualities whichentitle him to the personal respect of the people. On the only socialoccasion on which I ever had the honor to be in his company, viz., theCommemoration at Gettysburg, he sat at the table of my friend DavidWillis, by the side of several distinguished persons, foreigners andAmericans; and in gentlemanly appearance, manners, and conversation, hewas the peer of any man at the table."CHAPTER XXVI     Lincoln and Grant--Their Personal Relations--Grant's Successes at     Chattanooga--Appointed Lieutenant-general--Grant's First Visit to     Washington--His Meeting with Lincoln--Lincoln's First Impressions     of Grant--The First "General" Lincoln Had Found--"That Presidential     Grub"--True Version of the Whiskey Anecdote--Lincoln Tells Grant     the Story of Sykes's Dog--"We'd Better Let Mr. Grant Have his Own     Way"--Grant's Estimate of Lincoln.From the hour of Grant's triumph at Vicksburg to the close of the war,Lincoln never withdrew his confidence from the quiet, persistent,unpretending man who led our armies slowly but surely along the path ofvictory. As soon as the campaign at Vicksburg was over, Grant's sphereof operations was enlarged by his appointment to the command of themilitary division of the Mississippi. In November following he foughtthe famous battles of Chattanooga, including Lookout Mountain andMissionary Ridge; and, aided by his efficient corps commanders, Sherman,Thomas, and Hooker, gained a succession of brilliant victories for theUnion cause. The wisdom of Grant's policy of concentration and "fightingit out" had now become apparent.President Lincoln had watched closely the progress of these events, andhad come to recognize in Grant the master spirit of the war, on theNorthern side. Accordingly he determined to give him general command ofall the Union armies. In December, 1863, a bill was introduced in theSenate by Hon. E.B. Washburne, of Illinois, and passed both houses ofCongress, creating the rank of Lieutenant-General in the army.President Lincoln approved the act, and immediately nominated Grant forthe position. The nomination was confirmed; and on the 17th of March,1864, Grant issued his first order as Lieutenant-General, assumingcommand of the armies of the United States, and announcing that hisheadquarters would be in the field and until further orders with theArmy of the Potomac. Of this army he shrewdly remarked that it seemed tohim it "had never fought its battles _through_." He proposed, first ofall, to teach that army "not to be afraid of Lee." "I had known himpersonally," said Grant, "and _knew that he was mortal_." Withcharacteristic energy he formed a simple but comprehensive plan ofoperations both East and West; sending Sherman on his great march toAtlanta and the sea, while he, with the Army of the Potomac, pushedstraight for Richmond. These operations were vigorously urged, and whenthey were ended the war was ended. It was but little more than a yearfrom the date of Grant's commission as Lieutenant-General till hereceived Lee's surrender at Appomattox.Immediately upon Grant's appointment as Lieutenant-General, he wassummoned to Washington. It was his first visit to the capital since thewar began, and he was a stranger to nearly everyone from the Presidentdown. He arrived in the city on the 8th of March (1864), taking quartersat Willard's Hotel, where, when he went in to dinner, none knew "thequiet, rather stumpy-looking man, who came in leading a little boy--theboy who had ridden by his father's side through all the campaign ofVicksburg." But soon it was whispered about who was in the room, andthere was a loud call for three cheers for Ulysses S. Grant, which weregiven with a will. In the evening General Grant attended a reception atthe White House, passing in with the throng alone and unannounced. Thequick eye of the President discovered the identity of the modestsoldier, and he was most heartily welcomed. "As soon as it was knownthat he was present, the pressure of the crowd to see the hero ofVicksburg was so great that he was forced to shelter himself behind asofa. So irrepressible was the desire to see him that Secretary Sewardfinally induced him to mount a sofa, that this curiosity might begratified. When parting from the President, he said, 'This has beenrather the warmest campaign I have witnessed during the war.'" A graphicaccount of this interesting event is given by Secretary Welles, whorecords in his Diary (March 9, 1864): "Went last evening to thePresidential reception. Quite a gathering; very many that are notusually seen at receptions were attracted thither, I presume, from thefact that General Grant was expected to be there. He came abouthalf-past nine. I was near the centre of the reception-room, when a stirand buzz attracted attention, and it was whispered that General Granthad arrived. The room was not full, the crowd having passed through tothe East Room. I saw some men in uniform standing at the entrance, andone of them, a short, brown, dark-haired man, was talking with thePresident. There was hesitation, a degree of awkwardness, in theGeneral. Soon word was passed around--'Mr. Seward, General Grant ishere,' and Seward, who was just behind me, hurried and took the Generalby the hand and led him to Mrs. Lincoln, near whom I was standing. Thecrowd gathered around the circle rapidly, and it being intimated that itwould be necessary the throng should pass on, Seward took the General'sarm and went with him to the East Room. There was clapping of hands inthe next room as he passed through, and all in the East Room joined init as he entered."The next day at noon the General waited on the President to receive hiscommission. The interview took place in the Cabinet room. There werepresent, besides the members of the Cabinet, General Halleck, a memberof Congress, two of General Grant's staff-officers, his eldest son,Frederick D. Grant, and the President's private secretary. The ceremonywas simple, the President saying, as he proffered the papers: "Thenation's appreciation of what you have done, and its reliance upon youfor what remains to be done in the existing great struggle, are nowpresented with this commission, constituting you Lieutenant-General inthe Army of the United States. With this high honor devolves upon youalso a corresponding responsibility. As the country herein trusts you,so, under God, it will sustain you. I scarcely need to add that withwhat I here speak for the nation goes my own hearty personalconcurrence." The General responded briefly, promising to "accept thecommission with gratitude for the high honor conferred. With the aid ofthe noble armies that have fought on so many fields for our commoncountry, it will be my earnest endeavor not to disappoint yourexpectations. I feel the full weight of the responsibilities nowdevolving on me, and I know that if they are met it will be due to thosearmies, and above all to the favor of that Providence which leads bothnations and men."Before assuming personal command of the Army of the Potomac, as he haddetermined to do, General Grant found it necessary to return once moreto the West. In his parting interview with Lincoln, he was urged toremain to dinner the next day and meet a brilliant party whom the ladyof the White House had invited to do him special honor. The Generalanswered, apologetically: "Mrs. Lincoln must excuse me. I must be inTennessee at a given time." "But we can't excuse you," said thePresident. "Mrs. Lincoln's dinner without you would be Hamlet withHamlet left out." "I appreciate the honor Mrs. Lincoln would do me,"said the General, "but time is very important now. I ought to be at thefront, and a dinner to me means a million dollars a day lost to thecountry." Lincoln was pleased with this answer, and said cheerfully,"Well, we'll have the dinner without you."After Lincoln's first meeting with General Grant he was asked regardinghis personal impressions of the new commander. He replied, "Well, Ihardly know what to think of him. He's the quietest little fellow youever saw. He makes the least fuss of any man I ever knew. I believe onseveral occasions he has been in this room a minute or so before I knewhe was here. It's about so all around. The only evidence you have thathe's in any particular place is that he makes things move." To asubsequent inquiry as to his estimate of Grant's military capacities,Lincoln responded, with emphasis: "Grant is the first General I've had._He's a General_." "How do you mean, Mr. Lincoln?" his visitor asked."Well, I'll tell you what I mean," replied Lincoln. "You know how it'sbeen with all the rest. As soon as I put a man in command of the army,he'd come to me with the plan of a campaign, and about as much as tosay: 'Now I don't believe I can do it, but if you say so I'll try iton,' and so put the responsibility of success or failure on me. They allwanted _me_ to be the General. Now, it isn't so with Grant. He hasn'ttold me what his plans are. I don't know and I don't want to know. I amglad to find a man who can go ahead without me. When any of the rest setout on a campaign they'd look over matters and pick out some one thingthey were short of and they knew I couldn't give them, and tell me theycouldn't hope to win unless they had it--and it was most generallycavalry. Now when Grant took hold I was waiting to see what his petimpossibility would be, and I reckoned it would be cavalry, of course,for we hadn't horses enough to mount what men we had. There were fifteenthousand men, or thereabouts, up near Harper's Ferry, and no horses toput them on. Well, the other day Grant sent to me about these very men,just as I expected; but what he wanted to know was whether he could makeinfantry of 'em or disband 'em. He doesn't ask impossibilities of me,and he's the first General I've had that didn't." On another occasionLincoln said of Grant: "The great thing about him is his coolpersistency of purpose. He is not easily excited, and he has the grip ofa bulldog. _When he once gets his teeth in, nothing can shake him off_."The President's satisfaction with the new commander was speedilycommunicated to him in a characteristically frank manner, in a letterdated April 30, 1864.     LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:--     Not expecting to see you before the Spring campaign opens, I wish     to express in this way my entire satisfaction with what you have     done up to this time, so far as I understand it. The particulars of     your plan I neither know nor seek to know. You are vigilant and     self-reliant; and, pleased with this, I wish not to obtrude any     restraints or constraints upon you. While I am very anxious that     any great disaster or capture of our men in great numbers shall be     avoided, I know that these points are less likely to escape your     attention than they would be mine. If there be anything wanting     which is in my power to give, do not fail to let me know it. And     now, with a brave army and a just cause, may God sustain you.     Yours very truly, A. LINCOLN.General Grant himself wrote, on this point: "In my first interview withMr. Lincoln alone, he stated to me that he had never professed to be amilitary man, or to know how campaigns should be conducted, and neverwanted to interfere in them; but that procrastination on the part ofcommanders, and the pressure of the people at the North and Congress,_which was always with him_, forced him into issuing his series of'Military Orders'--one, two, three, etc. He did not know but they wereall wrong, and did know that some of them were. All he wanted or hadever wanted was someone who would take the responsibility and act, andcall on him for all the assistance needed, pledging himself to use allthe power of the government in rendering such assistance.... ThePresident told me he did not want to know what I proposed to do. But hesubmitted a plan of campaign of his own which he wanted me to hear andthen do as I pleased about. He brought out a map of Virginia on which hehad evidently marked every position occupied by the Federal andConfederate armies up to that time. He pointed out on the map twostreams which empty into the Potomac, and suggested that the army mightbe moved on boats and landed between the mouths of these streams. Wewould then have the Potomac to bring our supplies, and the tributarieswould protect our flanks while we moved out. I listened respectfully,but did not suggest that the same streams would protect Lee's flankswhile he was shutting us up."General Horace Porter, for some time Grant's chief of staff, says: "Thenearest Mr. Lincoln ever came to giving General Grant an order for themovement of troops was during Early's raid upon Washington. On July 10,1864, he telegraphed a long despatch from Washington, which containedthe following language: 'What I think is that you should provide toretain your hold where you are, certainly, and bring the rest with youpersonally, and make a vigorous effort to defeat the enemy's force inthis vicinity. I think there is really a fair chance to do this, if themovement is prompt. This is what I think--given upon yoursuggestion,--and is not an order.' Grant replied that on reflection hethought it would have a bad effect for him to leave City Point, then hisheadquarters, in front of Richmond and Petersburg; and the President wassatisfied with the dispositions which Grant made for the repulse ofEarly without taking command against him in person."A curious incident revealing the intense interest with which Lincolnwatched the career of Grant is related by Mr. J. Russell Jones, an oldand trusted friend of the President, who joined the army at Vicksburg intime to witness its final triumph. Soon after Mr. Jones's return toChicago, the President summoned him to Washington. With eager haste,after the first salutations were over, Lincoln declared the object forwhich he had secured the interview: "'I have sent for you, Mr. Jones, toknow if that man Grant wants to be President.' Mr. Jones, althoughsomewhat astonished at the question and the circumstances under which itwas asked, replied at once, 'No, Mr. President.' 'Are you sure?' queriedthe latter. 'Yes,' said Mr. Jones, 'perfectly sure. I have just comefrom Vicksburg. I have seen General Grant frequently, and talked fullyand freely with him about that and every other question; and I know hehas no political aspirations whatever, and certainly none for thePresidency. His only desire is to see you re-elected and to do what hecan under your orders to put down the rebellion and restore peace to thecountry.' 'Ah, Mr. Jones,' said Lincoln, 'you have lifted a great weightoff my mind, and done me an immense amount of good; for I tell you, myfriend, no man knows how deeply that Presidential grub gnaws till he hashad it himself.'" We cannot believe that Lincoln cherished any feelingof jealousy of the rising commander, or desired to interfere withwhatever political ambition he might nourish. It was rather his desireto be assured of the single-hearted purpose of a military leader whom hehad trusted and to whom he wished to confide still more importantservices in the conduct of the war.It may be remembered that early in the war an anecdote went the roundsof the press to the effect that, in reply to a complaint that Grant hadbeen guilty of drunkenness in the campaigns in the West, Lincolnremarked that he would "like to find out what kind of liquor Grantdrank," so that he might "send some of it to the other Generals." Thetrue version of that characteristic anecdote is this, as given by thelate Judge T. Lyle Dickey, who was a Judge of the Illinois Supreme Courtat the time of his death, and at the time of Grant's famous Vicksburgcampaign was on the General's staff as chief of cavalry. Judge (thenColonel) Dickey had been sent to Washington with private despatches forthe President and the Secretary of War. Lincoln and Dickey had beenintimate friends for years, and during the latter's visit to the formeron that occasion, Dickey remarked, "I hear that some one has been tryingto poison you against Grant by reporting that he gets drunk. I wish toassure you, Mr. President, that there is not a scintilla of truth in thereport." "Oh, Colonel," replied the President, "we get all sorts ofreports here, but I'll say this to you: that if those accusing GeneralGrant of getting drunk will tell me _where he gets his whiskey_, I willget a lot of it and send it around to some of the other Generals, whoare badly in need of something of the kind."After Lincoln and General Grant had become personally intimate, they hadmany enjoyable conversations and exchanges of anecdotes. Lincolnespecially enjoyed telling the General of the various persons who hadcome to him with complaints and criticisms about the Vicksburg campaign."After the place had actually surrendered," said the President, "Ithought it was about time to shut down on this sort of thing. So oneday, when a delegation came to see me, and had spent half an hour tryingto show me the fatal mistake you had made in paroling Pemberton's army,and insisting that the rebels would violate their paroles and in lessthan a month confront you again in the ranks and have to be whipped allover again, I thought I could get rid of them best by telling them astory about Sykes's dog. 'Have you ever heard about Sykes's yellow dog?'said I to the spokesman of the delegation. He said he hadn't. 'Well, Imust tell you about him,' said I. 'Sykes had a yellow dog he set greatstore by, but there were a lot of small boys around the village, andthat's always a bad thing for dogs, you know. These boys didn't shareSykes's views, and they were not disposed to let the dog have a fairshow. Even Sykes had to admit that the dog was getting unpopular; infact, it was soon seen that a prejudice was growing up against that dogthat threatened to wreck all his future prospects in life. The boys,after meditating how they could get the best of him, finally fixed up acartridge with a long fuse, put the cartridge in a piece of meat,dropped the meat in the road in front of Sykes's door, and then perchedthemselves on a fence a good distance off with the end of the fuse intheir hands. Then they whistled for the dog. When he came out he scentedthe bait, and bolted the meat, cartridge and all. The boys touched offthe fuse with a cigar, and in about a second a report came from that dogthat sounded like a small clap of thunder. Sykes came bouncing out ofthe house, and yelled: "What's up! Anything busted?" There was noreply, except a snicker from the small boys roosting on the fence; butas Sykes looked up he saw the whole air filled with pieces of yellowdog. He picked up the biggest piece he could find--a portion of theback, with a part of the tail still hanging to it, and, after turning itaround and looking it all over, he said, "Well, I guess he'll never bemuch account again--_as a dog_." And I guess Pemberton's forces willnever be much account again--_as an army._' The delegation began lookingaround for their hats before I had quite got to the end of the story,and I was never bothered any more about superseding the commander of theArmy of the Tennessee."When General Grant was ready to begin active operations with the Army ofthe Potomac, he sent forward all available men from Washington.Secretary Stanton, anxious about the safety of the city, said to Grantone day: "General, I suppose you have left us enough men to stronglygarrison the forts?" "No, I can't do that," was Grant's quiet answer."Why not? Why not?" repeated the Secretary nervously. "Because I havealready sent the men to the front." Said the Secretary, still morenervously: "That won't do. It's contrary to my plans. I cannot allow it.I will order the men back." To this Grant returned with quietdetermination: "I shall need the men there, and you cannot order themback." "Why not? Why not?" cried the Secretary. "I believe that I rankthe Secretary in this matter," remarked Grant. "Very well, we will seethe President about that," responded the Secretary sharply. "I will haveto take you to the President." "That is right. The President ranks usboth." So they went to the President; and the Secretary, turning toGeneral Grant, said, "Now, General, state your case." But the Generalcalmly replied, "I have no case to state. I am satisfied as it is."This threw the burden of statement on Secretary Stanton, and wasexcellent strategy. Meanwhile, General Grant had the men. When theSecretary had concluded, Lincoln crossed his legs, rested his elbow onhis knee, and said in his quaint way and with a twinkle in his eye:"Now, Mr. Secretary, you know we have been trying to manage this armyfor nearly three years, and you know we haven't done much with it. Wesent over the mountains and brought Mr. Grant, as Mrs. Grant calls him,to manage it for us; and now I guess we'd better let Mr. Grant _have hisown way_." And Mr. Grant had it.The favorable opinion which Lincoln held of Grant was stronglyreciprocated. A short time before the former's death, Grant said: "Iregard Lincoln as one of the greatest of men. He is unquestionably thegreatest man I have ever encountered. The more I see of him and exchangeviews with him, the more he impresses me. I admire his courage, andrespect the firmness he always displays. Many think from the gentlenessof his character that he has a yielding nature; but while he has thecourage to change his mind when convinced that he is wrong, he has allthe tenacity of purpose which could be desired in a great statesman. Hisquickness of perception often astonishes me. Long before the statementof a complicated question is finished, his mind will grasp the mainpoints, and he will seem to comprehend the whole subject better than theperson who is stating it. He will take rank in history alongside ofWashington."CHAPTER XXVII     Lincoln's Second Presidential Term--His Attitude toward it--Rival     Candidates for the Nomination--Chase's Achillean Wrath--Harmony     Restored--The Baltimore Convention--Decision "not to Swap Horses     while Crossing a Stream"--The Summer of 1864--Washington again     Threatened--Lincoln under Fire--Unpopular Measures--The President's     Perplexities and Trials--The Famous Letter "To Whom It May     Concern"--Little Expectation of Re-election--Dangers of     Assassination--"A Thrilling Experience"--Lincoln's Forced     Serenity--"The Saddest Man in the World"--A Break in the     Clouds--Lincoln Vindicated by Re-election--Cheered and     Reassured--More Trouble with Chase--Lincoln's Final Disposal of     him--The President's Fourth Annual Message--His Position toward the     Rebellion and Slavery Reaffirmed--Colored Folks' Reception at the     White House--Passage of the Amendment Prohibiting Slavery--Lincoln     and the Southern Peace Commissioners--The Meeting in Hampton     Roads--Lincoln's Impression of A H.

It washeld while a considerable portion of the people were engaged in armedrebellion against the authority of the National Government; and it wasnot participated in by the voters of several entire States. Aside fromthese unique features, it marked a most critical epoch in the historyof the country, and in that of Abraham Lincoln as well. The policy andacts of the administration, even the question of the furtherprosecution of the war, were to be submitted to the sovereign tribunalof the people; and with their verdict would be recorded also thepopular measure of approval or disapproval of President Lincoln. Thosewho knew him best during his first official term pronounce himsingularly free from plans and calculations regarding his ownpolitical future. He was too absorbed in public cares and duties, toonearly crushed by the great burdens resting upon him, to give thoughtor attention to questions of personal ambition. It had never been hisaim, during his Presidential life, to look far ahead. He was contentto deal wisely and soberly with important questions as they arose fromday to day and hour to hour; to adapt himself and his actions to theexigencies of the present, and in that way to earn security for thefuture. He himself said, using a forcible and apt illustrationborrowed from his early life: "The pilots on our Western rivers steerfrom _point to point_, as they call it--setting the course of the boatno farther than they can see; and that is all I propose to do in thegreat problems that are set before me."Such a policy as that outlined by Lincoln, embraced in his homely andcharacteristic phrase of "pegging away," caused him to be greatlymisunderstood and even distrusted in some quarters. As the time for thenew election drew near, there was very pronounced dissatisfaction withhim, particularly in New England. It was said of him, among otherthings, that he "lacked the essential qualities of a leader." Mr. HenryGreenleaf Pearson, the biographer of Governor Andrew of Massachusetts,illuminates this point in a few instructive sentences. "To comprehendthis objection, which to us seems so astonishingly wide of the mark,"says Mr. Pearson, "we must realize that whenever a New Englander of thatgeneration uttered the word 'leader' his mind's eye was filled with theimage of Daniel Webster. Even those who called the fallen statesman'Ichabod' could not forget his commanding presence, his lofty tone aboutaffairs of state, his sonorous professions of an ideal, his whole _excathedra_ attitude. All these characteristics supplied the aristocraticconnotation of the word 'leader.' Of the broad democratic meaning of theterm, the world had as yet received no demonstration. That Lincoln wasin very truth the 'new birth of a new soil,' Lowell, with the advantageof literary detachment, was one of the first to discover and proclaim,both in his political essays and in the splendid stanzas of the'Commemoration Ode.'"While Lincoln seemingly gave little heed to the question of a secondPresidential term, it must not be inferred that he was indifferentregarding it. His nature was one of those strong ones which, thoughdesiring approbation, are yet able to live without it. His whole lifehad been a schooling in self-reliance and independence, and the lastthree years especially had rendered him an adept in that sternphilosophy. But he was thoroughly human, and deep down in his nature wasa craving for human sympathy and support. Knowing that he had done hisbest and was entitled to the full approval of his countrymen, he nodoubt felt that it would be a pleasant thing to receive that approval bybeing called to serve them for another term. To one friend he remarked,using his old figure of "the people's attorney," "If the people think Ihave managed their case for them well enough to trust me to _carry it upto the next term_, I am sure I shall be glad to take it." He evidentlydreaded the rebuke that would be implied in a failure to be renominated;yet it seemed unbecoming to him, in the critical condition of thecountry, to make any personal effort to that end. To theseconsiderations were added his extreme weariness and longing for releasefrom his oppressive burdens. He was also, as Mr. Welles records in hisDiary, "greatly importuned and pressed by cunning intrigues."From these various complications, Lincoln's embarrassment andperplexity as the time for holding the Republican Convention drew nearwere extreme. A journalistic friend (Mr. J.M. Winchell), who had alengthy conversation with him on the subject, gives what is no doubt acorrect idea of his state of mind at that period. "Mr. Lincoln receivedme," says Mr. Winchell, "kindly and courteously; but his manner wasquite changed. It was not now the country about which his anxietyprevailed, but himself. There was an embarrassment about him which hecould not quite conceal. I thought it proper to state in the outset thatI wished simply to know whatever he was free to tell me in regard to hisown willingness or unwillingness to accept a renomination. The reply wasa monologue of an hour's duration, and one that wholly absorbed me, asit seemed to absorb himself. He remained seated nearly all the time. Hewas restless, often changing position, and occasionally, in some intensemoment, wheeling his body around in his chair and throwing a leg overthe arm. This was the only grotesque thing I recollect about him; hisvoice and manner were very earnest, and he uttered no jokes and told noanecdotes. He began by saying that as yet he was not a candidate forrenomination. He distinctly denied that he was a party to any effort tothat end, notwithstanding I knew that there were movements in his favorin all parts of the Northern States. These movements were, of course,without his prompting, as he positively assured me that with one or twoexceptions he had scarcely conversed on the subject with his mostintimate friends. He was not quite sure whether he desired arenomination. Such had been the responsibility of the office--sooppressive had he found its cares, so terrible its perplexities--that hefelt as though the moment when he could relinquish the burden andretire to private life would be the sweetest he could possiblyexperience. But, he said, he would not deny that a re-election wouldalso have its gratification to his feelings. He did not seek it, norwould he do so; he did not desire it for any ambitious or selfishpurpose; but after the crisis the country was passing through under hisPresidency, and the efforts he had made conscientiously to discharge theduties imposed upon him, it would be a very sweet satisfaction to him toknow that he had secured the approval of his fellow citizens and earnedthe highest testimonial of confidence they could bestow. This was thegist of the hour's monologue; and I believe he spoke sincerely. Hisvoice, his manner, gave his modest and sensible words a power ofconviction. He seldom looked me in the face while he was talking; heseemed almost to be gazing into the future. I am sure it was not apleasant thing for him to seem to be speaking in his own behalf. Forhimself, he affirmed that he should make no promises of office to anyoneas an inducement for support. If nominated and elected, he should begrateful to his friends; but the interests of the country must always befirst considered."The principal candidates talked of as successors to Lincoln wereSecretary Chase, General Fremont, and General Grant. Of the latter,Lincoln said, with characteristic frankness and generosity: "If he couldbe more useful as President in putting down the rebellion, I would becontent. He is pledged to our policy of emancipation and the employmentof negro soldiers; and if this policy is carried out, it will not makemuch difference who is President." But General Grant's good senseprevailed over his injudicious advisers, and he promptly refused toallow his name to be presented to the convention.The most formidable candidate for the Republican nomination wasSecretary Chase. The relations between him and the President had notlatterly been very harmonious; and the breach was greatly widened by abitter personal assault on Mr. Chase by General F.P. Blair, a newlyelected Congressman from Missouri, made on the floor of the House, aboutthe middle of April, under circumstances which led Mr. Chase to believethat the President inspired, or at least approved, the attack. Mr. Chasewas very angry, and an open rupture between his friends and those of thePresident was narrowly averted. Mr. Riddle, Congressman from Mr. Chase'sState (Ohio), relates that on the evening after General Blair'soffensive speech he was to accompany Mr. Chase on a visit to Baltimore."I was shown," says Mr. Riddle, "to the Secretary's private car, where Ifound him alone and in a frenzy of rage. A copy of Blair's speech hadbeen shown him at the station, and I was the sole witness of hisAchillean wrath. He threatened to leave the train at once and send thePresident his resignation; but was persuaded to go on to Baltimore. Hewished to forward his resignation from there, but concluded to withholdit till his return to Washington the next day. At Baltimore," continuesMr. Riddle, "I excused myself, and took the return train for Washington.I did not overestimate the danger to the Union cause. It would be afatal error to defeat Mr. Lincoln at the Baltimore Convention; yet howcould he succeed, with the angry resignation of Mr. Chase, and thedefection of his friends--the powerful and aggressive radicals? ReachingWashington, I went to the White House direct. I knew the President couldnot have been a party to Blair's assault, and I wanted his personalassurances to communicate to Mr. Chase at the earliest moment. I wasaccompanied by Judge Spaulding, an eminent member of the House, fullysharing Mr. Chase's confidence, and somewhat cool toward the President.We found Mr. Lincoln drawn up behind his table, with papers before him,quite grim, evidently prepared for the battle which he supposed awaitedhim. Without taking a seat, hat in hand, I stated frankly, not withoutemotion, the condition of affairs,--the public danger, my entireconfidence in him, my sole purpose there, the reason of JudgeSpaulding's presence, and that we were there in no way asrepresentatives of Mr. Chase. Mr. Lincoln was visibly affected. Thetones of confidence, sympathy, personal regard, were strangers to him atthat time. Softening, almost melting, he came round to us, shook ourhands again and again, returned to his place, and standing there, tookup and opened out, from their remote origin, the whole web of mattersconnected with the present complication. He spoke an hour--calm, clear,direct, simple. He reprehended Blair severely, and stated that he had noknowledge of his speech until after Blair left Washington. We werepermitted to communicate this to Mr. Chase. He was satisfied with thePresident's explanation, and at the Baltimore Convention my largeacquaintance enabled me to open the way for Governor Dennison of Ohio tobecome its presiding officer. All recognized the good effect of theorganization of that body by the friends of Mr. Chase."The National Republican Convention which met at Baltimore on the 8th ofJune adopted resolutions heartily approving the course of theadministration and especially the policy of emancipation, and completedits good work by nominating Abraham Lincoln as its candidate forPresident for another term. Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, was nominatedfor Vice-President. That Lincoln was gratified at this proof ofconfidence and esteem there can be no doubt. In his acceptance of thenomination, he said, with the most delicate modesty: "I view this callto a second term as in no wise more flattering to myself than as anexpression of the public judgment that I may better finish a difficultwork than could one less severely schooled to the task." And withcharacteristic humor, he thanked a visiting delegation for their goodopinion of him, saying, "I have not permitted myself to conclude that Iam the best man in the country; but I am reminded of the old Dutchfarmer who remarked to a companion that _it was not best to swap horseswhile crossing a stream_."In July, 1864, great excitement and alarm were occasioned inWashington by a body of Confederate cavalry under General Early, whoactually attacked the fortifications of the city, cut off its railroadcommunication with the North, and ravaged the country about with fireand sword. For several days skirmishing was going on between theraiders and the troops in our fortifications. The fact that thePresident himself was under fire from the enemy on this occasion gavethe episode a decided thrill of realism. He, with other governmentofficials--largely, no doubt, from motives of curiosity--visited thescene of the disturbance and witnessed the miniature but sometimesspirited engagements. Among these visitors was Secretary Welles, whothus records his experiences (Diary, July 12, 1864): "Rode out todayto Fort Stevens. Looking out over the valley below, where thecontinual popping of pickets was going on, I saw a line of our menlying close near the bottom of the valley. Senator Wade came up besideme. We went into the Fort, where we found the President, who wassitting in the shade, his back against the parapet toward theenemy.... As the firing from the Fort ceased, our men ran to thecharge and the Rebels fled. We could see them running across thefields, seeking the woods on the brow of the opposite hills. Below,we could see here and there some of our own men bearing away theirwounded comrades. Occasionally a bullet from some long-range riflepassed over our heads. It was an interesting and exciting spectacle."Another account says: "President Lincoln visited the lines in person,and refused to retire, although urged to do so. He exposed himselffreely at Fort Stevens, and a surgeon standing alongside of him waswounded by a ball which struck a gun and glanced." A gentleman namedNeill, who lived in the country, about twelve miles from the city,gives a vivid conception of the imminence of the danger. "Afterbreakfast, on Tuesday, July 12," says Mr. Neill, "I went as usual in arailway car to the city, and before noon my house was surrounded byGeneral Bradley Johnson's insurgent cavalry, who had made an attemptto capture the New York express train, and had robbed the countrystore near by of its contents. The presence of the cavalry stopped alltravel by railroad; and Senator Ramsey of Minnesota, who happened tobe in Washington, could find no way to the North except by descendingthe Potomac to its mouth and then ascending Chesapeake Bay toBaltimore. While the cavalry was in the fields around my home, theenemy's infantry was marching toward the capital by what was calledthe Seventh Street road, and they set fire to the residence of Hon.Montgomery Blair, who had been Postmaster-General. As I sat in my roomat the President's, the smoke of the burning mansion was visible; butbusiness was transacted with as much quietness as if the foe werehundreds of miles distant. Mr. Fox, the assistant Secretary of theNavy, had in a private note informed the President that if thereshould be a necessity for him to leave the city he would find asteamer in readiness at the wharf at the foot of Sixth Street. Aboutone o'clock in the afternoon of each day of the skirmishing, thePresident would enter his carriage, and drive to the forts, in thesuburbs, and watch the soldiers repulse the invaders." For severaldays Washington was in great danger of capture. Nearly all the forceshad been sent forward to reinforce Grant, and the city wascomparatively defenseless. But its slender garrison, mostly rawrecruits, held out gallantly under the encouragement of the President,until Grant sent a column to attack Early, who promptly withdrew, andthe crisis was over. This was the last time the enemy threatened thenational capital. From that time he had enough to do to defendRichmond.Lincoln labored under deep depression during the summer of 1864. TheArmy of the Potomac achieved apparently very little in return for itsenormous expenditure of blood and treasure. Until the victories ofFarragut in Mobile Bay, late in August, and Sherman at Atlanta a fewdays later, the gloom was unrelieved. The people were restless andimpatient, and vented their displeasure upon the administration, holdingit responsible for all reverses and disappointments, and giving grudgingpraise for success at any point. The popular displeasure was increasedby the President's call for 500,000 additional troops, made July 18,--ameasure which some of his strongest friends deprecated, as likely tojeopardize his re-election in November. "It is not a personal questionat all," said Lincoln. "It matters not what becomes of _me. We must havethe men_. If I go down, I intend to go like the Cumberland, with mycolors flying." To the question, When is the war to end? he said,"Surely I feel as deep an interest in this question as any other can;but I do not wish to name a day, a month, or a year, when it is to end.We accepted this war _for an object_--a worthy object; and the war willend _when that object is attained_. Under God, I hope it _never willend until that time_."The President's mind seemed constantly weighted with anxiety as to themovements and fortunes of our armies in the field. He could not sleep atnight under this crushing load. Secretary Welles's Diary gives frequentinstances of this. Once, after an engagement between the Western armies,the President, says Mr. Welles, "came to me with the latest news. He wasfeeling badly. Tells me a despatch was sent to him at the Soldiers' Homelast night shortly after he got asleep, and so disturbed him that he hadno more rest, but arose and came to the city and passed the remainder ofthe night awake and watchful." At another time, after a desperate battlebetween Grant and Lee, Mr. Welles says: "The President came into my roomabout one P.M. and told me he _had slept none last night._ He lay downfor a short time on the sofa in my room, and detailed all the news hehad gathered."Ex-Governor Bross of Illinois furnishes an account of an interview withLincoln during this dark period: "The last time I saw Mr. Lincoln, till,as a pallbearer, I accompanied his remains to their last resting-place,was in the early part of August, 1864. It was directly after thefrightful disaster at Petersburg, and I was on my way to the front, torecover, if possible, the body of my brother, Colonel John A. Bross, whofell there at the head of his regiment. I found the President with alarge pile of documents before him. He laid down his pen and gave me acordial but rather melancholy welcome, asking anxiously for news fromthe West. Neither of us could shut our eyes to the gloom which hung overthe entire country. The terrible losses of the Wilderness, and the awfuldisaster at Petersburg, weighed heavily upon our spirits. To a question,I answered that the people expected a still more vigorous prosecutionof the war; more troops and needful appliances would, if called for, beforthcoming. 'I will tell you what the people want,' said the President,'they want, and must have, _success_. But whether that come or not, Ishall stay _right here_ and do my duty. Here I shall be; and they maycome and hang me on that tree' (pointing out of the window to one),'but, God helping me, I shall never desert my post.' This was said in away that assured me that these were the sentiments of his inmost soul."The President, about this time, was greatly worried by Horace Greeleyand others, who importuned him to receive negotiations for peace fromthe Confederate authorities. He at length said to Mr. Greeley, "I notonly intend a sincere effort for peace, but you shall be a personalwitness that it is made." On the same day that the call for additionaltroops was made, the President issued, through Mr. Greeley, the famousletter, "To Whom It May Concern," promising safe conduct to any personor persons authorized to present "any proposition which embraces therestoration of peace, the _integrity of the whole Union_, and the_abandonment of slavery_." Nothing came of the proposed negotiations,except to stop for a time the mischievous fault-finding; which was, ofcourse, the result aimed at by Lincoln. The act was severely condemnedby many Republicans; but Lincoln only said, "It is hardly fair for themto say the letter amounts to _nothing_. It will shut up Greeley, andsatisfy the people who are clamoring for peace. That's _something_,anyhow!"So much blame was heaped upon the Government, and so great was thedissatisfaction at the North, that Lincoln looked upon the election ofhis competitor, General McClellan, and his own retirement, as notimprobable. An incident in evidence of his discouragement is related bySecretary Welles. Entering the Executive office one day, Mr. Welles wasasked to write his name across the back of a sealed paper which thePresident handed him. The names of several other members of the Cabinetwere already on the paper, with the dates of signature. After theelection, Lincoln opened the document in the presence of his Cabinet andread to them its contents, as follows:     EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON,     August 23, 1864.     This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable     that this administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my     duty to co-operate with the President-elect so as to save the Union     between the election and the inauguration.     A. LINCOLN.By this careful prevision had Lincoln pledged himself to give to hissuccessor that unselfish and patriotic assistance of which he himselfhad stood so sorely in need.As the desperation of the South and the opposition to Lincoln at theNorth increased, fears were entertained by his friends that an attemptmight be made upon his life. Lincoln himself paid but little heed tothese forebodings of evil. He said, philosophically: "I long ago made upmy mind that if anybody wants to kill me, he will do it. If I wore ashirt of mail and kept myself surrounded by a bodyguard, it would be allthe same. There are a thousand ways of getting at a man if it is desiredthat he should be killed. Besides, in this case, it seems to me, the manwho would succeed me would be just as objectionable to my enemies--if Ihave any." One dark night, as he was going out with a friend, he tookalong a heavy cane, remarking good-humoredly that "mother" (Mrs.Lincoln) had "got a notion into her head that I shall be assassinated,and to please her I take a cane when I go over to the War Department atnights--when I don't forget it."It is probable that the attempts upon the life of President Lincoln weremore numerous than is generally known. An incident of a very thrillingcharacter, which might easily have involved a shocking tragedy, isrelated by Mr. John W. Nichols, who from the summer of 1862 until 1865was one of the President's body-guard. "One night, about the middle ofAugust, 1864," says Mr. Nichols, "I was doing sentinel duty at the largegate through which entrance was had to the grounds of the Soldiers'Home, near Washington, where Mr. Lincoln spent much time in summer.About eleven o'clock I heard a rifle-shot in the direction of the city,and shortly afterwards I heard approaching hoof-beats. In two or threeminutes a horse came dashing up, and I recognized the belated President.The horse he rode was a very spirited one, and was Mr. Lincoln'sfavorite saddle-horse. As horse and rider approached the gate, I noticedthat the President was bareheaded. As soon as I had assisted him inchecking his steed, the President said to me: 'He came pretty neargetting away with me, didn't he? He got the bit in his teeth before Icould draw the rein.' I then asked him where his hat was; and he repliedthat somebody had fired a gun off down at the foot of the hill, and thathis horse had become scared and had jerked his hat off. I led the animalto the Executive Cottage, and the President dismounted and entered.Thinking the affair rather strange, a corporal and myself started off toinvestigate. When we reached the place whence the sound of the shot hadcome--a point where the driveway intersects, with the main road--wefound the President's hat. It was a plain silk hat, and upon examinationwe discovered a _bullet-hole_ through the crown. We searched thelocality thoroughly, but without avail. Next day I gave Mr. Lincoln hishat, and called his attention to the bullet-hole. He made some humorousremark, to the effect that it was made by some foolish marksman and wasnot intended for him; but added that he wished nothing said about thematter. We all felt confident it was an attempt to kill the President,and after that he never rode alone."Amidst his terrible trials, Lincoln often exhibited a forced andsorrowful serenity, which many mistook for apathy. Even his oldest andbest friends were sometimes deceived in this way. Hon. Leonard Swettrelates a touching instance: "In the summer of 1864, when Grant waspounding his way toward Richmond in those terrible battles of theWilderness, myself and wife were in Washington trying to do what littletwo persons could do toward alleviating the sufferings of the maimed anddying in the vast hospitals of that city. We tried to be thorough andsystematic. We took the first man we came to, brought him delicacies,wrote letters to his friends, or did for him whatever else he mostneeded; then the next man, and so on. Day after day cars and ambulanceswere coming in, laden with untold sorrows for thousands of homes. Afterweeks of this kind of experience my feelings became so wrought up that Isaid to myself: The country cannot long endure this sacrifice. In mercy,both to North and South, every man capable of bearing arms must behurried forward to Grant to end this, fearful slaughter at the earliestpossible moment. I went to President Lincoln at the White House, andpoured myself out to him. He was sitting by an open window; and as Ipaused, a bird lit upon a branch just outside and was twittering andsinging most joyously. Mr. Lincoln, imitating the bird, said: '_Tweet,tweet, tweet_; isn't he singing sweetly?' I felt as if my legs had beencut from under me. I rose, took my hat, and said, 'I see the country issafer than I thought.' As I moved toward the door, Mr. Lincoln calledout, in his hearty, familiar way, 'Here, Swett, come back and sit down.'Then he went on: 'It is impossible for a man in my position not to havethought of all those things. Weeks ago every man capable of bearing armswas ordered to the front, and everything you have suggested has beendone.'"The burdens borne by Lincoln seemed never to tell so seriously on hisstrength and vitality as in this terrible battle-summer of 1864. For himthere had been no respite, no holiday. Others left the heat and dust ofWashington for rest and recuperation; but he remained at his post. Thedemands upon him were incessant; one anxiety and excitement followedanother, and under the relentless strain even his sturdy strength beganto give way. "I sometimes fancy," said he, with pathetic good-humor,"that every one of the numerous grist ground through here daily, from aSenator seeking a war with France down to a poor woman after a place inthe Treasury Department, darted at me with thumb and finger, picked out_their especial piece of my vitality_, and carried it off. When I getthrough with such a day's work there is only one word which can expressmy condition, and that is _flabbiness_." Once Mr. Brooks "found himsitting in his chair so collapsed and weary that he did not look up orspeak when I addressed him. He put out his hand, mechanically, as if toshake hands, when I told him I had come at his bidding. Presently heroused a little, and remarked that he had had '_a mighty hard day_.'"Mr. Riddle, who saw him at this period, after some months' absence, sayshe was shocked, on gaining admission to the President, "by hisappearance--that of a _baited, cornered man_, always on the defenseagainst attacks that he could not openly meet and defy or punish." Mr.Carpenter, an inmate of the White House, says: "Absorbed in his papers,he would become unconscious of my presence, while I intently studiedevery line and shade of expression in that furrowed face. There weredays when I could scarcely look into it without crying. During the firstweek of the battles of the Wilderness he scarcely slept at all. Passingthrough the main hall of the domestic apartment on one of these days, Imet him, clad in a long morning wrapper, pacing back and forth a narrowpassage leading to one of the windows, his hands behind him, great blackrings under his eyes, his head bent forward upon his breast,--altogethersuch a picture of the effects of sorrow, care, and anxiety as would havemelted the hearts of the worst of his adversaries, who so mistakenlyapplied to him the epithets of tyrant and usurper."Mr. Edward Dicey, the English historian, says: "Never in my knowledgehave I seen a sadder face than that of the late President during thetime his features were familiar to me. It is so easy to be wise afterthe event; but it seems to me now that one ought somehow to haveforeseen that the stamp of a sad end was impressed by nature on thatrugged, haggard face. The exceeding sadness of the eyes and theirstrange sweetness were the one redeeming feature in a face of unusualplainness, and there was about them that odd, weird look, which someeyes possess, of seeming to see more than the outer objects of the worldaround."Lincoln's family and friends strove to beguile him of his melancholy.They took him to places of amusement; they walked and drove with him inthe pleasantest scenes about the capital; and above all, they talkedwith him of times past, seeking to divert his mind from its presentdistress by reviving memories of more joyous days. His old friends were,as Mr. Arnold states, "shocked with the change in his appearance. Theyhad known him at his home, and at the courts in Illinois, with a frameof iron and nerves of steel; as a man who hardly knew what illness was,ever genial and sparkling with frolic and fun, nearly always cheery andbright. Now they saw the wrinkles on his face and forehead deepen intofurrows; the laugh of old days was less frequent, and it did not seem tocome from the heart. Anxiety, responsibility, care, thought, disasters,defeats, the injustice of friends, wore upon his giant frame, and hisnerves of steel became at times irritable. He said one day, with apathos which language cannot describe, 'I feel as though I shall _neverbe glad again_.'"Hon. Schuyler Colfax repeats a similarly pathetic expression which fellfrom the lips of the afflicted President. "One morning," says Mr.Colfax, "calling upon him on business, I found him looking more thanusually pale and careworn, and inquired the reason. He replied with thebad news he had received at a late hour the previous night, which hadnot yet been communicated to the press, adding that he had not closedhis eyes or breakfasted; and, with an expression I shall never forget,he exclaimed, 'How willingly would I exchange places today with thesoldier who sleeps on the ground in the Army of the Potomac!'"A lady who saw Lincoln in the summer of 1864 for the first time, and whohad expected to see "a very homely man," says: "I was totally unpreparedfor the impression instantly made upon me. So bowed and sorrow-laden washis whole person, expressing such weariness of mind and body, as hedropped himself heavily from step to step down to the ground. But hisface!--oh, the pathos of it!--haggard, drawn into fixed lines ofunutterable sadness, with a look of loneliness, as of a soul whose depthof sorrow and bitterness no human sympathy could ever reach. I was sopenetrated with the anguish and settled grief in every feature, that Igazed at him through tears, and felt I had stepped upon the threshold ofa sanctuary too sacred for human feet. The impression I carried away wasthat I had seen, not so much the President of the United States, as _thesaddest man in the world_."The changes in Lincoln's appearance were noted in the subdued, refined,purified expression of his face, as of one struggling almost againsthope, but still patiently enduring. Mr. Brooks says, "I have knownimpressionable women, touched by his sad face and his gentle bearing, togo away in tears." Another observer, Rev. C.B. Crane, wrote at the time:"The President looks thin and careworn. His form is bowed as by acrushing load; his flesh is wasted as by incessant solicitude; and hisface is thin and furrowed and pale, as though it had becomespiritualized by the vicarious pain which he endured in bearing onhimself all the calamities of his country." Truly it might be said ofhim, in the words of Matthew Arnold:    With aching hands and bleeding feet      We dig and heap, lay stone on stone;    We bear the burden and the heat      Of the long day, and wish 't were done.    Not till the hours of light return      All we have built do we discern.In the tragic experiences of Lincoln in these dark days, the outlook wasless gloomy than it had seemed to his tortured soul. He was even then,as Mr. John Bigelow puts it, "making for himself a larger place inhistory than he had any idea of." He "builded better than he knew"; andthe "hours of light" were soon to come when he would know what he hadbuilt and see the signs that promised better things. The Presidentialelection of 1864 demonstrated the abiding confidence of the people inhim and his administration. Every loyal State but three--New Jersey,Delaware, and Kentucky--gave him its electoral vote; and his popularmajority over McClellan, the Democratic candidate, was upwards of400,000. Lincoln was cheered but not exultant at the news. Late in theevening of election day (November 8, 1864) he said, in response topublic congratulations: "I am thankful to God for this approval of thepeople. But while deeply grateful for this mark of their confidence inme, if I know my own heart my gratitude is free from any taint ofpersonal triumph. It is not in my nature to triumph over anyone; but Igive thanks to Almighty God for this evidence of the people's resolutionto stand by free government and the rights of humanity."While the election returns were coming in, early in the evening, Lincolnwas at the War Department with a little group assembled to hear themread. How different the scene from that in the quiet country town wherehe had waited for the returns on a similar occasion four years before!Then all was peace--the lull before the storm. Now the storm had broken,and its greatest fury was raging about that patient and devoted man whowaited to hear the decision of the nation's supreme tribunal--the voiceof the people whose decree would settle the fate of himself and of thecountry. Mr. Charles A. Dana, Assistant Secretary of War, who was in thegroup, gives this description of the scene: "General Eckert was comingin continually with telegrams containing election returns. Mr. Stantonwould read them, and the President would look at them and comment uponthem. Presently there came a lull in the returns, and Mr. Lincoln calledme up to a place by his side. 'Dana,' said he, 'have you ever read anyof the writings of Petroleum V. Nasby?' 'No, sir,' I said, 'I have onlylooked at some of them, and they seemed to me funny.' 'Well,' said he,'let me read you a specimen,' and pulling out a thin yellow-coveredpamphlet from his breast pocket he began to read aloud. Mr. Stantonviewed this proceeding with great impatience, as I could see; but Mr.Lincoln paid no attention to that. He would read a page or a story,pause to con a new election telegram, and then open the book again andgo ahead with a new passage. Finally Mr. Chase came in; and presentlyMr. Whitelaw Reid, and then the reading was interrupted. Mr. Stantonwent to the door and beckoned me into the next room. I shall neverforget his indignation at what seemed to him disgusting nonsense."The morning following the election one of his private secretaries, Mr.Neill, coming to the Executive office earlier than usual, found Lincolnat his table engaged in his regular routine of official work. "Enteringthe room," says Mr. Neill, "I took a seat by his side, extended my hand,and congratulated him upon the vote, for the country's sake and for hisown sake. Turning away from the papers which had been occupying hisattention, he spoke kindly of his competitor, the calm, prudent General,and great organizer."The importance of Lincoln's re-election, to the country and to himself,is forcibly stated by General Grant and Secretary Seward. The formertelegraphed from City Point, the day following: "The victory is worthmore to the country than a battle won." And the same evening, at apublic gathering held to celebrate the event, Mr. Seward said: "Theelection has placed our President beyond the pale of human envy or humanharm, as he is above the pale of human ambition. Henceforth all men willcome to see him as we have seen him--a true, loyal, patient, patriotic,and benevolent man. Having no longer any motive to malign or injure him,detraction will cease, and Abraham Lincoln will take his place withWashington and Franklin and Jefferson and Adams and Jackson--among thebenefactors of the country and of the human race."Lincoln evidently felt greatly reassured by the result of what hadseemed to him a very doubtful contest; but with the return ofcheerfulness came also the dread of continuing his official labors. Hebegan to long and plan for that happy period at the end of the secondterm when he should be free from public burdens. "Mrs. Lincoln desiredto go to Europe for a long tour of pleasure," says Mr. Brooks. "ThePresident was disposed to gratify her wish; but he fixed his eyes onCalifornia as a place of permanent residence. He had heard so much ofthe delightful climate and the abundant natural productions ofCalifornia that he had become possessed of a strong desire to visit theState and remain there if he were satisfied with the results of hisobservations. 'When we leave this place,' he said, one day, 'we shallhave enough, I think, to take care of us old people. The boys must lookout for themselves. I guess mother will be satisfied with six months orso in Europe. After that I should really like to go to California andtake a look at the Pacific coast.'"After the Baltimore Convention, Mr. Chase proposed to resign hisposition as Secretary of the Treasury, but he was persuaded byinfluential friends of himself and Lincoln to reconsider hisdetermination. Chief among these friends was Hon. John Brough, thesturdy "War Governor" of Ohio. Later in the summer of 1864 the relationsbetween the President and Secretary Chase again became inharmonious; thelatter determined a second time to resign, and communicated that factin a confidential letter to Governor Brough. Hon. Wm. Henry Smith, atthat time Ohio's Secretary of State, and intimately acquainted with thecircumstances as they occurred, says: "Mr. Brough went directly toWashington to bring about another reconciliation. After talking thematter over with Mr. Chase and Mr. Stanton, he called on the Presidentand urged a settlement that would retain the services of Mr. Chase inthe Treasury Department. Mr. Lincoln was very kind, and admitted theforce of all that was urged; but finally said, with a quiet butimpressive firmness, 'Brough, I think you had better _give up the job_this time.' And thereupon he gave reasons why it was unwise for Mr.Chase to continue longer in the Cabinet."In the autumn, the Chief-Justiceship became vacant by the death of JudgeR.B. Taney (October 11, 1864), and the friends of Mr. Chase, who wasthen in retirement, desired his elevation to that honorable seat.Congressman Riddle, who was designated to present the matter to thePresident, says: "After hearing what I had to say, Mr. Lincoln asked,'Will this content Mr. Chase?' 'It is said that those bitten of thePresidency die of it,' I replied. His smile showed he would not takethat answer. I added: 'Mr. Chase is conscious of ability to serve thecountry as President. We should expect the greatest from him.' 'He wouldnot disappoint you, were it in his reach. But I should be sorry to see aChief-Justice anxious to _swap_ for it.' I said then what I had alreadysaid to Mr. Chase: that I would rather be the Chief Justice than thePresident. I urged that the purity and elevation of Mr. Chase'scharacter guaranteed the dignity of the station from all compromise;that momentous questions must arise, involving recent exercises ofpower, without precedents to guide the court; that the honor of theGovernment would be safe in the hands of Mr. Chase. 'Would you _pack_the Supreme Court?' he asked, a little sharply. 'Would you have a Judgewith no preconceived notions of law?' was my response. 'True, true,' washis laughing reply; 'how could I find anyone, fit for the place, who hasnot some definite notions on all questions likely to arise?'"The proposed appointment of Mr. Chase as Chief-Justice was severelycriticized by certain friends of Lincoln, who believed Mr. Chase waspersonally hostile to the President, and could not understand thelatter's magnanimity in thus ignoring personal considerations. When toldof these criticisms, Lincoln said: "My friends all over the country aretrying to put up the bars between me and Governor Chase. I have a vastnumber of messages and letters from men who think they are my friends,imploring and warning me not to appoint him. Now I know more aboutGovernor Chase's hostility to me than any of these men can tell me; but_I am going to nominate him_." Which he did, and Chase becameChief-Justice in December, 1864.The withdrawal of Secretary Chase from the Cabinet was soon followed bythat of Postmaster-General Blair, who was succeeded by ex-GovernorDennison of Ohio. Blair received, says Mr. Welles in his Diary, a letterfrom the President, which, though friendly in tone, informed him thatthe time had arrived when it seemed best that he should retire, andrequesting his resignation, which was promptly given. Mr. Welles saysthat the President subsequently informed him that "Mr. Chase had manyfriends who felt wounded that he should have left the Cabinet, and leftalone. The friends of Blair had been his assailants, and the Presidentthought that if he also left the Cabinet Chase and his friends would besatisfied and the administration would be relieved of irritatingbickerings. The relations of Blair with Stanton also were such that itwas difficult for the two to remain." A little later came theresignation of Attorney-General Bates, which, says Mr. Welles, "hasinitiated more intrigues. A host of candidates are thrustforward--Evarts, Holt, Gushing, Whiting, and the Lord knows who, are allcandidates." This gives but a faint idea of the embarrassments anddissensions among Lincoln's friends and official advisers, and of theceaseless efforts and infinite tact that were needed to maintain adecent degree of harmony among them.Early in December the President submitted to Congress his fourth annualmessage--a brief and businesslike statement of the prospects andpurposes of the Government. Its first sentence is: "The most remarkablefeature in the military operations of the year is General Sherman'sattempted march of three hundred miles directly through the insurgentregion." Then follows a reference to the important movements that hadoccurred during the year, "to the effect of moulding society fordurability in the Union." The document closes with the followingexplicit statement: "In presenting the abandonment of armed resistanceto the national authority, on the part of the insurgents, as the onlyindispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the Government,I _retract nothing_ heretofore said as to slavery. If the people should,by whatever mode or means, make it an executive duty to re-enslave suchpersons, _another, and not I_, must be their instrument to perform it.In stating a single condition of peace, I mean simply to say that thewar will cease on the part of the Government whenever it shall haveceased on the part of those who began it."New Year's day, 1865, was marked by a memorable incident. Among thecrowds gathered in the White House grounds stood groups of coloredpeople, watching with eager eyes the tide of people flowing in at theopen door to exchange salutations with the President. It was a privilegeheretofore reserved for the white race; but now, as the line of visitorsthinned, showing that the reception was nearly over, the boldest of thecolored men drew near the door with faltering step. Some were inconventional attire, others in fantastic dress, and others again inlaborers' garb. The novel procession moved into the vestibule and oninto the room where the President was holding the republican court.Timid and doubting, though determined, they ventured where theiroppressed and down-trodden race had never appeared before, and with thekeen, anxious, inquiring look on their dark faces, seemed like a herd ofwild creatures from the woods, in a strange and dangerous place. Thereception had been unusually well attended, and the President was nearlyovercome with weariness; but when he saw the dusky faces of his unwontedvisitors, he rallied from his fatigue and gave them a hearty welcome.They were wild with joy. Thronging about him, they pressed and kissedhis hand, laughing and weeping at once, and exclaiming, "God bless MassaLinkum!" It was a scene not easy to forget: the thanks and adoration ofa race paid to their deliverer.Ever since issuing the Emancipation Proclamation Lincoln had earnestlydesired that that measure should be perfected by a Constitutionalamendment forever prohibiting slavery in the territory of the UnitedStates. He had discussed the matter fully with his friends in Congress,and repeatedly urged them to press it to an issue. Just before theBaltimore Convention, he urged Senator Morgan of New York, chairman ofthe National Republican Committee, to have the proposed amendment madethe "key-note of the speeches and the key-note of the platform."Congressman Rollins of Missouri relates that the President said to him,"The passage of the amendment will _clinch the whole matter_." Thesubject was already definitely before Congress. In December, 1863, jointresolutions for this great end had been introduced in the House by Hon.James M. Ashley of Ohio, and in the Senate by Hon. Charles Sumner ofMassachusetts and Hon. J.B. Henderson of Missouri. Senator Trumbull ofthe Judiciary Committee, to whom the Senate resolutions were referred,reported a substitute for the amendment, which, in April, 1864, passedthe Senate by a vote of thirty-eight to six; but reaching the House,June 15, it failed to get the necessary two-thirds vote and wasdefeated. At the next session of Congress the resolutions were againpresented to the House, and after a protracted debate were passed(January 13, 1865) by a vote of one hundred and nineteen to fifty-six.Illinois was the first State to ratify the amendment; and otherspromptly followed. Lincoln was grateful and delighted. He remarked,"This ends the job"; adding, "I feel proud that Illinois is a littleahead."Overtures having been made, through General Grant, for a meeting betweenthe President and certain "peace commissioners" representing thebelligerents, Lincoln, anxious that nothing should be left undone thatmight evidence his desire to bring the war to a close, consented to theinterview. On the morning of February 2, 1865, he left Washington, quiteprivately, in order to accomplish his mission without awakening thegossip and criticism which publicity would excite. At Fortress Monroe hewas joined by Secretary Seward, who seems to have been the only memberof the Cabinet who knew of the President's intention to meet theSouthern Commissioners. Lincoln took the full responsibility, as heoften did when dealing with risky or unpopular measures. "None of theCabinet were advised of this move, and without exception I think itstruck them unfavorably that the Chief Magistrate should have gone onsuch a mission," is the comment of Secretary Welles,--although he adds,"The discussion will be likely to tend to peace."The next morning (February 3) the President and Mr. Seward received theSouthern Commissioners--Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell--on board the U.S.steam transport "River Queen" in Hampton Roads. The conference, saysMr. Seward, "was altogether informal. There was no attendance ofsecretaries, clerks, or other witnesses. Nothing was written or read.The conversation, although earnest and free, was calm and courteous andkind on both sides. The Richmond party approached the subject ratherindirectly, and at no time did they either make categorical demands ortender formal stipulations or absolute refusals. Nevertheless, duringthe conference, which lasted four hours, the several points at issuebetween the Government and the insurgents were distinctly raised anddiscussed, fully, intelligently, and in an amicable spirit."The meeting was fruitless. The commissioners asked, as a preliminarystep, the recognition of Jefferson Davis as President of the SouthernConfederacy. Lincoln declined, stating that "the only ground on which hecould rest the justice of the war--either with his own people or withforeign powers--was that it was not a war of conquest, for the Stateshad never been separated from the Union. Consequently he could notrecognize another government inside of the one of which he alone wasPresident, nor admit the separate independence of States that were yet apart of the Union. 'That,' said he, 'would be doing what you have solong asked Europe to do in vain, and be resigning the only thing thearmies of the Union have been fighting for.' Mr. Hunter, one of thecommissioners, made a long reply to this, insisting that the recognitionof Davis's power to make a treaty was the first and indispensable stepto peace, and referred to the correspondence between King Charles I. andhis Parliament as a trustworthy precedent of a constitutional rulertreating with rebels. Lincoln's face then wore that indescribableexpression which generally preceded his hardest hits, as he remarked:'Upon questions of history I must refer you to Mr. Seward, for he isposted in such things, and I don't pretend to be. My only distinctrecollection of the matter is that _Charles lost his head_.'"Alexander H. Stephens, one of the commissioners at the meeting onboard the "River Queen," and the Vice-President of the waningConfederacy, was a very small man physically, with a complexion soyellow as to suggest an ear of ripe corn. Lincoln gave the followinghumorous account of the meeting with him: "Mr. Stephens had on anovercoat about three sizes too big for him, with an old-fashioned highcollar. The cabin soon began to get pretty warm, and after a while hestood up and pulled off his big coat. He slipped it off just about asyou would husk an ear of corn. I couldn't help thinking, as I lookedfirst at the overcoat and then at the man, 'Well, that's the _biggestshuck_ and the _smallest nubbin_ I ever laid eyes on.'"So strongly were Lincoln's hopes fixed on finding some possible basisfor a peaceful restoration of the Union that a few days after his returnfrom his meeting with the Southern Peace Commissioners he presented tothe Cabinet (February 5, 1865) a scheme for paying to the SouthernStates a partial compensation for the loss of their slaves, providedthey would at once discontinue armed resistance to the FederalGovernment. It was, says Mr. Welles, who was present at the meetingreferred to, as "a proposition for paying the expenses of the war fortwo hundred days, or four hundred millions of dollars, to the rebelliousStates, to be for the extinguishment of slavery. The scheme did not meetwith favor, and was dropped." But it showed, adds Mr. Welles, "theearnest desire of the President to conciliate and effect peace."The evening of March 3, 1865, the President had remained with hisCabinet at the Capitol until a late hour, finishing the businesspertaining to the last acts of the old Congress. His face had theineffaceable care-worn look, yet his manner was cheerful, and heappeared to be occupied with the work of the moment, to the exclusion ofall thoughts of the future or of the great event of the morrow.Rain prevailed during the morning of inauguration day, but before noonit had ceased falling. The new Senate, convened for a special session,was organized, and Andrew Johnson was sworn in its presence into theoffice of Vice-President. Shortly after twelve o'clock, Lincoln enteredthe chamber and joined the august procession, which then moved to theeastern portico. As Lincoln stepped forward to take the oath of office,a flood of sunlight suddenly burst from the clouds, illuminating hisface and form as he bowed to the acclamations of the people. Speaking ofthis incident next day, he said, "Did you notice that sunburst? It mademy heart jump." Cheers and shouts rent the air as the President preparedto speak his inaugural. He raised his arm, and the crowd hushed to catchhis opening words. He paused, as though thronging memories impededutterance; then, in a voice clear and strong, but touched with pathos,he read that eloquent and imperishable composition, the Second InauguralAddress.     _Fellow-Countrymen:_ At this second appearing to take the oath of     the Presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended     address than there was at the first. Then a statement, somewhat in     detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper. Now,     at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations     have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the     great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the     energies of the Nation, little that is new could be presented. The     progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as     well known to the public as to myself; and it is, I trust,     reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for     the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.     On the occasion corresponding to this, four years ago, all thoughts     were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it,     all sought to avoid it. While the inaugural address was being     delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union     without war, insurgent agents were in the city, seeking to destroy     it with war,--seeking to dissolve the Union, and divide the effects     by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would     make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would     accept war rather than let it perish; and the war came. One-eighth     of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed     generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it.     These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew     that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen,     perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the     insurgents would rend the Union by war, while the Government     claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial     enlargement of it.     Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration     which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause     of the conflict might cease when, or even before the conflict     itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a     result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible,     and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the     other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just     God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other     men's faces; but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The     prayer of both could not be answered. That of neither has been     answered fully. The Almighty has his own purposes. "Woe unto the     world because of offenses, for it must needs be that offenses come,     but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh." If we shall     suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses, which, in     the Providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued     through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He     gives to North and South this terrible war, as the woe due to those     by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure     from those Divine attributes which the believers in a living God     always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray,     that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet if God     wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's     two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and     until every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be paid by     another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago,     so still it must be said: "The judgments of the Lord are true and     righteous altogether."     With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the     right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish     the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him     who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and for his     orphan; to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting     peace among ourselves and with all nations.This address was probably, next to the Gettysburg oration, Lincoln'smost eloquent and touching public appeal. Gladstone of England said ofit: "I am taken captive by so striking an utterance as this. I see init the effect of sharp trial, when rightly borne, to raise men to ahigher level of thought and action. It is by cruel suffering thatnations are sometimes born to a better life. So it is with individualmen. Lincoln's words show that upon him anxiety and sorrow have wroughttheir true effect."As the procession moved from the Capitol to the White House, at theclose of the inaugural ceremonies, a bright star was visible in theheavens. The crowds gazing upon the unwonted phenomenon noted it as anauspicious omen, like the baptism of sunshine which had seemed toconsecrate the President anew to his exalted office.CHAPTER XXVIII     Close of the Civil War--Last Acts in the Great Tragedy--Lincoln at     the Front--A Memorable Meeting--Lincoln, Grant, Sherman, and     Porter--Life on Shipboard--Visit to Petersburg--Lincoln and the     Prisoners--Lincoln in Richmond--The Negroes Welcoming their "Great     Messiah"--A Warm Reception--Lee's Surrender--Lincoln Receives the     News--Universal Rejoicing--Lincoln's Last Speech to the Public--His     Peelings and Intentions toward the South--His Desire for     Reconciliation.Great events crowded upon each other in the last few weeks of the CivilWar; and we must pass rapidly over them, giving special prominence onlyto those with which President Lincoln was personally connected. The Armyof the Potomac under Grant, which for nearly a year had been incessantlyengaged with the army of General Lee, had forced the latter, fightingdesperately at every step, back through the Wilderness, into thedefenses about Richmond; and Lee's early surrender or retreat southwardseemed the only remaining alternatives. But the latter course,disastrous as it would have been for the Confederacy, was renderedimpracticable by the comprehensive plan of operations that had beenadopted a year before. Interposed between Richmond and the South was nowthe powerful army of General Sherman. This daring and self-reliantofficer, after his brilliant triumph at Atlanta the previous fall, hadpushed on to Savannah and captured that city also; then turning hisveteran columns northward, he had swept like a dread meteor throughSouth Carolina, destroying the proud city of Charleston, and thenColumbia, the State capital. General Johnston, with a strong force,vainly tried to stay his progress through North Carolina; but after adesperate though unsuccessful battle at Bentonville (March 20, 1865),the opposition gave way, and the Union troops occupied Goldsboro, animportant point a hundred miles south of Richmond, commanding theSouthern railway communications of the Confederate capital. Thesituation was singularly dramatic and impressive. In this narrow theatreof war were now being rendered, with all the leading actors on thestage, the closing scenes of that great and bloody tragedy. Grant on thenorth and Sherman on the south were grinding Lee and Johnston betweenthem like upper and nether millstones.The last days of March brought unmistakable signs of the speedybreaking-up of the rebellion. Lincoln, filled with anticipation notunmixed with anxiety, wished to be at the front. "When we came to theend of the War and the breaking-up of things," says General Grant, "oneof Lincoln's friends said to me, 'I think Lincoln would like to comedown and spend a few days at City Point, but he is afraid if he doescome it might look like interfering with the movements of the army, andafter all that has been said about other Generals he hesitates.' I wastold that if Lincoln had a hint from me that he would be welcome hewould come by the first boat. Of course I sent word that the Presidentcould do me no greater honor than to come down and be my guest. He camedown, and we spent several days riding around the lines. He was a finehorseman. He talked, and talked, and talked; he seemed to enjoy it, andsaid, 'How grateful I feel to be with the boys and see what is beingdone at Richmond!' He never asked a question about the movements. Hewould say, 'Tell me what has been done; not what is to be done.' Hewould sit for hours tilted back in his chair, with his hand shading hiseyes, watching the movements of the men with the greatest interest."Another account says: "Lincoln made many visits with Grant to the linesaround Richmond and Petersburg. On such occasions he usually rode one ofthe General's fine bay horses, called 'Cincinnati.' He was a goodhorseman, and made his way through swamps and over corduroy roads aswell as the best trooper in the command. The soldiers invariablyrecognized him, and greeted him, wherever he appeared amongst them, withcheers that were no lip service, but came from the depth of theirhearts. He always had a pleasant salute or a friendly word for the menin the ranks."Aside from the President's desire to be at the front at this criticaltime, he had an almost feverish anxiety to escape from the pettyconcerns and details of official life in Washington. In Welles's Diaryis this entry (March 23, 1865): "The President has gone to the front,partly to get rid of the throng [office-seekers, politicians, etc.] thatis pressing on him. The more he yields, the greater the pressure. It hasnow become such that he is compelled to flee. There is no doubt he ismuch worn down. Besides, he wishes the war terminated, and, to this end,that severe terms shall not be exacted of the Rebels."Much of the time during the President's visit to the army he had hisquarters on the steamer "River Queen," lying in the James river at CityPoint. It was the same vessel on which he had received the Southernpeace commissioners a month before, and the one on which he had made thejourney from Washington. On the 27th of March a memorable interviewoccurred in the cabin of this vessel, between President Lincoln,Generals Grant and Sherman, and Admiral Porter. General Sherman thusdescribes the interview: "I left Goldsboro on the 25th of March andreached City Point on the afternoon of the 27th. I found General Grantand staff occupying a neat set of log huts, on a bluff overlooking theJames river. The General's family was with him. We had quite a long andfriendly talk, when Grant remarked that the President was near by in asteamer lying at the dock, and he proposed that we should call at once.We did so, and found Mr. Lincoln on board the 'River Queen.' We had metin the early part of the war; he recognized me, and received me with awarmth of manner and expression that was most grateful. We sat some timein the after-cabin, and Mr. Lincoln made many inquiries about the eventswhich attended the march from Savannah to Goldsboro, and seemed to enjoythe humorous stories about 'our bummers,' of which he had heard much.When in lively conversation his face brightened wonderfully, but if theconversation flagged it assumed a sad and sorrowful expression. GeneralGrant and I explained to him that my next move from Goldsboro wouldbring my army, increased to 80,000 men by Schofield's and Terry'sreinforcements, in close communication with Grant's army then investingLee and Richmond; and that unless Lee could effect his escape and makejunction with Johnston in North Carolina, he would soon be shut up inRichmond with no possibility of supplies, and would have to surrender.Mr. Lincoln was extremely interested in this view of the case, and weexplained that Lee's only chance was to escape, join Johnston, and,being then between me in North Carolina and Grant in Virginia, he couldchoose which to fight. Mr. Lincoln seemed impressed with this; butGeneral Grant explained that at the very moment of our conversationGeneral Sheridan was pressing his cavalry across James River from thenorth to the south, that with this cavalry he would so extend his leftbelow Petersburg as to meet the South Shore Road, and that if Lee should'let go' his fortified lines he (Grant) would follow him so close thathe could not possibly fall on me alone in North Carolina. I in likemanner expressed the fullest confidence that my army in North Carolinawas willing to cope with Lee and Johnston combined, till Grant couldcome up. But we both agreed that one more bloody battle was likely tooccur before the close of the war. Mr. Lincoln repeatedly inquired as toGeneral Schofield's ability to maintain his position in my absence, andseemed anxious that I should return to North Carolina. More than once heexclaimed, 'Must more blood be shed? Cannot this last bloody battle beavoided?' We explained that we had to presume that General Lee was areal general; that he must see that Johnston alone was no barrier to myprogress, and that if my army of 80,000 veterans should reach Burksvillehe was lost in Richmond; and that we were forced to believe he would notawait that inevitable conclusion, but would make one more desperateeffort."General Sherman adds this personal tribute to Lincoln to the account ofthe interview on board the "River Queen": "When I left Mr. Lincoln I wasmore than ever impressed by his kindly nature, his deep and earnestsympathy with the afflictions of the whole people, resulting from thewar, and by the march of hostile armies through the South. I felt thathis earnest desire was to end the war speedily, without more bloodshedor devastation, and to restore all the men of both sections to theirhomes. In the language of his second inaugural address, he seemed tohave 'charity for all, malice toward none,' and above all an absolutefaith in the courage, manliness, and integrity of the armies in thefield. When at rest or listening, his legs and arms seemed to hangalmost lifeless, and his face was careworn and haggard; but the momenthe began to talk his face lightened up, his tall form, as it were,unfolded, and he was the very impersonation of good humor andfellowship. The last words I recall as addressed to me were that hewould feel better when I was back at Goldsboro. We parted at the gangwayof the 'River Queen,' about noon of March 28, and I never saw him again.Of all the men I ever met, he seemed to possess more of the elements ofgreatness, combined with goodness, than any other."A few days after the interview described by General Sherman, thePresident changed his quarters to the cabin of the "Malvern," AdmiralPorter's flagship. The Admiral says: "The 'Malvern' was a small vesselwith poor accommodations, and not at all fitted to receive highpersonages. She was a captured blockade-runner, and had been given to meas a flag-ship. I offered the President my bed, but he positivelydeclined it, and elected to sleep in a small state-room outside of thecabin occupied by my secretary. It was the smallest kind of a room, sixfeet long by four and a half feet wide--a small kind of a room for thePresident of the United States to be domiciled in; but Mr. Lincolnseemed pleased with it. When he came to breakfast the next morning, Iinquired how he had slept: 'I slept well,' he answered, 'but you can'tput a long sword into a short scabbard. I was _too long_ for thatberth.' Then I remembered he was over six feet four inches, while theberth was only six feet. That day, while we were out of the ship, allthe carpenters were put to work; the state-room was taken down andincreased in size to eight feet by six and a half feet. The mattress waswidened to suit a berth of four feet width, and the entire state-roomremodelled. Nothing was said to the President about the change in hisquarters when he went to bed; but next morning he came out smiling, andsaid: 'A miracle happened last night; I shrank six inches in length andabout a foot sideways. I got somebody else's big pillow, and slept in abetter bed than I did on the "River Queen."' He enjoyed it greatly; butI do think if I had given him two fence-rails to sleep on he would nothave found fault. That was Abraham Lincoln in all things relating to hisown comfort. He would never permit people to put themselves out for himunder any circumstances."On the 2d of April the stronghold of Petersburg fell into the hands ofthe Union troops. Lincoln, accompanied by Admiral Porter, visited thecity. They joined General Grant, and sat with him for nearly two hoursupon the porch of a comfortable little house with a small yard in front.Crowds of citizens soon gathered at the fence to gaze upon theseremarkable men of whom they had heard so much. The President's heart wasfilled with joy, for he felt that this was "the beginning of the end."Admiral Porter says: "Several regiments passed us _en route_, and theyall seemed to recognize the President at once. 'Three cheers for UncleAbe!' passed along among them, and the cheers were given with a vimwhich showed the estimation in which he was held by the soldiers. Thatevening," continues Admiral Porter, "the sailors and marines were sentout to guard and escort in some prisoners, who were placed on board alarge transport lying in the stream. There were about a thousandprisoners, more or less. The President expressed a desire to go onshore. I ordered the barge and went with him. We had to pass thetransport with the prisoners. They all rushed to the side with eagercuriosity. All wanted to see the Northern President. They were perfectlycontent. Every man had a chunk of meat and a piece of bread in his hand,and was doing his best to dispose of it. 'That's Old Abe,' said one, ina low voice. 'Give the old fellow three cheers,' said another; while athird called out, Hello, Abe, your bread and meat's better thanpop-corn!' It was all good-natured, and not meant in unkindness. I couldsee no difference between them and our own men, except that they wereragged and attenuated for want of wholesome food. They were as happy aset of men as ever I saw. They could see their homes looming up beforethem in the distance, and knew that the war was over. 'They will nevershoulder a musket again in anger,' said the President, 'and if Grant iswise he will leave them their guns to shoot crows with. It would do noharm.'"The next day (April 3) the Union advance, under General Weitzel, reachedand occupied Richmond. Lee was in retreat, with Grant in close pursuit.When the news of the downfall of the Confederate capital reached Lincolnon board the "Malvern," he exclaimed fervently: "Thank God that I havelived to see this! It seems to me I have been dreaming a horrid dreamfor four years, and now the nightmare is gone. _I want to seeRichmond._"The vessel started up the river, but found it extremely difficult toproceed, as the channel was filled with torpedoes and obstructions, andthey were obliged to wait until a passage could be cleared. AdmiralPorter thus describes what followed: "When the channel was reportedclear of torpedoes (a large number of which were taken up), I proceededup to Richmond in the 'Malvern,' with President Lincoln. Every vesselthat got through the obstructions wished to be the first one up, andpushed ahead with all steam; but they grounded, one after another, the'Malvern' passing them all, until she also took the ground. Not to bedelayed, I took the President in my barge, and with a tug ahead with afile of marines on board we continued on up to the city. There was alarge bridge across the James about a mile below the landing, and underthis a party in a small steamer were caught and held by the current,with no prospect of release without assistance. I ordered the tug tocast off and help them, leaving us in the barge to go on alone. Here wewere in a solitary boat, after having set out with a number of vesselsflying flags at every masthead, hoping to enter the conquered capital ina manner befitting the rank of the President of the United States, witha further intention of firing a national salute in honor of the happyresult. Mr. Lincoln was cheerful, and had his 'little story' ready forthe occasion. 'Admiral, this brings to my mind a fellow who once came tome to ask for an appointment as minister abroad. Finding he could notget that, he came down to some more modest position. Finally he asked tobe made a tide-waiter. When he saw he could not get that, he asked mefor _an old pair of trousers._ It is sometimes well to be _humble_.'"I had never been to Richmond before by that route," continues AdmiralPorter, "and did not know where the landing was; neither did thecockswain nor any of the barge's crew. We pulled on, hoping to seesomeone of whom we could inquire, but no one was in sight. The streetalong the river-front was as deserted as if this had been a city of thedead. The troops had been in possession some hours, but not a soldierwas to be seen. The current was now rushing past us over and amongrocks, on one of which we finally stuck; but I backed out and pointedfor the nearest landing. There was a small house on this landing, andbehind it were some twelve negroes digging with spades. The leader ofthem was an old man sixty years of age. He raised himself to an uprightposition as we landed, and put his hands up to his eyes. Then hedropped his spade and sprang forward. 'Bress de Lord,' he said, 'dere is_de great Messiah_! I knowed him as soon as I seed him. He's bin in myheart fo' long yeahs, an' he's cum at las' to free his chillun from deirbondage! Glory, Hallelujah!' And he fell upon his knees before thePresident and kissed his feet. The others followed his example, and in aminute Mr. Lincoln was surrounded by these people, who had treasured upthe recollection of him caught from a photograph, and had looked up tohim for four years as the one who was to lead them out of captivity. Itwas a touching sight--that aged negro kneeling at the feet of the tall,gaunt-looking man who seemed in himself to be bearing all the grief ofthe nation, and whose sad face seemed to say, 'I suffer for you all, butwill do all I can to help you.' Mr. Lincoln looked down on the poorcreatures at his feet. He was much embarrassed at his position. 'Don'tkneel to me,' he said, 'that is not right. You must kneel to God only,and thank Him for the liberty you will hereafter enjoy. I am but God'shumble instrument; but you may rest assured that as long as I live noone shall put a shackle on your limbs, and you shall have all the rightswhich God has given to every other free citizen of this Republic.' It wasa minute or two before I could get the negroes to rise and leave thePresident. The scene was so touching that I hated to disturb it, yet wecould not stay there all day; we had to move on; so I requested thepatriarch to withdraw from about the President with his companions, andlet us pass on. 'Yes, Mars,' said the old man, 'but after bein' so manyyeahs in de desert widout water, it's mighty pleasant to be lookin' atlas' on our spring of life. 'Scuse us, sir; we means no disrepec' toMars Lincoln; we means all love and gratitude.' And then, joining handstogether in a ring, the negroes sang a hymn, with the melodious andtouching voices possessed only by the negroes of the South. ThePresident and all of us listened respectfully while the hymn was beingsung. Four minutes at most had passed away since we first landed at apoint where, as far as the eye could reach, the streets were entirelydeserted; but now what a different scene appeared as that hymn wentforth from the negroes' lips! The streets seemed to be suddenly alivewith the colored race. They seemed to spring from the earth. They cametumbling and shouting, from over the hills and from the water-side,where no one was seen as we had passed. The crowd immediately becamevery oppressive. We needed our marines to keep them off. I orderedtwelve of the boat's crew to fix bayonets to their rifles and surroundthe President, all of which was quickly done; but the crowd poured in sofearfully that I thought we all stood a chance of being crushed todeath. At length the President spoke. He could not move for the mass ofpeople--he had to do something. 'My poor friends,' he said, 'you arefree--free as air. You can cast off the name of slave and trample uponit; it will come to you no more. Liberty is your birthright. God gave itto you as He gave it to others, and it is a sin that you have beendeprived of it for so many years. But you must try to deserve thispriceless boon. Let the world see that you merit it, and are able tomaintain it by your good works. Don't let your joy carry you intoexcesses. Learn the laws and obey them; obey God's commandments andthank Him for giving you liberty, for to Him you owe all things. There,now, let me pass on; I have but little time to spare. I want to see thecapital, and must return at once to Washington to secure to you thatliberty which you seem to prize so highly.' The crowd shouted andscreeched as if they would split the firmament, though while thePresident was speaking you might have heard a pin drop."Presently the little party was able to move on. "It never struck me,"says Admiral Porter, "there was anyone in that multitude who wouldinjure Mr. Lincoln; it seemed to me that he had an army of supportersthere who could and would defend him against all the world. Our progresswas very slow; we did not move a mile an hour, and the crowd was stillincreasing. It was a warm day, and the streets were dusty, owing to theimmense gathering which covered every part of them, kicking up the dirt.The atmosphere was suffocating; but Mr. Lincoln could be seen plainly byevery man, woman, and child, towering head and shoulders above thatcrowd; he overtopped every man there. He carried his hat in his hand,fanning his face, from which the perspiration was pouring. He looked asif he would have given his Presidency for a glass of water--I would havegiven my commission for half that."Now came another phase in the procession. As we entered the city everywindow flew up, from ground to roof, and every one was filled witheager, peering faces, which turned one to another, and seemed to ask,'Is this large man, with soft eyes, and kind, benevolent face, the onewho has been held up to us as the incarnation of wickedness, thedestroyer of the South?' There was nothing like taunt or defiance in thefaces of those who were gazing from the windows or craning their necksfrom the sidewalks to catch a view of the President. The look of everyone was that of eager curiosity--nothing more. In a short time wereached the mansion of Mr. Davis, President of the Confederacy, occupiedafter the evacuation as the headquarters of General Weitzel and Shepley.There was great cheering going on. Hundreds of civilians--I don't knowwho they were--assembled at the front of the house to welcome Mr.Lincoln. General Shepley made a speech and gave us a lunch, after whichwe entered a carriage and visited the State House--the late seat of theConfederate Congress. It was in dreadful disorder, betokening a suddenand unexpected flight; members' tables were upset, bales of Confederatescrip were lying about the floor, and many official documents of somevalue were scattered about."After this inspection I urged the President to go on board the'Malvern.' I began to feel more heavily the responsibility resting uponme through the care of his person. The evening was approaching, and wewere in a carriage open on all sides. He was glad to go; he was tiredout, and wanted the quiet of the flag-ship. I was oppressed withuneasiness until we got on board and stood on the deck with thePresident safe; then there was not a happier man anywhere than myself."On Sunday, April 9, the President returned to Washington; and there heheard the thrilling news that Lee, with his whole army, had that daysurrendered to Grant at Appomattox. Lincoln's first visit, afterreaching the capital, was to the house of Secretary Seward, who had metwith a severe accident during his absence, and was a prisoner in a sickroom. Lincoln's heart was full of joy, and he entered immediately uponan account of his visit to Richmond and the glorious successes of theUnion army; "throwing himself," as Mr. Carpenter says, "in his almostboyish exultation, at full length across the bed, supporting his headupon one hand, and in this manner reciting the story of the collapse ofthe Rebellion. Concluding, he lifted himself up and said, 'And now for aday of Thanksgiving!'"In Washington, as in every city and town in the loyal States, there wasthe wildest enthusiasm over the good news from the army. Flags wereflying everywhere, cannon were sounding, business was suspended, and thepeople gave themselves up to the impulses of joy and thanksgiving.Monday afternoon the workmen of the navy-yard marched to the WhiteHouse, joining the thousands already there, and with bands playing and atumult of rejoicing, called persistently for the President. After somedelay Lincoln appeared at the window above the main entrance, and wasgreeted with loud and prolonged cheers and demonstrations of love andrespect. He declined to make a formal speech, saying to the excitedthrong beneath:     I am very greatly rejoiced that an occasion has occurred so     pleasurable that the people can't restrain themselves. I suppose     that arrangements are being made for some sort of formal     demonstration, perhaps this evening or to-morrow night. If there     should be such a demonstration, I, of course, shall have to respond     to it, and I shall have nothing to say if I dribble it out before.     I see you have a band. I propose now closing up by requesting you     to play a certain air or tune. I have always thought "Dixie" one of     the best tunes I ever heard. I have heard that our adversaries over     the way have attempted to appropriate it as a national air. I     insisted yesterday that we had fairly captured it. I presented the     question to the Attorney-General, and he gave his opinion that it     is our lawful prize. I ask the band to give us a good turn upon it.The band did give "a good turn" not only to "Dixie," but to thewhimsical tune of "Yankee Doodle," after which Lincoln proposed threecheers for General Grant and all under his command; and then "three morecheers for our gallant navy," at the close of which he bowed and retiredamid the inspiring strains of "Hail Columbia" discoursed with vigor bythe patriotic musicians.As additional despatches were received from the army, the joyfulexcitement in Washington increased. Tuesday evening, April 11, thePresident's mansion, the Executive Departments, and many of the businessplaces and private residences, were illuminated, bonfires were kindled,and fireworks sent off, in celebration of the great event which stirredthe hearts of the people. A vast mass of citizens crowded about theWhite House, as Lincoln appeared at the historic East window and madehis last speech to the American public. It was a somewhat lengthyaddress, and had been prepared and written out for the occasion. "Wemeet this evening, not in sorrow but in gladness of heart," began thePresident. "No part of the honor or praise is mine. To General Grant,his skilful officers and brave men, all belongs." Mr. Brooks, who was inthe White House during the delivery of this address, gives the followingglimpses behind the scenes: "As Lincoln spoke, the multitude was assilent as if the court-yard had been deserted. Then, as his speech waswritten on loose sheets, and the candles placed for him were too low, hetook a light in his hand and went on with his reading. Soon coming tothe end of a page, he found some difficulty in handling the manuscriptand holding the candlestick. A friend who stood behind the drapery ofthe window reached out and took the candle, and held it until the end ofthe speech, and the President let the loose pages fall on the floor, oneby one, as fast as he was through with them. Presently Tad, havingrefreshed himself at the dinner-table, came back in search of amusement.He gathered up the scattered sheets of the President's speech, and thenamused himself by chasing the leaves as they fluttered from thespeaker's hand. Growing impatient at his father's delay to drop anotherpage, Tad whispered, 'Come, give me another!' The President made a queermotion with his foot toward the boy, but otherwise showed no sign thathe had other thoughts than those which he was dropping to the listenersbeneath. Without was a vast sea of upturned faces, each eye fixed on theform of the President. Around the tall white pillars of the porticoflowed an undulating surface of human beings, stirred by emotion andlighted with the fantastic colors of fireworks. At the window, his faceirradiated with patriotic joy, was the much-beloved Lincoln, reading thespeech that was to be his last to the people. Behind him crept back andforth, on his hands and knees, the boy of the White House, gathering uphis father's carefully written pages, and occasionally lifting up hiseager face waiting for more. It was before and behind the scenes.Sometimes I wonder, when I recall that night, how much of a father'slove and thought of his boy might have been mingled in Lincoln's lastspeech to the eager multitude."The President's speech on this occasion was largely devoted to theimpending problem of Reconstruction in the South. The problem wascomplex and difficult, with no recognized principles or precedent forguidance. Said Lincoln: "Unlike the case of a war between independentnations, there is no authorized organization for us to treat with. Noone man has authority to give up the rebellion for any other man. Wesimply must begin with and mould from disorganized and discordantelements. Nor is it a small additional embarrassment, that we, the loyalpeople, differ amongst ourselves as to the mode, manner, and measure ofreconstruction. Let us all join in doing the acts necessary to restoringthe proper practical relations between these States and the Union." Theproblem thus touched upon was one that had long occupied the thoughtsof Lincoln, especially since the downfall of the Confederacy had beenimminent. His practical and far-seeing mind was already addressingitself to the new issues, duties, and responsibilities, which he sawopening before him, and which he well knew would demand all of hiswisdom, firmness, and political sagacity. As was to be expected, a greatdiversity of views prevailed. A powerful faction in Congress,sympathized with by some members of the Cabinet, was for "making treasonodious" and dealing with the insurgent States as conquered provincesthat had forfeited all rights once held under the Constitution and wereentitled only to such treatment as the Government chose to give them.Lincoln's ideas were very different. His mind was occupied withformulating a policy having for its object the welfare of the Southernpeople and the restoration of the rebellious States to the Union. Hisbroad and statesmanlike views were outlined, the day after the publicaddress just referred to, in discussing Secretary Welles's plans forconvening the legislature of Virginia. Says Mr. Welles in his Diary:"His idea was that the members of the legislature, comprising theprominent and influential men of their respective counties, had bettercome together and undo their own work. Civil government must bereestablished, he said, as soon as possible; there must be courts, andlaw and order, or society would be broken up, the disbanded armies wouldturn into robber bands and guerillas, which we must strive to prevent.These were the reasons why he wished prominent Virginians who had theconfidence of the people to come together and turn themselves and theirneighbors into good Union men." Lincoln had no thought of leaving any ofthese questions to the military authorities. In March he had directed adespatch from Stanton to Grant, saying: "The President wishes you tohave no conference with General Lee, unless it be for the capitulationof his army, or on some other minor and purely military matter. Heinstructs me to say that you are not to decide, discuss, or confer uponany political question. Such questions the President _holds in his ownhands_, and will submit them to no military conferences or conventions."During his meeting with Grant at Petersburg the President revealed tothe General many of his plans for the rehabilitation of the South, andit could easily be seen that a spirit of magnanimity was uppermost inhis heart. And at the conference with Grant, Sherman, and Porter, onboard the "River Queen," the same subject was broached. "Though I cannotattempt to recall the words spoken by any one of the persons present onthat occasion," says General Sherman, "I know we talked generally aboutwhat was to be done when Lee's and Johnston's armies were beaten anddispersed. On this point Mr. Lincoln was very full. He said that he hadlong thought of it, that he hoped this end could be reached without morebloodshed, but in any event he wanted us to get the men of the Southernarmies disarmed and back to their homes; that he contemplated norevenge, no harsh measures, but quite the contrary, and that theirsuffering and hardships during the war would make them the moresubmissive to law." Says Hon. George Bancroft: "It was the nature of Mr.Lincoln to forgive. When hostilities ceased he who had always sent forththe flag with every one of its stars in the field was eager to receiveback his returning countrymen."One of the last stories of personal interviews with President Lincolnrelates to his feeling of clemency for the men lately in rebellion. Itis told by Senator Henderson of Missouri. "About the middle of March,1865," says Senator Henderson, "I went to the White House to ask thePresident to pardon a number of men who had been languishing in Missouriprisons for various offenses, all political. Some of them had been myschoolmates, and their mothers and sisters and sweethearts had persistedin appeals that I should use my influence for their release. Since itwas evident to me that the Confederacy was in its last throes, I feltthat the pardon of most of these prisoners would do more good than harm.I had separated them, according to the gravity of their offenses, intothree classes; and handing the first list to him, I said, 'Mr.President, the session of the Senate is closed, and I am about to startfor home. The war is virtually over. Grant is pretty certain to get Leeand his army, and Sherman is plainly able to take care of Johnston. Inmy opinion the best way to prevent guerilla warfare at the end oforganized resistance will be to show clemency to these Southernsympathizers.' Lincoln shook his head and said, 'Henderson, I am deeplyindebted to you, and I want to show it; but don't ask me at this time topardon rebels. I can't do it. People are continually blaming me forbeing too lenient. Don't encourage such fellows by inducing me to turnloose a lot of men who perhaps ought to be hanged.' I answered, 'Mr.President, these prisoners and their friends tell me that for them thewar is over; and it will surely have a good influence now to let themgo.' He replied, 'Henderson, my conscience tells me that I must not doit.' But I persisted. 'Mr. President, you _should_ do it. It isnecessary for good feeling in Missouri that these people be released.''If I sign this list as a whole, will you be responsible for the futuregood behavior of these men?' he asked. 'Yes,' I replied, 'I will.' 'ThenI'll take the risk.' He wrote the word _Pardoned_, signed the order ofrelease, and returned the paper to me. 'Thank you, Mr. President,' Isaid, 'but that is not all. I have another list.' 'You're not going tomake me let loose another lot!' he exclaimed. 'Yes,' I answered, 'and myargument is the same as before. The guilt of these men is doubtful.Mercy must be the policy of peace.' With the only words approachingprofanity that I ever heard him utter, he exclaimed, '_I'll be durned ifI don't sign it!_ Now, Henderson,' he said, as he handed me the list,'remember that you are responsible to me for these men, and if theydon't behave '_I'll put you in prison for their sins._'"Lincoln's whole feeling toward the vanquished Southern people was one ofpeace and magnanimity. While many were clamoring for the execution ofthe Southern leaders, and especially Jefferson Davis, Lincoln said, onlya day or two before his death: "This talk about Mr. Davis wearies me. Ihope he will mount a fleet horse, reach the shores of the Gulf ofMexico, and ride _so far into its waters_ that we shall never see himagain." And then he told a pat story--perhaps his last--of a boy inSpringfield, "who saved up his money and bought a 'coon,' which, afterthe novelty wore off, became a great nuisance. He was one day leadinghim through the streets, and had his hands full to keep clear of thelittle vixen, who had torn his clothes half off him. At length he satdown on the curb-stone, completely fagged out. A man passing was stoppedby the lad's disconsolate appearance, and asked the matter. 'Oh,' wasthe only reply, 'this coon is such a _trouble_ to me!' 'Why don't youget rid of him, then?' said the gentleman. '_Hush_!' said the boy,'don't you see he is gnawing his rope off? I am going to let him do it,and then I will go home and tell the folks _that he got away from me_.'"At the last Cabinet meeting ever attended by Lincoln, held in themorning of the day on which he was shot, the subject of Reconstructionwas again uppermost, and various plans were presented and discussed.Secretary Stanton brought forward a plan or ordinance which he said hehad prepared with much care and after a great deal of reflection. It wasarranged that a copy of this should be furnished to each member of theCabinet, for criticism and suggestion. "In the meantime," says SecretaryWelles, "we were requested by the President to deliberate and carefullyconsider the proposition. He remarked that this was _the great question_now before us, and _we must soon begin to act_." What that action wouldhave been had Lincoln lived--what wrong and misery would have beenspared to the South and shame and dishonor to the North--no one candoubt who comprehends the fibre of that kindly, just, and indomitablesoul.CHAPTER XXIX     The Last of Earth--Events of the Last Day of Lincoln's Life--The     Last Cabinet Meeting--The Last Drive with Mrs. Lincoln--Incidents     of the Afternoon--Riddance to Jacob Thompson--A Final Act of     Pardon--The Fatal Evening--The Visit to the Theatre--The Assassin's     Shot--A Scene of Horror--Particulars of the Crime--The Dying     President--A Nation's Grief--Funeral Obsequies--The Return to     Illinois--At Rest in Oak Ridge Cemetery.It is something to be ever gratefully remembered, that the last day ofLincoln's life was filled with sunshine. His cares and burdens slippedfrom him like a garment, and his spirit was filled with a blessed andbenignant peace.On the morning of that fatal Friday, the 14th day of April, thePresident had a long conversation at breakfast with his son Robert, thena member of Grant's staff, who had just arrived from the front withadditional particulars of Lee's surrender, of which event he had been awitness. The President listened with close attention to the interestingrecital; then, taking up a portrait of General Lee, which his son hadbrought him, he placed it on the table before him, where he scanned itlong and thoughtfully. Presently he said: "It is a good face. It is theface of a noble, brave man. I am glad that the war is over at last."Looking upon Robert, he continued: "Well, my son, you have returnedsafely from the front. The war is now closed, and we will soon live inpeace with the brave men who have been fighting against us. I trust thatthe era of good feeling has returned, and that henceforth we shall livein harmony together."After breakfast the President received Speaker Colfax, spending an houror more in discussing his plans regarding the adjustment of matters inthe South. This was followed by an interview with Hon. John P. Hale, thenewly appointed Minister to Spain, and by calls of congratulation frommembers of Congress and old friends from Illinois. Afterwards he took ashort drive with General Grant, who had just come to the city to consultregarding the disbandment of the army and the parole of prisoners. Thepeople were wild with enthusiasm, and wherever the President and GeneralGrant appeared they were greeted with cheers, the clapping of hands,waving of handkerchiefs, and every possible demonstration of delight.At the Cabinet meeting held at noon the President was accompanied byGeneral Grant. The meeting is thus described by one who was present,Secretary Welles: "Congratulations were interchanged, and earnestinquiry was made whether any information had been received from GeneralSherman. General Grant, who was invited to remain, said he was expectinghourly to hear from Sherman, and had a good deal of anxiety on thesubject. The President remarked that the news would come soon and comefavorably, he had no doubt, for he had last night his usual dream whichhad preceded nearly every important event of the war. I inquired theparticulars of this remarkable dream. He said it was in mydepartment--it related to the water; that he seemed to be in a singularand indescribable vessel, but always the same, and that he was movingwith great rapidity toward a dark and indefinite shore; that he had hadthis singular dream preceding the firing on Sumter, the battles of BullRun, Antietam, Gettysburg, Stone River, Vicksburg, Wilmington, etc.General Grant remarked, with some emphasis and asperity, that StoneRiver was no victory--that a few such victories would have ruined thecountry, and he knew of no important results from it. The President saidthat perhaps he should not altogether agree with him, but whatever mightbe the facts his singular dream preceded that fight. Victory did notalways follow his dream, but the event and results were important. Hehad no doubt that a battle had taken place or was about being fought,'and Johnston will be beaten, for I had this strange dream again lastnight. It must relate to Sherman; my thoughts are in that direction, and_I know of no other very important event which is likely just now tooccur_.'" "Great events," adds Mr. Welles in his Diary, "did indeedfollow; for within a few hours the good and gentle as well as trulygreat man who narrated his dream closed forever his earthly career."After the Cabinet meeting the President took a drive with Mrs. Lincoln,expressing a wish that no one should accompany them. His heart wasfilled with a solemn joy, which awoke memories of the past to minglewith hopes for the future; and in this subdued moment he desired to bealone with the one who stood nearest to him in human relationship. Inthe course of their talk together, he said: "Mary, we have had a hardtime of it since we came to Washington; but the war is over, and withGod's blessing we may hope for four years of peace and happiness, andthen we will go back to Illinois and pass the rest of our lives inquiet." He spoke, says Mr. Arnold, "of his old Springfield home; andrecollections of his early days, his little brown cottage, the lawoffice, the court room, the green bag for his briefs and law papers, hisadventures when riding the circuit, came thronging back to him. Thetension under which he had for so long been kept was removed, and he waslike a boy out of school. 'We have laid by,' said he to his wife, 'somemoney, and during this term we will try and save up more, but shall nothave enough to support us. We will go back to Illinois, and I will opena law office at Springfield or Chicago, and practise law, and at leastdo enough to help give us a livelihood.' Such were the dreams, theday-dreams of Lincoln, on the last day of his earthly life."Mr. Neill, the President's private secretary, states that between threeand four o'clock of this day he had occasion to seek the President toprocure his signature to a paper. "I found," says Mr. Neill, "that hehad retired to the private parlor of the house for lunch. While I waslooking over the papers on his table, to see if I could find the desiredcommission, he came back, eating an apple. I told him what I was lookingfor, and as I talked he placed his hand upon the bell-pull. I said: 'Forwhom are you going to ring?' Placing his hand upon my coat, he spoke buttwo words: 'Andrew Johnson.' 'Then,' I said, 'I will come in again.' AsI was leaving the room, the Vice-President had been ushered in, and thePresident advanced and took him by the hand."Charles A. Dana, the Assistant Secretary of War, says that his lastrecollections of President Lincoln are indelibly associated with theseditious Jacob Thompson. "Late in the afternoon," says Mr. Dana, "adespatch was received at the War Department from the provost marshal ofPortland, Maine, saying that he had received information that JacobThompson would arrive in Portland during that night, in order to takethere the Canadian steamer which was to sail for Liverpool. On readingthis despatch to Mr. Stanton, the latter said, 'Order him to bearrested--but no; you had better take it over to the President.' I foundMr. Lincoln in the inner room of his business office at the White House,with his coat off, washing his hands preparatory to a drive. 'Hello,'said he, 'what is it?' Listening to the despatch, he asked, 'What doesStanton say?' 'He thinks he ought to be arrested,' I replied. 'Well,' hecontinued, drawling his words, 'I rather guess not. When you have anelephant on your hands, and he wants to run away, better let him run.'"During the afternoon the President signed a pardon for a soldiersentenced to be shot for desertion; remarking, as he did so, "Well, Ithink the boy can do us more good above ground than under ground." Healso approved an application for the discharge, on taking the oath ofallegiance, of a Southern prisoner, on whose petition he wrote, "_Let itbe done_." This act of mercy was his last official order.It had been decided early in the day that the President and Mrs. Lincolnwould attend Ford's Theatre in the evening, to witness the play of "TheAmerican Cousin." Lincoln had invited General Grant to accompany hisparty to the theatre, saying that the people would expect to see him andshould not be disappointed. But the General had declined, as Mrs. Grantwas anxious to start that afternoon to visit their children, who were atschool in Burlington, New Jersey.As the hour approached for leaving for the theatre, the President wasengaged in a conversation with two friends--Speaker Colfax and Hon.George Ashmun of Massachusetts. The business on which they had met notbeing concluded, the President gave Mr. Ashmun a card on which he hadwritten these words: "Allow Mr. Ashmun and friend to come in at 9 A.M.to-morrow--A. Lincoln." He then turned to Mr. Colfax, saying, "You aregoing with Mrs. Lincoln and me to the theatre, I hope." Mr. Colfaxpleaded other engagements, when Lincoln remarked: "Mr. Sumner has thegavel of the Confederate Congress, which he got at Richmond to hand tothe Secretary of War. But I insisted then that he must give it to you;and you tell him for me to hand it over." He then rose, but seemedreluctant to go, expressing a half-determination to delay a whilelonger. It was undoubtedly to avoid disappointing the audience, to whomhis presence had been promised, that he went to the play-house thatnight. At the door he stopped and said to Speaker Colfax, who was aboutto leave for the Pacific coast, "Colfax, do not forget to tell thepeople in the mining regions, as you pass through, what I told you thismorning about the development when peace comes. I will telegraph you atSan Francisco."It was nine o'clock when the Presidential party reached the theatre. Theplace was crowded; "many ladies in rich and gay costumes, officers intheir uniforms, many well-known citizens, young folks, the usualclusters of gaslights, the usual magnetism of so many people, cheerful,with perfumes, music of violins and flutes--and over all, and saturatingall, that vast, vague wonder, Victory, the Nation's victory, the triumphof the Union, filling the air, the thought, the sense, with exhilarationmore than all perfumes." As the President entered he was greeted withtremendous cheers, to which he responded with genial courtesy. The boxreserved for him, at the right of the stage, a little above the floor,was draped and festooned with flags. As the party were seated, thedaughter of Senator Harris of New York occupied the corner nearest thestage; next her was Mrs. Lincoln; and behind them sat the President andMajor Rathbone, the former being nearest the door.    In his quiet chair he sate,      Pure of malice or guile,    Stainless of fear or hate;      And there played a pleasant smile    On the rough and careworn face,--      For his heart was all the while    On means of mercy and grace.    The brave old flag drooped o'er him,--      A fold in the hard hand lay;      He looked perchance on the play,--    But the scene was a shadow before him,      For his thoughts were far away.It was half-past ten o'clock, and the audience was absorbed in theprogress of the play, when suddenly a pistol shot, loud and sharp, rangthrough the theatre. All eyes were instantly directed toward thePresident's box, whence the report proceeded. A moment later, the figureof a man, holding a smoking pistol in one hand and a dagger in theother, appeared at the front of the President's box, and sprang to thestage, some eight or ten feet below, shouting as he did so, "_Sic sempertyrannis!_" He fell as he struck the stage; but quickly recoveringhimself, sprang through the side-wings and escaped from the theatre by arear door.At the moment of the assassination a single actor, Mr. Hawk, was on thestage. In his account of the tragical event he says: "When I heard theshot fired, I turned, looked up at the President's box, heard the manexclaim, '_Sic semper tyrannis_!' saw him jump from the box, seize theflag on the staff, and drop to the stage. He slipped when he struck thestage, but got upon his feet in a moment, brandished a large knife,crying, 'The South shall be free,' turned his face in the directionwhere I stood, and I recognized him as John Wilkes Booth. He ran towardsme, and I, seeing the knife, thought I was the one he was after, and ranoff the stage and up a flight of stairs. He made his escape out of adoor directly in the rear of the theatre, mounted a horse, and rode off.The above all occurred in the space of a quarter of a minute, and at thetime I did not know the President was shot."Scarcely had the horror-stricken audience witnessed the leap and flightof the asassin when a woman's shriek pierced through the theatre,recalling all eyes to the President's box. The scene that ensued isdescribed with singular vividness by the poet Walt Whitman, who waspresent: "A moment's hush--a scream--the cry of murder--Mrs. Lincolnleaning out of the box, with ashy cheeks and lips, with involuntary cry,pointing to the retreating figure, '_He has killed the President!_' Andstill a moment's strange, incredulous suspense--and then thedeluge!--then that mixture of horror, noises, uncertainty--(the sound,somewhere back, of a horse's hoofs clattering with speed)--the peopleburst through chairs and railing, and break them up--that noise adds tothe queerness of the scene--there is inextricable confusion andterror--women faint--feeble persons fall and are trampled on--many criesof agony are heard--the broad stage suddenly fills to suffocation with adense and motley crowd, like some horrible carnival--the audience rushgenerally upon it--at least the strong men do--the actors and actressesare there in their play costumes and painted faces, with mortal frightshowing through the rouge--some trembling, some in tears--the screamsand calls, confused talk--redoubled, trebled--two or three manage topass up water from the stage to the President's box--others try toclamber up. Amidst all this, a party of soldiers, two hundred or more,hearing what is done, suddenly appear; they storm the house, inflamedwith fury, literally charging the audience with fixed bayonets, muskets,and pistols, shouting, 'Clear out! clear out!'.... And in the midst ofthat pandemonium of senseless haste--the infuriated soldiers, theaudience, the stage, its actors and actresses, its paints and spanglesand gaslights,--the life blood from those veins, the best and sweetestof the land, drips slowly down, and death's ooze already begins itslittle bubbles on the lips."It appears that Booth, the assassin, had long been plotting the murderof the President, and was awaiting a favorable moment for its execution.He had visited the theatre at half-past eleven on the morning of the14th, and learned that a box had been taken for the President thatevening. He engaged a fleet horse for a saddle-ride in the afternoon,and left it at a convenient place. In the evening he rode to thetheatre, and, leaving the animal in charge of an accomplice, entered thehouse. Making his way to the door of the President's box, and taking asmall Derringer pistol in one hand and a double-edged dagger in theother, he thrust his arm into the entrance, where the President, sittingin an arm-chair, presented to his view the back and side of his head. Aflash, a sharp report, a puff of smoke, and the fatal bullet had enteredthe President's brain.Major Rathbone, who occupied a seat in the President's box, testifiesthat he was sitting with his back toward the door, when he heard thedischarge of a pistol behind him, and looking around saw through thesmoke a man between the door and the President. Major Rathbone instantlysprang toward him and seized him; the man wrested himself from hisgrasp, and made a violent thrust at the Major's breast with a largeknife. The Major parried the blow by striking it up, and received awound in his left arm. The man rushed to the front of the box, and theMajor endeavored to seize him again, but only caught his clothes as hewas leaping over the railing of the box. Major Rathbone then turned tothe President. His position was not changed; his head was slightly bentforward, and his eyes were closed.As soon as the surgeons who had been summoned completed their hastyexamination, the unconscious form of the President was borne from thetheatre to a house across the street, and laid upon his death-bed.Around him were gathered Surgeon-General Barnes, Vice-President Johnson,Senator Sumner, Secretaries Stanton and Welles, Generals Halleck andMeigs, Attorney-General Speed, Postmaster-General Dennison, Mr.McCulloch, Speaker Colfax, and other intimate friends who had beenhastily summoned. Mrs. Lincoln sat in an adjoining room, prostrate andoverwhelmed, with her son Robert. The examination of the surgeons hadleft no room for hope. The watchers remained through the night by thebedside of the stricken man, who showed no signs of consciousness; and alittle after seven o'clock in the morning--Saturday the 15th ofApril--he breathed his last.A vivid account of the death-bed scene, together with particulars of theattacks upon Secretary Seward and his son Frederick a half-hour laterthan the attack upon the President, is furnished in the contemporaneousrecord of Secretary Welles, a singularly cool observer and clearnarrator. "I had retired to bed about half-past ten on the evening ofthe 14th of April," writes Mr. Welles, "and was just getting asleep whenMrs. Welles, my wife, said some one was at our door.... I arose at onceand raised a window, when my messenger, James Smith, called to me thatMr. Lincoln, the President, had been shot; and said Secretary Seward andhis son, Assistant Secretary Frederick Seward, were assassinated.... Iimmediately dressed myself, and, against the earnest remonstrance andappeals of my wife, went directly to Mr. Seward's, whose residence wason the east side of the square, mine being on the north.... Entering thehouse, I found the lower hall and office full of persons, and among themmost of the foreign legations, all anxiously inquiring what truth therewas in the horrible rumors afloat.... At the head of the first stairs Imet the elder Mrs. Seward, who was scarcely able to speak, but desiredme to proceed up to Mr. Seward's room.... As I entered, I met Miss FannySeward, with whom I exchanged a single word, and proceeded to the footof the bed. Dr. Verdi, and, I think, two others, were there. The bed wassaturated with blood. The Secretary was lying on his back, the upperpart of his head covered by a cloth, which extended down over his eyes.His mouth was open, the lower jaw dropping down. I exchanged a fewwhispered words with Dr. Verdi. Secretary Stanton, who came after butalmost simultaneously with me, made inquiries in a louder tone tilladmonished by a word from one of the physicians. We almost immediatelywithdrew and went into the adjoining front room, where lay FrederickSeward. His eyes were open, but he did not move them, nor a limb, nordid he speak. Doctor White, who was in attendance, told me he wasunconscious and more dangerously injured than his father.... As wedescended the stairs, I asked Stanton what he had heard in regard to thePresident that was reliable. He said the President was shot at Ford'sTheatre, that he had seen a man who was present and witnessed theoccurrence. I said I would go immediately to the White House. Stantontold me the President was not there but was at the theatre. 'Then,' saidI, 'let us go immediately there.' ... The President had been carriedacross the street from the theatre, to the house of a Mr. Peterson. Weentered by ascending a flight of steps above the basement and passingthrough a long hall to the rear, where the President lay extended on abed, breathing heavily. Several surgeons were present, at least six, Ishould think more. Among them I was glad to observe Dr. Hall, who,however, soon left. I inquired of Dr. H., as I entered, the truecondition of the President. He replied the President was dead to allintents, although he might live three hours or perhaps longer.... Thegiant sufferer lay extended diagonally across the bed, which was notlong enough for him. He had been stripped of his clothes. His largearms, which were occasionally exposed, were of a size which one wouldscarce have expected from his spare appearance. His slow, fullrespiration lifted the clothes with each breath that he took. Hisfeatures were calm and striking. I had never seen them appear to betteradvantage than for the first hour, perhaps, that I was there. Afterthat, his right eye began to swell and that part of his face becamediscolored ... Senator Sumner was there, I think, when I entered. Ifnot, he came in soon after, as did Speaker Colfax, Mr. SecretaryMcCulloch, and the other members of the Cabinet, with the exception ofMr. Seward. A double guard was stationed at the door and on thesidewalk, to repress the crowd, which was of course highly excited andanxious. The room was small and overcrowded. The surgeons and members ofthe Cabinet were as many as should have been in the room, but there weremany more, and the hall and other rooms in the front or main house werefull. One of these rooms was occupied by Mrs. Lincoln and herattendants, with Miss Harris. Mrs. Dixon and Mrs. Kinney came to herabout twelve o'clock. About once an hour Mrs. Lincoln would repair tothe bedside of her dying husband and with lamentations and tears remainuntil overcome by emotion.... A door which opened upon a porch orgallery, and also the windows, were kept open for fresh air. The nightwas dark, cloudy, and damp, and about six it began to rain. I remainedin the room until then without sitting or leaving it, when, there beinga vacant chair which some one left at the foot of the bed, I occupied itfor nearly two hours, listening to the heavy groans, and witnessing thewasting life of the good and great man who was expiring before me.... Alittle before seven in the morning I re-entered the room where the dyingPresident was rapidly drawing near the closing moments. His wife soonafter made her last visit to him. The death-struggle had begun. Robert,his son, stood with several others at the head of the bed. Therespiration of the President became suspended at intervals, and at lastentirely ceased at twenty-two minutes past seven o'clock."The news of the President's assassination flashed rapidly over thecountry, everywhere causing the greatest consternation and grief. Therevulsion from the joy which had filled all loyal hearts at theprospects of peace was sudden and profound. All business ceased, andgave way to mourning and lamentation. The flags, so lately unfurled inexultation, were now dropped at half-mast, and emblems of sorrow werehung from every door and window. Men walked with a dejected air. Theygathered together in groups in the street, and spoke of the murder ofthe President as of a personal calamity. The nation's heart was smittensorely, and signs of woe were in every face and movement.A scene which transpired in Philadelphia, the morning after the murder,reflects the picture presented in every city and town in the UnitedStates. "We had taken our seats," says the delineator, "in the early carto ride down town, men and boys going to work. The morning papers hadcome up from town as usual, and the men unrolled them to read as the carstarted. The eye fell on the black border and ominous column-lines.Before we could speak, a good Quaker at the head of the car broke out inhorror: 'My God! What's this? _Lincoln is assassinated._' The driverstopped the car, and came in to hear the awful tidings. There stood thecar, mid-street, as the heavy news was read in the gray dawn of thatill-fated day. Men bowed their faces in their hands, and on thestraw-covered floor hot tears fell fast. Silently the driver took thebells from his horses, and we started like a hearse cityward. What achanged city since the day before! Then all was joy over the end of thewar; now we were plunged in a deeper gulf of woe. The sun rose on a citysmitten and weeping. All traffic stood still; the icy hand of death layflat on the heart of commerce, and it gave not a throb. Men stood bytheir open stores saying, with hands on each other's shoulders, 'OurPresident is dead.' Over and over, in a dazed way, they said the fatefulsyllables, as if the bullet that tore through the weary brain atWashington had palsied the nation. The mute news-boy on the corner saidnever a word as he handed to the speechless buyers the damp sheets fromthe press; only he brushed, with unwashed hand, the tears from his dirtycheeks. Groups stood listening on the pavement with faces to the earth,while one, in choking voice, read the telegrams; then with a look theydeparted in unworded woe, each cursing bitterly in his breast the 'deepdamnation of his taking off.' Mill operatives, clerks, workers, schoolchildren, all came home, the faltering voice of the teacher telling thewondering children to 'go home, there will be no school to-day.' Thehousewife looked up amazed to see husband and children coming home sosoon. The father's face frightened her and she cried, 'What is wrong,husband?' He could not speak the news, but the wee girl with theschool-books said, 'Mamma, they've killed the President.' Ere noon everyhouse wore crape; it was as if there lay a dead son in every home. Forhours a sad group hung around the bulletins, hoping against hope; then,when the last hope died, turned sullenly homeward, saying, 'When all waswon, and all was done, then to strike him down!' The flags in the harborfell to half-mast; the streets were rivers of inky streamers; fromdoor-knobs floated crape; and even the unbelled car-horses seemed todraw the black-robed cars more quietly than before."On Saturday the remains were borne to the White House, where they wereembalmed and placed on a grand catafalque in the East Room. Little "Tad"was overcome with grief. All day Saturday he was inconsolable, but onSunday morning the sun rose bright and beautiful and into his childishheart came the thought that all was well with his father. He said to agentleman who called upon Mrs. Lincoln, "Do you think, sir, that myfather has gone to heaven?" "I have not a doubt of it," was the reply."Then," said the little fellow in broken voice, "I am glad he has gonethere, for he was never happy after he came here. This was not a goodplace for him!" Tuesday the White House was thrown open to admit friendswho desired to look upon the still form as it lay in death. Wednesday,the 19th, the funeral services took place. Mrs. Lincoln was too ill tobe present; but her two sons sat near the coffin in the East Room. Nextin order were ranged Andrew Johnson (now President) and the members ofthe Cabinet, and after them the foreign representatives, the chief menof the nation, and a large body of mourning citizens. The services wereconducted jointly by the Rev. Dr. Hall, Bishop Simpson, Dr. Gray, andthe Rev. Dr. Gurley, the latter delivering the discourse. At two o'clockthe funeral cortege started for the Capitol, where the remains were tolie in state until the following morning. The procession was long andimposing. "There were no truer mourners," says Secretary Welles, "thanthe poor colored people who crowded the streets, joined the procession,and exhibited their woe, bewailing the loss of him whom they regarded asa benefactor and father. Women as well as men, with their littlechildren, thronged the streets, sorrow and trouble and distress depictedon their countenances and in their bearing. The vacant holidayexpression had given way to real grief." The body was borne into therotunda, amidst funeral dirges and military salutes; and the religiousexercises of the occasion were concluded. A guard was stationed near thecoffin, and the public were again admitted to take their farewell of thedead. While these obsequies were being performed at Washington, similarceremonies were observed in every part of the country. It had beendecided to convey the remains of Lincoln to the home which he left fouryears before with such solemn and affectionate words of parting. Thefuneral train left Washington on the 21st. Its passage through theprincipal Eastern States and cities of the Union was a most mournful andimpressive spectacle. The heavily craped train, its sombre engineswathed in black, moved through the land like an eclipse. At every pointvast crowds assembled to gain a tearful glimpse as it sped past.    Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,    Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the      violets peep'd from the ground, spotting the      gray debris,    Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes,       passing the endless grass,    Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from      its shroud in the dark-brown fields uprisen,    Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the      orchards,    Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,    Night and day journeys a coffin.    Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,    Through day and night with the great cloud darkening      the land,    With the pomp of the inloop'd flags, with the cities      draped in black,    With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veil'd      women standing,    With processions long and winding and the flambeaus      of the night,    With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of      faces and the unbared heads,    With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the      sombre faces,    With dirges through the night, with the thousand      voices rising strong and solemn,    With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour'd      around the coffin,    The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs--    With the tolling, tolling bells' perpetual clang.At the principal cities delays were made to enable the people to paytheir tribute of respect to the remains of their beloved President.Through Baltimore, Harrisburg, Philadelphia, the train passed to NewYork City, where a magnificent funeral was held; thence along the shoreof the Hudson river to Albany, thence westward through the principalcities of New York, Ohio, and Northern Indiana, the cortege wended itssolemn way, reaching, on the 1st of May, the city of Chicago. Here veryextensive preparations for funeral obsequies had been made by thethousands who had known him in his life, and other thousands who hadlearned to love him and now mourned his death.On the 3d of May the funeral train reached Springfield, where oldfriends and neighbors tenderly received the dust of their beloved dead.Funeral services were held, and for twenty-four hours the catafalqueremained in the hall of the House, where thousands of tear-dimmed eyesgazed for the last time upon the familiar face. Then, on the morning ofthe 4th of May, a sorrowing procession escorted the remains to thebeautiful grounds of Oak Ridge Cemetery, to rest at last from the careand tumult of a troubled life. To this hallowed spot have come thegray-haired soldiers of that stormy war, reverently to salute theirgreat commander's tomb. Here shall long be paid the loving homage of thedusky race that he redeemed. And pilgrims from every land, who valuehuman worth and human liberty, bring here their tributes of respect. Andhere, while the Government that he saved endures, shall throng hispatriot countrymen, not idly to lament his loss, but to resolve _thatfrom this honored dead they take increased devotion to that cause forwhich he gave the last full measure of devotion; that the dead shall nothave died in vain; that the nation, under God, shall have a new birth offreedom; and that government of the people, by the people, for thepeople, shall not perish from the earth_.NOTES[A] The popular vote was as follows: Lincoln, 1,857,610; Douglas,1,291,574; Breckenridge, 850,082; Bell, 646,124. Of the electoralvotes, Lincoln had 180; Breckenridge, 72; Bell, 39; and Douglas,12.[B] On the very day of Lincoln's arrival in Washington, he said tosome prominent men who had called upon him at his hotel, "As thecountry has placed me at the helm of the ship, I'll try to steerher through."[C] This first call for troops was supplemented a month later (May16) by a call for 42,034 volunteers for three years, for 22,114officers and men for the regular army, and 18,000 seamen for thenavy.[D] Orpheus C. Kerr (_Office Seeker_) was the pseudonymn of RobertH. Newell, a popular humorist of the war period, who dealtparticularly with the comic aspects of Washington and army life.[E] Lincoln never lost his interest in exhibitions of physicalstrength, and involuntarily he always compared its possessor withhimself. On one occasion--it was in 1859--he was asked to make anaddress at the State Fair of Wisconsin, which was held atMilwaukee. Among the attractions was a "strong man" who wentthrough the usual performance of tossing iron balls and lettingthem roll back down his arms, lifting heavy weights, etc.Apparently Lincoln had never seen such a combination of strengthand agility before. He was greatly interested. Every now and thenhe gave vent to the ejaculation, "By George! By George!" After thespeech was over, Governor Hoyt introduced him to the athlete; andas Lincoln stood looking down at him from his great height,evidently pondering that one so small could be so strong, hesuddenly gave utterance to one of his quaint speeches. "Why," hesaid, "I could lick salt off the top of your hat!"[F] Hon. George S. Boutwell of Massachusetts stated Lincoln said tohim personally: "When Lee came over the river, I made a resolutionthat if McClellan drove him back I would send the proclamationafter him. The battle of Antietam was fought Wednesday, and untilSaturday I could not find out whether we had gained a victory orlost a battle. It was then too late to issue the proclamation thatday; and the fact is, I fixed it up a little on Sunday, and MondayI let them have it."[G] The cause of General Hooker's seeming stupefaction at thecritical point of the Chancellorsville battle has been muchdiscussed but never satisfactorily explained. It has been thoughtthat he was disabled by the shock of a cannon-ball striking a postor pillar of the house where he had his headquarters. Aninteresting entry in Welles's Diary, made soon after the battle,reflects somewhat the feeling at the time. "Sumner expresses anabsolute want of confidence in Hooker; says he knows him to be ablasphemous wretch; that after crossing the Rappahannock andreaching Centreville, Hooker exultingly exclaimed, 'The enemy arein my power, and God Almighty cannot deprive me of them.' I haveheard before of this, but not so direct and positive. The suddenparalysis that followed, when the army in the midst of a successfulcareer was suddenly checked and commenced its retreat, has neverbeen explained. Whiskey is said by Sumner to have done the work.The President said that if Hooker had been killed by the shot whichknocked over the pillar that stunned him, we should have beensuccessful."[H] General T.R. Tannatt, a graduate of West Point in 1858, is now(1913) an active and honored citizen of Spokane, Washington.[I] The criticism of Meade for not attacking Lee before herecrossed the Potomac is based on the assumption that the attackmust be successful. On this point Meade's words to Halleck, writtenin reply to the latter's conciliatory letter of July 28, can hardlybe ignored. "Had I attacked Lee the day I proposed to do so, and inthe ignorance that then existed of his position, I have everyreason to believe the attack would have been unsuccessful, andwould have resulted disastrously. This opinion is founded on thejudgment of a number of distinguished officers after inspectingLee's vacated works and position. Among these officers I could nameGenerals Sedgwick, Wright, Slocum, Hays, Sykes, and others." Inother words the attack which Meade has been so severely blamed fornot making might have ended in reversing the results at Gettysburg,losing all we had gained at such terrible cost, placed Washingtonand other Northern cities in far more deadly peril, and changingthe whole subsequent issues of the war.[J] A curious revelation of the estimate of General Halleck held byat least one member of the Cabinet, and of the relations betweenHalleck and the President, is found in Welles's Diary in the recordof a rather free conversation with the President during the anxiousperiod about the time of the battle of Gettysburg. Says Mr. Welles:"I stated I had observed the inertness if not the incapacity of theGeneral-in-Chief, and had hoped that he [the President], who hadbetter and more correct views, would issue peremptory orders. ThePresident immediately softened his tone, and said, 'Halleck knowsbetter than I what to do. He is a military man, has had a militaryeducation. I brought him here to give me military advice. His viewsand mine are widely different. It is better that I, who am not amilitary man, should defer to him, rather than he to me.' This,"continues Mr. Welles, "is the President's error. His ownconvictions and conclusions are infinitely superior to Halleck's;even in military operations, more sensible and more correctalways.... Halleck has no activity; never exhibits sagacity orforesight." And in another place in the same Diary we are giventhis singular picture by a Cabinet minister of the man who was atthat moment the General-in-Chief of the Union armies and themilitary adviser of the President: "Halleck sits and smokes, andswears, and scratches his arm, but exhibits little militarycapacity or intelligence; is obfuscated, muddy, uncertain, stupidas to what is doing or to be done."INDEX_[The abbreviation "L.," as used in this index, refers in every case tothe subject of this biography_.]Abolitionists,  Bloomington convention, 165-169;

Died August 20th, 1912.]The Authoritative Life Of General William BoothFounder of The Salvation ArmyByG. S. RailtonFirst Commissioner to General BoothWith a Preface byGeneral Bramwell BoothCopyright, 1912,By George H. Doran CompanyPrefaceI have no hesitation in commending this small volume as containing sofar as its space permits, a good picture of my beloved Father and arecord of much that made his life of interest and importance to theworld.It does not, of course, profess to cover anything like the whole storyof his many years of world-wide service. It could not do so. For anysuch complete history we must wait for that later production which may,I hope, be possible before very long when there has been time to gofully through the masses of diaries, letters and other papers he hasleft behind him.It must not be supposed that I can make myself responsible for everyphrase Commissioner Railton has used. I know, however, that perhaps noone except myself had anything like his opportunities, during the lastforty years, of knowing and studying my Father's life, both in publicand private, and of understanding his thoughts and purposes._Now we wish this book to accomplish something._ We cannot think itpossible for anyone, especially a Salvationist, to read it without beingcompelled ever and anon to ask himself such questions as these:--"Am I living a life that is at all like this life? Am I, at any rate,willing by God's grace to do anything I can in the same direction, inorder that God may be more loved and glorified, and that my fellow menmay be raised to a more God-like and happy service? After all, is therenot something better for me than money-making, or the search after humanapplause, or indeed the pursuit of earthly good of any kind?"If, instead of aiming at that which will all fade away, I turn myattention to making the best of my life for God and for others, may Inot also accomplish something that will afford me satisfaction at lastand bear reflection in the world to come?"I hope also that to some, at least, the great message of this life willstand revealed in these pages. I believe it to be that, while God can dolittle or nothing by us until we are completely submitted and given upto Him, He can work wonders of infinite moment to the world when we are.Asked, a few months before his death, if he would put into a sentencethe secret as he saw it, of all the blessings which had attended himduring his seventy years of service, The General replied: "Well, if I amto put it into one sentence, I would say that I made up my mind that GodAlmighty should have all there was of William Booth." It was, in thebeginning, that entire devotion to God and its continued maintenancewhich could, alone, account for the story told in these brief records.The book is, of course, written in the main from the Salvationist pointof view; much of it, indeed, is simply a reproduction of my father's ownsayings and writings to his own people. This, to all thoughtful readers,must be our defence against any appearance of self-glorification, or anyomission to refer to the work in the world that others are doing forChrist. No attempt has been made to tell the story of The General's"life and times," but simply to note some of the things he said and didhimself. And I trust the record may be found useful by all the manyservants of God who do not think exactly as he thought, but who yetrejoiced in the triumphs of the Cross through his labours.To continue and to amplify the results of his work must needs be mycontinual aim. I am full of hope that this book may bring me some help,not only towards his Memorial Scheme, which contemplates the erectionand equipment in London and other Capitals of enlarged premises for theTraining of Officers in every branch of the work, or where they alreadyhave such buildings, the erection of new Headquarters or Halls; buttowards the maintenance and extension in every land of the work hebegan.It cannot but be a special gratification to me to know that this bookwill be received with eager affection in almost every part of theworld. How could it ever cease to be my greatest joy to strive more andmore after my Father's ideal of linking together men and women of everyland and race in one grand competition for the extinction of selfishnessby the enlistment of all sorts and conditions of men in one Great HolyWar for God and for all that is good?Whether those into whose hands this volume falls, agree or not with theteachings of The Salvation Army, may God grant them Grace to joinheartily at least in this, my Father's great purpose, and so help me toattain the victory for which he lived and died.W.

His father had been one of those builders of houses who sorapidly rose in those days to wealth, but who, largely employingborrowed capital, often found themselves in any time of general scarcityreduced to poverty.I glory in the fact that The General's ancestry has never been traced,so far as I know, beyond his grandfather. I will venture to say,however, that his forefathers fought with desperation against somebodyat least a thousand years ago. Fighting is an inveterate habit of oursin England, and another renowned general has just been recommending allyoung men to learn to shoot. The constant joy and pride with which ourGeneral always spoke of his mother is a tribute to her excellence, aswell as the best possible record of his own earliest days. Of her hewrote, in 1893:--     "I had a good mother. So good she has ever appeared to me that I     have often said that all I knew of her life seemed a striking     contradiction of the doctrine of human depravity. In my youth I     fully accepted that doctrine, and I do not deny it now; but my     patient, self-sacrificing mother always appeared to be an exception     to the rule.     "I loved my mother. From infancy to manhood I lived in her. Home     was not home to me without her. I do not remember any single act of     wilful disobedience to her wishes. When my father died I was so     passionately attached to my mother that I can recollect that,     deeply though I felt his loss, my grief was all but forbidden by     the thought that it was not my mother who had been taken from me.     And yet one of the regrets that has followed me to the present     hour is that I did not sufficiently value the treasure while I     possessed it, and that I did not with sufficient tenderness and     assiduity at the time, attempt the impossible task of repaying the     immeasurable debt I owed to that mother's love.     "She was certainly one of the most unselfish beings it has been my     lot to come into contact with. 'Never mind me' was descriptive of     her whole life at every time, in every place, and under every     circumstance. To make others happy was the end of all her thoughts     and aims with regard not only to her children but to her domestics,     and indeed to all who came within her influence. To remove misery     was her delight. No beggar went empty-handed from her door. The     sorrows of any poor wretch were certain of her commiseration, and     of a helping hand in their removal, so far as she had ability. The     children of misfortune were sure of her pity, and the children of     misconduct she pitied almost the more, because, for one reason,     they were the cause of sorrow to those who had reason to mourn on     their account.     "For many years before she died, love, joy, and peace reigned in     her heart, beamed from her countenance, and spoke in her words. Her     faith was immovably fixed on Him who is able to save to the     uttermost. It was a common expression of confidence with her that     'Jesus would go with her all the way through the journey of     life--even to the end. He would not leave her. Her feet were on the     Rock.'"To this testimony to his mother's worth The General added:--     "To those whose eyes may fall on these lines, may I not be excused     saying, 'See to it that you honour your father and your mother, not     only that your days may be long in the land, but that you may not,     in after years, be disturbed by useless longings to have back again     the precious ones who so ceaselessly and unselfishly toiled with     heart and brain for your profoundest well-being.'     "My mother and father were both Derbyshire people. They were born     within a few miles of each other, the former at Somercotes, a small     village within a mile or two of Alfreton and the latter at Belper.     My mother's father was a well-to-do farmer. Her mother died when     she was three years of age; and, her father marrying again, she     was taken to the heart and home of a kind uncle and aunt, who     reared and educated her, giving her at the same time a sound     religious training.     "Years passed of which we have but imperfect knowledge during     which, by some means, she drifted to the small town of     Ashby-de-la-Zouch. Here she met my father, who was availing himself     of the waters as a remedy for his chronic enemy, rheumatism. He     offered her marriage. She refused. He left the town indignant, but     returned to renew his proposal, which she ultimately accepted.     Their marriage followed. Up to this date her path through life had     been comparatively a smooth one; but from this hour onward through     many long and painful years, it was crowded with difficulties and     anxieties.     "My father's fortunes appear to have begun to wane soon after his     marriage. At that time he would have passed, I suppose, for a rich     man, according to the estimate of riches in those days. But bad     times came, and very bad times they were, such as we know little     about, despite all the grumbling of this modern era. Nottingham,     where the family was then located, suffered heavily, a large     proportion of its poorer classes being reduced to the verge of     starvation. My father, who had invested the entire savings of his     lifetime in small house property, was seriously affected by these     calamitous circumstances; in fact, he was ruined.     "The brave way in which my mother stood by his side during that     dark and sorrowful season is indelibly written on my memory. She     shared his every anxiety, advised him in all his business     perplexities, and upheld his spirit as crash followed crash, and     one piece of property after another went overboard. Years of heavy     affliction followed, during which she was his tender, untiring     nurse, comforting and upholding his spirit unto death; and then she     stood out all alone to fight the battles of his children amidst the     wreck of his fortunes.     "Those days were gloomy indeed; and the wonder now in looking back     upon them is that she survived them. It would have seemed a     perfectly natural thing if she had died of a broken heart, and been     borne away to lie in my father's grave.     "But she had reasons for living. Her children bound her to earth,     and for our sakes she toiled on with unswerving devotion and     unintermitting care. After a time the waters found a smoother     channel, so far as this world's troubles were concerned, and her     days were ended, in her eighty-fifth year, in comparative peace."     "During one of my Motor Campaigns to Nottingham," The General wrote     on another occasion, "my car took me over the Trent, the dear old     river along whose banks I used to wander in my boyhood days,     sometimes poring over Young's _Night Thoughts_, reading Henry Kirke     White's _Poems_, or, as was frequently the case before my     conversion, with a fishing-rod in my hand.     "In those days angling was my favourite sport. I have sat down on     those banks many a summer morning at five o'clock, although I     rarely caught anything. An old uncle ironically used to have a     plate with a napkin on it ready for my catch waiting for me on my     return.     "And then the motor brought us to the ancient village of Wilford,     with its lovely old avenues of elms fringing the river.     "There were the very meadows in which we children used to revel     amongst the bluebells and crocuses which, in those days, spread out     their beautiful carpet in the spring-time, to the unspeakable     delight of the youngsters from the town.     "But how changed the scene! Most of these rural charms had fled,     and in their places were collieries and factories, and machine     shops, and streets upon streets of houses for the employes of the     growing town. We were only 60,000 in my boyhood, whereas the     citizens of Nottingham to-day number 250,000.     "A few years ago the city conferred its freedom upon me as a mark     of appreciation and esteem. To God be all the glory that He has     helped His poor boy to live for Him, and made even his former     enemies to honour him."But we all know what sort of influences exist in a city that is at oncethe capital of a county and a commercial centre. The homes of thewealthy and comfortable are found at no great distance from thedwellings of the poor, while in the huge market-places are exhibitionsweekly of all the contrasts between town and country life, between theextremest want and the most lavish plenty.Seventy years ago, life in such a city was nearly as different from whatit is to-day as the life of to-day in an American state capital is fromthat of a Chinese town. Between the small circle of "old families" whostill possessed widespread influence and the masses of the people therewas a wide gap. The few respectable charities, generally due to thepiety of some long-departed citizen, marked out very strikingly acertain number of those who were considered "deserving poor," and helpedto make every one less concerned about all the rest. For all the manythousands struggling day and night to keep themselves and thosedependent upon them from starvation, there was little or no pity. It wasjust "their lot," and they were taught to consider it their duty to becontent with it. To envy their richer neighbours, to covet anything theypossessed, was a sin that would only ensure for the coveter an eternaland aggravated continuance of his present thirst.In describing those early years, The General said:--     "Before my father's death I had been apprenticed by his wish. I was     very young, only thirteen years of age, but he could not afford to     keep me longer at school, and so out into the world I must go. This     event was followed by the formation of companionships whose     influence was anything but beneficial. I went down hill morally,     and the consequences might have been serious if not eternally     disastrous, but that the hand of God was laid on me in a very     remarkable manner.     "I had scarcely any income as an apprentice, and was so hard up     when my father died, that I could do next to nothing to assist my     dear mother and sisters, which was the cause of no little     humiliation and grief.     "The system of apprenticeship in those days generally bound a lad     for six or seven years. During this time he received little or no     wages, and was required to slave from early morning to late evening     upon the supposition that he was 'being taught' the business,     which, if he had a good master, was probably true. It was a severe     but useful time of learning. My master was a Unitarian--that is, he     did not believe Christ was the son of God and the Saviour of the     world, but only the best of teachers; yet so little had he learnt     of Him that his heaven consisted in making money, strutting about     with his gay wife, and regaling himself with worldly amusements.     "At nineteen the weary years of my apprenticeship came to an end.     I had done my six years' service, and was heartily glad to be free     from the humiliating bondage they had proved. I tried hard to find     some kind of labour that would give me more liberty to carry out     the aggressive ideas which I had by this time come to entertain as     to saving the lost; but I failed. For twelve months I waited. Those     months were among the most desolate of my life. No one took the     slightest interest in me.     "Failing to find employment in Nottingham, I had to move away. I     was loath, very loath, to leave my dear widowed mother and my     native town, but I was compelled to do so, and to come to London.     In the great city I felt myself unutterably alone. I did not know a     soul excepting a brother-in-law, with whom I had not a particle of     communion.     "In many respects my new master very closely resembled the old one.     In one particular, however, he differed from him very materially,     and that was he made a great profession of religion. He believed in     the Divinity of Jesus Christ, and in the Church of which he was a     member, but seemed to be utterly ignorant of either the theory or     practice of experimental godliness. To the spiritual interests of     the dead world around him he was as indifferent as were the vicious     crowds themselves whom he so heartily despised. All he seemed to me     to want was to make money, and all he seemed to want me for was to     help him in the sordid selfish task.     "So it was work, work, work, morning, noon, and night. I was     practically a white slave, being only allowed my liberty on     Sundays, and an hour or two one night in the week, and even then     the rule was 'Home by ten o'clock, or the door will be locked     against you.' This law was rigidly enforced in my case, although my     employer knew that I travelled long distances preaching the Gospel     in which he and his wife professed so loudly to believe. To get     home in time, many a Sunday night I have had to run long distances,     after walking for miles, and preaching twice during the day."The contrast between those days and ours can hardly be realised by anyof us now. We may put down almost in figures some of the differencesthat steam and electricity have made, linking all mankind together moreclosely than Nottingham was then connected with London. But what wordscan convey any picture of the development of intelligence and sympathythat makes an occurrence in a London back street interest the readinginhabitants of Germany, America, and Australia as intense as those ofour own country?What a consolation it would have been to the apprentice lad, could hehave known how all his daily drudgery was fitting him to understand, tocomfort, and to help the toiling masses of every race and clime?In the wonderful providence of God all these changes have been allowedto leave England in as dominating a position as she held when WilliamBooth was born, if not to enhance her greatness and power, far as somemay consider beyond what she deserved. And yet all the time, with orwithout our choice, our own activities, and even our faults andneglects, have been helping other peoples, some of them born on oursoil, to become our rivals in everything. Happily the multiplication ofplans of intercourse is now merging the whole human race so much intoone community that one may hope yet to see the dawn of that fraternityof peoples which may end the present prospects of wars unparalleled inthe past. How very much William Booth has contributed to bring thatuniversal brotherhood about this book may suffice to hint.Chapter IISalvation In YouthIn convincing him that goodness was the only safe passport to peace andprosperity of any lasting kind, William Booth's mother had happily laidin the heart of her boy the best foundation for a happy life, "Be good,William, and then all will be well," she had said to him over and overagain.But how was he to "be good"? The English National Church, eighty yearsago, had reached a depth of cold formality and uselessness which canhardly be imagined now. Nowhere was this more manifest than in the"parish" church. The rich had their allotted pew, a sort of reservedseat, into which no stranger dare enter, deserted though it might be byits holders for months together. For the poor, seats were in somechurches placed in the broad aisles or at the back of the pulpit, soconspicuously marking out the inferiority of all who sat in them asalmost to serve as a notice to every one that the ideas of Jesus Christhad no place there. Even when an earnest clergyman came to any church,he had really a battle against great prejudices on both sides if hewished to make any of "the common people" feel welcome at "commonprayer." But the way the appointed services were "gone through" was onlytoo often such as to make every one look upon the whole matter as onewhich only concerned the clergy. Especially was this the effect on youngpeople. Anything like interest, or pleasure, in those dull and dreary,not to say "vain" repetitions on their part must indeed have been rare.It is not surprising then that William Booth saw nothing to attract himin the Church of his fathers. John Wesley, that giant reformer ofreligion in England, had been dead some forty years, and his life-workhad not been allowed to affect "the Church" very profoundly. Hisfollowers having seceded from it contrary to his orders and entreaties,had already made several sects, and in the chief of these William Boothpresently found for himself at least a temporary home. Here the serviceswere, to some extent, independent of books; earnest preaching of thetruth was often heard from the pulpits, and some degree of real concernfor the spiritual advancement of the people was manifested by thepreachers.Under this preaching and these influences, and the singing of Wesley'shymns, the lad was deeply moved. To his last days he sang some of thosegrand old songs as much as, if not more than, any others; that one, forexample, containing the verse:--    And can I yet delay my little all to give?    To tear my soul from earth away, for Jesus to receive?    Nay, but I yield, I yield! I can hold out no more,    I sink, by dying love compelled, and own Thee conqueror.The mind that has never yet come in contact with teaching of thischaracter can scarcely comprehend the effect of such thoughts on a youngand ardent soul. This Jesus, who gave up Heaven and all that was brightand pleasant to devote Himself to the world's Salvation, was presentedto him as coming to ask the surrender of his heart and life to Hisservice, and his heart could not long resist the appeal. It was in nolarge congregation, however, but in one of the smaller Meetings thatWilliam Booth made the glorious sacrifice of himself which he had beenmade to understand was indispensable to real religion. Speaking sometime ago, he thus described that great change:--     "When as a giddy youth of fifteen I was led to attend Wesley     Chapel, Nottingham, I cannot recollect that any individual pressed     me in the direction of personal surrender to God. I was wrought     upon quite independently of human effort by the Holy Ghost, who     created within me a great thirst for a new life.     "I felt that I wanted, in place of the life of self-indulgence, to     which I was yielding myself, a happy, conscious sense that I was     pleasing God, living right, and spending all my powers to get     others into such a life. I saw that all this ought to be, and I     decided that it should be. It is wonderful that I should have     reached this decision in view of all the influences then around me.     My professedly Christian master never uttered a word to indicate     that he believed in anything he could not see, and many of my     companions were worldly and sensual, some of them even vicious.     "Yet I had that instinctive belief in God which, in common with my     fellow-creatures, I had brought into the world with me. I had no     disposition to deny my instincts, which told me that if there was a     God His laws ought to have my obedience and His interests my     service.     "I felt that it was better to live right than to live wrong, and as     to caring for the interests of others instead of my own, the     condition of the suffering people around me, people with whom I had     been so long familiar, and whose agony seemed to reach its climax     about this time, undoubtedly affected me very deeply.     "There were children crying for bread to parents whose own distress     was little less terrible to witness.     "One feeling specially forced itself upon me, and I can recollect     it as distinctly as though it had transpired only yesterday, and     that was the sense of the folly of spending my life in doing things     for which I knew I must either repent or be punished in the days to     come.     "In my anxiety to get into the right way, I joined the Methodist     Church, and attended the Class Meetings, to sing and pray and speak     with the rest." (A Class Meeting was the weekly muster of all     members of the church, who were expected to tell their leader     something of their soul's condition in answer to his inquiries.)     "But all the time the inward Light revealed to me that I must not     only renounce everything I knew to be sinful, but make restitution,     so far as I had the ability, for any wrong I had done to others     before I could find peace with God.     "The entrance to the Heavenly Kingdom was closed against me by an     evil act of the past which required restitution. In a boyish     trading affair I had managed to make a profit out of my companions,     whilst giving them to suppose that what I did was all in the way of     a generous fellowship. As a testimonial of their gratitude they     had given me a silver pencil-case. Merely to return their gift     would have been comparatively easy, but to confess the deception I     had practised upon them was a humiliation to which for some days I     could not bring myself.     "I remember, as if it were but yesterday, the spot in the corner of     a room under the chapel, the hour, the resolution to end the     matter, the rising up and rushing forth, the finding of the young     fellow I had chiefly wronged, the acknowledgment of my sin, the     return of the pencil-case--the instant rolling away from my heart     of the guilty burden, the peace that came in its place, and the     going forth to serve my God and my generation from that hour.     "It was in the open street that this great change passed over me,     and if I could only have possessed the flagstone on which I stood     at that happy moment, the sight of it occasionally might have been     as useful to me as the stones carried up long ago from the bed of     the Jordan were to the Israelites who had passed over them     dry-shod.     "Since that night, for it was near upon eleven o'clock when the     happy change was realised, the business of my life has been not     only to make a holy character but to live a life of loving activity     in the service of God and man. I have ever felt that true religion     consists not only in being holy myself, but in assisting my     Crucified Lord in His work of saving men and women, making them     into His Soldiers, keeping them faithful to death, and so getting     them into Heaven.     "I have had to encounter all sorts of difficulties as I have     travelled along this road. The world has been against me, sometimes     very intensely, and often very stupidly. I have had difficulties     similar to those of other men, with my own bodily appetites, with     my mental disposition, and with my natural unbelief.     "Many people, both religious and irreligious, are apt to think that     they are more unfavourably constituted than their comrades and     neighbours, and that their circumstances and surroundings are     peculiarly unfriendly to the discharge of the duties they owe to     God and man.     "I have been no exception in this matter. Many a time I have been     tempted to say to myself, 'There is no one fixed so awkwardly for     holy living and faithful fighting as I am.' But I have been     encouraged to resist the delusion by remembering the words of the     Apostle Paul: 'There hath no temptation taken you but such as is     common to man.'     "I am not pretending to say that I have worked harder, or practised     more self-denial, or endured more hardships at any particular time     of my life than have those around me; but I do want those who feel     any interest in me to understand that faithfulness to God in the     discharge of duty and the maintenance of a good conscience have     cost me as severe a struggle as they can cost any Salvation Soldier     in London, Berlin, Paris, New York, or Tokio to-day.     "One reason for the victory I daily gained from the moment of my     conversion was, no doubt, my complete and immediate separation from     the godless world. I turned my back on it. I gave it up, having     made up my mind beforehand that if I did go in for God I would do     so with all my might. Rather than yearning for the world's     pleasures, books, gains, or recreations, I found my new nature     leading me to come away from it all. It had lost all charm for me.     What were all the novels, even those of Sir Walter Scott or     Fenimore Cooper, compared with the story of my Saviour? What were     the choicest orators compared with Paul? What was the hope of     money-earning, even with all my desire to help my poor mother and     sisters, in comparison with the imperishable wealth of ingathered     souls? I soon began to despise everything the world had to offer     me.     "In those days I felt, as I believe many Converts do, that I could     willingly and joyfully travel to the ends of the earth for Jesus     Christ, and suffer anything imaginable to help the souls of other     men. Jesus Christ had baptised me, according to His eternal     promise, with His Spirit and with Fire.     "Yet the surroundings of my early life were all in opposition to     this whole-hearted devotion. No one at first took me by the hand     and urged me forward, or gave me any instruction or hint likely to     help me in the difficulties I had at once to encounter in my     consecration to this service."This clear experience and teaching of an absolutely new life, that"eternal life" which Jesus Christ promises to all His true followers, isindispensable to the right understanding of everything in connexion withthe career we are recording. Without such an experience nothing of whatfollows could have been possible. With it the continual resistance toevery contrary teaching and influence, and the strenuous struggle by allpossible means to propagate it are inevitable.One is amazed at this time of day, to find intelligent men writing asthough there were some mysticism, or something quite beyond ordinaryunderstanding, in this theory of conversion, or regeneration.Precisely the process which The General thus describes in his own casemust of necessity follow any thoughtful and prayerful consideration ofthe mission and Gospel of Christ. Either we must reject the whole Biblestory or we must admit that "all we like sheep have gone astray," takingour own course, in contempt of God's wishes. To be convinced of thatmust plunge any soul into just such a depth of sorrow and anxiety asleft this lad no rest until he had found peace in submission to his God.No outside influences or appearances can either produce or besubstituted for the deep, inward resolve of the wandering soul, "I willarise, and go to my Father." Whether that decision be come to in somecrowded Meeting, or in the loneliness of some midnight hour is quiteunimportant. But how can there be true repentance, or the beginning ofreconciliation with God, until that point is reached?And whenever that returning to God takes place, there is the sameabundant pardon, the same change of heart, the same new birth, which hashere been described. What can be more simple and matter of fact? Takeaway the need and possibility of such "conversion," and this whole lifebecomes a delusion, and the proclamation of Jesus Christ as a Saviour ofmen inexcusable. What has created any mystery around the questionamongst Christians, if not the sacramental theory, which more or lesscontradicts it all? In almost all Christian Churches a theory is set upthat a baby by some ceremonial act becomes suddenly regenerated, "made achild of God, and an heir of His Kingdom."If that were the case, there could, of course, have been no need for thelater regeneration of that child; but I do not believe that anecclesiastic could be found, from the Vatican to the most remoteisland-parish where children are "christened," who would profess to haveseen such a regenerated child alive. There is notoriously no such changeaccomplished in any one, until the individual himself, convinced of hisown godless condition, cries to God for His Salvation, and receives thatgreat gift.What a foundation for life was the certainty which that lad got as heknelt in that little room in Nottingham! Into that same "full assurance"he was later on to lead many millions--young and old--of many lands. Thesimple Army verse:--    I know thy sins are all forgiven,      Glory to the Bleeding Lamb!    And I am on my way to Heaven,      Glory to the Bleeding Lamb!embalms for ever that grand starting-point of the soul, from which ourpeople have been able, in ignorance of almost everything else of Divinetruth, to commence a career of holy living, and of loving effort for thesouls of others.How much more weight those few words carry than the most eloquentaddress bereft of that certainty of tone could ever have!That certainty which rests not upon any study of books, even of theBible itself, but upon the soul's own believing vision of the Lamb ofGod who has taken its sins away; that certainty which changes in amoment the prison darkness of the sin-chained into the light and joy andpower of the liberated slave of Christ; that is the great conquest ofthe Salvation Soldier everywhere.And yet, perhaps, in the eyes of an unbelieving world, and a doubtingChurch, that was General Booth's great offence all through life. Tothink of having uneducated and formerly godless people "bawling" the"mysteries of the faith" through the streets of "Christian" cities,where it had hitherto been thought inconsistent with Christian humilityfor any one to dare to say they really knew Him "whom to know is lifeeternal"! Oh, that was the root objection to all The General's preachingand action.And it was one of the most valuable features of his whole career thatwherever he or his messengers went there came that same certainty whichfrom the days of Bethlehem onwards Jesus Christ came to bring to everyman."By faith we know!" If every outward manifestation of The General'ssuccesses could be swept off the world to-morrow, this positive faith inthe one Saviour would be capable of reproducing all its blessed resultsover again, wherever it was preserved, or renewed. Any so-called faithwhich gives no certainty must needs be hustled out of the way of aninvestigating, hurrying, wealth-seeking age. Only those who are certainthat they have found the Lord can be capable of inducing others to seekand find Him.Chapter IIILay MinistryConvictions such as we have just been reading of were bound to lead toimmediate action. But it is most interesting to find that WilliamBooth's first regular service for Christ was not called forth by anychurch, but simply by the spontaneous efforts of one or two youngConverts like himself. No one could be more inclined towards the use oforganisation and system than he always was, and yet he always advocatedan organisation so open to all, and a system so elastic, that zeal mightnever be repressed, but only made the most of. It is, perhaps, fortunatethat we have in one of his addresses to his own young Officers thefollowing description of the way he began to work for the Salvation ofhis fellow-townsmen:--     "Directly after my conversion I had a bad attack of fever, and was     brought to the very edge of the grave. But God raised me up, and     led me out to work for Him, after a fashion which, considering my     youth and inexperience, must be pronounced remarkable. While     recovering from this illness, which left me far from strong, I     received a note from a companion, Will Sansom, asking me to make     haste and get well again, and help him in a Mission he had started     in a slum part of the town. No sooner was I able to get about than     I gladly joined him.     "The Meetings we held were very remarkable for those days. We used     to take out a chair into the street, and one of us mounting it     would give out a hymn, which we then sang with the help of, at the     most, three or four people. Then I would talk to the people, and     invite them to come with us to a Meeting in one of the houses.     "How I worked in those days! Remember that I was only an apprentice     lad of fifteen or sixteen. I used to leave business at 7 o'clock,     or soon after, and go visiting the sick, then these street     Meetings, and afterwards to some Meeting in a cottage, where we     would often get some one saved. After the Meeting I would often go     to see some dying person, arriving home about midnight to rest all     I could before rising next morning in time to reach my place of     business at 7 A.M. That was sharp exercise! How I can remember     rushing along the streets during my forty minutes' dinner-time,     reading the Bible or C. G. Finney's _Lectures on Revivals of     Religion_ as I went, careful, too, not to be a minute late. And at     this time I was far from strong physically; but full of     difficulties as those days were, they were nevertheless wonderful     seasons of blessing, and left pleasant memories that endure to this     hour.     "The leading men of the church to which I belonged were afraid I     was going too fast, and gave me plenty of cautions, quaking and     fearing at my every new departure; but none gave me a word of     encouragement. And yet the Society of which for those six     apprentice years I was a faithful member, was literally my heaven     on earth. Truly, I thought then there was one God, that John Wesley     was His prophet, and that the Methodists were His special people.     The church was at the time, I believe, one thousand members strong.     Much as I loved them, however, I mingled but little with them, and     had time for but few of their great gatherings, having chosen the     Meadow Platts as my parish, because my heart then as now went out     after the poorest of the poor.     "Thus my conversion made me, in a moment, a preacher of the Gospel.     The idea never dawned on me that any line was to be drawn between     one who had nothing else to do but preach and a saved apprentice     lad who only wanted 'to spread through all the earth abroad,' as we     used to sing, the fame of our Saviour. I have lived, thank God, to     witness the separation between layman and cleric become more and     more obscured, and to see Jesus Christ's idea of changing in a     moment ignorant fishermen into fishers of men nearer and nearer     realisation.     "But I had to battle for ten of the best years of my youth against     the barriers the Churches set up to prevent this natural following     of the Lamb wherever He leads. At that time they all but compelled     those who wished to minister to the souls of men to speak in     unnatural language and tones, and adopt habits of mind and life     which so completely separated them from the crowd as to make them     into a sort of princely caste, whom the masses of every clime     outwardly reverenced and inwardly despised.     "Lad though I was, a group of new Converts and other earnest souls     soon gathered around me, and greater things seemed to be ahead when     a great trial overtook me. The bosom friend already referred to was     taken from my side. We had been like David and Jonathan in the     intensity of our union and fellowship in our work for God. He had a     fine appearance, was a beautiful singer, and possessed a wonderful     gift in prayer. After I had spoken in our Open-Air Meeting he would     kneel down and wrestle with God until it seemed as though he would     move the very stones on which he knelt, as well as the hearts of     the people who heard him. Of how few of those men called ministers     or priests can anything like this be said!     "But the unexpected blow came. He fell into consumption. His     relations carried him up and down the country for change of air and     scene. All was done that could be done to save his life, but in     vain. The last change was to the Isle of Wight. In that lovely spot     the final hope fled. I remember their bringing him home to die. He     bade farewell to earth, and went triumphantly to Heaven singing--        And when to Jordan's flood I come,          Jehovah rules the tide,          And the waters He'll divide,        And the heavenly host will shout--              "Welcome Home!"     "What a trial that loss was to my young heart! It was rendered all     the greater from the fact that I had to go forward all alone in     face of an opposition which suddenly sprang up from the leading     functionaries of the church."The consecration which William Booth made of himself to this work, withall the zeal and novelty with which it was characterised, was due, nodoubt, to the teaching, influence, and example of James Caughey, aremarkable American minister who visited the town. Largely free fromEuropean opinions and customs in religious matters, and seeking only toadvance the cause of Jesus Christ with all possible speed, this man to avery large extent liberated William Booth for life from any one set ofplans, and led him towards that perfect faith in God's guidance whichmade him capable of new departures to any extent.The old-fashioned representatives of officialdom grumbled in vain atnovelties which have now become accepted necessities of all missionwork.     "But just about this time," The General has told us, "another     difficulty started across my path in connexion with my business. I     have told you how intense had been the action of my conscience     before my conversion. But after my conversion it was naturally ever     increasingly sensitive to every question of right and wrong, with a     great preponderance as to the importance of what was right over     what was wrong. Ever since that day it has led me to measure my own     actions, and judge my own character by the standard of truth set up     in my soul by the Bible and the Holy Ghost; and it has not     permitted me to allow myself in the doing of things which I have     felt were wrong without great inward torture. I have always had a     great horror of hypocrisy--that is, of being unreal or false,     however fashionable the cursed thing might be, or whatever worldly     temptation might strive to lead me on to the track. In this I was     tested again and again in those early days, and at last there came     a crisis.     "Our business was a large one and the assistants were none too     many. On Saturdays there was always great pressure. Work often     continued into the early hours of Sunday. Now I had strong notions     in my youth and for long after--indeed, I entertain them now--about     the great importance of keeping the Sunday, or Sabbath as we always     called it, clear of unnecessary work.     "For instance, I walked in my young days thousands of miles on the     Sabbath, when I could for a trifling sum have ridden at ease,     rather than use any compulsory labour of man or beast for the     promotion of my comfort. I still think we ought to abstain from all     unnecessary work ourselves, and, as far as possible, arrange for     everybody about us to have one day's rest in seven. But, as I was     saying, I objected to working at my business on the Sabbath, which     I interpreted to mean after twelve o'clock on Saturday night. My     relatives and many of my religious friends laughed at my scruples;     but I paid no heed to them, and told my master I would not do it,     though he replied that if that were so he would simply discharge     me. I told him I was willing to begin on Monday morning as soon as     the clock struck twelve, and work until the clock struck twelve on     Saturday night, but that not one hour or one minute of Sunday would     I work for him or all his money.     "He kept his word, put me into the street, and I was laughed at by     everybody as a sort of fool. But I held out, and within seven days     he gave in, and, thinking my scrupulous conscience might serve his     turn he told me to come back again. I did so, and before another     fortnight had passed he went off with his young wife to Paris,     leaving the responsibilities of a business involving the income and     expenditure of hundreds of pounds weekly on my young shoulders.     "So I did not lose by that transaction in any way. With no little     suffering on four separate occasions, contrary to the judgments of     all around me, I have thus left every friend I had in the world,     and gone straight into what appeared positive ruin, so far as this     world was concerned, to meet the demands of conscience. But I have     trusted God, and done the right, and in every separate instance I     can now see that I have gained both for this world and the next as     the result.     "During all the period of my lay preaching, both in Nottingham and     London, I had to grapple with other difficulties. What with one     thing and another I had a great struggle at times to keep my head     above the waters, and my heart alive with peace and love. But I     held on to God and His grace, and the never-failing joy that I     experienced in leading souls to Christ carried me through."How can anybody fail to see how much more the masses are likely to beinfluenced by the preaching, no matter how defective oratorically, ofone who has thus lived in the midst of them--living, in fact, their verylife of anxiety, suffering, and toil--than by that of men, howeverexcellent, who come to them with the atmosphere of the study, thecollege, or the seminary?And yet, after having been trained for a year in the rough-and-readyoratory of the streets, subject to interruptions and interjected sneers,The General was called upon, in order to be recognised as fit forregistration as a lay preacher, to mount the pulpit and preach a "trialsermon"! Accustomed as he had become to talk out his heart with suchwords and illustrations as involuntarily presented themselves to thesimple-minded, though often wicked and always ignorant crowds, whogathered around the chair on which he stood; able without difficulty tohold their attention when he had won it, and drive the truth home totheir souls, in spite of the counter-attractions of a busy thoroughfare,he took very hardly to the stiff, cold process of sermonising andsermon-making such as was then in vogue, and it was some time before hehad much liberty or made much progress in the business.Still, in due time he was passed, first as a lay "preacher on trial,"and later called as fully qualified to preach at any chapel in thedistrict--this latter after a second year's activities and a "secondtrial sermon."When he once got on to this sermon-making line he took the best modelshe could find--men like John Wesley, George Whitefield, and, above all,C. G. Finney, who he could be certain had never sought in theirpreaching for human applause, but for the glory of God and the good ofsouls alone.In the Psalms, as in the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, we havethe most unmistakable guidance upon this subject, showing it to havebeen God's purpose so to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh that all Hispeople should be true prophets--not all, of course, of the same calibreor style, but all capable of warning and teaching, in all wisdom, everyone whom they could reach.The work of the ministry is another thing altogether. Let no one supposethat The Salvation Army at all underrates the "separation" unto His workof those whom God has chosen for entire devotion to some task, whateverit be. As to those whom we take away from their secular calling tobecome our Officers, I will only say here that we judge of their fitnessnot alone by their ability to speak, but by their having provedthemselves to be so devoted to the poor that we can rely upon theirreadiness to act as servants of the very neediest in any way that lieswithin their power. Only two persons at each of our Stations, theOfficers actually in command, receive any payment whatever from TheArmy. All the others associated with us, many of them wearing ouruniform and holding some particular office, give freely theirleisure-time and money to the work, and may be spoken of as "laypreachers."Our young "local preacher" generally spent his Sundays in some distantvillage where he had been appointed to preach, just as is the case inthese days with thousands of our Soldiers.     "My homeward walk, often alone through the dark, muddy fields and     lanes," he tells us, "would be enlivened by snatches of the songs     we had been singing in our Meetings, and late into the night people     might have heard my solitary prayers and praises. 'Don't sit up     singing till twelve o'clock after a hard day's work,' was one of     the first needed pieces of practical advice I got from my best     adviser of later years."     "But we never felt we could have too much of God's service and     praise, and scarcely regarded the grave itself as a terminus for     our usefulness; for in the case of a girl who had attended our     Cottage Meetings, and who had died of consumption, we lads     organised something very like one of our present-day Salvation Army     Funerals.     "Having ministered to the poor girl's necessities during her     sickness, comforted her in her last hours of pain, sung hymns of     triumph round her bed as her spirit took its passage to the skies,     we had the right, as her only friends, to order her funeral, and we     resolved to make the most of it for the good of her neighbours.     "Although it was in the depth of winter, and snow lay thick on the     ground, we brought the coffin out into the street, sang and prayed     around it, and urged the few neighbours who stood shivering by, or     listening at their doors and windows, to prepare for their dying     day. We then processioned to the Cholera Burial Ground, as the     cemetery in which the poorest of Nottingham were buried was called,     obtaining permission from the Chaplain to hold another little     Meeting by the grave-side, after he had read the ordinary Service.     I cannot but feel that the hand of God was upon me in those days,     teaching me how much lay preachers could do."How wonderful that the lad who did all that in the teeth of religiousconvention and opinion should have lived to organise just such battlesand just such funerals all round the world, and to train hundreds ofthousands of Soldiers of Christ to do likewise! What a termination tohis own career he was preparing all the time, when the City of Londonwas to suspend the traffic of many of its busiest thoroughfares forhours to let his coffin pass through with a procession of his uniformedSoldiers a mile long!With regard to the question of a "Call to the ministry," that bugbear ofso many souls, The General constantly expressed himself as follows:--     "How can anybody with spiritual eyesight talk of having no call,     when there are such multitudes around them who never hear a word     about God, and never intend to; who can never hear, indeed, without     the sort of preacher who will force himself upon them? Can a man     keep right in his own soul, who can see all that, and yet stand     waiting for a 'call' to preach? Would they wait so for a 'call' to     help any one to escape from a burning building, or to snatch a     sinking child from a watery grave?     "Does not growth in grace, or even ordinary growth of intelligence,     necessarily bring with it that deepened sense of eternal truths     which must intensify the conviction of duty to the perishing world?     "Does not an unselfish love, the love that goes out towards the     unloving, demand of a truly loving soul immediate action for the     Salvation of the unloved?"     "And, are there not persons who know that they possess special     gifts, such as robust health, natural eloquence or power of voice,     which specially make them responsible for doing something for     souls?     "And yet I do not at all forget, that above and beyond all these     things, there does come to some a special and direct call, which it     is peculiarly fatal to disregard, and peculiarly strengthening to     enjoy and act upon.     "I believe that there have been many eminently holy and useful men     who never had such a call; but that does not at all prevent any one     from asking God for it, or blessing Him for His special kindness     when He gives it."There is, I think, no doubt that God did give to young William Boothsuch a call, although he never spoke of it, perhaps lest he mightdiscourage any who, without enjoying any such manifestation, acted uponthe principles just referred to. At any rate, he battled through anyseason of doubt he had with regard to it, and came out into a certaintythat left him no room for question or fear.Chapter IVEarly MinistryWe cannot wonder that God Himself rarely seems to find it wise, even ifit be possible, to fit men for His most important enterprises in a fewyears, or by means of one simple process of instruction. Consider thediversity of men's minds and lives, and the varying currents of thoughtand opinion which are found in the various parts of the world atdifferent periods of even one century, and it will at once be seen howimpossible we should all immediately pronounce it to fit one man bymeans of one pathway of service to be the minister and leader of thefollowers of Christ in every part of the world.Christ Himself was kept in an obscurity we cannot penetrate for thirtyyears before He was made known to the comparatively small people amongstwhom all His time on earth was to be spent. Moses was not called till hewas eighty years old, having spent forty years amidst the splendours ofone of the grandest courts of the ancient world, and forty more amidstthe sheep on a desert border!How was the ardent English lad who came to serve in a London shop duringthe week, and to do the work of a lay preacher on Sundays, to be fittedto form and lead a great Christian Order of devotees out of everynation, and to instruct and direct them in helping their fellow-men ofevery race in every necessity that could arise? To prepare a man merelyto preach the Gospel a few years of service in that work might suffice;but then we should probably have seen a man merely interested in thenumbers of his own audiences and the effect produced upon them by hisown preaching.For William Booth a much more tedious and roundabout journey was needed.He must first of all preach his way up from the counter to the pulpit,and he must then have twenty years of varied experiences in ministerialservice amongst widely differing Churches, before he could be fit totake up his appointed place, outside all the Churches, to raise fromamongst every class a new force for the exaltation of Christ amongst allmen.For so great a work he must needs have a helpmeet, and he was to findher when she was still physically as weak and unlikely for the greattask as he was, and as entirely severed from all existing organisations.Catherine Mumford, like himself, innocent of any unkind feeling towardsher Church, had been excluded from it, simply because she would notpledge herself to keep entirely away from the Reform party.Unable really at the time to do more than teach a class in the SundaySchool, and occasionally visit a sick person, she nevertheless, by thefervour of her action, made herself a power that was felt, and threw allher influence on the side of any whole-hearted religious or temperanceeffort. The anxiety of both these two young people not to allow anythought for their own happiness to interfere with their duty to God andto their fellows delayed their marriage for years; and when they didmarry it was with the perfect resolve on both sides to make everythingin their own life and home subordinate to the great work to which theyhad given themselves.[Illustration: CATHERINE BOOTHBorn January 17th, 1829. Died October 4th, 1890.]Neither of them at the time dreamed of Mrs. Booth's speaking in public,much less that they were together to become the liberators of woman fromthe silence imposed on her by almost every organisation of Christ'sfollowers. Having known both of them intimately during the years inwhich The Salvation Army was being formed, I can positively contradictthe absurdly exaggerated statement that The General would have hadlittle or no success in life but for the talents and attractive ministryof Mrs. Booth. She was a helpmeet in the most perfect sense, never, evenwhen herself reduced to illness and helplessness, desiring to absorbeither time or attention that he could give to the great War in whichshe always encouraged him as no other ever could. Remaining to herlatest hour a woman of the tenderest and most modest character, sheshrank from public duty, and merely submitted so far as she felt"constrained," for Christ's sake, to association with anything that shewas convinced ought to be done to gain the ears of men for the Gospel,however contrary it might be to her own tastes and wishes. Perhaps hermost valuable contribution to the construction of The General's life washer ability to explain to him opinions and tastes differing widely fromhis own, and to sustain and defend his general defiance of the usualtraditions and customs of "society."His own feelings about it all he has described in these words:--     "The sensations of a new-comer to London from the country, are     always somewhat disagreeable, if he comes to work. The immensity of     the city must especially strike him as he crosses it for the first     time and passes through its different areas. The general turn-out     into a few great thoroughfares, on Saturday nights especially,     gives a sensation of enormous bulk. The manifest poverty of so many     in the most populous streets must appeal to any heart. The language     of the drinking crowds must needs give a rather worse than a true     impression of all.     "The crowding pressure and activity of so many must almost oppress     one not accustomed to it. The number of public-houses, theatres,     and music-halls must give a young enthusiast for Christ a sickening     impression. The enormous number of hawkers must also have given a     rather exaggerated idea of the poverty and cupidity which     nevertheless prevailed. The Churches in those days gave the very     uttermost idea of spiritual death and blindness to the existing     condition of things; at that time very few of them were open more     than one evening per week. There were no Young Men's or Young     Women's Christian Associations, no P.S.A.'s, no Brotherhoods, no     Central Missions, no extra effort to attract the attention of the     godless crowds; for miles there was not an announcement of anything     special in the religious line to be seen.     "To any one who cared to enter the places of worship, their     deathly contrast with the streets was even worse. The absence of     week-night services must have made any stranger despair of finding     even society or diversion. A Methodist sufficiently in earnest to     get inside to the 'class' would find a handful of people reluctant     to bear any witness to the power of God.     "Despite the many novelties introduced since those days, the     activities of the world being so much greater, the contrast must     look even more striking in our own time."Imagine a young man accustomed to daily labour for the poor, coming intosuch a world as that!Thought about what they sang and said in the private gatherings of theMethodist Societies could only deepen and intensify the feeling ofmonstrosity. They sang frequently:--    He taught me how to watch and pray,    And live rejoicing every day.But where were the rejoicing people? Where was there indeed anybody who,either in or out of a religious service, dared to express his joy in theLord--or wished to express anything. It was as if religious societieshad become wet blankets to suppress any approach to a hearty expressionof religious faith. Nevertheless, by God's grace, it all worked in thiscase not to crush but to infuriate and stir the new-comer to action.Preaching, under such circumstances, was a relief to such a soul, andnecessarily became more and more desperate.One hearing of William Booth was enough for Mr. Rabbits, a practical,go-ahead man, who had raised up out of the old-fashioned little businessof his forefathers one of the great "stores" of London, and who longedto see the same sort of development take place in connexion with theold-fashioned, perfectly correct, and yet all but lifeless institutionsthat professed to represent Jesus Christ the Saviour of the world. Hissense of the contrast between this preacher and others whom he knew wasproportionately rapid and acute. The effects produced on hearers werethe same at every turn.This living preaching was and is a perfect fit with all the rush of theworld outside, and the helplessness of the poor souls around.William Booth was, as we have seen, only seventeen when he was fullyrecognised as a preacher of the Gospel according to the custom of theMethodist Churches, and at nineteen his minister urged him to give uphis life to the ministry. At that time, however, he felt himself tooweak physically for a ministerial career, and in this view his doctorconcurred. So determined was he to accomplish his purpose, however, thathe begged the doctor not to express his opinion to the minister, but toallow the matter to stand over for a year. Unless a man with a nervoussystem like his was "framed like a bullock," and had "a chest like aprize-fighter," he would break down, said the physician, and seeing thathe was not so built, he would be "done for" in twelve months. The doctorwent to the grave very soon afterwards, whereas The General continuedpreaching for over sixty years after that pronouncement.At this period, some of the Wesleyans who were discontented with theirleaders in London broke into revolt, and there was so much bitterfeeling on both sides, that the main object of John Wesley--theexaltation of Christ for the Salvation of men--was for the moment almostlost sight of.Mr. Booth joined with the most earnest people he could find; but thoughthey gave him opportunity to hold Meetings, he wrote to one of his oldassociates:--     "How are you going on? I wish I knew you were happy, living to God     and working for Jesus.     "I preached on Sabbath last to a respectable but dull and lifeless     congregation. Notwithstanding this I had liberty in both prayer and     preaching. I had not any one to say 'Amen' or 'Praise the Lord'     during the whole of the service. I want some of you here with me in     the Prayer Meetings, and then we should carry all before us."Thus we see emerging from the obscurity of a poor home a conqueror,fired with one ambition, out of harmony with every then existingChristian organisation, because of that strange old feeling, so oftenexpressed in the Psalms of David, that the praises of God ought to beheard from all men's lips alike, and that everything else ought to giveway to His will and His pleasure.In speaking to his Officers later on he said:--     "When the great separation from the Wesleyan Church took place, Mr.     Rabbits said to me one day: 'You must leave business, and wholly     devote yourself to preaching the Gospel.'     "'Impossible,' I answered. 'There is no way for me. Nobody wants     me.' 'Yes,' said he, 'the people with whom you have allied yourself     want an evangelist.'     "'They cannot support me,' I replied; 'and I cannot live on air.'     "'That is true, no doubt,' was his answer. 'How much can you live     on?'     "I reckoned up carefully. I knew I should have to provide my own     quarters and to pay for my cooking; and as to the living itself, I     did not understand in those days how this could be managed in as     cheap a fashion as I do now. After a careful calculation, I told     him that I did not see how I could get along with less than twelve     shillings a week.     "'Nonsense,' he said; 'you cannot do with less than twenty     shillings a week, I am sure.'     "'All right,' I said, 'have it your own way, if you will; but where     is the twenty shillings to come from?'     "'I will supply it,' he said, 'for the first three months at     least.'     "'Very good,' I answered. And the bargain was struck there and     then.     "I at once gave notice to my master, who was very angry, and said,     'If it is money you want, that need not part us.' I told him that     money had nothing to do with the question, that all I wanted was     the opportunity to spend my life and powers in publishing the     Saviour to a lost world. And so I packed my portmanteau, and went     out to begin a new life.     "My first need was some place to lay my head. After a little time     spent in the search, I found quarters in the Walworth district,     where I expected to work, and took two rooms in the house of a     widow at five shillings a week, with attendance. This I reckoned at     the time was a pretty good bargain. I then went to a furniture     shop, and bought some chairs and a bed, and a few other     necessaries. I felt quite set up. It was my birthday, a Good     Friday, and on the same day I fell in love with my future wife.     "But the people would have nothing to do with me. They 'did not     want a parson.' They reckoned they were all parsons, so that at the     end of the three months' engagement the weekly income came to an     end; and, indeed, I would not have renewed the engagement on any     terms. There was nothing for me to do but to sell my furniture and     live on the proceeds, which did not supply me for a very long time.     I declare to you that at that time I was so fixed as not to know     which way to turn.     "In my emergency a remarkable way opened for me to enter college     and become a Congregational minister. But after long waiting,     several examinations, trial sermons and the like, I was informed     that on the completion of my training I should be expected to     believe and preach what is known as Calvinism. After reading a book     which fully explained the doctrine, I threw it at the wall opposite     me, and said I would sooner starve than preach such doctrine, one     special feature of which was that only a select few could be     saved.[A]     "My little stock of money was exhausted. I remember that I gave the     last sixpence I had in the world to a poor woman whose daughter lay     dying; but within a week I received a letter inviting me to the     charge of a Methodist Circuit in Lincolnshire, and from that     moment my difficulties of that kind became much less serious.     "The Spalding people welcomed me as though I had been an angel from     Heaven, providing me with every earthly blessing within their     ability, and proposing that I should stay with them for ever. They     wanted me to marry right away, offered to furnish me a house,     provide me with a horse to enable me more readily to get about the     country, and proposed other things that they thought would please     me.     "With them I spent perhaps the happiest eighteen months of my life.     Of course my horizon was much more limited in those days than it is     now, and consequently required less to fill it.     "Although I was only twenty-three years of age and Lincolnshire was     one of the counties that had been most privileged with able     Methodist preaching for half a century before, and I had to     immediately follow in Spalding a somewhat renowned minister, God     helped me very wonderfully to make myself at home, and become a     power amongst the people.     "I felt some nervousness when on my first November Sunday I was     confronted by such a large congregation as greeted me. In the     morning I had very little liberty; but good was done, as I     afterwards learned. In the afternoon we had a Prayer, or     After-Meeting, at which one young woman wept bitterly. I urged her     to come to the communion rail at night. She did so, and the Lord     saved her. She afterwards sent me a letter thanking me for urging     her to come out. In the evening I had great liberty, and fourteen     men and women came to the communion rail; many, if not all, finding     the Saviour.     "On the Monday I preached there again. Four came forward, three of     whom professed to find Salvation. I exerted myself very much, felt     very deeply, and prayed very earnestly over an old man who had been     a backslider for seven years. He wept bitterly, and prayed to the     Lord to save him, if He could wash a heart as black as Hell. By     exerting myself so much I made myself very ill, and was confined to     the house during the rest of the week. My host and hostess were     very kind to me.     "The next Sunday I started from home rather unwell. I had to go to     Donnington, some miles away, in the morning and evening, and to     Swineshead Bridge in the afternoon.     "But at night God helped me to preach in such a way that many came     out, and fourteen names were taken of those who really seemed     satisfactory. It was, indeed, a melting, moving time.     "I was kneeling, talking to a Penitent, when somebody touched me on     the shoulder, and said, 'Here is a lady who has come to seek     Salvation. Her son came to hear you at Spalding, and was induced to     seek the Saviour, and now she has come to hear you, and she wants     Salvation, too." The Lord had mercy upon her, and she went away     rejoicing.     "At Swineshead Bridge--the very name gives some idea of the utterly     rural character of the population--I was to preach on three     successive evenings, in the hope of promoting a Revival there. Many     things seemed to be against the project; but the Lord was for us.     Two people came out on the Monday evening, and God saved them both.     This raised our faith and cheered our spirits, especially as we     knew that several more souls were in distress.     "On the Tuesday the congregation was better. The news had spread     that the Lord was saving, and that seldom fails to bring a crowd     wherever it may be. That evening the word was with power, and six     souls cried for mercy. At the earnest solicitations of the people,     I decided to stay the remainder of the week, and urged them to pray     earnestly, with the result that many more sought and found     Salvation, and the little Society was nearly doubled.     "On the Saturday, just before I started home on the omnibus, a     plain, unsophisticated Christian came and said, 'O sir, let me have     hold of your hand.' When he had seized it between both his, with     tears streaming down his face, he said, 'Glory be to God that ever     you came here. My wife before her conversion was a cruel     persecutor, and a sharp thorn in my side. She would go home from     the Prayer Meeting before me, and as full of the Devil as possible;     she would oppose and revile me; but now, sir, she is just the     contrary, and my house, instead of being a little Hell has become a     little Paradise.' This was only one of a number of cases in which     husbands rejoiced over wives, and wives over husbands, for whom     they had long prayed, being saved.     "I shall always remember with pleasure the week I spent at     Swineshead Bridge, because I prayed more and preached with more of     the spirit of expectation and faith, and then saw more success     than in any previous week of my life. I dwell upon it as, perhaps,     the week which most effectually settled my conviction for ever that     it was God's purpose by my using the simplest means to bring souls     into liberty, and to break into the cold and formal state of things     to which His people only too readily settle down."For the sake of readers who have never seen Meetings such as The Generalfor so many years conducted, it seems at once necessary to explain whatis meant by the terms "seeking mercy" or "Salvation," the "cries formercy," and, above all, the "Mercy-Seat," or "Penitent-Form," whichappear so constantly in all reports of his work.From the first beginnings of his Cottage Meetings as a lad inNottingham, he always aimed at leading every sinner to repentance, andhe always required that repentance should be openly manifested by thePenitent coming out in the presence of others, to kneel before God, toconfess to Him, and to seek His pardon.This is merely in accordance with the ancient customs practised by theJews in their Temple, to which practice Jesus Christ so strikingly callsattention in His Parable of the Publican, who cried, "God be merciful tome a sinner." The Psalms of David abound with just such cries fordeliverance, and with declarations that God heard and answered all thosewho so cried to Him in the anguish of their guilt.The General was never blind to the fact that open acts of contritionlike this may be feigned, or produced by a mere passing excitement; buthaving seen so much of the indifference with which men generallycontinue in sin, even when they admit their consciousness of guilt anddanger, he always thought the risk of undue excitement, or too hastyaction, comparatively small.The "Penitent-Form" of The Salvation Army is simply a form or a row ofseats, immediately in front of the platform, at which all who wish toseek Salvation are invited to kneel, as a public demonstration of theirresolution to abandon their sins, and to live henceforth to please God.Those who kneel there are urged to pray for God's forgiveness, and whenthey believe that He does forgive them to thank Him for doing so. Whilstkneeling there they are spoken to by persons who, having passed throughthe same experience, can point out to them the evils and dangers theymust henceforth avoid, and the first duties which a true repentance mustdemand of them.There are many cases, for example, in which the Penitent is urged togive up at once some worldly habit or companionship, or to makeconfession of, and restitution for, some wrong done to others. AnOfficer or Soldier accompanies the Penitent to his home or to hisemployer, should such a course appear likely to help him to effect anyreconciliation, or take any other step to which his conscience callshim. The names and addresses of all Penitents are recorded, so that theymay be afterwards visited and helped to carry out the promises they havemade to God.For convenience' sake, in very large Meetings, such as those The Generalhimself held, where hundreds at a time come to the Penitent-Form, a roomcalled the Registration Room is used for the making of the necessaryinquiries and records. In this room those who decide to join The Armyhave a small piece of ribbon of The Army's colours at once attached totheir coats. But this Registration Room must in no way be confused withan "Inquiry Room," where seeking souls can go aside unseen. The Generalwas always extremely opposed to the use of any plan other than that ofthe Penitent-Form, lest there should be any distinction made between oneclass and another, or an easier path contrived for those who wish toavoid a bold avowal of Christ.And he always refused to allow any such use of the Bible in connexionwith Penitents as has been usual in Inquiry Rooms, where the people havebeen taught that if they only believed the words of some text, all wouldbe well with them. The faith to which The General desired all who cameto the Penitent-Form to be led is not the mere belief of some statement,but that confidence in God's faithfulness to all His promises, whichbrings peace to the soul.Nothing could be more unjust than the representation that by the use ofthe Penitent-Form an attempt is made to work up excitement, or emotion.Experience has proved, everywhere, that nothing tends so rapidly toallay the painful anxiety of a soul, hesitating before the greatdecision, as the opportunity to take at once, and publicly, a decisivestep. We often sing:--    Only a step, only a step,    Why not take it now?    Come, and thy sins confessing,    Thou shalt receive a blessing;    Do not reject the mercy    So freely offered thee.But the Penitent-Form is no modern invention, nor can it be claimed asthe speciality of any set of religionists. Even heathen people in pastages have provided similar opportunities for those who felt a specialneed either to thank their God for blessings received, or to seek Hishelp in any specific case, to come forward in an open way, and confesstheir wants, their confidence, or their gratitude, at some altar orshrine.Shame upon us all that objection should ever be made to equally publicavowals of penitence, of submission, of faith, or of devotion to theSaviour of the world. The General, at any rate, never wavered indemanding the most speedy and decisive action of this kind, and heprobably led more souls to the Penitent-Form than any man who has everlived.In Germany especially it has frequently been objected that the soulwhich is "compelled" to take a certain course has in that very factmanifested a debased and partly-destroyed condition, and that nothingcan excuse the organisation of methods of compulsion. With any suchtheory one could not but have considerable sympathy, were it not for theundeniable fact that almost all "civilised" people are perpetually underthe extreme pressure of society around them, which is opposed toprayer, or to any movement of the soul in that direction.To check and overcome that very palpable compulsion on the wrong side,the most desperate action of God's servants in all ages has never beenfound strong enough. Hence there has come about another sort ofcompulsion, within the souls of all God's messengers. It could not butbe more agreeable to flesh and blood if the minds of men could moreeasily be induced to turn from the things that are seen to those whichare invisible. But this has never yet been the case. Hence all whoreally hear God's voice cannot but become alarmed as to the manifestdanger that His warnings may remain entirely unheeded. When once anysoul is truly enlightened, it cannot but put forth every devisableeffort to compel the attention of others.The Army is only the complete organisation of such efforts for permanentefficiency. We may have had to use more extreme methods than many beforeus, because, unlike those who are the publicly recognised advocates ofChrist, we have, in the first instance, no regular hearers at all, andhave generally only the ear of the people so long as we can retain it,against a hundred competitions. And yet, to those who live near enoughto notice it, the exercise of force by means of church steeples andbells is far more violent, all the year round, than the utmost attack ofthe average Corps upon some few occasions.Who complains of the compulsion of railway servants, who by bell, flag,and whistle, glaring announcements, or in any other way, urge desiringpassengers to get into their train, before it is too late? Wherever atrue faith in the Gospel exists, The General's organisation ofcompulsory plans for the Salvation of souls will not only be approved,but regarded as one of the great glories of his life.The "Will you go?" of The Army, wherever its songs are heard, has everbeen more than a kindly invitation. It has been an urging to whichmillions of undecided souls will for ever owe their deliverance from thedilatory and hindering influences around them, into an earnest starttowards a heavenly life.That is why The General taught so many millions to sing, in their variedlanguages, his own song:--    O boundless Salvation! deep ocean of love,    O fulness of mercy Christ brought from above!    The whole world redeeming, so rich and so free,    Now flowing for all men--come, roll over me!    My sins they are many, their stains are so deep,    And bitter the tears of remorse that I weep;    But useless is weeping, thou great crimson sea,    Thy waters can cleanse me, come, roll over me!    My tempers are fitful, my passions are strong.    They bind my poor soul, and they force me to wrong;    Beneath thy blest billows deliverance I see,    Oh, come, mighty ocean, and roll over me!    Now tossed with temptation, then haunted with fears,    My life has been joyless and useless for years;    I feel something better most surely would be,    If once thy pure waters would roll over me.    O ocean of mercy, oft longing I've stood    On the brink of thy wonderful, life-giving flood!    Once more I have reached this soul-cleansing sea,    I will not go back till it rolls over me.    The tide is now flowing, I'm touching the wave,    I hear the loud call of "The Mighty to Save";    My faith's growing bolder--delivered I'll be--    I plunge 'neath the waters, they roll over me.    And now, Hallelujah! the rest of my days    Shall gladly be spent in promoting His praise    Who opened His bosom to pour out this sea    Of boundless Salvation for you and for me.Chapter VFight Against FormalityThe Army's invariable principle of avoiding even the appearance ofattacking any other association of religionists, or their ideas orpractices, renders it difficult to explain fully either why WilliamBooth became the regular minister of a church, or why he gave up thatposition; and yet he has himself told us sufficient to demonstrate atone stroke not only the entire absence of hostility in his mind, but theabsolute separateness of his way of thinking from that which sogenerally prevails.The enthusiastic welcome given to The General wherever he went, by theclergy of almost every Church indicates that he had generally convincedthem that he had no thought of attacking them or their Churches, evenwhen he most heartily expressed his thankfulness to God for having beenable to escape from all those trammels of tradition and form which wouldhave made his great life-work, for all nations, impossible. And I thinkthere are few who would nowadays question that his life, teaching, andexample all tended greatly to modify many of the Church formalities ofthe past.     "Just before leaving Lincolnshire," he says, "I had been lifted up     to a higher plane of the daily round of my beloved work than I had     experienced before. Oh, the stagnation into which I had settled     down, the contentment of my mind with the love offered me at every     turn by the people! I still aimed at the Salvation of the     unconverted and the spiritual advance of my people, and still     fought for these results. Indeed, I never fell below that. And yet     if the After-Meeting was well attended, and if one or two Penitents     responded, I was content, and satisfied myself with that hackneyed     excuse for so much unfruitful work, that I had 'sown the seed.'     Having cast my bread on the waters, I persuaded myself that I must     hope for its being found by and by.     "But I heard of a Rev. Richard Poole who was moving about the     country, and the stories told me of the results attending his     services had aroused in me memories of the years gone by, when I     thought little and cared less about the acceptability of my own     performances, so long as I could drag the people from the jaws of     Hell.     "I resolved to go and hear him. I found him at the house of a     friend before the Meeting, comparatively quiet. How I watched him!     But when I had heard him preach from the text, 'Said I not unto     thee, that if thou wouldst believe, thou shouldst see the salvation     of God,' and had observed the blessed results, I went to my own     chamber--I remember that it was over a baker's shop--and resolved     that, regardless of man's opinions, and my own gain or position, I     would ever seek the one thing.     "Whilst kneeling in that room, there came into my soul a fresh     realisation of the greatness of the opportunity before me of     leading men and women out of their miseries and their sin, and of     my responsibility to go in for that with all my might. In obedience     to the heavenly vision, I made a consecration of the present and     future, of all I had, and hoped to have, to the fulfilment of this     mission, and I believe God accepted the offering.     "I continued my public efforts in line with my new experience."Happily and freely as William Booth had been allowed to lead his people,however, he and his intended wife both saw that there could be nopermanent prospect of victory amongst these "Reformers." The verypopularity of a preacher was sure to lead to contention about the sphereof his labours.     "The people," he writes, "with whom I had come into union were     sorely unorganised, and I could not approve of the ultra-radicalism     that prevailed. Consequently, I looked about for a Church nearer my     notions of system and order, and in the one I chose, the Methodist     New Connexion, I found a people who were, in those days, all I     could desire, and who received me with as much heartiness as my     Lincolnshire friends had done.     "Ignorance has different effects on different people. Some it puffs     up with self-satisfaction. To others it is a source of mortifying     regret. I belonged to the latter class. I was continually crying     out, 'O God, how little I am, and how little I know! Give me a     chance of acquiring information, and of learning how more     successfully to conduct this all-important business of saving men     to which Thou hast called me, and which lies so near my heart.'     "To gratify this yearning for improvement, the Church with which I     had come into union gave me, at my request, an opportunity of     studying under a then rather celebrated theologian. But instead of     better qualifying me for the work of saving men, by imparting to me     the knowledge necessary for the task, and showing me in every-day     practice how to put it to practical use, I was set to study Latin,     Greek, various Sciences, and other subjects, which, as I saw at a     glance, could little help me in the all-important work that lay     before me. However, I set to work, and, with all the powers I had,     commenced to wrestle with my studies.     "My Professor was a man of beautiful disposition, and had an     imposing presence. The books he wrote on abstract and difficult     theological problems were highly prized in those days. Moreover, he     belonged to a class of preachers, not altogether unknown to-day,     who have a real love for that order of preaching which convicts and     converts the soul, although unable to practise it themselves. _He     knew a good thing when he saw it_.     "The first time he heard me preach was on a Sunday evening. I saw     him seated before me, at the end of the church. I knew he was going     to judge me, and I realised that my future standing in his     estimation, as well as my position in the Society I had now made my     home, would probably very much depend on the judgment he formed of     me on that occasion.     "I am not ashamed to say that I wanted to stand well with him. I     knew also that my simple, practical style was altogether different     from his own, and from that of the overwhelming majority of the     preachers he was accustomed to approve. But my mind was made up. I     had no idea of altering my aim or style to please him, the world,     or the Devil.     "I saw dying souls before me, the gates of Heaven wide open on the     one hand, and the gates of Hell open on the other, while I saw     Jesus Christ with His arms open between the two, crying out to all     to come and be saved. My whole soul was in favour of doing what it     could to second the invitation of my Lord, and doing it that very     night.     "I cannot now remember much about the service, except the sight of     my Professor, with his family around him, a proud, worldly daughter     sitting at his side. I can remember, however, that in my desire to     impress the people with the fact that they could have Salvation     there and then, if they would seek it, and, to illustrate their     condition, I described a wreck on the ocean, with the affrighted     people clinging to the masts between life and death, waving a flag     of distress to those on shore, and, in response, the life-boat     going off to the rescue. And then I can remember how I reminded my     hearers that they had suffered shipwreck on the ocean of time     through their sins and rebellion; that they were sinking down to     destruction, but that if they would only hoist the signal of     distress Jesus Christ would send off the life-boat to their rescue.     Then, jumping on the seat at the back of the pulpit, I waved my     pocket-handkerchief round and round my head to represent the signal     of distress I wanted them to hoist, and closed with an appeal to     those who wanted to be rescued to come at once, and in the presence     of the audience, to the front of the auditorium. That night     twenty-four knelt at the Saviour's feet, and one of them was the     proud daughter of my Professor.     "The next morning was the time for examination and criticism of the     previous day's work, and I had to appear before this Doctor of     Divinity. I entered the room with a fellow-student. He was put     through first. After listening to the Doctor's judgment on his     performance my turn came. I was not a little curious as to what his     opinion would be.     "'Well, Doctor,' I said, 'what have you to say to me? You heard me     last night. What is your judgment on my poor performance?'     "'My dear Sir,' he answered, 'I have only one thing to say to you,     and that is, go on in the way you have begun, and God will bless     you.'     "But other difficulties were not far away, for I had hardly settled     down to my studies before I got into a red-hot Revival in a small     London church where a remarkable work was done. In an account of     this effort my name appeared in the church's Magazine, and I was     invited to conduct special efforts in other parts of the country.     This, I must confess, completely upset my plans once more, and I     have not been able to find heart or time for either Greek or Latin     from that day to this."How sincerely this curious student longed for improvement is manifestedin the following entry in his Journal, written, I presume, on a Mondaymorning when it was thought that some relaxation of his studiesfollowing a Sunday's services would be advantageous:--     "Monday.--Visited the British Museum. Walked up and down there     praying that God would enable me to acquire knowledge to increase     my power of usefulness."Who will doubt that that Museum prayer was heard and answered?The Church he had joined was governed by an annual assembly, called theConference, at which candidates for the ministry were accepted into it,and were appointed to some sphere of labour called a Circuit. Justbefore the Conference met he was astonished to hear that it was proposedto appoint him as Superintendent of a London Circuit. He was able topersuade the authorities concerned to alter this intention on the groundof his comparative lack of experience, although he expressed hiswillingness to take the post of assistant minister under whomsoever theConference might appoint as Superintendent.In due course, the appointment was made, and he found himself assistantto a Superintendent who, he tells us, was "stiff, hard, and cold, makingup, in part, for the want of heart and thought in his publicperformances by what sounded like a sanctimonious wail."This gentleman strongly objected when, as a result of the reports of Mr.Booth's services appearing in the Press, he was urgently invited tovisit other places, as he had visited Guernsey. The Conferenceauthorities, however, prevailed, and insisted, in the general interest,upon his place in London being taken by another preacher, and hisservices being utilised wherever called for.It was thus by no choice of his own, but by the arrangement of hisChurch, that Mr. Booth, instead of remaining tied down to the ordinaryroutine of pastoral life, was sent for some time from place to place toconduct such evangelising Campaigns as his soul delighted in. Who candoubt that God's hand was in this disposal of his time? He was allowedto marry, though his young wife had to content herself with butoccasional brief spells of association with him.His Campaigns were really wonderful in their success. He would go for afortnight, or even less, to some city where the congregation haddwindled almost to nothing, and where one or two services a week,conducted in a very quiet and formal way, were maintained withdifficulty, owing to the indifference or hopelessness of both ministerand people. For the period of his stay all the usual programme would belaid aside, however, and he would be left free to carry out his ownplans of daily service.How remarkable to find him so completely carrying with him all who hadbeen accustomed to the old forms, and introducing, with the evidentsanction of the president and authorities of his Church, suchre-arrangements, records, and reorganisation as he desired.But the strange, the almost inexplicable thing is that, without his evenremarking upon it, all should go back to the old forms the moment hisCampaign ended!What is not at all strange is that there should have grown up within theChurch a strong opposition to him, so that, at the end of two and a halfyears, a majority of the Conference voted against his continuing theseCampaigns, and required him to resume the ordinary routine of theministry. Surely, any one might have foreseen that unless the old formscould be altered in favour of the new regime, the leader of this warfaremust submit to the old routine. True, he might try to carry out in hisCircuit, to the utmost of his power, his ideas of free and dailywarfare; but, unless all who were under him in the various places whichconstituted a Methodist Circuit would constantly agree and co-operate,no one man could prevent the old forms from prevailing.But William Booth was no revolutionist, and his willingness andsubmission to carry on the old routine, with little alteration, for foursuccessive years surely proved that no desire for personal exaltation ormastery, but only the conquest of souls, was his guiding influence.In those four years, spent in Brighouse and Gateshead, he tried tointroduce into the churches as much as he could of the life of warfarewhich he considered necessary. In one year he so far won over theofficialdom of Brighouse that they desired his reappointment; whilst inGateshead he so transformed the Circuit that before many weeks hadpassed the Central Chapel, which had hitherto borne the dignified butcool-sounding name of "Bethesda," was dubbed by the mechanics, whoformed the bulk of the surrounding population, "The Converting Shop."To those iron workers, accustomed daily to see masses of metal suddenlychanged, whilst in a red-hot state, into any desired form by the actionof powerful machinery, set up for the purpose, such a name was bothintelligible and expressive.It, moreover, accorded with the new pastor's idea of the properutilisation of any building devoted to the worship of Jesus Christ.There ought to be felt there, he thought, that marvellous heat of DivineLove which was implied in Christ's engagement to "baptise" all Hisfollowers "with fire," and the services should above all else, be suchas would ensure the immediate conversion to God of all who came undertheir influence.But in Gateshead The General was to discover the most potent force thatcould be brought to bear upon all these questions, in the liberation ofMrs. Booth from the customary silence which Church system has almostuniversally imposed upon woman. It might almost be said that the wholeproblem of cold formality, as against loving warmth, can be solved bywoman's liberation. True, in the ordinary state of things, the mostexcellent ladies of any church become its most conservative bulwarks;and, fortified, as they imagine, by a few words in one of St. Paul'sEpistles, such ladies can oppose every new spiritual force as powerfullyas some of them opposed him in Antioch, nineteen hundred years ago. But"daughters" of God who have been liberated by His Spirit generally makeshort work of any continued opposition.Mrs. Booth, herself trained and hitherto fettered by this old school ofsilence, to the astonishment of every one prayed in the church on thefirst Sunday evening in Gateshead. The opposition of an influentialpastor, in a neighbouring city, to the public ministrations of a Mrs.Palmer, a visitor from the United States, very soon afterwards led Mrs.Booth to defend her sister's action in the Press, and thus to see moreclearly than before what God could do through her, if she was willing.The General had not yet seen the importance of this advance, and, inview of his wife's delicate health, had not pressed her into any sort ofactivity, much as he had valued her perfect fellowship with him inprivate. But he rejoiced, of course, in her every forward step, and whenshe not only visited a street of the most godless and drunken people inthe neighbourhood, but began to speak in the services, he gave her allthe weight of his official as well as his personal sanction, littleimagining at the time what a mighty force for the spread of the truth hewas thus enlisting.After faithfully serving the Church in Gateshead for three years, hefound the Conference no more willing than before to release him for theevangelistic work which now both he and his wife more and more longedfor.The final scene, when, in a Conference at Liverpool, Mrs. Boothconfirmed The General's resolution to refuse to continue even for onemore year his submission to form, by calling out "Never!" marked a stagein his career which was decisive in a startling way as to the whole ofhis future.     "It is true that I had a wonderful sphere of usefulness and     happiness," says The General; "but I was not contented. I had many     reasons for dissatisfaction. I was cribbed, cabined, and confined     by a body of cold, hard usages, and still colder and harder people.     I desired freedom! I felt I was called to a different sphere of     labour. I wanted liberty to move forward in it. So when the     Conference definitely declined my request to set me free for     evangelistic work I bade them farewell.     "It was a heart-breaking business. Here was a great crowd of people     all over the land who loved me and my dear wife. I felt a deep     regard for them, and to leave them was a sorrow beyond description.     But I felt I must follow what appeared to be the beckoning finger     of my Lord. So, with my wife and four little children, I left my     quarters and went out into the world once more, trusting in God,     literally not knowing who would give me a shilling, or what to do     or where to go.     "All my earthly friends thought I was mistaken in this action; some     of them deemed me mad. I confess that it was one of the most     perplexing steps of my life. When I took it every avenue seemed     closed against me. There was one thing I could do, however, and     that was to trust in God, and wait for His Salvation."The difficulty of the Church was really insurmountable at that time.Since those days most of the Protestant Churches have learnt thatevangelistic work is just as essential as the ordinary pastoralministrations.The fact is, that neither the Booths nor the Church were then aware thatGod, behind all their perplexities, was working out a plan of His own.Who laments that separation to-day? As the evangelists of any Churchthey could not possibly have become to so large an extent theevangelists of all.Chapter VIRevivalismNot many days passed after William Booth's retirement from the ministryof the Methodist New Connexion before his faith was rewarded by a warminvitation to a small place at the other end of the country. One of hisformer Converts was a minister in the little seaport Hayle, in Cornwall,and he sent the call, "Come over and help us."The Church had got into the stagnant condition which is so commonlyexperienced wherever contentment with routine long holds sway. Mr. andMrs. Booth were not only welcomed, but given a free hand to take anycourse they pleased to fill the building with hearers, and to securetheir Salvation.Fighting now together, as they had learnt to do at Gateshead, they sawresults more rapid and striking than they had ever known before,although they found themselves face to face with a population moredisinclined for novelty, and especially for the novelties theyintroduced, than any they had before had to deal with. The General thusdescribed at the time for the Connexional Magazine some of his firstbattles in Cornwall:--     "Hayle, Cornwall.     "When in London, you requested me to send now and then a report of     the Lord's working in connexion with my ministry, and thinking that     the following account of the Revival now in progress here will be     interesting to you, I forward it. We arrived here on the 10th     inst., and commenced labour on the following Sabbath. The chapel     was crowded. Gracious influences accompanied the word. Many     appeared to be deeply convicted of sin, but no decided cases of     conversion took place that day. On Monday afternoon we had a     service for Christians, and spoke on the hindrances to Christian     labour and Christian joy. Evening, chapel crowded. Very solemn     season. Nearly all the congregation stayed to the Prayer Meeting     that followed, and many appeared deeply affected, but refused to     seek the mercy of God. A strong prejudice prevails here against the     custom of inviting anxious inquirers to any particular part of the     building. The friends told me that this plan never had succeeded in     Cornwall; but I thought it the best, considering the crowded state     of the chapel, and therefore determined to try it. I gave a short     address, and again invited those who wished to decide for Christ to     come forward. After waiting a minute or two, the solemn silence was     broken by the cries of a woman who at once left her pew, and fell     down at the Mercy-Seat, and became the first-fruits of what I trust     will be a glorious harvest of immortal souls. She was quickly     followed by others, when a scene ensued beyond description. The     cries and groans were piercing in the extreme; and when the     stricken spirits apprehended Jesus as their Saviour, the shouts of     praise and thanksgiving were in proportion to the previous sorrow.     "Tuesday Evening.--Congregation again large. Prayer Meeting similar     to Monday night, and some very blessed cases of conversion.     "Wednesday.--Chapel full. Mrs. Booth spoke with much influence and     power. Glorious Prayer Meeting. An old woman who found the Saviour     jumped on her feet, and shouted, with her face beaming with     heavenly radiance, 'He's saved me! Glory to God! He's saved me, an     old sinner, sixty-three. Glory to God!' Other cases of great     interest transpired, and the people, with swimming eyes, and     glowing hearts, sang--     "'Praise God, from whom all blessings flow.'     "Thursday.--Preached from 'Him that cometh to Me I will in nowise     cast out.' Had a blessed Meeting. A woman who had herself found     Jesus during the week, pointed me to her husband. Found him fully     enlightened and deeply convicted. I urged him to immediate decision     and the full surrender of himself to God. He came out, and fell     down among the Penitents. He remained there about an hour. The     Meeting could not be concluded until near eleven o'clock, and many     were very reluctant to retire even then.     "Friday.--The first thing this morning my host informed me that he     had just heard of a mason who had been at the services every night,     and who had resolved to stop work until he found the Lord. Soon     after a young lady came in to tell us of a woman who had found     peace during the night. At the family altar this morning, a woman     in the employ of the gentleman with whom we are staying commenced     to bemoan her sinful condition and to cry for mercy. I asked her to     remain, and pointed her to Jesus, and she soon found rest through     believing. In the afternoon, met several anxious persons for prayer     and conversation. In the evening we had announced a public Prayer     Meeting. Before we reached the chapel we could hear the cries and     prayers of those already assembled. On entering, we found a strong     man praising God at the top of his voice for hearing his prayer and     pardoning his sins. It was the mason. He had been under deep     concern for three days; had not slept at all the night before, but     after a day's agony, he had found Jesus; and such tumultuous,     rapturous joy I think I never witnessed. Again and again, during     the evening, he broke out with a voice that drowned all others, and     rose above our songs of praise ascribing glory to Jesus for what He     had done for his soul. There were many other cases of almost equal     interest. The Meeting was not closed until eleven.     "About midnight, the Rev. J. Shone, the minister in charge of the     church, was called out to visit a woman who was in great distress.     He afterwards described her agony in seeking, and her joy in     finding, the Lord, together with the sympathy and exultation of her     friends with her, as one of the most thrilling scenes he ever     witnessed."In a later report The General wrote:--     "Hayle, Cornwall.     "The work of the Lord here goes on gloriously. The services have     progressed with increasing power and success, and now the whole     neighbourhood is moved. Conversion is the topic of conversation in     all sorts of society. Every night, crowds are unable to gain     admission to the sanctuary. The oldest man in the church cannot     remember any religious movement of equal power. During the second     week, the Wesleyans opened a large room for united Prayer Meetings     at noon; since then, by their invitation, we have on several     occasions spoken in their chapels to densely crowded audiences;     services being simultaneously conducted in the chapel where the     movement originally commenced. One remarkable and gratifying     feature of the work is the large number of men who are found every     night amongst those who are anxious. Never have I seen so many men     at the same time smiting their breasts, and crying, 'God be     merciful to me a sinner,' Strong men, old men, young men, weeping     like children, broken-hearted on account of their sins. A number of     these are sailors, and scarcely a ship has gone out of this port     the last few days without taking among its crew one or more souls     newly-born for Heaven."Can it be believed that just such victories as these led to the closingof almost all the Churches against him?     "In these days," The General has more recently written, "it has     become almost the fashion for the Churches to hold yearly 'revival'     or 'special' services, but forty years ago they were as unanimously     opposed to anything of the kind, and compelled me to gain outside     every Church organisation the one liberty I desired--to seek and     save the lost ones, who never enter any place of worship whatever.     "Let nobody suppose that I cherish any resentment against any of     the Churches on account of their former treatment of me, or that I     have a desire to throw a stone at any of them. From any such     feelings I believe that God has most mercifully preserved me all my     life, and I rejoice in the kindness on this account with which they     load me now in every land, as testimonies to that fact.     "But I want to make it clear to readers in lands far away from     Christendom why I was driven into the formation of an Organisation     entirely outside every Christian Church in order to accomplish my     object, and why my people everywhere, whilst having no more desire     than myself to come into dispute, or even discussion, with any     Church near them, must needs act as independently of them all as I     have done, no matter how friendly they may now be to us.     "Nothing could be more charming than the present attitude towards     us of every religious community in the United States, from the     Roman Catholics, whose Archbishop has publicly commended us, to the     Mormons, who are generally regarded as enemies of all Christianity,     and the Friends (commonly called Quakers) whose ideas of worship     seem to be at the uttermost extreme from ours. All are satisfied     that I and my people are not wishful to find fault with any     religious body whatever, but to spend all our time and energy in     combating the great evils of godlessness and selfishness which     threaten to sweep away all the people everywhere from any thought     above material things.     "Yet we have had to forbid our people to accept too often the     pressing invitations that pour upon them from all sides to hold     Meetings in Church buildings, lest they should lose touch with the     masses outside, and begin to be content with audiences of admirers.     "The thirty-six years of my life whilst I was groping about in vain     for a home and fellowship amongst Churches gave me to understand,     as only experience can, what are the thoughts and feelings of the     millions in Christian lands, who not only never enter a church, but     who feel it to be inconceivable that they ever should do so.     "If this experience has been invaluable to us in Christian lands,     how much more so is it in the far vaster countries of Asia and     Africa, where our work is only as yet in its beginnings. When I     went to Japan, the entire missionary community everywhere united to     uphold me as the exemplar of true Christlike action for the good of     all men. But the leaders of all the five sects of Buddhism were no     less unanimous in their welcome to me, or in their expressions of     prayerful desire for the success of my work.     "In India and Africa I have repeatedly seen supporting me in my     indoor and outdoor demonstrations the leaders of the Hindu, Parsee,     Sikh, Buddhist, Jewish, and Mohammedan communities, who had never     met with the Christians in so friendly a way before. I cannot think     this would have been the case had I ever become settled amongst any     Christian body in this country.     "Can any one wonder then that I see in all the unpleasant     experiences of my early days the hand of God Himself, leading me by     a way that I knew not--that I could scarcely believe indeed at the     time to be His way. Why should it have been so difficult for a man,     who only wished to lead the lost ones to the great Shepherd who     seeks them all to get or to remain within any existing fold, if it     was not that there lay before me and my Soldiers conquests     infinitely greater and more important than had ever yet been made?     "Oh, with what impatience I turn from the very thought of any of     the squabbles of Christian sects when I see all around me the     millions who want to avoid any thought of their great Friend and     Father, and of the coming Judge before whom we must all, perhaps     this very day, appear."How easily excuses, which sound most plausible, are found for every sortof negligence in the service of God--indeed, for not serving Him at all!"It is not my way, you see," says some one, who does not like to makeany open profession of interest in Jesus Christ, as though our ownpreferences or opinions were to be the governing consideration in allthat affects the interests of "our Lord"!The General has proved that the old ideas connected with "the Master"can not only be revived but acted up to in our day, and the sense ofshame for idle excuses drive out all the paltry pleas set up forindifference to the general ruin."At this season, nothing can be done" is as coolly pleaded to-day as if"in season, out of season" had never been written in our DivineOrder-Book.How often our forces in the midst of fairs, and race-days, and "slacktimes," have demonstrated that real soldiers of Christ can snatchvictory, just when all around seems to ensure their defeat!When The General began to form his Army, it was ordinarily assumed as asettled principle that Open-Air Work could only be done in fine weather,and the theory is still existent in many quarters. As if the comfort andconvenience of "the workers," and not the danger and misery of thepeople, were to fix the times of such effort!"But the people will not come," is even now pleaded as an excuse for theomission or abandonment of any imaginable attempt to do good. As if thepeople's general disinclination for anything that has to do with Godwere not the precise reason for His wish to "send out" His servants!"Such a plan would never succeed here," is an almost invariable excusemade for not undertaking anything new. The General was never blind todifferences between this and that locality and population. But heinsisted that no plan that could be devised by those on any given spot,and especially no plan that has manifestly been blessed and used by Godelsewhere should be dismissed without proper, earnest trial."But that has never been done, or has never done well here," seemed tohim rather a reason for trying it with, perhaps, some littlemodification than for leaving a plan untried. The inexorable law towhich he insisted that everything should bend was that nothing canexcuse inactivity and want of enterprise where souls are perishing. Andhe was spared to see even Governments beginning to recognise that it isinexcusable to let sin triumph in "a Christian country." He proved thatit was possible to raise up "Christian Soldiers," who would not onlysing, or hear singing, in beautiful melody about "Marching, onward as toWar"; but who would really do it, even when, it led to real battle.Chapter VIIEast London BeginningWhat were Mr. and Mrs. Booth to do? They were excluded from most of theChurches in which during the last twenty years they had led so manysouls to Christ. They found themselves out of harmony with most of theundenominational evangelists of the day, and, moreover, they hadexperienced throughout even the brightest of their past years a gnawingdissatisfaction with much of their work, which The General thusdescribed in the preface to his book, _In Darkest England, and the WayOut_:--     "All the way through my career I have keenly felt the remedial     measures usually enumerated in Christian programmes, and ordinarily     employed by Christian philanthropy, to be lamentably inadequate for     any effectual dealing with the despairing miseries of the outcast     classes. The rescued are appallingly few, a ghastly minority     compared with the multitudes who struggle and sink in the     open-mouthed abyss. Alike, therefore, my humanity and my     Christianity, if I may speak of them as in any way separate from     each other, have cried out for some comprehensive method of     reaching and saving the perishing crowds."The Booths had settled in a London home, finding that they must needshave some fixed resting-place for their children, and that abundantopportunities of one kind or another could be found for them both in themetropolis. But The General, who was "waiting upon God, and wonderingwhat would happen" to open his way to the unchurched masses, received aninvitation to undertake some services in a tent which had been erectedin an old burial-ground in Whitechapel, the expected missioner havingfallen ill! He consented, and he thus describes his experiences:--     "When I saw those masses of poor people, so many of them evidently     without God or hope in the world, and found that they so readily     and eagerly listened to me, following from Open-Air Meeting to     tent, and accepting, in many instances, my invitation to kneel at     the Saviour's feet there and then, my whole heart went out to them.     I walked back to our West-End home and said to my wife:--     "'O Kate, I have found my destiny! These are the people for whose     Salvation I have been longing all these years. As I passed by the     doors of the flaming gin-palaces to-night I seemed to hear a voice     sounding in my ears, "Where can you go and find such heathen as     these, and where is there so great a need for your labours?" And     there and then in my soul I offered myself and you and the children     up to this great work. Those people shall be our people, and they     shall have our God for their God.'"Mrs. Booth herself wrote:--     "I remember the emotion that this produced in my soul. I sat gazing     into the fire, and the Devil whispered to me, 'This means another     departure, another start in life!' The question of our support     constituted a serious difficulty. Hitherto we had been able to meet     our expenses out of the collections which we had made from our more     respectable audiences. But it was impossible to suppose that we     could do so among the poverty-stricken East-Enders--we were afraid     even to ask for a collection in such a locality.     "Nevertheless, I did not answer discouragingly. After a momentary     pause for thought and prayer, I replied, 'Well, if you feel you     ought to stay, stay. We have trusted the Lord _once_ for our     support, and we can trust Him _again_!'""That night," says The General, "The Salvation Army was born."Before long God moved the heart of one of the most benevolent men inEngland, Mr. Samuel Morley, to promise them his influence and supportwithout any condition but the continuance of the work thus begun. But noamount of monetary help could have placed The General in a position toestablish anything like the permanent work he desired. He writes:--     "I had hardly got successfully started on this new path before my     old experience of difficulty met me once more. On the third Sunday     morning, I think it was, we found the old tent which formed our     cathedral, blown down, and so damaged by the fall, as well as so     rotten, that it could not be put up again. Another tent was     impossible, as we had no money to buy one; so, as no suitable     building could be obtained, there was nothing for it but for us to     do our best out of doors.     "After a time we secured an old dancing-room for Sunday Meetings.     But, there being no seats in it, our Converts had to come at 4     o'clock on Sunday morning to bring the benches in, and work till     midnight, or later still, when the day's Meetings were over, to     move them out again. For our week-night Meetings we had hired an     old shed, formerly used to store rags in, and there we fought for     months."What a testimony to the character of the work already accomplished, andthe readiness of the little force already raised to toil like pioneersoldiers for the love of Christ!Most of the Converts of those days "had been forgiven much." Thefollowing letter from one of them may give some idea both of the natureof the work done, and the surrounding circumstances:--     "Dear Sir,--I have reason to bless the hour that God put the     thought into your head to open the Mission at the East-End of     London, for it has been the means of making me and my family happy     in the love of Christ; it has turned me from a drunkard,     blasphemer, and liar, to a true believing Christian. At the age of     thirteen, I went as a waiter-boy in a public-house, where I     remained until I was sixteen. Here I learned to love the flavour of     drink, and I never lost it until I was converted to God, through     the blessed words spoken in the open air. When I look back, and     think how I have beaten my poor wife--it was through the drink--it     makes me ashamed of myself. It was the word and the blow, but     sometimes the blow first. After I got sober, sometimes it would     make me ashamed to look at her black eyes; but I do thank God there     is no fear of black eyes now; for we are very happy together.     "I am a stoker and engine-driver, and I wonder I have never had an     explosion, for I have been drunk for a week at a time. On one     occasion, I had been drunk overnight, and was not very sober in the     morning. I went to work at half-past five, instead of five, and,     without looking to see if there was any water in the boiler, I     began stoking the fire up. The fright sobered me. It cost above     L100 before it was fit for work again. But that did not alter me,     only for the worse. I broke up my home. I got worse, after that,     and cared for nothing. Half my wages went in drink, my wife was     afraid to speak to me, and the poor children would get anywhere out     of my way. Afterwards I was discharged; but although I soon got     another job, I could not leave off the drink. I was reckoned a     regular drunkard. I lost place after place, and was out of work     several weeks at a time; for they did not care to employ a     drunkard. Still, I would have beer somehow, I did not care how. I     have given one and sixpence for the loan of a shilling, and though     there was not a bit of bread at home, the shilling went in beer.     "I have often had the police called in for ill-using my wife. On     one occasion she ran down to her mother's, with her face bleeding;     but I went to bed. When I woke, I saw she was not there, so I went     out and got drunk. I came home and got a large carving-knife, put     it up my sleeve, and went down to her mother's, with the intention     of killing her; but they saw the knife. The police were called in,     and I was taken to Spitalfields Station. But no one coming to press     the charge, I got off.     "Eight years ago God thought fit to lay me on a bed of sickness for     thirteen weeks, and I was given up by all the doctors. When I got     better, people thought I would alter my life, and become a steady     man; but no, I was as bad as ever. While I was at work, another     time, drunk, I lost one of my eyes by an accident; but even that     did not make me a sober man, nor make me leave off swearing and     cursing. I was generally drunk two or three times on Sundays. The     Sunday that I was convinced I was a sinner I had been drunk twice.     "I did not think there was so much happiness for me; but I do thank     God for what He has done for me. He has changed my heart, He has     filled me full of the love of Christ; and my greatest desire is to     tell sinners what a dear Saviour I have found."Best of all was the demonstration that, out of such material, God wasable and ready to raise up a fighting force.One great difficulty of those days was the obtaining of suitablebuildings. For a time a theatre was hired for Sunday Meetings (the lawin England then not allowing theatres to give performances on Sundays).The great buildings to which the people have been accustomed to go foramusement have always proved admirably suited for the gathering ofcongregations of that sort. A gentleman who had had long experience inmission work thus describes what he saw when he went to spend a "Sundayafternoon with William Booth":--     "On the afternoon of Sunday, January 31st, I was able to see some     of the results of William Booth's work in the East of London, by     attending his Experience Meeting, held in the East London Theatre.     About 2 o'clock some of his helpers and Converts went out from the     Mission Hall, where they had been praying together, and held an     Open-Air Meeting in front of a large brewery opposite the Hall. The     ground was damp and the wind high, but they secured an audience,     and then sang hymns along the road, till they came to the theatre,     taking in any who chose to follow them. Probably about five hundred     were present, though many came in late.     "The Meeting commenced at three, and lasted one hour and a half.     During this period fifty-three persons gave their experience, parts     of eight hymns were sung, and prayer was offered by four persons.     After singing Philip Philips' beautiful hymn, 'I will sing for     Jesus,' prayer was offered up by Mr. Booth and two others.     "A young man rose and told of his conversion a year ago, thanking     God that he had been kept through the year.     "A negro, of the name of Burton, interested the Meeting much by     telling of his first Open-Air Service, which he had held during the     past week in Ratcliff Highway, one of the worst places in London.     He said, when the people saw him kneel in the gutter, engaged in     prayer for them, they thought he was mad. The verse--        Christ now sits on Zion's hill,        He receives poor sinners still,     Was then sung.     "A young man under the right-hand gallery, having briefly spoken,     one of Mr. Booth's helpers, a Yorkshireman, with a strong voice and     hearty manner, told of the Open-Air Meetings, the opposition they     encountered, and his determination to go on, in spite of all     opposition from men and Devils.     "A middle-aged man on the right, a sailor, told how he was brought     to Christ during his passage home from Colombo. One of the Dublin     tracts, entitled, 'John's Difficulty,' was the means of his     conversion.     "A young man to the right, having told how, as a backslider, he had     recently been restored, a cabman said he used to be in the     public-houses constantly; but he thanked God he ever heard William     Booth, for it led to his conversion.     "Three young men on the right then spoke. The first, who comes five     miles to these Meetings, told how he was lost through the drink,     and restored by the Gospel; the second said he was unspeakably     happy; the third said he would go to the stake for Christ.     "A middle-aged man in the centre spoke of his many trials. His     sight was failing him, but the light of Christ shone brilliantly in     his soul.     "The chorus--        Let us walk in the light,     was then sung.     "A young man described his feelings as he had recently passed the     place where he was born; and a sister spoke of her husband's     conversion, and how they were both now rejoicing in God.     "After a young man on the left had told how his soul had recently     revived, another on the right testified to the Lord having pardoned     his sins in the theatre on the previous Sunday.     "Two sailors followed. The first spoke of his conversion through     reading a tract while on his way to the Indies four months ago. The     other said he was going to sea next week, and was going to take     some Bibles, hymns, and tracts with him, to see what could be done     for Christ on board.     "The verse--        I believe I shall be there,        And walk with Him in white,     was then sung.     "A young man of the name of John, sometimes called 'Young     Hallelujah,' told of his trials while selling fish in the streets;     but he comforted himself by saying, ''Tis better on before.' He had     been drawn out in prayer at midnight on the previous night, and had     dreamed all night that he was in a Prayer Meeting. He was followed     by a converted thief, who told how he was 'picked up,' and of his     persecutions daily while working with twenty unconverted men.     "A man in the centre, who had been a great drunkard, said, 'What a     miserable wretch I was till the Lord met with me! I used to think I     could not do without my pint a day, but the Lord pulled me right     bang out of a public-house into a place of worship.'     "He was followed by a young man who was converted at one of the     Breakfast Meetings last year, and who said he was exceedingly     happy. Another young man on the left said his desire was to speak     more and work more for Jesus.     "Two sisters then spoke. The first uttered a brief, inaudible     sentence, and the second told of being so happy every day, and     wanting to be more faithful.     "The verse--        Shall we meet beyond the River,        Where the surges cease to roll?     was then sung.     "A young woman said: 'I well remember the night I first heard Mr.     Booth preach here. I had a heavy load of sin upon my shoulders. But     I was invited to come on the stage. I did so, and was pointed to     Jesus, and I obtained peace.'     "Another told of his conversion by a tract, four years ago, on his     passage to Sydney. 'To my sorrow,' he said, 'I became a backslider.     But I thank God He ever brought me here. That blessed man, Mr.     Booth, preached, and I gave my heart to God afresh. I now take     tracts to sea regularly. I have only eighteen shillings a week, but     I save my tobacco and beer money to buy tracts.'     "The verse--        I never shall forget the day        When Jesus took my sins away,     was then sung.     "A stout man, a navvy, who said he had been one of the biggest     drunkards in London, having briefly spoken, was followed by one     known as 'Jemmy the butcher,' who keeps a stall in the Whitechapel     Road. Some one had cruelly robbed him, but he found consolation by     attending the Mission Hall Prayer Meeting.     "Two young lads, recently converted, having given their experience,     a dock labourer, converted seventeen months ago, asked the prayers     of the Meeting for his wife, yet unconverted. Some of his comrades     during the last week said, 'What a difference there is in you now     to what there used to be!'     "Three young women followed. The first spoke but a sentence or two.     The desire of the second was to live more to Christ. The third had     a singularly clear voice, and gave her experience very     intelligently. It was a year and a half since she gave her heart to     the Saviour; but her husband does not yet see with her. Her desire     was to possess holiness of heart, and to know more of the language     of Canaan.     "The experience of an old man, who next spoke, was striking. Mr.     Booth had announced his intention, some time back, of preaching a     sermon on 'The Derby,' at the time of the race that goes by that     name. This man was attracted by curiosity, and when listening     compared himself to a broken-down horse. This sermon was the means     of his conversion.     "The verse then sung was:--        Can you tell me what ship is going to sail?        Oh, the old ship of Zion, Hallelujah!     "Two sisters then spoke. The first had been very much cast down for     seven or eight weeks; but she comforted herself by saying, ''Tis     better on before.' The second said it was two years since she found     peace, and she was very happy.     "A young man told how his sins were taken away. He worked in the     city, and some one took him to hear the Rev. E. P. Hammond. He did     not find peace then, but afterwards, as a young man was talking to     him in the street, he was able to see the way of Salvation, and     rejoice in it. He used to fall asleep generally under the     preaching. 'But here,' he said, 'under Mr. Booth, I can't sleep.'     "A little boy, one of Mr. Booth's sons (the present General), gave     a simple and good testimony. He was followed by a young man, and     then an interesting blind girl, whom I had noticed singing heartily     in the street, told of her conversion.     "A girl told how she found peace seventeen months ago; and then Mr.     Booth offered a few concluding observations and prayed. The Meeting     closed by singing:--        I will not be discouraged,        For Jesus is my Friend.     "Such is a brief outline of this most interesting Meeting, held     Sunday after Sunday. Mr. Booth led the singing by commencing the     hymns without even giving them out. But the moment he began, the     bulk of the people joined heartily in them. Only one or two verses     of each hymn were sung as a rule. Most of them are found in his own     admirably compiled Song-Book.     "I could not but wonder at the change which had come over the     people. The majority of those present, probably nearly five     hundred, owed their conversion to the preaching of Mr. Booth and     his helpers. How would they have been spending Sunday afternoon, if     this blessed agency had not been set on foot?     "In the evening I preached in the Oriental Music Hall, High Street,     Poplar, where five or six hundred persons were assembled. This is     one of the more recent branches of Mr. Booth's work, and appears to     be in a very prosperous condition. I found two groups of the     helpers singing and preaching in the streets, who were only driven     in by the rain just before the Meeting commenced inside. This is     how the people are laid hold of.     "Shall this good work be hindered for the want of a few hundred     pounds?"The supply of "pounds," alas! though called for in such religiousperiodicals as at that time were willing to report the work, did notcome, and The General says: "After six years' hard work, we had nothingbetter for our Sunday Night Meetings than a small covered alley attachedto a drinking-saloon, together with some old discarded chapels, and atumble-down penny theatre for week-nights."At last a drinking-saloon, "The Eastern Star," having been burnt out,was acquired, and rebuilt and fitted as a centre for the Work, to besucceeded ere long by the large covered People's Market in WhitechapelRoad, which was for ten years to be The Army's Headquarters, and whichis now the Headquarters of its English Men's Social Work.Throughout all these years of struggle, however, the Converts werebeing drilled and fitted for the further extension of the Work.The idea of forming them into a really permanent Organisation only cameto their Leader gradually. He says:--     "My first thought was to constitute an evangelistic agency, the     Converts going to the Churches. But to this there were three main     obstacles:--          i. They would not go where they were sent.         ii. They were not wanted when they did go.        iii. I soon found that I wanted them myself."And the more time he spent amongst them the more the sense ofresponsibility with regard to them grew upon him. He had discovered whatmines of unimagined power for good were to be found amidst the veryclasses who seemed entirely severed from religious life. There theywere, and if only proper machinery could be provided and kept going theycould be raised from their present useless, if not pernicious, life tothat career of usefulness to others like themselves for which they wereso well qualified. They could thus become a treasure of priceless valueto their country and to the world.On the other hand, neglected, or left with no other sort of worship thanas yet existed to appeal to them, they must needs become worse andworse, more and more hostile to religion of any kind, more and moreunlikely ever to take an interest in anything eternal.The General could not, therefore, but feel more and more satisfied thathe had begun a work that ought to be permanently maintained andenlarged, as opportunity might arise, until it could cope with thisstate of things wherever it was to be found.And now that he had at length a centre to which he could invite all hishelpers from time to time, there was no hindrance to the carrying out ofsuch a purpose.With the establishment of a Headquarters that cost L3,500, in one of themain thoroughfares of Eastern London, we may look upon The General ashaving at last got a footing in the world.Chapter VIIIArmy-makingWhat a place for a Christian Mission centre was Whitechapel Road!"Just look here," said The General to his eldest son, then a boy ofthirteen, as he led him late one Sunday evening through the greatswing-doors of a public-house into the crowded bar. "These are thepeople I want you to live and labour for."The mere appearance of many a thousand in the neighbourhood, whetherinside or outside such houses, was enough to give some idea of themisery of their lives. The language and the laughter with which thoseragged, dirty, unkempt men and women accompanied their drinking weresuch as to leave no doubt that they were wallowing in the mire. At thattime, and, indeed, until the Children Act of 1909 came into force, itwas the custom of thousands of mothers to take their babies and littlechildren into the public-houses with them, so that the scenes of familymisery and ruin were complete.In many of the side streets and back lanes, where there was little wheeltraffic, groups of men and women might have been seen bargaining; forthe most dilapidated and greasy articles of old clothing that couldstill be worn, whilst lads and even children gambled with half-pence, oreven with marbles, as if they could not early enough learn how fully tofollow the evil courses of their elders. There were, and are still,streets within ten minutes' walk of the Whitechapel Road where dogs andbirds were traded in, or betted on, competitions in running and singingbeing often indispensable to the satisfaction of the buyers and sellers.By the side of the road along which there was, and is, a continuousstream of waggon and omnibus, as well as foot traffic, was a broad stripof unpaved ground, part of it opposite that Sidney Street which a fewyears ago became world-renowned as the scene of the battle of the LondonPolice with armed burglars. This was called the Mile End Waste, and wasutilised for all the ordinary purposes of a fair ground. Themerry-go-rounds, and shows of every description, which competed with theunfailing Punch and Judy, and wooden swings, kept up a continuous din,especially on Saturday nights and Sundays.Amidst all this the vendors of the vilest songs and books, and of themost astounding medicines, raised their voices so as to attract theirown little rings of interested listeners. There, too, men spoke uponalmost every imaginable evil theme, denouncing both God and Governmentin words which one would have thought no decent workman would care tohear. But all who have seen a fair will have some idea of the scene, ifthey can only imagine all the deepest horrors of appearance anddemeanour that drunkenness and poverty, illness and rags, can crowdtogether within a few hundred yards of space.Once you can place all that fairly before your imagination you can formsome conception of the mind that could look upon it all and hunger tofind just there a battlefield for life, as well as of the faith thatcould reckon upon the victory of the Gospel in such a place. We have allread accounts of missionaries approaching some far-away island shore andseeing the heathen dance round some cannibal feast. But such feastscould not have been very frequent, amidst such limited populations,whereas the ever-changing millions of London have furnished all theseyears tragedies daily and nightly numerous enough to crowd our memorieswith scenes no less appalling to the moral sense than anything witnessedon those distant pagan shores. To those who take time to think it out,the marvel of both the eagerness and the reluctance of Mr. and Mrs.Booth to plunge into this human Niagara will appear ever greater. As welook nowadays at the world-wide result of their resolve so to do,despite all their consciousness of ignorance and unfitness for thetask, we cannot but see in the whole matter the hand of God Himself,fulfilling His great promise: "Even the captives of the mighty shall betaken away, the prey of the terrible shall be delivered, for I willcontend with them that contend with thee, and I will save thy children.And all flesh shall know that I the Lord am thy Saviour, and thyRedeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob."As long as the God of that solitary, selfish tramp remains determined toredeem and save even the most depraved and abandoned of mankind, itsWhitechapels and Spitalfields, and other moral jungles, can be turnedinto gardens, blooming with every flower of moral innocence andbeauty--if only gardeners, capable of enough trust in God and toil forman, can be found.The Meetings held at noon daily in front of the new Headquarters set anexample of patient, persevering combat which was followed in theMeetings, outdoors or in, held by what was then known as "The ChristianMission." The first name used by "The General Superintendent," as ourFounder was then called, was "The East London Christian RevivalSociety." This was changed to "The East London Christian Mission," andthe "East London" being dropped, when the work extended outside London,"The Christian Mission" remained, much as the name was always disliked,from its appearance of implying a slight on all other missions.The steadily increasing success of the Whitechapel work was such thatwhen I first saw it, after it had only had that centre for two years,the Hall, seating more than 1,200 persons, would be crowded on Sundays,and, although the people had been got together from streets full ofdrunkenness and hostility, the audiences would be kept under perfectcontrol, once the outer gates were closed, and would listen with theintensest interest to all that was said and sung.On Sunday nights I have known ten different bands of speakers take theirstand at various points along the Whitechapel Road, and when they allmarched to the Hall, they could usually make their songs heard above allthe din of traffic, and in spite of any attempts at interruption madeby the opposition.The enemy constantly displayed his hostility at the Meetings held in thestreet, whether in Whitechapel or any of the other poor parishes towhich the work had spread, and was not often content with mere cries ofderision either. Dirt and garbage would be thrown at us, blows and kickswould come, especially on dark evenings, and the sight of a policemanapproaching, so far from being a comfort, was a still worse trial, as hewould very rarely show any inclination to protect us, but more generallya wish to make us "move on" just when we had got a good crowd together,on the plea that we were either "obstructing the thoroughfare" or"creating a disturbance."But what a blessed training for War it all was! The Converts learnt notmerely to raise their voices for God, and to persist in their efforts,in spite of every possible discouragement, but to bridle their tongueswhen abused, to "endure hardness," and manifest a prayerful, lovingspirit towards those who despite fully used them. The very fighting madebold and happy Soldiers out of many of the tenderest and most timidConverts.And yet I am not sure whether a still more important part of TheArmy-making was not accomplished in the Prayer Meetings, and HolinessMeetings, which came to be more and more popular, until under the nameof "Days with God" and "Nights of Prayer" they attracted, in many of thegreat cities of England, crowds, even of those who did not belong to us,but who wished to find out the secret of our strength, for it was by thelight and help got in such Meetings that Converts became "steadfast,unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord," so that instead ofmerely carrying on a "Mission" for so many weeks, months, or years, manyof them became reliable warriors for life.How few of The General's critics, who sneered at his Meetings as thoughthey were mere scenes of "passing excitement" had any idea of theprofound teaching he gave his people! The then editor of "TheChristian," who took the trouble to visit them, as well as to conversewith The General at length, with remarkable prescience wrote, as earlyas 1871, in his preface to The General's first important publication,"How to Reach the Masses with the Gospel":--     "The following pages tell a fragment of the story of as wonderful a     work, of its kind, as this generation has seen. No doubt it is open     to the same kind of criticism as the sculptor's chisel might award     to the excavator's pick; but I do not hesitate to believe that for     every essential Christian virtue--faith, zeal, self-denial, love,     prayer, and the like--numbers of the Converts of this Mission will     bear not unfavourable comparison with the choicest members of the     most cultivated Churches.     "There is not in this kingdom an agency which more demands the     hearty and liberal support of the Church of Christ. In the East of     London are crowded and condensed a large proportion of the poorer     labouring population of London. The ruined, the unfortunate, the     depraved, the feeble ones, outrun in the race of life, gravitate     thither and jostle one another in the daily struggle for bread;     thousands remain on the edge of starvation from day to day, and the     bulk of these teeming multitudes are as careless of eternity as the     heathen, and far more uncared for by the great majority of the     professed people of God. Mr. Booth's operations are unparalleled in     extent, unsectarian in character, a standing rebuke to the apathy     of Christians, and a witness of the willingness of God to show His     work unto His servants and to establish the work of their hands     upon them."From the beginning, The General had taught his people to come togetherfor an hour's prayer early each Sunday morning, and to delight in prayerat all times, looking ever to God to deliver them personally from "allevil" and to "make and keep them pure within." These phrases werefamiliar to all English people; but that their real meaning might notonly be taken in but kept ever before his people The General hadestablished two weekly Holiness Meetings in the Mission Halls, one onSunday morning and the other on Friday evening. These practices, kept upwherever The Army has gone all these forty-five years, have resulted inthe cultivation of ideals far above those usual even in the most refinedChristian circles.Nothing has more astonished me, amongst all the torrents of eulogypassed upon The General and his Army since his death, than the almostinvariable silence amongst Christian as well as secular papers aboutthese Holiness Meetings, and that teaching of Holiness which were theroot and secret of all the success of The Army.Any capable schoolmaster might compile volumes of rules; but how to getthem obeyed is the question. How could it be possible to settle everyquestion of who shall be the greatest in an Army formed largely of themost independent and unruly elements, if there were no superhuman powerthat could destroy the foundations of envy and ill-feeling, and fillhearts, once wide apart, with the humble love that can prefer others'honour before one's own?The organisation of The Army has been, and is, in all countries asteady, careful development. But it has only been made possible by thecontinual maintenance of a complete confidence in God for the neededsupplies of wisdom and grace to enable each to submit to others forChrist's sake, to bear and forbear for the good of the whole Army,seeking ever to learn to do better, and yet being willing to beforgotten, and even to be undervalued, misunderstood, and ill-treated bya hasty or unjust superior, for Christ's sake.General Booth, himself, did not always appear the most patient andkindly of leaders. He would have been the first to admit how he woundedtender hearts, and, perhaps, even repulsed some who could have been ofgreater helpfulness to him had he been able to endure more patientlytheir slowness and timidity.But, conscious as he was of his own defects, he especially rejoiced whenhis son and successor began to shine as a Holiness teacher, whose weeklyMeetings at Whitechapel became a power that was felt all over the world.The teaching and enjoyment of this great blessing, with all thedeliverance from self-seeking and pride which it brings, has made itpossible to go on imposing more and more of regulation and disciplineon all sorts of men and women without either souring their spirit ortransforming The Army's system into mere machinery. The Army will go onto carry out its Founder's purpose better and better the more it learnshow to sit constantly at the feet of the one great Master.Chapter IXArmy LeadingWe have seen Mr. Booth beginning on the spot, now marked with a stone,near the site of "The Vine" public-house (since happily pulled down, thesite being turned into a public garden) on July 5, 1865, scramblingthrough the first six years' difficulties until he marched thebeginnings of an Army of saved drunkards, infidels, and sinners into aPeople's Market, transformed into a public Hall and Headquarters.He called all that "The Christian Mission," with only a slowly dawningconsciousness that it was an Army, for six years more.But he was leading it on, in humble dependence upon God, with increasingspeed and force. He was really hindered by many things, amongst them hisown ministerial habits of thought and plan. That nothing lasting couldbe achieved without system and organisation he had always seen. But hehad never yet known a formation equal to that of some of the Churchesaround him which depended upon more or less skilled preachers, and acomplete network of elected assemblies. For all purposes of conquest hehad got preachers enough out of the public-houses; but he could notimagine their holding regular congregations, or developing the work,without having years for study and just such plans as the Churches hadestablished. Hence, when he wanted leaders for the enlargement of thework he advertised for them in Methodist or other publications. Hesecured some excellent, well-meaning men, too; but, in almost everyinstance, they proved to be slower than the troops they were supposed tolead, and a kind of ecclesiastical organisation wrapped them all aroundwith a sort of Saul's armour, in which fighting the heathen wasunthinkable. He had got--by the testimony, as we have seen, ofimpartial observers--such a force as was "unparalleled in extent,unsectarian in character, and a standing rebuke to the apathy ofChristians."But how was he to go further afield with it? He had not a leader readyfor its extension outside London. In 1873, Mrs. Booth, however, couldnot be content without doing something, at least for a season, inEngland's great naval base, Portsmouth, and, after that, in the sisterarsenal city of Chatham. The force of new Converts she gathered in eachtown must needs be led by somebody, and in each case The General sentmen of proved ability to manufacture preachers of their own _fighting_type. After having led Missions in those towns, they went and didlikewise in two of the great manufacturing cities of the north. Buttheir first achievements had led The General to venture upon sending outothers, of much less ability, to smaller communities, where they werenot less successful than the first two.Already another great difficulty had been solved, for it had been foundthat congregations of workmen gathered in the provincial towns wouldgive collections generally large enough to defray the local expenses.Thus were cleared away not only two of the main blocks in the path ofprogress, but all need or desire for the officialdom that had alreadybegun to grow threateningly stiff.     "After awhile," writes The General, "the work began to spread and     show wonderful promise, and then, when everything was looking like     progress a new trouble arose. It came about in this wise. Some of     the evangelists whom I had engaged to assist me rose up and wanted     to convert our Mission into a regular Church, with a Committee of     Management and all that sort of thing. They wanted to settle down     in quietness. I wanted to go forward at all costs. But I was not to     be defeated or turned from the object on which my heart was set in     this fashion, so I called them together, and addressing them said,     'My comrades, the formation of another Church is not my aim. There     are plenty of Churches. I want to make an Army. Those among you who     are willing to help me to realise my purpose can stay with me.     Those who do not must separate from me, and I will help them to     find situations elsewhere.'"They one and all chose to stand by The General, for those who werereally set upon the formation of deliberative assemblies had alreadyleft us.This was in February, 1877, and in the following July the last ChristianMission Conference met to celebrate the abandonment of the entire systemthat Conference represented, and to assure The General that he had got areal fighting Army to lead.It was only at the end of 1878, during which year the "Stations," whichwe now call Corps, had increased from thirty to eighty, that in a briefdescription of the work we called the Mission a "Salvation Army." Butthe very name helped us to increase the speed of our advance.The rapidity with which The General selected and sent out his Officersreminds one constantly of the stories of the Gospel. One who became oneof his foremost helpers, had formerly been a notorious sinner, and hadindeed only been converted a fortnight, when because he already showedsuch splendid qualities he was sent by a girl Officer to The Generalwith the strongest recommendation for acceptance.It was arranged for him to speak with The General on the platform, aftera Meeting. The General, who had, no doubt, observed him during theevening, looked at him for a moment and then said, "You ought to dosomething for God with those eyes! Good-night!""I had never had such a shock," says the Commissioner, as he now is. "Ifthat's being accepted for the Work, I said to myself--what next, Iwonder."But, sure enough, in another three weeks' time he was called out fromhis place of employment by a Staff Officer, who asked him, "Can you beready to go to M---- next Monday?" And he went.This young man had been a devotee of billiards; but had becomeinterested in The Army by seeing two of our "Special" speakers--one avery short Officer, the other a giant doctor from Whitechapel, whoweighed some 334 lbs., wheeled up a steep hill in a pig cart, to a greatOpen-Air Meeting. After listening many times without yielding, he wasstartled out of his coolness by a large Hall in which he attended aNight of Prayer being burned to the ground the next day. The nextevening, with one of his companions, he went to the Penitent-Form andfound the mercy of God.When The General was at all in doubt about a Candidate for Officership,he would often draw such a one out by means of the most discouragingremarks. To one who had gone expecting a hearty welcome, he said, "Well,what good do you think you'll be?" The General's eldest son beingpresent, desiring to help her, remarked upon the high commendation herOfficers gave her. He wished to send her off directly to a Corps; butThe General, still uncertain, said, "No, send her to Emma," which openedthe way for her immediately to leave her business and go to thenewly-opened Training Home for women under his daughter's direction.A similar Home for young men, under the present Chief of the Staff,Commissioner Howard, provided means to take those about whose fitnessfor the Work there was any doubt, and give them a training prior tosending them on to the Field.In 1880, The General addressed the Wesleyan Methodist Conference of theUnited Kingdom. That Conference is one of the most powerful Churchassemblies in the world, directing as it does the entire forces of itsChurch within the British Empire, and consequently influencing verylargely all Methodists in the world. It was a remarkable testimony toThe General's work that, so early as 1880, its most influential leadersshould have been able to arrange, despite considerable opposition, forhim to address the Conference which that year sat in London. ThePresident, in welcoming him, warned him that they could only give him alimited time in which to speak.What an expression of his sense of liberty and power "from on high,"that The General should at once have begun by saying, "Mr. President,in our Meetings we are accustomed to bring any speech that seems likelyto go on too long to a close by beginning to sing. I shall not take itamiss if you do so in my case." The general laughter with which thissuggestion was greeted banished at once any appearance of stiffness fromthe solemn and exclusive assembly, whose members alone were present. Hethen proceeded to explain the origin and work of The Army, as follows:--     "I was told that ninety-five in every hundred of the population of     our larger towns and cities never crossed the threshold of any     place of worship, and I thought, 'Cannot something be done to reach     these people with the Gospel?' Fifteen years ago I thus fell in     love with the great crowds of people who seemed to be out of the     pale of all Christian Churches. It seemed to me that if we could     get them to think about Hell they would be certain to want to turn     from it. If we could get them to think about Heaven they would want     to go there. If we could get them to think about Christ they would     want to rush to His open arms.     "I resolved to try, and 'The Salvation Army' is the outcome of that     resolution. In August, 1877, we had 26 Stations. We have now, in     1880, 162. In 1877, we had 35 Evangelists. We have now 285     Evangelists, or, as we now call them, Officers, and in many     instances they have the largest audiences in the towns where they     are at work.     "We have got all those Officers without any promise or guarantee of     salary, and without any assurance that when they reach the railway     station to which they book they will find anybody in the town to     sympathise with them. The bulk would cheerfully and gladly go     anywhere.     "We have got, I think, an improvement upon John Wesley's penny a     week and shilling a quarter, by way of financial support from our     Converts. We say to them, 'You used to give three or four shillings     a week for beer and tobacco before you were converted, and we shall     not be content with a penny a week and a shilling a quarter. Give     as the Lord has prospered you, and down with the money.'" (Loud     laughter.) "When I asked one of my Officers the other day at a     Meeting held after a tea, for which the people had paid a shilling     each, to announce the collection, the woman-Captain, to my     astonishment, simply said, 'Now, friends, go into the collection.     Whack it into the baskets.' The whole audience was evidently fond     of her, and they very heartily responded.     "If asked to explain our methods, I would say: _Firstly, we do not     fish in other people's waters, or try to set up a rival sect._ Out     of the gutters we pick up our Converts, and if there be one man     worse than another our Officers rejoice the most over the case of     that man.     "When a man gets saved, no matter how low he is, he rises     immediately. His wife gets his coat from the pawn-shop, and if she     cannot get him a shirt she buys him a paper front, and he gets his     head up, and is soon unable to see the hole of the pit from which     he has been digged, and would like to convert our rough concern     into a chapel, and make things respectable. That is not our plan.     We are moral scavengers, netting the very sewers. We want all we     can get, but we want the lowest of the low.     "My heart has gone out much after Ireland of late, and ten weeks     ago I sent out there a little woman who had been much blessed, and     four of her Converts. They landed at Belfast at two o'clock in the     morning. They did not know a soul. Our pioneer (contrary to our     usual customs) had taken them a lodging. We had said to her, 'Rest     yourselves till Sunday morning'; but she was not content with this.     After a wash, a cup of tea, and a little sleep, they turned out,     found a Christian gentleman who lent them a little hall, had it     crowded at once, and now, though only ten weeks have passed away,     we have Stations in four other towns, two in Belfast, and two     others are getting ready for opening. Blessed results have     followed. The people, we are told, come in crowds--they are very     poor--they sit and listen and weep, rush out to the Penitent-Form,     and many are saved.     "Now, Mr. President, I think I may say that it is a matter for     great thankfulness to God that there is a way--a simple, ready     way--a cheap way, to get at the masses of the people.     "_Secondly. We get at these people by adapting our measures._ There     is a most bitter prejudice, amongst the lower classes, against     churches and chapels. I am sorry for this; I did not create it, but     it is the fact. They will not go into a church or chapel; but they     will go into a theatre or warehouse, and therefore we use these     places. In one of our villages we use the pawnshop, and they gave     it the name of 'The Salvation Pawnshop,' and many souls were saved     there. Let me say that I am not the inventor of all the strange     terms that are used in The Army. I did not invent the term     '_Hallelujah Lassies_.' When I first heard of it I was somewhat     shocked; but telegram after telegram brought me word that no     buildings would contain the people who came to hear the Hallelujah     Lassies. Rough, uncouth fellows liked the term. One had a lassie at     home, another went to hear them because he used to call his wife     'Lassie' before he was married. My end was gained, and I was     satisfied.     "_Thirdly. We set the Converts to work._" (Hear, hear.) "As soon as     a man gets saved we put him up to say so, and in this testimony     lies much of the power of our work. One of our lassies was holding     a Meeting in a large town the other day when a conceited fellow     came up to her saying, 'What does an ignorant girl like you know     about religion? I know more than you do. I can say the Lord's     Prayer in Latin.' 'Oh, but,' she replied, 'I can say more than     that. I can say the Lord has saved my soul in English.' (Laughter     and cheers.)     "_Lastly. We succeed by dint of hard work._ I tell my people that     hard work and Holiness will succeed anywhere."Of course, every day's march forward brought with it lessons that werelearned and utilised. Not long could The General continue to interviewCandidates himself, and then forms of application were evolved. TheCandidate must have every opportunity to understand what would berequired of him, and to express his agreement or otherwise with theteachings and principles of The Army. It was made clear to him or herthat, whilst called upon to offer up a life-long service to this workfor Christ's sake, he must expect no guarantee of salary whatever, andno engagement even to continue to employ him, should he at any timecease to act up to his promises, or show himself to be inefficient inthe work.As for the Soldiers, it was soon required of them that they should sign"Articles of War" before they could be enrolled. These Articles formedso simple and clear an expression of The Army's teachings and system,that the most illiterate in every land could at once take in theirpractical effect.The Articles simply required every one to give up the use ofintoxicants; to keep from any resorts, habits, company, or language thatwould be harmful; and to devote all the leisure time, spare energy andmoney to the War.As time went on The General published _Orders and Regulations forSoldiers_, a booklet of 164 pages, and perhaps as complete a handbookfor the direction of every department of life, public and private, aswas ever written; _Orders and Regulations for Field Officers_,containing 626 pages of the minutest directions for every branch of theWork; and _Orders and Regulation's for Staff Officers, _ the mostextraordinary directory for the management of missionaries andmissionary affairs that could well be packed in 357 pages. At laterdates he issued _Orders and Regulations for Territorial Commissionersand Chief Secretaries_, containing 176 pages, and _Orders andRegulation's for Social Officers_, the latter a complete explanation ofhis thoughts and wishes for the conduct of every form of effort for theelevation of the homeless and workless and fallen; and _Orders andRegulations for Local Officers_, containing precise details as to theduties of all the various non-commissioned or lay Officers, whetherengaged in work for old or young. Smaller handbooks of _Orders andRegulations for Bands and Songster Brigades_, and for almost every otherclass of agents were also issued from time to time.Thus, step by step, The General not merely led those who gave themselvesup to follow him in the ever-extending War; but furnished them with suchsimple and clear directions in print as would enable them at anydistance from him to study his thoughts, principles, and practices, andsock God's help to do for the people around them all that had been shownto be possible elsewhere.With such a complete code of instructions there naturally arose a systemof reporting and inspection which enabled The General to ascertain, withremarkable accuracy, how far his wishes were being carried out, orneglected, by any of his followers. He sometimes said, "I would like,if I could, to get a return from every man and every woman in The Armyas to what they do for God and their fellow-men every day." It soonbecame impossible, of course, for any one person to examine the returnswhich were furnished by the Corps; but records were kept, and, as thework increased, Divisional and Provincial Officers were appointed, withparticular responsibility for the Work in their areas; so that in eventhe most distant corners of the world, wherever there is a registeredSalvationist, there is some Staff Officer to whom he must report what heis doing, and who is expected periodically to visit each Corps, see thatthe reports made are accurate, and that the work is not merely beingdone "somehow," but done as it ought to be, in the Master's Spirit ofLove and Hope for the vilest. And all this without the absolute promiseof a penny reward to any one! In fact, from the first, The Generaltaught his Officers that they must try to raise all expenses of the workin their Commands within the borders of the districts in which they wereoperating. He has always regarded it as a proper test of the value ofwork done that those who see it are willing to pay as much as they cantowards its continuance. And, to this day, The Army's resources consistnot so much in large gifts from outsiders as of the pence of those whotake part in or attend its services.Regulations are made, from time to time, as to the amount any Officermay draw for himself, according to the cost of living where he is atwork, though a considerable number do not regularly receive the fullamount. So utterly, indeed, above any such consideration have ourOfficers, everywhere, proved themselves to be that, to guard againstneedless sacrifice of health and life, it has been necessary to fix,also, in each country, a minimum allowance, which the Staff Officersmust see that the Field Officers receive. Knowing, as I do, that manydevoted Officers have, for months together, been down at the minimumlevel of six shillings per week, in little places where we have nowealthy friends to help a Corps into greater prosperity, I feel it safeto say that never was there a religious society raised and led tovictory with so much reliance upon Divine Grace to keep its workers in aperfectly unselfish and happy condition.Space forbids any description of the heroic labours by which The Generaland Mrs. Booth, travelling, holding Meetings, and corresponding, managedto extend The Army's work throughout Great Britain; so that before itsname had been adopted ten years, it had made itself loved or dreaded inmany parts.At the earliest possible date in The Army's history, The General tooksteps to get its constitution and rights so legally established that itshould be impossible for any one, after his death, to wrest from it orturn to other purposes any of the property which had been acquired forits use by a Deed Poll enrolled in the High Court of Chancery ofEngland, August 7, 1878. The construction, aims and practices of TheArmy are so defined that its identity can never be disputed. AnotherDeed Poll, enrolled January 30, 1891, similarly safeguarded The Army'sSocial Work, so that persons or corporations desiring to contribute onlyto the Social funds could make sure that they were doing so. SimilarDeeds or other provisions are made in every other country where we areat work, containing such references to the British Deeds, that theabsolute unity of The Army, and the entire subjection of every part ofit to its one General is, in conformity with the laws of each country,secured for all time.And again a deed dated July 26th, 1904, has provided for the case of aGeneral's death without having first named his successor, or for anyother circumstance which might arise rendering a special appointmentnecessary.Subsequent chapters will show how wondrously God helped The General tocarry on this work in other countries as well as in his own, and wecannot believe that any one will read this book through without beingconstrained to admit that there has not merely been the accomplishment,under The General's own eye, of an enormous amount of good; but theformation and maintenance of a force for the continual multiplicationof it all, in every clime, such as no other leader ever beforeattempted, or even planned. And then most will be constrained surely tosay with us: "It is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes."Chapter XDesperate FightingOne might have supposed that a man who thus raised a force of workingpeople to do good to others, would in a Christian country have beenhonoured and encouraged by all the better elements, and defended withvigour by the press, the pulpit, and the police against any of the lowersort who might oppose him or his followers.To the shame of his fellow-countrymen, alas! it must be told that, sofar from this being the case, The General was generally treated for thefirst few years of The Army's work as being unworthy to be received inany decent society, and his followers, as "blasphemers of religion" and"disturbers of the peace," who ought by all possible means to besuppressed.Those who fattened on the vices of the poor and the opponents ofreligion generally were undoubtedly the leaders of opposition to hiswork. There were only too many ignorant ruffians ready to delight in anyexcuse for disturbance, and very many truly religious people who putdown every disturbance so created to The Army's account, and who,without taking the trouble to make any inquiry, denounced itmercilessly.Condemned almost whenever mentioned, either by press or pulpit, TheGeneral and The Army were naturally treated by many authorities andlargely by respectable citizens, not only as unworthy of any defence,but as deserving of punishment and imprisonment. In one year alone,1882, no fewer than 699 of our Officers and Soldiers, 251 of them womenand 23 children under fifteen, were brutally assaulted generally whilstmarching through the streets singing hymns, though often when attendingMeetings in our own hired buildings, and 86, of whom 15 were women,were imprisoned. True, these persecutions almost always gained for ussympathy and friends, as many as 30,000 people coming out in one case tothe railway station to welcome an Officer upon his release from prison.Yet, year after year, such attacks were repeated, and, even during thelast year, imprisonment was suffered by several Officers for leadingMeetings where they had regularly been tolerated for some thirty years;but where some newly-appointed dignitary would rather not see them.When we ask in wonder how so bitter an opposition to such a leader, orhis work, could arise, we always find the sort of explanation which thatfamous man John Bright once wrote to Mrs. Booth:--     "The people who mob you would doubtless have mobbed the Apostles.     Your faith and patience will prevail. The 'craftsmen' who find     'their craft in danger,' 'the high priests and elders of the     people,' whose old-fashioned counsels are disregarded by     newly-arrived stirrers-up of men, always complain, and then the     governors and magistrates, who may 'care for none of these things,'     but who always act 'in the interests of the public peace,' think it     best to 'straightly charge these men to speak no more' of Christ."The General's attitude in face of all these storms was ever the same;"Go straight on" was the pith of all his replies to inquiries, and hisown conduct and bearing amidst the most trying hours were always inaccord with that counsel. As in the case of many popular leaders ofthought in England, the custom was established of meeting him at railwaystations, and escorting him with bands and banners, music and song fromtrain to theatre, Town Hall, or whatever the meeting-place might be forthe day. When he was received, however, not as in later years withuniversal acclamations, but with derisive shouts and groans andsometimes with showers of stones and mud, he smiled to see thecommotion, and took every opportunity to show his enemies how much heloved them. Already more than fifty years old, and looking decidedlyolder, when the worst of these storms burst upon him, this bearing oftensubdued crowds, the moment they really caught sight of his grey beard."At Ipswich," says one of our Commissioners, "I remember how he won overthe booing crowd by laughingly imitating them, and saying, 'I can boo aswell as you.' Riding with Mrs. Booth through one of the worst riots thathe experienced, and in full sight of all the violence which nearly costone of our Officers his life, The General was seen, even when hiscarriage was all splattered with mud and stones, standing as usual toencourage his Soldiers and to salute the people. Arrived at the greathall he was fitter than most of his people to conduct the Meetingthere."How much his own calm and loving spirit was communicated to many of hisfollowers may best be represented by the remarks of a wounded Lieutenanton that occasion to a local newspaper whilst he was in hospital.The fact that this Lieutenant had been the champion wrestler of hiscounty, and would never, before his conversion, have allowed any one totake any liberty with him, will explain the way in which from time totime The General acquired Officers capable of overcoming such crowds.The Lieutenant, riding in the very dress he had once worn as an athlete,but with our Salvation Army band around his helmet, was a perfect targetfor the enemy."When I came to S----, I never thought for one moment that I should haveto suffer and to be taken to a hospital for my blessed Master; but Ihave had a happy time there. I can truly say that the Spirit of God hasrevealed wondrous things to me since I have been in. Though I havesuffered terrible pains, the Great Physician has been close by my side."(Whilst being removed into the hospital he was heard to whisper "I hopethey'll all get saved.") But he goes on, "When I became conscious Ifound myself in the hospital with a painful head and body; but it waswell with my soul. The grace of God constituted my soul's happiness, somuch so, that when I thought about Paul and Silas being taken to prison,and how they praised God and sung His praises, my heart sang within me.I could not sing aloud for the pain I was suffering. Could I have doneso, I would have made the place ring for the victory the Lord had givenme in the battle. Glory to His Name! I remember I had no sleep untiltwelve o'clock the second night I was in. The first night was anall-night of pain. At the same time it was an all-night with Jesus. Hewas indeed very precious to my soul. I thought of the sufferings ofChrist for me--even then--the chief of all sinners until saved by Hisgrace. Hallelujah for His love to me. My suffering was nothing (though Isuffered thirteen weeks) compared to Christ's. Should my blessed Saviourwant me to do the work over again, I should do it to-morrow.""The General," says one of his chosen associates of those times, "alwaysreminded me so of the captain of a vessel in a stormy sea. Perfectlycalm himself in a way, yet going resolutely ahead with unerring aim,quickly deciding whenever a decision was needed, and always ready totake all the risks; he trained his folks how to go through everythingthat came, to victory."One of the weakest of the many women whom in those days he taught how torise up out of their ease and go to battle and victory, says of herfirst sight of him, more than forty years ago, "He gave me theimpression in that Meeting of a man of God, whose only aim was theSalvation of souls. I got saved at one of Mrs. Booth's Meetings, when Iwas still a girl only twelve years old. They used to call me 'PrayingPolly.' But, never having had a day's schooling, when he wanted me tobecome an Officer, I feared my own incompetence. Mrs. Booth said 'Youwill see God will punish you.' She had seen something of my work inMeetings where I had to take up collections and turn out roughs, and sohad no doubt told The General what she thought I could do."Sure enough I was laid up completely, lost the use of one limb, and hadto use crutches. But just as I came weak out of hospital and penniless,I saw a shilling lying on the ground, picked it up, and with it paid myway across London to The General's house. I thought, 'Oh, if I can onlysee Mrs. Booth, I'll get her to pray for me, and get help from God.'When I arrived at the door, she was just coming out to go off to theNorth of England; but she sent her cab away and stayed for a latertrain, to attend to me. She helped me up the steps and said:--"'Now then, are you willing to follow God?'"I didn't feel fit for anything; but I said, 'Yes, if God will only helpme, I'll go to the uttermost parts of the earth for Him.'"Accordingly, after having some care and nursing I recovered strength,and, soon after returning to my Corps, I, in a Meeting when my name wascalled, forgot my crutches and hobbled to the front without them. Howthe Soldiers all shouted! The Captain carried them after me on hisshoulder home that night."After I had been in the War for some months I was ordered to bidfarewell to Lancaster, and, whilst resting at a little place near, Ireceived order to go to Scotland. When I was at the station, however, onthe Saturday, I got a wire from The General, 'Orders cancelled. GoKing's Lynn.' Nobody at the station knew, at first, where it was, andeven the stationmaster said, 'You cannot get there to-day.' 'But Imust,' I said, 'I have to commence my work there to-morrow.' And hefound out there was just a chance, by taking an express part of the way.When I got there, at a quarter to ten at night, I knew of no friend, andfound there had been no announcement made in the town. But, on going toa Temperance Hotel to put up, I learned that a gentleman near had theletting of a large hall. I at once went to him."'But,' said he, 'we don't let like that, out of business hours. And weare accustomed to get payment in advance of the L2 10_s._ it costs.'"As I had only sixpence left, I could pay nothing; but I said to him,'The Rev. William Booth is responsible. You draw up an agreement. I'llsign, and you shall have the money Monday morning.' Somehow he felt hecould not refuse me, and so I had got my hall for Sunday afternoon andevening."After a good night's rest, I went out on the Sunday morning and spokeduring the forenoon in twelve streets, making, of course, myannouncement of the afternoon and evening Meetings. A poor woman whothought I was out singing to get bread came and gave me 11/2_d._saying, 'That's all I have; but you shall have it.' I had to doeverything myself in the afternoon Meeting, for I could not get anybodywho came even to pray. But they gave me twelve shillings. I wanted themto help me hold a Meeting outdoors at 4:30. At 5:30 we had to open thedoors, as so many were waiting to get in, and at six the building waspacked. We kept up the Meeting till after ten o'clock, by which timeseventeen people had come out to seek Salvation."The police sent me a message one Sunday evening, during the Meeting,that they wanted me at the police station. I replied that I was engagedthat evening; but that I was at their service any time after six thenext morning. So they had me up the Monday morning, and sentenced me toa month's imprisonment. But they never enforced it, till I left thetown."In another place we had no Hall, and I have seen my Soldiers in theearly morning trample snow down till it was hard enough for us to kneelupon for our Prayer Meeting."In Tipton one of the Converts was called the 'Tipton Devil.' He oncesold his dead child's coffin for drink. When we got him, a week later,to the Penitent-Form, and I said to him, 'Now you must pray,' he said,'I can't pray.' 'But you must,' I said. After waiting a moment, he justclapped his great rough hands together and said, 'O God, jump down mythroat and squeeze the Devil out.' And then he said the old child'sprayer:--    Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,    Look upon a little child;    Pity my simplicity,    Suffer me to come to Thee.If ever a big rough fellow came 'like a little child' to Jesus he did,for his life from that day was absolutely new."Another of those men's wives sent for me, and said she feared he wasgoing mad, for he had hung up his old ragged clothes on the wall. But wesoon heard him come singing up the street, and he said, 'I've hung themup to remind us all what I was like when Jesus set me free. A lot of ourblokes have turned respectable, and gone and joined the chapel, and Ithought if ever the Devil comes to tempt me that way I'll show him thoseclothes, and say, "The hand that was good enough to pick me up will begood enough to lead me on to the finish."'"So I said to his wife, 'He might do a worse thing: let them hang there,if it helps him any.'"How The Army won so many of its worst opponents to be its Soldiers comesout beautifully in a more recent story."When I was a drunkard," says a poor woman, "I used just to hate TheArmy. But one day, as I was drinking in the 'King George' public-house,I heard them singing to an old tune of my childhood, and that brought meout. I stood and listened, and the Sergeant of the Cadets, who wasleading, came over to me and said:--"'Isn't it very cold? Hadn't you better go home? Don't go back to them,'she said, nodding towards the public-house. And she started to walk withme, and put her jacket round my shoulders. In that moment I felt thatThe Salvation Army was something for me."Not only did this woman get saved, but her husband and children, too, asa result of that loving act.There came times in many cities, both in England and elsewhere, when ouropposers were formally organised against us, under such names as"Opposition and Skeleton Armies," etc. These were organisations, in someinstances so formidable, especially on Sunday afternoons, that at onetime, in 1882, there would be 1,500 police on extra duty to protect usfrom their attack. This, of course, we much disliked, and we gave up ourmarches entirely for a few weeks, so that when we began again the policemight get proper control. They never allowed the formation of thesebands again, for they had learned their lesson by that time. But howmarvellously God helped The General by means of those very oppositions!They brought us into close touch with bodies of young fellows, many ofwhom have since become leaders amongst us.Strange and sad that throughout all the years of our most desperatefighting we scarcely ever found men from the "better classes" daring tomarch with us. One noble exception, Colonel Pepper, of Salisbury, withhis wife, never hesitated, in the roughest times, to take their standwith their humblest comrades, glad to go through whatever came. To Mrs.Pepper The General wrote in 1880:--     "The Colonel will have sent you some information of our Meetings.     But any real description is impossible. Manchester has, in many     respects, surpassed everything. The Colonel, himself, has pleased     me immensely--so humble and willing. When I look at him in the     processions, evidently enjoying them, I cannot help wondering at     what God hath wrought, and praising Him. London seems your place,     and it has been borne in on my mind that the time has come for us     to make an attack on the West End, and to raise a Corps there,     principally out of the proper and decent people. I don't mean out     of the Plymouth Brethren, or the 'evangelical party,' so-called;     but out of the wicked and wretched class who have money and     position and education, and who are floating to Hell with it all.     "I shrink from suggesting further sacrifices to you. God give you     wisdom. We have much success and much trial, and much bitter     opposition. We must have more and more success and more trial, and     more bitter opposition. We must have more intelligent Officers, and     you must help us get them."That West-End attempt, made later by Mrs. Booth, produced for us,indeed, some Officers who have done much for The Army's advancement;although, perhaps, not another Colonel Pepper. The very attacks madeupon us, however, helped to attract the attention of thoughtful people,and to lead to our Meetings persons possessing all the gifts needed forThe Army's world-wide extension.Amongst these were Colonel Mildred Duff, Editress of our papers for theyoung, and authoress of a number of books; Commissioner W. ElwinOliphant, then an Anglican Clergyman; Miss Reid, daughter of a formerGovernor of Madras and now the wife of Commissioner Booth-Tucker, ofIndia; Lieut.-Colonel Mary Bennett, as well as Mrs. de Noe Walker, Dr.and Mrs. Heywood-Smith, and a number of other friends in England andmany other lands who, though never becoming Officers, have in variousways been our steadfast and useful friends and supporters.Surely it can only be a question of time! It is true what our greatMaster said: "Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, notmany noble are called."But, if in the days of our weakness and contempt, it was given us to winsuch a force of honourable women and a man now and then, are we todespair, now that all the world is awakened to the value of our work, ofwinning for it more of the excellent of the earth?The prosecutions of our people by the police also helped us not only toattain notoriety locally, but to gain a much higher standing generally.As soon as The General could find legal ground for appealing against themagistrates' decisions he did so, and this not only obtained for usjudgments that made our pathway clear in the future, but caused the thenLord Chancellor, the late Earl Cairns, Lord Chief Justice Cockburn,Archbishop Tait of Canterbury, Bishop Lightfoot of Durham, and other menof wide influence to speak out in the House of Lords or elsewhere forus.And yet, throughout his entire career, right down to his last days, TheGeneral was at times personally assailed with a malevolence andbitterness that could hardly have been exceeded. It has constantly beensuggested, if not openly stated, that he was simply "making a pile" ofmoney for himself; and yet, as will be seen in our chapter on Finance hemade the most comprehensive arrangements to render suspicion on thisscore inexcusable.But try, if you can, at every turn throughout all this life, wheneveryou hear of General Booth, to realise what it means for such a man,struggling to carry on and extend such a work, to know every minute, dayand night, that he is being accused and suspected of seeking only hisown, all the time. Remember that his nature was perhaps abnormallysensitive about any mistrust or suspicion, and about the confidence ofthose nearest to him. And then you may have some conception of the crosshe had always to bear, and of the wounded heart that went about, foryears, inside that bold and smiling figure.And yet there is, thank God! much of the humorous to relieve ourtensions in The Army. A brother Commissioner of mine remembers seeingThe General sail for the United States for the first time. As thesteamer swung off, a bystander remarked, "So he's off?" "Yes." "And whendo you go?" "Go? What do you mean?" "Well, you will never see him againnow, will you?" And then my comrade fairly took in that the man wasalluding to the continual prophecy of those days that The General, oncehe had got enough, would disappear with all the money he had raised. Sothat man went down to his house laughing, and has been laughing over itnow for twenty-six years!Perhaps The General gained more than can ever be calculated from havingto begin and to carry on his warfare, for a long time, in the very teethof public opinion.    We're marching on to war, we are, we are, we are!    We care not what the people think, nor what they say we are,was one of the favourite choruses which, in his greatest publicdemonstrations in this country, as well as in his ordinary Meetings, hetaught us to sing.Only in this spirit of utter disregard for public opinion have God'sprophets, in all ages, been able to do their work, and only whilst theyremain indifferent to men's scorn and opposition, can the Soldiers ofThe Salvation Army properly discharge their task of "warning andteaching every man," in all wisdom.How indispensable this state of mind is to the individual Convert onlythose who have lived for Christ amongst the hostile surroundings of agreat city can really know. That we have now so many resolute comrades,even amongst the young people, who meet with no encouragement, butrather with every sort of contempt and rebuff in their homes, theirworkshops, and the neighbourhoods in which they live, is alike aremarkable demonstration of the extent to which this great victory hasbeen won, and, at the same time, of the far wider and grander conqueststhat are yet to come.The gigantic enterprises that lie before us, if Christ is really tobecome the First and Last with the millions of Africa, India, Japan, andChina, as with those of America and Europe, would be hopeless were wenot prepared to raise up Soldiers to this great military height ofcontempt for civilian opinion.But it may be that our very attitude in this respect has whetted theenemy's resolution to do all that could be done to prejudice publicopinion against us. The very large measure of popularity or, at anyrate, respect, so far as The Army generally is concerned, in which werejoice to-day, must be attributed to the impression created by the calmpersistence of The General, and those who have truly followed him, indoing what they believed to be right, and turning from all they believedto be doubtful and wrong, in spite of the general condemnation andopposition of those around them.The very people who to-day applaud our efforts to assist the poorest andworst to a self-supporting and honourable career, are often blind to thefact that we have only succeeded by doing the very things which theyonce said we ought not to do, and by turning away from all the oldcustoms to which they would fain have chained us.Chapter XIReproducing The Army in AmericaSo far we have traced the beginnings of The Army in the United Kingdom.But would The General desire or be able to extend it to other countries?With regard to the need for it there is now, at any rate, no dispute inany "Christian country," for almost all intelligent persons, whatevermay be their own creed, or want of creed, admit the presence in theirgreat cities, if not elsewhere, of only too many of the sort of personsto whom The Army has proved useful.But there has been no country in which the need for, or possible valueof, The Army has not been at first hotly disputed. We have seen howdesperately it was at first opposed in the country of its birth. Andthat could not have been possible had not so many really religiouspeople looked upon it as an "un-English" sort of thing, "American" inits ideas and in its style of action. When it was beginning in Scotland,many said that it might be tolerated amidst the godless masses acrossthe border, but that its free style of worship especially "on the Lord'sDay" could not but be "a scandal" in the land of Sabbath stillness;whilst as to Ireland, we were assured that our outdoor proceedings mustneeds lead to bloodshed.When, however, The General resolved to send Officers to America, therewas hardly a voice in either Church or Press which did not ridicule theidea of our being of use there. And in the case of almost every othercountry the same prejudice against English people having "thepresumption to think" that they can give lessons in true religion to anyother nation has made itself more or less felt, even to this day.But, happily, The General never took counsel with flesh and blood uponsuch questions. He knew that, whatever differences might exist betweenone race and another, there was everywhere the one sad similarity whenit came to neglect of God and the soul. That The Army must adapt itselfto each new population he had always taught; but that it wouldultimately succeed wherever there were masses of godless people, henever doubted.Really the first extension to the United States came about, however, byno planning of his. A family belonging to one of the home Corpsemigrated, in 1879, to Philadelphia, where they commenced to holdMeetings there, meeting with such rapid success that two Corps wereraised before the Officers for whom they pleaded could be sent to them.When The General paid his first visit to America, in 1886, we hadalready 238 Corps in the Union, under the leadership of 569 Officers,mostly Americans. Ten years later there came that terrible blow to himand to the Work, when his second son, who had been entrusted with itsdirection for a term, left The Army, and founded a separateorganisation. Notwithstanding the misunderstanding which followed, andthe check to our progress that was necessarily involved, The Army wentsteadily forward, and The General visited the country from time to time,receiving on each occasion a very remarkable welcome.The appreciation of his leadership was always of the more value in theUnited States, because the disinclination of the American people toaccept anything like direction, let alone command, from this side theAtlantic was always so marked. It is this fact which gives such specialvalue to the sort of experiences we are about to record from one of thelater tours of The General, that of 1902-3.Summing up the journey and its general impressions to an old friend, hewrites:--     "Well, I have been busy and no mistake. Day after day, hour after     hour, you might say minute after minute, I have had duties calling     for immediate attention. Oh, it has been a whirl! But what a     wonderful rush of success the nine weeks have been since I landed     at New York.     "The people, the Press, the dignitaries of all classes have     combined in the heartiest of welcomes ever given in this country, I     suppose, to 'a foreigner' of any nationality. It has been     remarkable, and, indeed, surprising, for it was so largely     _unexpected_.     "I have just come into this city of Kansas. The two largest hotels     have competed to have the privilege of giving me their best rooms,     with free entertainment. A monster brewery that illumines the whole     city every night with a search-light has been running alternate     slides, one saying, 'Buy our Lager Beer,' and the other, 'General     Booth at the Convention Hall Monday night.' The building for my     Meeting to-night will hold 8,000 people, and on Saturday 4,000     tickets were already sold.     "You will be a little interested in this because you will know     something of the difficulties that seemed to lie ahead of me when I     started. God has been very good, and I hope my Campaign will do     something towards the forwarding of His wishes in the country."The reception at New York was one of the most enthusiastic The Generalever had. At four o'clock on the Saturday morning, enough of hisfollowers and friends to fill fifteen small steamers had assembled, soas to be sure to be in time to meet his liner. By way of salute, whenthe great steamer appeared, they discharged seventy-three bombs--one foreach year of his life, as yet completed.The _New York Herald_ said of his Sunday there:--     "Eight thousand people heard General William Booth speaking     yesterday at the Academy of Music. The rain had no effect in     keeping either Salvation Army people or the general public from the     Meetings. About one-third of those present wore Salvation Regalia.     "General Booth displayed wonderful energy throughout his fatiguing     day's work. His voice has great carrying power, and the speaker was     distinctly heard throughout the auditorium. Despite the fact that     they could not gain admission to the building, at the evening     service, people remained standing in the drenching rain from 7:30     till after 9 o'clock to see The General leave."     "At the close of his last address," says _The Times_, "167 men and     women had been persuaded to his point of view, and went to the     Mercy-Seat."How generally the whole country, and not merely the central areas, wasstirred by the mere arrival of The General, may be guessed from thefollowing words taken from the _Omaha Daily News_ article of the Mondayfor its readers through far-away Nebraska:--     "One of the arrivals on the steamship _Philadelphia_ is General     William Booth of The Salvation Army. That vessel never carried     before so great a man as this tall, white-haired, white-bearded     organiser, enthusiast, and man-lover.     "Wherever men and women suffer and sorrow and despair, wherever     little children moan and hunger, there are disciples of William     Booth. The man's heart is big enough to take in the world. He has     made the strongest distinct impact upon human hearts of any man     living. This is a man of the Lincoln type. Like Lincoln he has the     saving grace of humour, and sense of proportion. There is something     of the mother-heart in these brooding lovers of their kind. There     is the constraining love that yearns over darkness and cold and     empty hearts. Big hearts are scarce.     "In an age of materialism and greed William Booth has stirred the     world with a passion for the welfare of men. His trumpet-call has     been like the silvery voice of bugles. His spirit will live, not     only in lives made better by his presence, but in the temper of all     the laws of the future."We shall see from the welcomes given to him by great officialpersonages, that these remarks do not in the least exaggerate thefeeling created all over the country by the activities of The Army. HadThe General merely made great proposals he would only have been lookedupon in the generally favourable way in which men naturally regard everyprospector of benevolent schemes. But the country recognised in him theman who, in spite of the extreme poverty of most of his followers, hadraised up, and was then leading on, a force of obedient and efficientservants of all men.The journey was arranged, for economy of time, so as to include a visitto Canada, and its general course was as follows: From New York hetravelled to St. John's, New Brunswick, where the Premier, in welcominghim, said the work of The Salvation Army had "placed General Booth in aposition perhaps filled by no other religious reformer." From NewBrunswick he passed on to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Montreal (where hewas the guest of Earl Grey, the Governor-General), Ottawla, Kingston,Hamilton, London, and Toronto. Thence he returned to the States, andheld Meetings in Buffalo, Chicago, Minneapolis, and St. Paul, DesMoines, Kansas City, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Oakland,Omaha, St. Joseph, St. Louis, Birmingham, Cincinnati, Cleveland,Pittsburg, Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Worcester, in three ofwhich cities he conducted Councils of Officers, in addition to publicMeetings.The impression invariably made wherever he went, was thus ably summed upby the _Chicago Interocean_:--     "No other man _is_ General of an Army of people that circles the     globe. No emperor commands soldiers serving openly under him in     almost every nation of the earth. No other man is called     'commander' by men and women of a hundred nationalities.     "Aside from his power over the great Organisation of which he is     the head, General Booth is one of the world's most remarkable     figures. His eloquence stirs and stings, soothes and wins; and this     eloquence alone would make him famous, even if he had never     undertaken the great work he has done with The Salvation Army.     "As he speaks, his face is radiant with the fervour that carries     conviction. His tall figure and long arms, used energetically in     gestures that add force to what is said, his white hair and beard,     and his speaking eyes, make him an orator whose speeches remain     long in the minds of those who hear them. The feeling of the     members of The Army towards their Commander has in it both the love     and reverence of a large flock of their pastor, and, added to this,     the enthusiasm, loyalty, and energetic spirit of an Army."[Illustration: General Bramwell Booth]Where so wonderful a journey is so filled up with Meetings sodescribed, and where, from the very highest to the lowest all speak sowarmly of him, it is really difficult within the limited space at ourdisposal to give, without danger of monotony, or repetition, anyadequate idea of what took place. Americans are such habitual organisersof huge demonstrations, and are so generally accustomed to say,publicly, without reserve, what they think, that the expression of whatto them may appear perfectly natural runs the risk of creating elsewherean air of exaggeration and unreality. But if we consider that greatAmerican States like Minnesota, Ohio, and Michigan contain moreinhabitants than some of the kingdoms of Europe, and that theirGovernors are men likely to occupy the very highest positions in thegovernment of America, we can realise how effective amongst the massesof the people The General's work must have been before such Governorscould be expected to preside at his Meetings, and to speak of him, asthey did.Said Governor Nash, of Ohio:--     "I never had the privilege of meeting you in person, until I     grasped your hand upon this platform. You have not been unknown,     however, to me or to the people of Ohio. You recognise the fact     that you could not perform this work well without the help of God.     That your work has been well performed is well known to us all from     the fact that the Organisation you have made known as The Salvation     Army has spread throughout the world, turning the feet of     multitudes into the paths of righteousness and peace. It has done     good. It has done a great work wherever it has gone. It is for     these reasons that the people of Ohio welcome you most cordially     to-night, and they and I wish you an abundant harvest in your     life's work, and that at the end you may have the peace and rest     and the joy that God gives to all His own good people."Similar specially religious references to those used by Governor Nashcame constantly into the speeches of other leaders who expressed theirpeople's welcomes to The General, showing how faithfully everyopportunity was being utilised to exalt Christ, amongst even the mostunusual crowds assembled on these occasions.Governor Cummins, of Iowa, said:--     "I have long wanted an opportunity to express publicly my     appreciation of the grand, noble, and untiring work that every day     is being performed by those noble and unselfish men and women, who     have gathered under the Flag of The Salvation Army, loved and     esteemed throughout the whole world.     "In every army there is a leader. The Salvation Army has a Leader     whose commanding figure towers above the Salvationists of the     world, and has drawn to himself more love, more respect, and more     confidence than at this moment centres in any other human being. Of     him it will be said, after he has passed to the beautiful shores of     the hereafter, the best that can be said of any man, that the world     is better because he lived in it."Lest The General should have been too much puffed up by all hissuccesses and the praises showered upon him, God almost at the end ofthe tour allowed an accident which might easily have ended his career;but which only gave him an opportunity to show more conspicuously thanever his resolution to persevere in his ceaseless labours.It was whilst passing along a dark passage in New York that The Generalstumbled, and, but for God's great goodness, would have fallen into acellar. As it was, one leg was very much bruised and hurt. He thusdescribed, in writing, to a friend what followed:--     "March 13, 1903.--The accident came at a very unfortunate moment,     and at the onset it looked like spoiling the closing chapters of     the Campaign.     "But God is good. I was favoured with the services of one of the     most skilful and experienced surgeons in New York. He put my leg     into starch, and then into a plaster of Paris jacket. And by dint     of resolution, and the supporting Spirit of my Heavenly Father, I     went through the last Meeting with apparent satisfaction to     everybody about me, and some little comfort to myself.     "It was a great effort. The Hall is one of the finest and most     imposing I ever spoke in. Three tiers of boxes all round full with     the swell class of people in whom you are so much interested, with     two galleries beyond.     "It called for some little courage to rise up with my walking-stick     to steady me; but God helped me through. I hung my stick on the     rail, and balanced myself on my feet, and talked the straightest     truth I could command for an hour and twenty minutes.     "A little spectacular function followed in the shape of trooping     the Colours of the different nationalities amongst whom we are at     work in the States, and a midnight torchlight procession, with a     massed farewell from the balcony of the Headquarters, closed the     Campaign.     "I am doing the voyage fairly well. Of course, it is very     wearisome, this lying all the time. The ship is rolling and tossing     and pitching considerably, and it looks like doing so, until we get     under shelter of the land."The probable after-effect of these distant Campaigns of The Generalcould not be better described than in the words of one of our AmericanOfficers, himself known throughout The Army as one of our mostspiritually-minded and intelligent observers:--     "Seventeen years ago," he says, "the writer first heard The     General, and it has been his privilege to hear him many times     since. Each succeeding effort and series of Meetings seems to     eclipse all the rest. It was so in Pittsburg, which, being one of     the greatest business centres and home of some of the most virile     men of the world, deeply appreciates him.     "He was very weary from his heavy Campaign in Cleveland, but, in     spite of this, to me he seemed at his best. He spent no time in     angling to get into sympathetic touch with them, but with the     precision of a bullet he made direct for the conscience of every     man and woman there. Talk about 'naked truth,' 'judgment,'     'daylight,' 'straight preaching.' We had it that night, as I never     heard it before. There was no escape. Every honest person there had     to pass judgment on himself.     "It was difficult to close that Meeting. The truth was setting men     free. Many wept and prayed and submitted to God, and some fairly     howled at the revelation God gave them of their character and     conduct. It has been my privilege to hear such preachers as     Beecher, Matthew, Simpson, and Phillips Brooks, and such orators as     Wendell Phillips and Gough; but The General is the greatest master     of assemblies I ever met. He played on those vast audiences of     judges, lawyers, ministers, business and working men as Ole Bull     played on the violin. They laughed, they wept, they hung their     heads with conviction, their bosoms heaved with emotions, they were     convinced, convicted, and a multitude were converted. I think at     one time there could not have been less than 3,000 eyes brimming     with tears. He uncovered sin and made it appear as it is, utterly     without excuse, and utterly loathsome; and then he revealed the     love and sympathy and helpfulness of Christ, till many could not     resist, but had to yield.     "A lawyer said to me the next day that the sermons and lecture were     the most wonderful he had ever heard. Another lawyer who had been     to each Meeting stayed in his place till the very close on Sunday     night, saying that he could not tear himself away.     "The common people heard him gladly, and the uncommon people were     overwhelmed with admiration, and conviction. A young lady,     belonging to one of the best families in the city, just home from     Paris, where she had been studying art, heard him and could not     refrain from leaving the box in which she sat and going to the     Penitent-Form. She went home truly converted.     "The wave of power and conviction did not cease when The General     left; and during the next four days we saw fifty-eight persons at     the Penitent-Form."The special value of all these American testimonies to the effect of TheGeneral's brief visits, lies in the fact that they show the triumph ofthe War plan of God, just in the circumstances where weaklings aretempted to yield to public opinion, substitute orations for realrighting for souls, and to press nobody to an immediate decision, orchange of heart and life.There can be no doubt that The Army's invariable fight against the drinkhas helped to make its General so highly honoured amongst Americanstatesmen. But in that, as in everything else, the important fact tonote is that it was by establishing an absolute authority that hesecured the faithful carrying on of the campaign against drink and everyother evil at every spot where our Flag flies.The eyes of the whole world have, in our day, been more or less openedto the ruinous character of the drink traffic, and The General and hisforces, whilst keeping out of the political arena, have mightily helpedthe agitations that have ended in the exclusion of the drink trafficaltogether from many states and cities, and its limitation, in manyways.But much less notice has been taken of other evils, which have no lessabsorbed the attention, and spoiled the means, the minds, and the soulsof the masses. The sight daily in every great English-reading city whenthe sporting editions of the newspapers appear, ought indeed to arouseevery follower of Christ. But the habit of irresponsibility that hasgrown up in most "Christian" circles has still to be fought againsteverywhere, and The General's persistent testimony against it, indeedthe whole theory of a Divine Army and of War, must remain for ever oneof the strongest features of his life's work. The old song:--    Arm me with jealous care,      As in Thy sight to live;    And, Oh, Thy servant, Lord, prepare      A strict account to give,has expressed the thought behind all the arrangements of our Army. Andit is remarkable how, in the midst of the general indifference, so largea measure of this "jealous care" for God and souls has been awakened andmaintained.Nowhere, alas! does the theory of irresponsibility find a more congenialsoil than in the very places and services where God is most feared,honoured, and obeyed. His doors are indeed opened to the world; butwhether anybody enters them or no is the care of but sadly too few.Hymns are so announced as to make it easy for all to join in singingthem, if they choose. But whether the words are sung by many, or only bya proficient few, and above all, whether hearts as well as voices areraised in prayer and praise to God, is too often a matter of absoluteindifference to almost every one.How The General altered all that, wherever his influence was felt! Hemade all his people understand that not merely are they responsible forunderstanding and heeding God's commands themselves, but for enforcingattention to them, as those who must give account of their success orfailure.The sister leader of some little Meeting in the far-away Outpost of aCorps, thousands of miles from the centre, when she insists upon havinga verse sung for the third time because "I'm sure some of you lads werenot half singing," has little idea of the religious revolution sherepresents. That the dislike of so many for any "such innovations"continues, may help to convince any one who thinks of the urgent needthere was, and is still, for the substitution of responsible forirresponsible leadership in "Divine Service."During his visit to the United States in 1907 The General had a severeillness which seriously threatened to cut short his career. His deathwas indeed cabled as an item of news from Chicago. But the report was,as Mark Twain would have said, "grossly exaggerated." Nobody willwonder, however, at his having been ill when they read CommissionerLawley's report. He writes:--     "We have calculated that in the thirteen meetings of his New York     Campaign the General was on his feet speaking about twenty-six and     three-quarters hours.     "He spent less than six weeks in the Country, travelled about 3,700     miles by train, spoke about eighty-five hours to fifty audiences,     before conferring many hours with leading Officers, and talking to     the Newspaper Reporters in each town he visited."An Officer describing his illness wrote:--     "I never shall forget his effort to ascend the staircase of the     Commissioner's house on Friday morning after his victory at     Milwaukee the night before. The veteran Warrior had to rest his     head and hands on the rail and pray 'My Lord.' It was clear to me     that the chill he had sustained days before, and which he fought in     vain against would make him a prisoner for days."What that meant to him when he was already announced for a number ofother cities can be imagined.His symptoms the following day were very serious, and one cannot but beglad that he had at his side at the time his daughter--Commander EvaBooth. Under her loving care, and with all the help of Doctors andMasters that could be got in Chicago, The General recovered so as to beable to go on after a few days with his interrupted tour, after which hewrote in his farewell letter to his American Troops:--     "I have been impressed with the great improvement in the devotion,     spirituality and Blood and Fire character of the forces already in     existence. I have also most pleasantly gratified by a conviction of     the possibility of raising a force in the United States that shall     not only be equal to the demand made upon it by the conditions of     the country but of supplying me with powerful reinforcements of men     and money for the mighty task of bringing the whole world to the     feet of Jesus."During this visit, The General and the Commander were received byPresident Roosevelt at the White House. The General was presented withthe freedom of the City of Philadelphia, and after going through thegigantic final week described alone in New York was able to sail directto Germany for his usual great Repentance Day in Berlin, and he wasalready seventy-eight years old.Need it be said that whilst in this book little mention is made of anyone but The General himself, it not having been his habit in hisjournals to refer to those with whom he was for the time associating, weare not to suppose that at any rate in recent years he was anywherefighting alone. In Heaven no doubt the victory won in many a crowdedbuilding was put down to the credit of someone whom few if any of thoseoccupying the front of the platform would have mentioned; but as aresult of whose prayers, faith and effort the audience was gathered orthe results attained.It would have been very unfair to the great majority of his Officers tohave called frequent or special attention to the small English Staff whousually accompanied him, for not only the Commissioners and ChiefSecretaries but the Officers of every nationality labouredsystematically to make the most of his visits to any particular placeand to render to the largest possible extent the results of each visitpermanent.This may possibly seem specially and curiously unfair in the UnitedStates and Denmark, yet it will only make[1] the principle of thisomission from The General's own records and ours the more clear.It will doubtless be expected that I make some comment upon the painfulseparation from him of three of his own children which were amongst thesaddest events of The General's life, and, yet, I feel it best to saynothing.It is not within the scope of this book to tell "all about it," andtelling part could only cause misunderstanding. So I leave it, and hopeeveryone else will do the same.Chapter XIIIn AustralasiaThe entire programme of every tour The General made emphasises sostrongly his advocacy of hard work that one really hesitates to pick outany one Campaign as more remarkable than another. What is, however,extraordinary in connexion with one of his far-away Australian journeysis our having letters which so much more than any others giveparticulars of his doings.     "I am resting to-night, and well I think my poor body has earned     some kind of respite. Such a ten days' work I never did before of     sheer hard work. How I have come through it, and come through so     well, I cannot understand, except that God has indeed been my     Helper."Here is another side-light on The General's own inner life which we getby the way. We conceal, of course, the identity of the lady in question,except to say that it was a very distinguished hostess with whom he hadoccasion to spend some hours when travelling.     "It was perhaps the loveliest journey I ever had. I talked nearly     all the time, and, in fact, had no alternative. But I think I ought     to have made a more desperate and definite attack on her soul than     I did. She is a very intelligent and amiable lady, and I have no     doubt I made an impression.     "Good-bye. Go on praying and believing for me. I want to be a flame     of fire wherever I go. I thank God for the measure of love and     power I have. _But I must have more._ I am pushing everybody around     me up to this--the inward burning love and zeal and purity. I wish     our _best_ men were _more spiritual_. Give my tenderest love to     all."In each of The General's visits to Australia there was much of the samecharacter; but from the letters to his children which he wrote on one ofthem, we can extract enough to give some idea of what he saw and felt inpassing through those vast regions:--     "What the reception (at Melbourne) would have been had it not been     for the torrents of rain I cannot imagine. Although it was known     that I could not get in before six or seven o'clock, there was a     great mass of several thousand people waiting at three o'clock. As     it was we did not get into the Exhibition Building till ten, and a     vast crowd had been sitting inside from five, and stayed to hear me     talk till 10:45.     "I had an immense Meeting--they say 5,000 were present on the     Sunday morning, 7,000 in the afternoon, with as many more turned     away.     "The opportunity here is immense beyond conception. The people are     delightful, and the Officers also. If they were my own sons and     daughters, I don't see how either Officers or Soldiers could have     been much more affectionate."How great was the strain of the Meetings may be guessed from thefollowing remarks as to the final one:--     "I trembled as I rose. You must understand that the Hall down which     I spoke is about 400 to 450 feet long, and that on this occasion a     partition about ten feet high was drawn across it, some 300 feet     from the spot on which I stood, so that my voice had to travel all     through the entire length of the building before it met with any     obstruction, whilst behind me there was at least another seventy     feet. The Press estimate the crowds at 10,000; but, that is an     exaggeration. There would be 7,000, at least. I had taken the     precaution to send an Officer to the far end to see how far he     could or could not hear me, and he brought back word 'excellently.'     So I drove ahead, speaking over an hour and a half, and not losing     the attention of my audience for a moment. Indeed, I felt I had the     whole house from the moment I opened my lips. Of course, it was the     greatest physical effort a long way that I ever made, and,     considering that it was my seventh address in that 'dreadful'     building, and that I commenced with a bad throat, exhausted with     the fatigues and miseries of the voyage, and that I had     ceaselessly worked at smaller Meetings, etc., all the four days, I     do think it very wonderful how I went through it, and I must     attribute it to the direct holding up and strengthening of the dear     Lord Himself.     "On all hands I think a deep impression was made. To God be the     glory, and to my poor constituents, for whom I live and plead, be     the benefit.     "I am tired this morning, but shall get a little rest to-day and a     little extra sleep in the train. We leave for Bendigo at twelve     o'clock, arriving at four for Meeting to-morrow. We go to Geelong     next day, coming back here on Friday morning, and leaving at five     for Sydney, travelling all night, and arriving there about noon on     Saturday.     "You will get tired of hearing of this round of Meetings, and of     the very echo of this enthusiasm; but you will, I am sure, rejoice,     not merely that the people of this new world have welcomed your     father and General with such heartiness, but that there is for The     Army such an open door in these parts."That is indeed what lends such endless importance to the recital whichwe cannot help reporting ever and anon of The General's Meetings in eachcountry to which he went. It was not the mere coming together of crowdsto listen to a speaker, but the enthusiastic acceptance and endorsementof a system, and of demands made by a perfect stranger in which he sodelighted. The General never went anywhere merely to preach or lecture.All that he did in that way was always so combined with SalvationCampaigns that at every step he was really recruiting for The Army.Hence his every movement, the reports of his journeys, the conversationshe held with all whom he met, everything told in the one great War andhelped to create, more and more all over the world, this force of men,women, and children, pledged to devote themselves to the service ofChrist and of mankind.There is a very interesting account of a visit to a State School,especially as it shows The General's keenness to learn, for The Army,anything possible:--     "At ten o'clock I went by the request of Mrs. McLean, the lady     with whom I am staying, to visit one of her State Schools. I was     met at the door by the managers and members of the board, who     conducted me through the building.     "There were over 1,000 children in ten different classrooms. I was     much interested in them, and spoke in each room, so that I began     the day with at least ten little sermons.     "I was very much struck with the singing of the children, rendered     very effective with some corresponding action with the arms and     feet, which gave life and vigour to the thing. I am satisfied that     we might follow this plan out with very good effect in our Army     singing. The little that is done is always appreciated."And so whilst the Secular Australian Schools got some little gleam ofthe heavenly light, the aged General saw and passed on to all his world,a valuable suggestion that has since been taken up and acted uponeverywhere in our Children's Meetings and demonstrations.And then he passes at once to quite another department of hisactivities. He always exercised the same care in every country, which wehave already described as to England to ensure the careful settlement ofall property acquired for The Army, so that it may be, as nearly aspossible, made certain that nothing given to the one Army should ever beremoved out of the control of its central authority. How much of timeand care this has demanded will be readily understood by those who haveany experience in property matters, and who know how widely laws andlegal usages differ in different countries:--     "I had an interview with Mr. Maddocks, our solicitor out here--a     very nice fellow indeed, and I should think capable withal. He     seems to grasp the idea of The Army government, and to be anxious     to co-operate with us in such a settlement of our property as will     be in harmony with it."Only by means of many such interviews, and all the care they represent,was it possible, under the laws of such thoroughly democratic States, toleave the local holders of authority under The General's completefreedom of aggressive action, and yet to secure that everything theyacquired with The Army's funds should remain for all time at thedisposal, for The Army only, of a General with his office at the otherside of the world.And then we go on to the journey during which he was hoping "to get someextra sleep"!     "At twelve, left for Bendigo, arriving about four o'clock. Was very     weary on the journey, and had to turn out two or three times to     address the crowds waiting to listen to me on station platforms.     "Bendigo is a town of some 30,000 people, entirely made and     sustained by the gold-digging industry. An immense amount of the     precious metal has been taken here, and sufficient is being secured     still to make it a paying concern, although the miners have to go     to a considerable depth in order to secure the quartz.     "We had a public reception, and they had made a general holiday of     it in the place. People must have come in from miles around to help     make up such a crowd. They pulled up at a splendid fountain in the     centre of the town, intending to separate with three cheers for The     General; but I could not withstand the temptation, and made quite a     little sermon about saving their souls, and serving God."It is this interest both in the everyday occupations and resources ofthe people, and of the tours they made which, joined with all hisintense concern about the soul, constituted The General and all whotruly follow him, the true brethren of all mankind. It must ever beremembered, to the credit of Australia, that its leading men were thefirst to recognise this characteristic of our Officers, and to lend themall the influence of their public as well as private countenance andsympathy. It is this fact which makes it a permanent pleasure to recordtheir kindnesses to The General.     "Came on to Melbourne, on my way to Sydney. Met a body of     representative men to lunch, amongst them Sir James McBain,     President of the Upper Chamber, Mr. Deakin, an ex-Cabinet     Minister, a very nice fellow indeed, a man who appears to me to     have more capacity than any one I have yet met in the Colonies. He     made a speech, and at the close drew me on one side, and said he     wanted to do something for us, and if I could only tell him what it     should be on my return to Melbourne, he would be very glad to do     it.     "I am sure he is prepared to be a good friend. He is a coming Prime     Minister, I should think."(The General had no idea then that all Australasia would, so soon, beunited into one Commonwealth, much less that Mr. Deakin would, for somany of the next ten years, be Premier of the whole.)But a remark he once made respecting the reported scepticism of somehighly-placed Colonials might be made with regard, alas! to many"statesmen" of Christian lands nowadays, and we cannot but see in thatfact, and in the friendliness of so many such persons with us, a tokenof the meaning both of the scepticism, and The Army's position. In howmany instances have men, moving in influential circles, met with aChristianity manifestly formal and carrying with it no impress ofreality! How natural for them to sink into scepticism! But the momentthey encounter men who convince them instantly that they believe theBible they carry, scepticism retires in favour of joyous surprise, andwithout any desire to discuss doctrines, they become our lifelongfriends.The General's ability in securing the assistance of all sorts of men,including those whose religious opinions widely differed from his own,or who had got none at all, was remarkable. When reproached, as he wassometimes, for taking the money even of sporting men, he would alwayssay that he only regretted that he had not got a larger amount, and thathe reckoned the tears of the poor creatures that would be relieved wouldwash the money clean enough in the sight of God for it to be acceptablein His sight.     "Met Mr.----. He is interested in our Maternity work, and promised     some time back to assist us with the Hospital we are proposing to     erect. He is a multi-millionaire. He promised L2,500 right     away--L1,500 when the sum of L23,500 had been raised, making     thereby a total of L25,000 with which building operations could be     commenced.     "He is a young man; sprightly and generous, I should think. I     wanted him to make his promise L5,000 in round figures. But he     simply said, 'I cannot promise.' We shall see!"The following description of one Australian night ride may give someidea both of the eagerness of the people to hear him, and of the amountof fatigue The General was able to endure:--     "We left at 5 P.M. The journey was certainly unique in my history.     Six or seven times in that night, or early morning, was I fetched     out of my carriage to deliver addresses. The Mayors of two of the     towns were there to receive me, with crowds all placed in orderly     fashion, with torches burning, everything quiet as death while I     spoke, and finishing up only with the ringing of the departing bell     of the train and the hurrahs of the people.     "At two in the morning, at Wagga-Wagga, of Tichborne fame, they     fairly bombarded my carriage shouting, 'General Booth, won't you     speak to us? Won't you come out?' But I thought you could really     have too much of a good thing.     "At another station, after speaking for the twenty minutes allowed     for breakfast, a lady put through the window a really superb     English breakfast, as good as ever I had in my life, with     everything necessary for eating it, and as we went off she added,     'Mind, I am a Roman Catholic.'     "The reception at Sydney was enormous, they say never surpassed,     and only equalled once at the burial of some celebrated oarsman who     died on the way from England. They had arranged a great reception     for him, and they gave it to his corpse. The enthusiasm of the     Meetings is Melbourne over again."The General's almost invariable escape from illness during so many yearsof travelling, in so many varying climates and seasons, can only beattributed to God's special guidance and care. In Melbourne, influenzaraged in the home where he was billetted, and seized upon one of theOfficers travelling with him. And yet he escaped, and could resume hisjourney undelayed. In South Africa, when he was seventy-nine, another ofhis companions in travel was separated from him for days by severeillness; but The General, in spite of a milder attack of the same sort,was able to fulfil every appointment made for him.Best of all, however, was the peculiarly blessed inward experience whichhe enjoyed amidst all the outward rush of the Australian tour. It hasbeen so often suggested by truly excellent men that the soul cannotenjoy all the fulness of fellowship with God without a great deal ofretirement from men, that we should like to have The General's innerlife fairly exhibited, if it were only in order for ever to bury thismonstrous and, we might also say blasphemous, superstition, which has sooften been supported by one or two quotations from the Gospel, though indefiance of the whole story of Christ, and of every promise He evermade.Of what value could a Saviour be who drew back from helping His ownmessengers upon the ridiculous pretence that they were too busy doingHis bidding, and did not spend enough time "seeking Him for themselves"?     "Just a P.S. to say that God is wonderfully with me. I don't think     that I ever in the midst of a great Revival had a more powerful     time than last night. It was nothing short of a miracle. I had no     definite line ready, and had no time to get one. I preached an old     sermon at Melbourne, just because I must have something straight     before me that I could shout out to that immense crowd, and I had a     wonderful time; but last night God helped me in every way. The     power upon the people was really wonderful at times."Little did most of his own Soldiers guess the extreme strain of inwardweight and struggle under which The General was often labouring justwhen in some great assembly he appeared to every one to be overflowingwith youthful gaiety and self-confidence.The following letter to his youngest daughter, and some entries in hisdiary, will give some idea of the inner victory he really gained on manysuch occasions.Commissioner Lawley, mentioned in this letter, was The General's almostconstant companion and helper in many years' travel in many lands,leading the singing, soloing, managing the Prayer Meetings, andgenerally aiding in every arrangement, a true armour-bearer and comradeat every turn:--     "Fair night; might have been better. Plenty of weakness; still,     better than it often is.     "Lawley just been in; he is not over well; says we have got the     biggest theatre (The Empire). He is not quite sure whether its     suitability for talking is beyond the Coliseum at Glasgow, but he     thinks the Meetings are rather heavy for a sick man, whom four     doctors have been conjuring during the week to 'settle down' and     take things quietly, under pain and penalties of the sufferings     described.     "However, I am going on with faith that God won't forsake me. It is     very probable that Mr. MacDougal said something of the same kind     when he retired to rest on his last sleep, and failing to appear in     the morning was found by his son with life extinct, gone to live by     sight; anyway, to have some further assistance to sight through his     faith in the Better Land.     "This has been one of the most remarkable of the many remarkable     days of my history.     "I passed a weary night, and felt altogether unfit for the task     before me. The natural force seemed to have passed out of me, both     mentally and physically. In fact, my heart failed me, and there     seemed nothing before me but the prospect of slackening down. I was     only kept going by the memory of so many deliverances brought out     for me in the past.     "We had one of the largest audiences, and the biggest crowd I ever     addressed in a single day. In the morning it appeared that Satan     sat at my door, suggesting all sorts of discouraging things. He     tried to make me believe that my public work was done, and     especially suggesting that I should renounce the subject on which I     was talking, and wait for better days before I attempted to talk     again. The Prayer Meeting that followed was certainly encouraging.     We had twenty-seven out. Still, I came away with very much the same     feeling that had been aroused while I was talking. I took a little     refreshment, and tried to get a little sleep, but my mind was too     much agitated to allow of it. I woke up and called for the notes     of my lecture. My mind could not put two and two together hardly,     and so I gave up in despair and left myself to my fate. On my way     to the Meeting, however, a strange feeling came over me. It was     like the sun through a rift in the black clouds, and all at once a     spirit of tenderness, hope, and faith came over me. A voice in my     soul seemed to say, 'Go and do the Lord's work, and the people will     gather; go for their souls, and all will be well.' I accepted the     command, my fears vanished, a spirit of confidence took possession     of me, I rose, I addressed the crowd for an hour and twenty minutes     with all the physical vigour and mental liberty I could desire.     "Night. A terrific crowd. I talked for an hour and ten minutes with     the same force and fervour as in my most successful efforts; 147     came on to the stage in the After Meeting."It was thus in the smaller matters of personal strength and health, asin the greatest affairs, that The General struggled, believed, andtriumphed all through his career.Australasia has gone farther than most countries towards Statesocialism. But it was well remarked by some statesman many years ago,"We are all socialists now."No man within his times was more intensely devoted to the cause of thepoor than William Booth. He was indifferent to no practical scheme oreffort for the improvement of the people's condition in any land. Butfor that very reason he loathed, with uncommon vigour, such socialism aswould spurn and crush out of the world the man who is no longer infirst-class physical condition or desirous of earning an honest livingby hard work, instead of going about to create hatred between man andman, and would prevent those who will not submit to any man's dictationfrom leaving their families to starve when work is to be obtained.The General's indignation was specially aroused when "socialist"spouters tried to block all his plans of beneficence with their foulmisrepresentations. He fought every such attempt with the utmostdetermination, and by the help of God and the more intelligent of hisfellow-countrymen, crushed every such attack more completely than thepublic sometimes knew, for he resolutely kept out of any political orsocial agitation and went calmly on his way, even when his quietude ledthe enemy to imagine that he was yielding. In later years, when all thepressmen of a city came together to meet him, the Social Democraticpaper representative would, of course, come with the rest. On theoccasion of such an interview once in Denmark, he writes:--     "The Social Democrat usually contents himself by compassionating     the inadequacy of my efforts for dealing with the miseries which     they contemplate, with the remark that I don't go deep enough, that     mine is a superficial operation, whereas they destroy poverty by     dragging it up by the roots!     "My notion is that the principles upon which my efforts are founded     carry me to the lowest roots of all, namely, the selfishness of     human nature. Their notion is that capital is the root of the     misery. Destroy the capital, or rather I expect they mean divide it     up, or let everybody have the benefits that flow out of its     possession. My notion is that the roots of the selfishness are to     be found in human nature itself."Chapter XIIIWomen And ScandinaviaFor a number of years it was The General's custom to conduct the annualreview of our Swedish troops at Sodertelge, a beautiful seaside spot,near enough to Stockholm to make it easily accessible, and yet farenough down the Fjord to make the journey thither a very delightfulexcursion.The sight of from fifteen to twenty steamers crowded with Salvationistsmaking their way, with streaming banners, music and song, to the campground, was almost like a glimpse of the coming glory when the wholeearth should rejoice before the Lord. But, of course, there came alwaysto that great gathering a sufficient number of the unconverted tofurnish abundant opportunity for conquests to be made, and the greatMeetings, lasting throughout the day, never broke up without theingathering of many souls.The Councils for Officers which followed during the next few days inStockholm and elsewhere, gave The General great opportunities to confirmand extend the influence of his teachings throughout the whole of theseNorthern countries.Some of The General's earlier visits to Sweden were, however, still moreinteresting, and perhaps even more permanently effective, because, as weshall see, they helped the newly-rising force, enlisted under theirfirst leader--a devoted woman--to gain some liberty for demonstrationsand other work outside their own buildings such as they had not hadbefore, and strengthened them in their resolution to fight, whilstalmost all their fellow-countrymen still looked down upon them withdisdain if not with hatred. It is difficult to realise now what adreadful thing The Army in those days must have appeared. Huge crowdsgathered from the very first to the Meetings, convened in theatres andother public buildings by Major, now Commissioner Ouchterlony, a Swedishlady who had been appointed by The General to inaugurate the Work in herown land; but the bulk of the population seemed to regard her as thoughshe was a suffragette, advocating window-breaking or something worse.This will explain some of the facts The General records in his diary ofhis visit seven years later. The journey began with a great Meeting atHull, after which the traveller went on board his steamer for amiserable two days' voyage to Gothenburg. After Meetings there heproceeded to Sundsvall, a city from which point his Journal reads:--     "At the conclusion of the evening Meeting the dear Soldiers flocked     to the station, crowding the platform and expressing, as far as     opportunity served them, their love for me, and their desire that     God should bless me. I spoke to them for a few minutes; then came     the signal and the start, and then as we slowly moved off     handkerchiefs were waved, volleys of 'Amens' were fired, the Band     played, and away we were borne out into the darkness. All this was     like a dream to my comrades, as neither the railway officials nor     the police had hitherto allowed a word to be spoken or a note of     music to be played outside our Halls.     "All that night and all the following day we travelled to     Stockholm, which we reached at 6 p.m. Crowds awaited our arrival.     The Soldiers had come down in force, wearing sashes on which the     words, 'God bless The General,' 'Welcome,' and other devices had     been worked. The police had come too. There were 200 of them--some     mounted and some on foot. Our people had been formed into an avenue     down which I passed to an open space. Every face wore a smile, but     there was comparative silence. The Police Master had insisted that     there should be no volley firing or shouting. But hands and     handkerchiefs were waved, and every one appeared delighted. We were     soon in a carriage, galloping off to the Headquarters where we were     to stay."If all that The General has done for the attainment of a larger libertyby the peoples of every land were recorded, one might easily make himappear as a great political reformer. But whilst consistently aiming atthe one great purpose of all his journeys and Meetings, the Salvation ofsouls, he has, incidentally, done more to stir the humblest and leastcapable to great nation-rousing efforts than any mere political reformercan hope to do.During this first visit of twelve days to Sweden, he travelled by railover 3,000 kilometres (say 2,000 miles), held twenty-eight publicMeetings, besides a number of private ones with press interviews, andwayside gatherings at railway stations. Five nights were spent in thetrains, mostly in crowded compartments, for the days of comfortable"sleepers" on all lines had not yet come. He had, besides hisinterpreter, a young English companion, who paid his own expenses, andhe could seldom be persuaded to take any refreshment whilst travellingthat could not be got in the carriage. It must not be forgotten that inwinning and retaining the enthusiastic affection of such multitudes ofpersons, The General has had to face the difficulty of only being ableto speak through an interpreter, and that he has had to endure campaignsof opposition and slander, of which we can say very little, but which,founded so largely as they have been upon his being "a foreigner," havehad so good a chance to build up walls of difficulty before him.After this tremendous journey and reception, The General continues:--     "In the night Meeting I felt a little nervous. The Riding School     was nearly full, another 100 persons would have filled every seat,     although a charge had been made for admission, in order to help     with the heavy expenses.     "Many had stayed away for fear of the crush. The audience, which     was most respectable, included the Police Master. I was very tired,     and no particular topic had been announced. However, I spoke an     hour and a half, and all seemed intensely interested.     "Sunday.--The Riding School was full for the morning Holiness     Meeting. Much power. About 100 stood up to make a full surrender of     themselves to God.     "In the afternoon the Hall was again full. The police, of whom     there were twenty present, would only allow persons to stand in the     end aisles. Spoke an hour or more.     "Night. Full an hour before the time. Many convicted. About twelve     pressed forward.     "Monday.--Inspected new Hall and Training Home--building to cost     L5,000. Also visited present Training Home and attended to     correspondence.     "At night the Riding School was full long before we arrived. Spoke     two hours. Immense impression seemed to be produced.     "Tuesday.--Morning, addressed Officers and Cadets. One o'clock,     Meeting of Clergy and Evangelistic workers, at which 300 were     present. Spoke an hour, and answered questions for an hour. Was     enabled, I think, to answer all objections, putting every one to     silence.     "Dined with Lieutenant Lagercrantz of the King's army. He is a dear     fellow, and he has a dear wife. They are in deep sympathy with us.     She put on a bonnet and riband that night.     "I was determined to have a free Meeting for the poorest, a charge     for admission having been made for all the Meetings yet held in     Stockholm. So called one at 6 p.m. in our own Hall in the south of     the city. At six we were quite full. I spoke an hour or more, and     some twenty or more came out for a clean heart. Closed at 8.15 p.m.     "At 8.30 p.m. Soldiers' Meeting. Some 500 were present. Spoke for     nearly two hours. At the close cleared the front as a Mercy Seat,     and nearly all in the place--Officers, Cadets, and Soldiers--went     down in company after company. The wonderful Meeting closed about     midnight.     "Wednesday.--Rose at 6 a.m., not having had much sleep. Away in     Norrkoeping at 7.30 a.m. Arrived at 2.30 p.m. Meeting at 3.30 p.m.     in a great church, where 800 were present. Good time. Very tired.     "Night. I,500 present. Talked two hours. Afterwards, at 10.30 p.m.,     had a Meeting for Soldiers. Got home about 11.45 p.m.     "Thursday.--Meeting at 10 a.m. to say 'Farewell.' Spoke about an     hour, and left at one o'clock for Lynkoeping, arriving at 2.30 p.m.     Meeting in our beautiful Theatre at 2.30 p.m. Fine audience."Mere lack of space forbids further quotation. But surely enough hasbeen said to show with what marvellous exertion The General managed inone brief journey to do so much for all classes, and so much not merelyin the way of Meetings but of organisation and administration in everyway.And the diary tells us nothing of his talks with Officers betweenMeetings, which have formed so important a part of all his travels. Bymeans of such conversations, especially in the case of Officers who arenot English, The General has gained a close knowledge of them and theirdifficulties as they have of his thoughts and wishes.Between his arrival at Gothenburg and his Sundsvall Meetings came arough journey to Norway, where we had as yet no Officers, yet where,nevertheless, a great Meeting had been arranged for by friends, wholater helped in the establishment of our work in their country! TheGeneral passed on to Denmark, where our work was in its first year.On the afternoon of his arrival he tells us he rested, wrote upcorrespondence and journal, and had some little thought about the comingMeetings.     "Night. Welcome Meeting in the Methodist Church. Packed. There must     have been nearly 1,300 people present. The admission was free, and     there were many Philistines, some socialists, and some lads bent on     mischief. To add to our difficulties, my interpreter did his work     so miserably that we had some confusion and restlessness. After an     hour's talk, I paused for the collection to be taken, and changed     interpreters. The second one did very much better. His voice,     however, was feeble and his manner very quiet, so that things were     not very much better for a time. Then we had a little quiet, and a     decent finish. It was a considerable disappointment, however, and     next door to a defeat. I retired to rest very sad, and with awkward     forebodings about the coming Meetings.     "The great funereal vault of a church, the interpreting, the     mocking young fellows void of any sense of honour or conscience to     appeal to, or any respect for a stranger, the intense anxiety of     the Officer in command to have good Meetings, and above all my     longings to meet the needs of the hungry crowd, only wanting to     hear, and many of them equally willing to obey: these and other     troubling thoughts haunted my mind and spoiled my night's sleep.     But I fell back on my old remedy, and, comforting myself in the     Lord, resolved to do what could be done and left myself in His     hands.     "Sunday.--11 a.m. Had a local minister to translate; he did well.     Some fifty or sixty stood up at the close as seekers for a clean     heart.     "Afternoon. The great church packed. Interpretation went fairly     well. Began at 3 p.m. and went on till 5.20 p.m.     "Night. Police sent up word soon after six that the street was     filling up, and the doors must be opened. When this was done the     young fellows who had made so much trouble on Saturday night--or at     least some hundreds of this class--forced their way in through all     else, leaving hundreds more outside. They talked and laughed, and     although now and then a policeman marched a row of them out,     their game went on, spoiling everything.     "The voice of the interpreter was weak, and the confusion flustered     him. So my dreams of a smash and of a hundred seekers were not     realised, and we terminated with some six or seven gathered out of     the crowd immediately near to the platform.     "It was a great disappointment. I felt beaten, and went home     confessing it. And yet what could be done? My tongue was all but     tied. I was helpless without an interpreter capable of conveying my     meaning to the people. Such a man was wanting. Commending the whole     matter and the anxious crowds of people so eager to hear to my     Master, I retired at midnight.     "Monday.--Breakfast, 8.30 a.m. 9 a.m., spoke with a gentleman from     Kiel, who is anxious to see The Army open there, and is building us     a Hall. Saw his plans and arranged terms.     "9.30 a.m., saw the Officer from Stuttgart. He has a heavy     struggle. 12 noon, drove round the city. In summer time it must be     a very pleasant place.     "3.30 p.m., Meeting. Fine audience, very nearly filling the church.     Commenced with a new interpreter, a student--execrable! I soon had     to fall back on one of the others.     "7 p.m., as full as the police would allow. Continued till 10 p.m.     And then had a Soldiers' Meeting till 11.30 p.m.     "Left Copenhagen the next morning at 8.30 a.m."We who have since seen some of The General's greatest triumphs in thatcity, and have watched the steady growth of The Army in Denmark till ithas won the sympathy of the Royal Family and of every other decentfamily in the country, must rejoice in this record of his firstdesperate battles there, and can guess how much of all the subsequentvictory is due to what his people learned in those days.But the record has a far wider interest, for it lets us see, as we havelittle opportunity ordinarily, the inward conflicts through which TheGeneral passed in so many places where, out of his weakness, or theweakness of his forces, he, or they, were "made strong."Few achievements of The General's lifetime will, I fancy, impress futuregenerations more than his establishment of The Army in Finland at thevery time when all the former liberties of that country were graduallybeing taken away.Formerly recognised by treaties as a Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire,with its own Parliament and laws, which were supposed to be permanentlyguaranteed, Finland found itself looked upon with a growing jealousyjust when a new constitution was slowly changing the governmentalarrangements of Russia. It is, as yet, too early for outsiders tounderstand how it came to pass that the country was regarded as a centreof disaffection, or why, ever and anon some new step was taken tonullify its Parliament, and to place it more and more under militarycontrol. What we are concerned with is the simple fact that these thingsinterfered but little with the steady progress of The Army, and thatthis proved at every step the soundness of The General's principles, thecompleteness with which he succeeded in planting them in the hearts ofhis most distant followers, and the marvellous way in which God guided,protected, and blessed his work, just where he could do the least forits development.The very beginning of the Work was due entirely to one of his mostdaring decisions, for it may well be doubted whether any attempt, underthe leadership of a foreigner, would have been tolerated at that time.But when a young lady, who had become acquainted with The Army inStockholm, devoted herself to its service, and after passing some timein Training in London, was sent back with two or three subordinates tobegin work in Helsingfors, who could look upon her with suspicion?The moment she succeeded, however, in inducing a few of her firstConverts to put on our uniform or insignia, the police came down uponthem, took away all their badges, and declared that the formation of aCorps there must be regarded as for ever prohibited. Even when theConverts were provided with a second supply of badges, they were calledto the police-station, and again deprived of them. But the leader hadlearnt from The General too well the lessons of patient endurance andcontinuance to give way. And when the police saw her followers supplieda third time with the signs of union with us, having in the meantimehad so many opportunities to learn more both of the leader and of herpeople, they concluded that it would be, after all, the best for thepublic interest to let them alone.Two newspapers in the two languages of the country were issued and soldin all the public-houses. Congregations were gathered in all the cities,and even small towns, and everywhere the authorities could see that nospirit of discontent with anything but sin and evil habits was beingcreated, but that the police would find their tasks lightened, and thelife of the poorest of the people brightened and bettered, if they letthe work go on.Chapter XIV.Children Conquerors in Holland and ElsewhereThe General's own personal experience, as well as numberless instancesthat came under his observation in his own and other families, gave himthe same assurance as to the need and possibility of the Salvation ofchildren as he had with regard to adults.If human beings cannot hope to please God until they are born again ofHis Spirit, what folly it would be to give up the best years of life tomere outside instruction, instead of aiming first of all at this firstand greatest need. This law he always laid down as the guiding line withregard to all work amongst children, instead of the ordinary SundaySchool idea "first teach, and then try to lead the children to Christ."In his first publication, _How to Reach the Masses with the Gospel_, hewrote in 1871:--     "Great pains are taken, we know, to make the children acquainted     with the history and theory of Christianity; but their conversion,     which is the main thing, seems to us to be sadly and sorely     overlooked. That the immediate gathering of the children to Christ     is the teacher's work, is recognised, we fear, in very few schools.     It is not the aim of the present moment; and, consequently, little     effort is made to bring it about. Feeling all this, we resolved     that, if ever opportunity offered, we would try services as much     adapted for the conversion and instruction of children as our other     services are for adults.     "On the first Sunday afternoon in April, 1869, we held our first     'Children's Salvation Service,' in our late Hall in the old Bethnal     Green Road, and five children professed to find the Saviour."But of all The General's revolutionary tasks this has, perhaps, provedto be the toughest. His eldest son--now General Bramwell Booth--made thechildren's work his earliest care, and in later years held annuallyCouncils for all Officers engaged in it in England.But, although God has wrought wonders amongst the children in everyland, so that we have now thousands of Officers who have been won intheir early years by that Junior work, the spectre of the Sunday Schoolever and anon rises to threaten with a peaceful death, this Divineundertaking. Only the most persistent watchfulness can prevent thenarrow idea of instruction, and unbelief as to children's Salvationwhich is its foundation, from gaining the upper hand. It is so easy toget a thousand children drilled into pretty attention, prettyperformances, pretty recitations and singing, and even into some degreeof knowledge of the killing letter, but so hard to get any one childreally to submit to the one great Teacher of mankind, and be saved!Therefore we take special pleasure in dwelling upon the fact that TheGeneral's theory has been proved, on trial, to result in producingheroes and heroines, capable, almost in infancy, of daring battle forGod, and becoming, before they reach their majority, thoroughlyexperienced and intelligent conquerors.In that earliest record we read:--     "Although the services are strictly for children, it is not an     unusual thing to see adults sitting by the side of the little ones,     and sometimes to see parent and child kneeling together seeking 'to     know Him whom to know is life eternal.' One Sunday evening a woman     brought her young son, who a short time previously had been     detected in an act of dishonesty. During the service God's Spirit     strove with both. The mother saw that she would have to give an     account of her doings, as well as the boy, and so, side by side,     they knelt, sought and professed to find pardon.     "A young lad who had been a source of great annoyance at our     Meetings, and a dreadful swearer, a short time ago died triumphant     in the faith. When lying in the London Hospital, evidently dying,     he sent a request that I would tell the children that he was     'going Home'; 'but tell them I'm not afraid; and, Oh, tell them not     to swear.'"Many of our leading Officers of to-day were truly converted before theywere ten years old, so that, at thirty, they were already veterans inthe Fight. Two Colonels, who were later most frequently seen closelyassociated with The General's Campaigns, like him were converted atfifteen--one of them being at that time almost overlooked by theSergeant, who was counting the Penitents. "Captain," said he, "there areseventy-one; or seventy-two, if you count this lad."The General has not only counted his young lads and lasses whenever theywere true Penitents, but has dared to set them at once to work to bringothers to Christ and that with such effect that whole countries havefelt the result.Our first Dutch Officer was a young teacher, dismissed from hisemployment because he would persist in seeking the Salvation, as well asthe instruction, of his young pupils. After spending a few months inEngland in order to be able to translate for us, he became theLieutenant and general helper of our pioneer Officer there. The way hadbeen prepared before us by a retired Major of the Dutch Army, who hadfor some time been carrying on mission work in the city of Amsterdam,and who, having seen something of The Army in England, turned over hisMission Hall to us and gave us all possible help. He was rewarded byseeing all his own children converted.Holland has suffered, perhaps, more than any country in the world, fromthe substitution of head knowledge for real heart acquaintance with God.The refuge of true believers in days of terrible persecution, it hasseen its Churches either paralysed with the narrowest and coldestorthodoxy, proclaiming the impossibility of Salvation for any but thefew elect, or the natural reaction, a wild "liberalism," which doubtseverything. How far the two million Catholics of the country hold fasttheir old faith is doubtful; but it is admitted that very few of theother four millions profess to be "born again."But The General never sought to trim his sails to catch any "modern"breeze. Upon his every visit to the country he spoke out with the samesimple liberty as in England. Of the fisherman leader he sent torepresent him in Holland, knowing "only a handful" of Dutch words, alady said, "He prays just like a man who is drowning." Such praying, andcorresponding effort, for "the perishing" soon brought thousands tokneel in penitence before God.The General has visited the country repeatedly, presiding over theAnnual Reviews, which have generally been held on some great landproprietor's estate, or holding "Days with God" in its largest theatres.Of one such visit, in 1906, he writes:--     "I have just had a wonderful campaign in Holland--Meetings,     enthusiasm, collections, and souls far beyond anything that has     preceded it in my experience. Praise the dear Lord."The simple old Gospel that any child can understand, has indeed made TheArmy triumphant all over Holland, and the following extracts from TheGeneral's diary, during his visit of 1908, will show how childlike afaith and devotion our people there have:--     "Rotterdam, Saturday, _March 14th_.--Soldiers' and ex-Soldiers'     Meeting fine--three-fourths men. A great improvement on anything I     have seen in the way of Soldiers' Meetings in this place. I got the     truth out, and thirty-seven of them fell at the Penitent-Form to     seek power to walk in its light.     "Sunday.--The Doelen Hall (one of the largest auditoriums in the     city) full in the morning, and crowds shut out afternoon and night.     People hard at first; but twenty-two came to the Penitent-Form in     the morning, and fifty-eight at night. Never saw men weep more     freely. L212 given during the day.     "Monday.--Came on to Amsterdam and commenced Officers' Councils.     "Tuesday.--A tired, restless night for some reason or other. Sleep     flew. Occupied with many matters, but not very anxious. Still, did     not get much refreshment or invigoration for the day's work, and     felt accordingly. On the whole, the three Meetings were     interesting, and, I think, useful to the Officers present, although     nothing remarkable.     "Wednesday.--What I said of the Councils yesterday may be repeated     to-day. I had a great deal more material than I could possibly     introduce into two days, and on leaving out some topics, on the     spur of the moment, some were left out that might have been of     great benefit. However, everybody was pleased, and, I think,     profited. The only question in my mind, similar to the one that     haunts me in every Officers' Council, is whether I am making the     most of the opportunity.     "There is no doubt that we have here a powerful body of men and     women, good, devoted, and loyal to the principles of The Army,     proud to be connected with it, and ready to receive instructions,     and to carry them out. The great lack appears to be a want of     energy, enterprise, and daring, the being content with a little     success instead of reaching out to all that is possible and     promising. However, they are wonderfully improved, and I hope the     present Commissioner's health will allow of his carrying them a     long way farther in the direction of enthusiasm than they have     reached before.     "Lieut.-Colonel Schoch (our original friend before referred to) was     with us at all the Meetings. He is very cordial, and in making the     closing speech, described his oneness with The Army in every     direction.     "My correspondence with London is somewhat heavy.     "Thursday.--Fair night's sleep, but feeling rather tired, which     must be expected. We are away to Den Helder at 9.42 a.m., so must     be stirring. Den Helder is a naval port, the headquarters of the     Dutch navy. We were billetted with Rear-Admiral van den Bosch, who     is in command of the port, fleet, dockyards, and many other things.     We were received at the station in a formal but hearty manner by     the leading people of the town, in the large waiting-room     (decorated for the occasion), by the minister of the State Church,     who made a really eloquent address. The great point of his speech     was the work of the Holy Spirit--God working through us to the     benefit of mankind. As he stood there talking in that circle of     sixty or seventy of the leading inhabitants of the place, including     naval officers of rank, professionals of various classes, and     prominent people, I could not help feeling, as I often feel now,     what a change has come over the people, not only with respect to     The Army, but towards myself.     "I answered in a few words that I trust were useful and beneficial     to all present. The whole thing, from the moment of my being     received at the door of my railway carriage, until I left next     morning, had been prearranged through the instrumentality of one of     our Local Officers, to his great credit, to the credit of his town,     and to the satisfaction of his General.     "The mail brought me a request to take over a certain county     council's lodging-house for poor men, on which they are losing a     large sum, also another to take over an inebriates' home, which     cost L40,000 and is an utter failure. In such exploits people will     not have The Salvation Army at the onset, otherwise they might save     a good deal of expense, etc.     "Friday.--Arriving at Amsterdam, the mail brought confirmation of     my agreement of yesterday to postpone my South African visit to     September, and to begin my Motor Tour at Dundee, and finish at the     Crystal Palace. In all these things the maxim is ever present to my     mind, 'Man proposes, but God disposes.' Closed the night at the     desk, which is becoming more and more a difficult task from the     failure of my eyes.     "Saturday.--Good night's sleep. That is for me, anyway, a great     improvement on recent nights. So now for a good day's work, of     which there is plenty lying before me.     "7.30 p.m., Soldiers' Meeting. We have always been crowded out     before, so this time the Palace Theatre was taken, as an     experiment, and it justified my reckonings for several years gone     by, namely, that we could fill any reasonable place on Saturday     night here, and yet keep the Meeting select; that is, confine it to     Soldiers and ex-Soldiers, adherents, and those concerned about     religion. We were more than full, and the place holds 1,500. I had     much liberty in speaking, the After Meeting went with a swing     seldom known on the Continent or elsewhere, and we had eighty-four     at the Penitent-Form, some of them remarkable cases."No wonder this octogenarian Leader finds his young Dutchmen wanting inenterprise!     "Sunday.--The theatre again in the morning at ten. An excellent     plan. Oh, that it could be adopted the world over! The senseless     system of beginning at eleven makes you feel it is time to close     almost before you have had time to get well started. We were     crowded, large numbers outside clamouring for admission, so much so     that the police called out their reserves, and fifty men guarded     the entrance. We had an excellent service inside, and forty at the     Mercy-Seat. It was a beautiful Meeting, and made a mark for ever on     my heart, and on the hearts of many more.     "Afternoon. The large Hall of the People's Palace had been arranged     for this as well as the Night Meeting. We were full, and many were     turned away. I lectured on 'The Duty of the Community.' Great     satisfaction among my own people, and a good impression made upon     the minds of a good many of the leading people of the city.     "Night, 7.30. Again full. It is a building erected for an     Exhibition, and made suitable for a Meeting only by putting up a     great screen across the centre. I suppose we could have filled the     entire space; but whether my interpreter could then have been     heard, I am not sure. I preached with point and power--more     breathless attention I never had in my life. I reckoned on an easy     conquest, but we had one of the hardest fights I ever remember     before we got a soul out. I left at 10.30, completely played out. A     wall of policemen on either side kept the people back while I got     into the carriage, the crowd having waited a long time to catch a     glimpse of me. Had long, restless, and sleepless spells during the     night; but still I have not done amiss on the whole. I must now     prepare myself for the coming Berlin Staff Congress."So much for the general effect upon a largely unbelieving people ofsimple, childlike faith!But The General was, of course, always just as earnest about instructingall who came to him, old or young, in the way of life, as about gettingthem into it. In the midst of these tremendous Campaigns, he repeatedlyprepared Lesson-books for both children and adults. To a lady who hadtried to help him by sending him a number of catechisms for children, onsuch an occasion, he wrote:--     "Thanks for your letter, and your catechisms sent here.     "The particular catechisms you send I already had--not that the     church affair could be of any advantage to me, and I should     imagine it would not be of much use to any one else, especially to     children.     "I am trying to produce something that will be a boon to The Army     by being blessed to hundreds of thousands of children for years to     come. You do not seem to think it is a very important task. I count     it the most important work I have had my hands on for years.     "I had a proper day at----. I got at the peasantry for once,     although I have often had that privilege before, and we had a     mighty day. Oh, the joy of leading those simple souls into the     light and power and freedom of the Kingdom! I am keeping better.     Praise the Lord!"Whether The General's hopes for the use of his writings to the good ofchildren will be fully realised, remains to be seen; but it is a greatthing to have established even the purpose of making the way to Heavenplain enough for the youngest feet to find.The other day I heard a Captain explaining how he was "conscripted" intoThe Army at ten years of age. He was standing outside the door of one ofour Halls on an evening when children were not admitted. He had tried,in vain, boylike, to dodge through the doorkeeper's legs--but a drunkenwoman came up and not only insisted on getting in, but on dragging himin "to keep her company." Once inside, she went right up to thePenitent-Form with her prisoner, and made him kneel with her there. Hehad never seen so many grown-up people kneeling before, and, as theyprayed, he felt what a naughty boy he had been, and began both to weepand pray. However little any older people might think of him that night,God heard and saved him, and he is now fighting under our Flag in theWest Indies.And others, who in their early years came to Christ, are now occupyingleading positions all over the world. One of them remembers, when a ladof fifteen, hearing The General, whilst giving out the verse, "Sure, Imust fight, if I would reign; Increase my courage, Lord," say, "I wouldlike to alter it, to--'Sure, I will fight, and I shall reign.'" The ladshouted, "Hallelujah!" and, as he was on the front seat in the theatre,The General both heard and noticed him, and remarked: "I hope you willmake as good a fighter as you are a shouter." Thirty-three years offaithful warfare have replied to The General's encouraging challenge.And we have no means as yet of calculating how many such youthfuldisciples have been equally helped by The General into a conqueringlife. May this record help to multiply the number, for it is the will ofGod to make all His children "strong in the power of His might."It is, indeed, this bringing all, whether old or young, forward, in thedevelopment of all their powers for God, which constitutes everywhere agreat part of The Army's work.The enlarging influence of a close contact with Christ has hardly yetbeen fully realised even by ourselves. The peasant, whose whole circleof thought was so limited and stereotyped that his life only rose by fewdegrees above that of the animals he drove before him, is taught by TheArmy to pray and sing to the Maker and Saviour of the world:--    Give me a heart like Thine;      By Thy wonderful power,      By Thy grace every hour,    Give me a heart like Thine.In a few years' time you will find that man capable of directing the Warover a wide stretch of country--dealing not merely with as many Meetingsin a week as some men would be content to hold in a year, and with thediversified needs of thousands of souls; but taking his share in anybusiness transactions, or councils with civic authorities, as ably asany city-born man.What has so enlarged his capacity, broadened his sympathies, and turnedhim into the polite and valued associate of any one, high or low, withwhom he comes in contact? His library, if, indeed he has any, beyond thefew Army publications he needs for his work, is still scanty enough tomake his removal at a few hours' notice remarkably easy, and he willnot be found much in public reading-rooms either. He has very littletime for fellowship with any of the intelligent friends who, for TheArmy's sake, might now be willing to help him on.He has simply had that oft-repeated prayer answered, and with the heartof a saviour of all men comes an interest in men's thoughts and wayswhich leads the man ever onward, overcoming all his own ignorance andincapacities, for the sake of helping on the War.Thus The General's declaration at an early moment, that he would get hispreachers out of the public-houses, has not merely been justified withregard to the first elementary lines of recruiting; but the grace of Godhas proved capable of developing, out of the most limited and despoiledhuman material, the most able and large-hearted of organisers andleaders, without building up any artificial or educational barriersbetween them and their former associates.How, indeed, could it be otherwise? Those who are ignorant of God maywell doubt the possibility of any mental improvement by means of prayer.But those who believe that it is possible for the poorest to dwell onearth with their Saviour, and to hold continual intercourse with Him,will perfectly understand how enlightening, how elevating, how inspiringsuch fellowship must ever be. Alas! how few there are yet in the worldwho can truly say, "Our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son,Jesus Christ".Chapter XVIndia and DevoteesNowhere has The Army shown its marvellous power to unite men of allraces and classes so rapidly and completely as in India. With itsHeadquarters in Simla, and its leader, formerly a magistrate under theIndian Government, looked upon almost as a felon, and imprisoned when hefirst began leading Open-Air Meetings in Bombay, but now honoured by thehighest both of British and Indian rulers and by the lowest of itsoutcasts equally, The Army has become the fully-recognised friend ofGovernors and governed alike.When The General decided upon issuing a weekly paper called _The WarCry_, it was to be as nearly as possible The Salvation Army in print,and Mr. Booth-Tucker, then an Indian official, at once got the idea,from the copy he read, that such a force as it described was exactlywhat was wanted in that country--a set of Christians determined to fightfor the establishment of Christ's Kingdom by every method love coulddevise; but loving especially the poorest and weakest, and proving theirlove by working continually amongst them. After visiting England, to seeThe Army and its leaders for himself, he had no hesitation in abandoninghis Government appointment, and giving himself up for life to this War.Such was the devotion of our Officers, and especially of the firstIndians they won, that The General, far from having to urge themforward, had rather to check the tendency needlessly to sacrifice healthand life. He gladly gave, at later dates, two of his own daughters tothe Work; and, perfectly informed by his own repeated visits to thecountry, and by what he learnt from the actualities of the War, he wasthe better able to correct mistakes, and so to utilise to the uttermostthe forces that were raised in various parts of the vast peninsula.Nobody would hesitate to acknowledge how much his counsels helped toprevent an excessive zeal from sacrificing precious lives.He divided the country into six Territories, each under a separateCommander, realising that India could not be treated as one country, butthat its diverse people must be dealt with according to their severalneeds, and that unless those using different languages were trained toact independently enough of each other they could never form strongenough forces to cope with the vast enterprises required. But thefollowing account, written to his children, of his first visit to thecountry gives a photographic view, both of his own activities andsuccesses, and of the attitude of the high and mighty generally towardshim at that remote date. He writes from Benares, January 13, 1892, justten years after our beginning in India:--     "Benares, _January_ 13, 1892.     "My Dear Children,--     "Wednesday and Thursday, 6th and 7th, were consumed in travelling     to Calcutta, and, all things considered, I got through the journey     very well. Nevertheless, I was exceedingly weary on being roused at     five o'clock to prepare for the arrival.     "It was early, 5.35 a.m., and Colonel Ajeet Singh did not expect     any reception beyond that of our own Officers.     "To our surprise, however, we found the platform crowded with our     own enthusiastic little party (who raised some music from a scratch     Band), some native Christians, and a very large number of Hindu     gentlemen.     "I was taken by surprise, and, unaware of the extent of the     demonstration, allowed them to leave by only shaking hands.     "Interview upon interview followed during the morning, but in the     afternoon I was down for the Town Hall Meeting. I scarcely ever     remember in my life feeling more thoroughly weary than on that day.     Three times I laid down to try to sleep, and each time failed to     get a wink, and my brain was benumbed and bewildered when I entered     that immense building and was called upon by General Merrill, the     American Consul, who presided, to address that crowd.     "I don't know whether Commissioner Booth-Tucker ever had a Meeting     at the Town Hall. It is a long building, 120 feet long, with the     most clumsy pillars down the sides shutting out almost the side     seats from view.     "There was quite as large an audience as I expected, although it     was not what it might have been. There were a few Europeans present     and a few native Christians, and the remainder were composed of the     non-Christian element.     "Amongst others who interviewed me during the day, or were     introduced to me before the Meeting, was the successor to Chunder     Singh and the two most prominent teachers of the Brahmo Samaj, and     a number of other leading people. On the platform was the Judge of     the Supreme Court and Vice-Chancellor of the University, and one of     the few Hindus who are strict observers of every principle and     usage of their sect. Near to me was the Nawal Abdool Luteef     (Mohammedan), and just behind me was a boy of about fourteen, a son     and heir of a Maharajah whose father had intended to have been at     the Meeting, but was prevented, and so sent his son, a bright-eyed     youth who paid every attention to what was said.     "General Merrill had consented to preside at the last moment, being     induced to do so very largely from the fact that every one of the     English of any note had refused.     "Bombay, _January 16th_.     "I broke off at the beginning of my Calcutta Campaign as above, not     having had a moment's space to resume. Never had I such a crush of     engagements before, and it was really all I could possibly do to     keep pace with them, and that I only did to some extent in a     poorish way.     "The detail of them I must leave to another day.     "I may say, however, that Calcutta in interest exceeded anything I     have seen since I left England. From the rush of welcome at the     railway station at six in the morning, to the pack who came to say     farewell (in which the papers say there were 3,000 people), it was     one series of surprises. Although the Town Hall Meeting was stiff,     and the Europeans were conspicuous by their absence, still there     was sufficient indication of the high esteem in which The Army was     held in general, and myself in particular, to make it a matter of     great interest and encouragement.     "Of the welcomes that followed from individuals of note, such as     Mr. Bannerjee and Mr. Bhose (representing the Brahmo Samaj); and     the Successor of Chunderssing, Mr. Chuckervetty, the lay reader of     the Yogal Samaj, His Highness the Maharajah Sir Joteendro Mohun, of     Tanjore, one of the most princely men of the city; the Nawab     Abdool Luteef, the most distinguished leader of the Mohammedans,     etc.; and of the several missionaries who came up, all was really     complimentary and respectful--nay affectionate.     "Then there were the crowds, perhaps the greatest in the Emerald     Theatre, in which there must have been nearly 3,000 people, inside     and out, listening through the doorways. It was certainly the most     remarkable audience I ever addressed. Exclusively native. I only     saw one white face in the crowd beyond our own people. Nothing more     hearty could have been conceived. Then came Meeting upon Meeting;     but the Circus on Sunday night outdid almost anything in some     respects, that I have ever witnessed in my life. It came upon me     quite by surprise. The hour fixed was the same as the churches, and     it had been predicted that we should not get an audience. It was     right away outside the city, in a park in the swellest part of the     suburbs. Consequently, it was not at all attractive to the native,     who doesn't like to get outside his own quarter.     "The Emerald Theatre had been a great success because it was in the     midst of his quarter; the Europeans would not come there, and now     it was fair to assume that the native would not come to the     European centre.     "As to any attendance of English people, that was hardly to be     expected. They had cold-shouldered me at the Town Hall, the     Lieutenant-Governor had even refused to see one of our Officers     when she called, although he had the reputation of being a     Christian man. The Viceroy had been civil to me--he could not have     been otherwise; in fact, he verged on friendliness before we     parted--but that was all. His Military Secretary had been as stiff     as military etiquette could possibly make him. There seemed to be,     therefore, nothing much to expect as to audience from them.     "Then I was tired out--a more wearying morning and afternoon I had     seldom experienced--and I bargained in my own mind, and even     mentioned it to Ajeet Singh, that if there was not much of an     audience I should leave them to bear the brunt of the burden.     "As we drove up the appearance of things seemed to confirm my     anticipations. Everything was silent. They had been afraid of the     roaring of the wild beasts disturbing the Meetings, but there was     not a growl to be heard, nor a carriage to be seen, nor even a     pedestrian. It is true we were at the back part of the Circus.     "Hoe came to meet us, however, at the gates, and when asked about     the audience very coolly announced, to our amazement, that they     were _full_. Without any delay, therefore, I mounted the platform,     and the sight that met me certainly was sufficiently surprising to     be actually bewildering. They say the place seated 3,500; it     appeared to be full. It was a simple circle, with a ring set in the     centre. At one end was a little platform seating myself and my     Staff, opposite me was the entrance for the horses, which was     packed by the crowd, while the remaining space, on circle upon     circle, tier upon tier, the audience was to be seen. On the right     hand we had row after row of Queen's soldiers in their red jackets,     lower down the Eurasian and middle-class Europeans, with a few     natives. In the centre we had a very fair proportion of the _elite_     of Calcutta: there was the Lieut.-Governor, the Chief Commissioner     of Police, the Consuls of America and two or three other countries,     some great native swells, ladies bespangled with jewellery and     finery, while on the left was one mass of dark faces reaching right     up to the canvas sky. It was the most picturesque audience I ever     addressed, to say the least of it.     "Our singing of 'Grace is flowing like a river,' was very weak,     still everybody listened, nobody more so than the swell Europeans.     "The solo, 'On Calvary,' was sung with good effect, and then I rose     to do my best. The opportunity put new life into me. I was     announced to speak on 'The Religion of Humanity,' but this did not     seem to me to be the hour for argument of any description; there     was no time for dissertation. I felt I must have something that     went straight to the point. I had been talking to these Brahmo     Samaj and other people upon Social Work, alluring them on     afterwards by indirect arguments long enough. Now I felt that I     must go as straight to the point as it was possible to do. So I     took 'What must I do with Jesus?' and made it fit into 'The     Religion of Humanity' as best I could.     "I never hit out straighter in my life, and was never listened to     with more breathless attention--except for the few wretched natives     in the top seats, who would go out, I guessed, because they did not     know the language, and came perhaps expecting I should be     translated, and after sitting an hour felt that was enough.     However, they soon cleared out, the audience taking no notice of     the process.     "Once done, however, a general movement took place; a Prayer     Meeting was impossible. We retired feeling that a victory had been     gained so far.     "I cannot stop here to speak of the Meeting at which the Brahmo     Samaj presented me with an Address of Welcome the next day.     "All I know is, that nothing surprised me more than to hear some of     the priests and laymen declare that they had gone with me in every     word I had said the night before.     "Other Meetings followed, interviews, visits to the houses of the     leading natives, and with blessings without stint poured upon my     head, and hand-shaking that almost threatened to lame me, the train     tore me away from the packed platform, and I left Calcutta with     unfeigned regret.     "I stayed a night at Benares, and had the Town Hall crowded, with a     leading Hindu in the chair. Quiet Meeting. Landed here (Bombay) six     this morning with a hearty welcome, and, I think, with the promise     of good Meetings, although anything equal to Calcutta is not to be     expected; and the news of the death of the Prince has come in our     way, the news of which we have only just received.     "This will be my last letter, I presume, and I send with it, as     ever, my undiminished affection to you all.     "For THE GENERAL,     "J. C. R.     "Written in a terrible haste."This was immediately followed by the following final days:--     "Saturday:--            Noon.

"Saturday:  Sailed for Europe."Remembering that The General was already nearly sixty-three years old,such programmes in India might well, fatigue him. But these were easydays, compared with many country ones of this journey, during which hetraversed Ceylon, visited South India, spoke to some 8,000 SyrianChristians, and, calling at Madras and Calcutta, went on to the Punjaband Guzerat. His final days in Bombay were, as we have seen, clouded bya bereavement of the Royal House. But to his telegram to the Prince andPrincess of Wales (now King George and Queen Mary), he got the cabledreply:--     "Their Royal Highnesses' thanks for your prayers and sympathy."It had thus already been seen that The General's plans for India wereanswering their purpose. It became possible first to march large partiesthrough various tracts of country, so impressing thousands in a few daysmore than the isolated labours of the best individuals could have donein the course of years, and then it came to learn later from Officersplaced amongst them. All this The General knew could not mean all thatit would have meant amongst peoples who understood more perfectly ourteachings; but he saw no reason for not making the most of suchincidents. Why not abandon, so far as such people were concerned, oursystem elsewhere, and recognise them as "Adherents," leaving them tolearn after, from Officers placed amongst them, all that was necessaryfor them to become Salvation Soldiers. By this plan we avoided anywatering-down of our teachings or requirements, and yet those who werenot fit to be enrolled in our ranks were able, so far as they chose, toabandon idolatry and every evil practice, to get the advantages ofChristian schooling for their children, and generally to improvethemselves, under our influence.Famines, epidemics of cholera and plague, and other general calamitiesreally helped us to increase our influence in various districts. Wegathered many orphans and abandoned children and brought them up as ourown, whilst over wide tracts of country the people learnt to look uponus as a family of "brothers born for adversity," whose help could berelied upon not merely with regard to heavenly but to earthly things.The barriers of caste, which bind Indians to treat each other to solarge an extent as if they were enemies are naturally a constant andserious hindrance to us, especially as most of our people naturallybelong to the lower castes, or are even outcasts. And our plan oforganisation has helped us wonderfully in this matter, for the villagerof Guzerat, or Ceylon, who might be very greatly hampered amongst hisown natural surroundings, may be placed in an infinitely better positionin some other part of the country. Indians are marvellously quick atlearning languages, so that we need seldom hesitate about theirusefulness in any new appointment on account of difference of language.And thus it has come about that we have already, after some thirtyyears' work, nearly 2,000 Indian Officers, as absolutely devoted to theservice of Christ as any of their comrades of any other land. And theforces under their command have shown already that they can dealeffectively with peoples utterly inaccessible to the ordinary Europeans.The Bheels, when we first went amongst them, were all armed with bowsand arrows, living entirely by the chase, and so terrified at any signof officialism that our Officers had to avoid taking a scrap of paperwith them when visiting their districts. But we have now many Bheelvillages entirely under our teaching, and quite a number of BheelOfficers who have learnt to read their own language, and to lead theircountrymen as fully to follow Christ as they do themselves.So many of our people in Guzerat were weavers that one Officer sethimself specially to the task of improving their loom. He was soon ableto make one with which they could double their daily product. The makingof these looms created a new industry, also, so that we have been ablethus to help many. In India we have also commenced in three of ourTerritories medical work, making it, after first cost of buildings,equipment, and Staff, largely self-supporting, as we found that thepeople really appreciated help more for which they were called upon tomake ever so small a return.In the same way, respecting all our work, The General has always urgedthe importance of applying, as far as possible, our general rule ofself-support; for though the people may have very little to give, thevery least they can do helps to protect us from the prejudice created bythe term "rice Christians," applied to those who are believed to havemade professions of Christianity for the sake of the food they hope toreceive.And now the Government, having seen the practical effect of our work,are beginning to give us opportunities such as we never had before. TheDoms, a tribe systematically trained to live by thieving, were placedunder our special care, and the result was such as to lead to our havingother unmanageables likewise given over to us. In fact, we are barelynow beginning to reap in India what in twenty-eight arduous years hadbeen sown.Does some one ask, Where does The General's own hand appear in much ofthis? Is it not all rather due to his having from the beginning, had soable a helper, acquainted with the languages and mental habits of thecountry, and other exceptionally able Officers both here and there?Even if it were so, I should ask how all these people of ability placedthemselves so absolutely at The General's disposal as to wish to spendall their lives under his direction in the greatest poverty in thatfar-away land? And I should inquire, further, how it came to pass thatBritish, French, American, Swedish, Swiss, Dutch, and others could begot to submit, not only to work in union under the same "iron"regulations, but often under the leadership of women, and often underthat of Indian Staff Officers? Who else but General Booth has everattempted to place under command of a woman a missionary work, carriedon largely by men, over a territory larger and more populous than theUnited Kingdom? Yet, undoubtedly, nothing has more contributed to thesuccess of our work in a country where women have been so largelyrepressed, as the fact that The Army has thus demonstrated itsconfidence in God's power to lift up the weakest to the uttermostdegree.Nobody who reflects on these things will dispute that whatever The Armyhas done for India has been due most of all to its first General. And sosurely as the knowledge of what is already done grows, shall we beallowed to do more and more to show India what Christ really desires,and so to capture it for Him.In connexion with all our Indian work, one vastly important part of TheGeneral's work comes ever before us, whether we think of CommissionerBooth-Tucker or of one of his humblest native helpers.Commonly enough in recent times The General was honoured because he hadwon from the path of vice to that of virtue some notorious sinner. Butdid he not even more remarkably earn the general gratitude by changingthe comparatively helpless and uninfluential, though well-meaning, intoenterprising and widely useful leaders in good work? How many millionsof people he has taught or urged to sing:--    Were the whole realm of nature mine,      That were a present far too small;    Love so amazing, so divine,      Demands my soul, my life, my all.That grand verse was well known in this country, and widely sung, ofcourse, long before he was born. But alas! how many sing it even now"with the understanding"?How many thousands of choice spirits first learnt, under The General'sdirection, to look fairly at the immensity of their responsibility toGod, as they sang that and similar verses? And how many only found out,as ever-widening responsibilities were pressed upon them, how greattheir "all" really could become. The humble labourer, without any greatspeaking ability, and often involved in a struggle to earn the barestlivelihood for himself and family, was taught how to share in seekingthe Salvation of men. To-day he has become a well-known benefactor inone way or another to thousands of his fellow-townsmen, and hischildren, in the Far East or West, are helping to realise his grandestthoughts of winning the whole world for God.This result would never have come about simply by the reading andsinging of the most beautiful words. But the man who was first of allmade responsible, perhaps, only for the keeping of a Hall door, learntwith astonishing rapidity how much our common life could accomplish forGod, and went on expanding in thought and purpose, as hisresponsibilities were increased, until he became not merely a localleader in every form of Salvationist effort, but a foreman or tradesmanexercising a widespread influence amongst his fellow-townsmen for allthat is good, and urging thousands of a younger generation forward inevery way, to the glory of God and the advancement of their country.Such development, when it comes to be applied, say, to an educated lady,produces one of those wise mothers of mankind whose practical counselsand help are being sought by the greatest cities in these days, when menhave found out what largeness of both heart and understanding are oftento be found under a Salvation Army bonnet.Chapter XVISouth Africa and ColonisationThe General visited South Africa three times--in 1891, 1895, and 1908.His visits were very largely dominated, as will be seen, by the ideathat in South Africa good and abundant space could be found for Over-SeaColonies; enough space, in fact, to accommodate all the surpluspopulation of England.The following extract from the record of his first journey is taken, inthe main, from one of his "letters to my children," dated fromKimberley:--     "The afternoon Meeting was a select gathering, with the Mayor in     the chair. Most of the ministers of the district were present. I     talked with freedom, questions were proposed, and I carried the     audience with me.     "At night we had a Social Meeting in the amphitheatre, which was     well filled. The ex-Mayor presided. I do not know how long I     talked, but they say two hours. Everybody was much interested. The     doctor with whom I was staying, and a brother physician, came into     the house and thanked me for my 'magnificent speech,' giving L5 to     the fund for which we were collecting.     "I was very glad to get to bed, and to find that I had not taken a     serious cold, for everything was open behind me in the theatre, and     the night was piercingly cold, whilst I perspired with the exertion     of speaking, and felt the wind blowing at my back, striking me like     a wet blanket. I was very tired.     "Tuesday.--Officers' Meetings all day. If I had been pleased with     what I saw of the Officers before, I was more so to-day. Their     eagerness to hear, and quickness to understand, the readiness with     which they assented to every call and everything laid before them,     was delightful. No body of men more simple or apparently ready for     action ever sat before me.     "At night I endeavoured to deal with their hearts, making clear     what a full consecration to the War included, and appealing to     them for it. I don't think I ever gave a more heart-searching     address, and it awoke a solemn feeling, almost amounting to gloom,     which settled down upon every soul. You could see it in their     faces. The knife of conviction pierced them through and through, as     I called up the particulars in which they came short of that life     of love, sacrifice, and service which the War demanded. We then     cleared the decks, inviting those who felt condemned in regard to     the past, and who were willing to make the surrender, to come out.     The first to roll up was about as handsome a fellow as I ever saw,     a Cornish-man, who fell down and began to cry out aloud to God.     Others followed, and before we finished I suppose we should have     nearly seventy down, row after row, sincere, beautiful cases. Some     of the testimonies that followed were delightful. T. was one of the     first to come out, and he confessed down to the ground, and wept     like a child, the whole audience being much moved. It was ten     o'clock when I got home, having talked nearly seven hours, and I     was glad to get to bed.     "Wednesday.--Officers' Meeting in the morning. A very precious time     on matters of detail, which I believe helped the Officers very     much."Only those who thoroughly take in the meaning of these Officers'Meetings can hope to understand The General's hold upon The Army, or thevalue of his various journeys, for such Meetings had far more to do withthe success of his work than any of his great public gatherings. Hefrequently uses the word "simple" in describing Officers, meaning menwho have not got so much puffed up by applause as to be incapable ofseeing their defects, and learning how to do better.Can it be necessary to remind the reader that in The Army nodistinctions of race, country, age or colour exist, so far as Officersare concerned? When it is inevitable to have together in one Officers'Meeting groups who do not speak the language chiefly employed, some oneof their number is so placed amongst the group as to be able totranslate to them The General's addresses.Here we have a gathering of men and women from near and far, most ofwhom must needs carry on their work amidst small communities living verywidely apart, and where they could very rarely see another Officer, orbe visited by any leader. To bring all these up before the tribunal oftheir own consciences as to the extent to which they had discharged allthe obligations they took upon them when they first engaged to form andlead on the forces whose duties, in so vast a territory, must be toovaried and too difficult to prescribe by any fixed routine, could notbut be of priceless value. Would to God that all persons engaged inmissionary work were periodically passed through such examinations, byfire! How easily may any one in such solitary spheres yield todiscouragement, or to some ill-feeling towards a predecessor in the sameappointment, or towards some leader who has not seemed sympatheticenough!Remembering that each of these has to go back to some position of lonelytoil, with no guarantee of salary, and no prospect of improvingcircumstances, in a country whose large towns could be counted on thefingers of one hand, you can understand the supreme importance and theafter-effect of such Meetings. The letter goes on:--     "On this and the previous day, my host, the Doctor, had invited     guests to meet me at luncheon. Yesterday we had the ministers, who     were mostly very friendly and sympathetic. As the Doctor put it,     'To-day we had the sinners,' who he reckoned were by far the most     enjoyable--Judges, Commissioners of Crown Lands, etc. All were very     respectful, and, to say the least of it, were in sympathy with my     Social scheme, if not actually having strong faith in its success.     "I had some further conversation with a member of the South African     Cabinet, who said he was on the most intimate terms both with the     leaders of the Afrikander Bund, and with Mr. Rhodes. He was quite     sure that however any one from political motives, might disguise     their feelings, they were equally in sympathy with me. We had some     conversation as to the co-operation of the authorities, supposing     lazy people turned out unwilling to carry out the engagements they     might sign in England. He said he felt sure if anything were     wanting in present law to ensure authority being respected, that it     would readily be remedied."This has reference to the scheme of an Over-Sea Colony in South Africawith which The General had been occupied ever since 1890. He, of course,always foresaw the risk that persons, who were sent out in connexionwith such a plan, might see in the colonies an easier career than thatof the cultivation of land, and that there must needs be some assuranceof their being held to their agreement in any such case. He goes on:--     "At night, Farewell Meeting in the amphitheatre. It was a     considerable strain on me, as I hadn't a minute to prepare. I had     promised myself a couple of hours in the afternoon, when some Dutch     ministers came down upon me to open a Y.W.C.A. building that they     had just converted from a low public-house at Beaconsfield a suburb     of Kimberley. If I would only go for half an hour they would be so     grateful. I couldn't refuse, so my bit of leisure was seized upon.     "However, we had a very good Meeting. We were nearly full. I made a     new speech which went, I thought, with considerable power, and then     commissioned separate detachments for operations amongst the Zulus     and Swazis--outriders for the Orange Free State, and Officers for     various branches of Social Work. The leaders of each detachment     spoke very well indeed. Promising fellows, all of them.     "At the close of the public Meeting I had to have another for     Soldiers, Officers, and Auxiliaries. This I was compelled to     conclude earlier than I should otherwise have done by the     announcement that the electric light would soon give out. However,     we had a very nice finish, and I got to bed about 11.30.     "Thursday.--Breakfast with the Staff Officers at 8. An hour and     three-quarters' good straight talk afterwards with beautiful     influence, everybody so tender. At the close I said, 'Now let us     kneel down,' and after a little prayer asked them to link hands     with me, and let us give ourselves up again to Jesus for the     service of God and The Army."Such tender-hearted linkings together of those who have the leadershipof The Army's various departments have alone prevented the separationsof heart that must inevitably be threatened wherever a number of verystrong-willed men and women are engaged in labours into which they throwtheir whole soul, and in which they cannot, perhaps should not, avoidthe feeling that their own department is, after all, the most importantin the world. But any one who thinks will understand how men and womenso blended together in fellowship with God and each other have been ableto override all contrary influences in every country.     "E. (the leader of our Work in South Africa) then turned to me"     (the letter goes on) "and made a few appropriate remarks about his     own devotion to The Army, and on behalf of every Officer, present     and absent, assured me that they loved The Army as it was, and did     not want any alterations in _Orders_ or _Regulations_, and were     prepared to live and die in the War. I don't remember anything more     tender and affecting on the conclusion of a Council.     "I shook hands all round and we parted. God bless them. I made a     hasty call at the Rescue Home, and was very pleased with it--a     really nice little place.     "The platform at the station was crowded. A passage was made for     me; but I readily reached the compartment, and having five minutes     or so made a little speech, which was received with volley after     volley, and cheer after cheer. There was a good deal of     handshaking, any number of 'God bless you's,' and the train bore me     away from a people with whom I have certainly had a really hearty     and happy fellowship.     "I should have said that, by request of my host, I went through a     kind of board school, in a very commodious and suitable building. I     saw room after room so far as I could judge of the happiest,     healthiest, and I might say, most beautiful lot of children it was     ever my privilege to see. They ought to make a splendid body of men     and women for the future.     "Friday.--I did not get on very well last night with the 'plank     bed' or shelf which was dignified with the name of a sleeping     berth. There was very little spring and no cushion. Moreover, I had     heartburn. It was a cold night, and altogether I was glad when     daylight came. The sun came out, and it was just as hot by noon as     it had been cold at night.     "We stopped at Cradock a little time, where a gentleman interviewed     me with regard to 80,000 acres of land possessed by some syndicate     of the town at Prieska, up beyond Kimberley. This kind of thing     happens almost every day.     "At a station a little further on quite a crowd of Salvationists     and others had gathered. I could not see any sign of a town beyond     two or three shanties. I used to think some of the places that had     been dignified by the name of 'cities' in Canada were rather     grotesque; but here it is carried to a greater extreme. However,     they must have some method of distinguishing the place of ingress     and egress from the train, and perhaps they are named in the hope     of becoming what they are said to be--things that are spoken of as     if they were.     "Well, on the platform was as picturesque and motley a crowd as     well could be imagined. I only wished at the moment the pencil of     some artist had been there to have painted the Kafirs in their     showy turbans and half-naked bodies, the women with babies on their     backs, and the whites of various ranks and conditions, all mixed up     with Salvationists. Among others was a Salvationist old woman,     half-caste, who had trudged over the mountain fourteen miles from     Somerset East, with a big drum over her shoulders, travelling     during the night in order to get a glimpse of The General. All at     once, whilst the people stared, she struck up a lively chorus,     leading the singing, and beating the drum most vigorously. Then     followed the choruses: 'No, we never, never, never will give in,'     'Never say die,' and 'Steadily keep advancing,' etc. I beckoned to     her, shook hands with her, wrote her name in a copy of _Aggressive     Christianity_ in the presence of the crowd, and gave it to her, all     of which was interpreted to her, as she spoke only Dutch. Then she     wound up in good English with 'Victory for me, through the Blood of     Christ my Saviour.' The little scene altogether was very striking."Yes, surely that scene was striking for every one, and for evermore.That union of races and languages to the glory of Christ, and for thehighest well-being of the whole world; that valuing of the humblest trueSoldier of the Cross above all the great ones of this world, accountsfor the creation, maintenance, and spread of The Army wherever they areseen.The following report of one of his Meetings with the natives fairlyrepresents one of them:--     "The room could not contain the people who wished to listen to the     General. Dark faces were to be seen at every window. The General     did not talk at them, but he talked into them, and their close     attention and many 'Amen!' showed that he was well understood. No     sooner had he ceased talking than the mercy-seat was filled, and at     least a hundred came to Christ to seek deliverance from sin, and     the supplying of their hearts' needs. Amongst the number were eight     or nine women from Central Africa; they had been brought down for     immoral purposes, but the Army had got hold of them and rescued     them.     "Ere the General turned away he gave them still further advice as     follows:     "'My heart is drawn out to you. I am going a long way off, but I     want you to think of me, and when you think of me, I want you to     pray for me. Be decided to fight for Jesus. God will be on your     side. Go in and get all your people saved, and be the friends of     all. Before I go I should like to know who have made up their minds     to trust God,'--and up went a hundred hands. 'That's right. Now all     who have made up their minds to meet me in Heaven raise their hands     again'--and once more every hand went up, this time accompanied by     a tremendous shout."These journeys to South Africa were, indeed, taken together, amongst themost painful lessons of The General's life as to the smallness of hopefrom the great ones of this world. The first visit, paid on the swell ofthe first admiration for the "Darkest England" Scheme, filled him withgreat expectations; and no wonder, for everywhere at that timeGovernments, municipalities, and wealthy magnates talked as if they wereready to assist him immediately to place the deserving, though poor,crowds of the Old Country on the magnificent tracts of land he saweverywhere unoccupied, or very slightly used.But "Governments" of the elected type come and go, making the mostlavish promises and denouncing "the other party," who, on turning themout, do ditto. And so it came to pass that The General made his thirdjourney to South Africa, in 1908, when seventy-nine years of age. Hislife ran serious risk, because his going to Rhodesia himself wasconsidered indispensable in order so to impress some British or SouthAfrican "statesmen" that they might give him the needed help toestablish an Over-Sea Colony there. And, then, all the "statesmen"denounced to Colonel Kitching by one of themselves as "a set of----fools" say that "nothing can be done at present." And the old manreturns to die with his great dream unrealised.[Illustration: MRS. BRAMWELL BOOTH]The following account of one journey taken by Colonel Kitching alone,who was not only his Secretary but his representative in many directionsthroughout his latest years, shows the loving willingness of an ArmySecretary to do and bear anything for Christ's sake, and, what our StaffOfficers generally understand by the words "indefatigable," and"unconquerable":--     "After a long journey of thirty hours I reached ---- railway     station, expecting, in the virgin simplicity of my youthful mind,     to find his place within sight--perhaps across a couple of     stiles--instead of which I found that it was thirty-six miles or     more--four hours' drive in a Cape cart. The only 'boy' at the     station with a vehicle was engaged, so I bade him come back again     for me as soon as he had got rid of his fare, which he did in     something over an hour, although he had said he should be 'back in     a second.' When he did come he was unwilling to take me without his     baas' leave, so we set off to find the baas; he was not at his     house nor at his stable; he might be at church. I went and routed     him out of his devotions, finally bargaining with him to take me     there and back for L3!     "Now Mr. ----'s 'farm' comprises some eighteen or twenty different     farms, of which about 160,000 acres are in one block, and some     80,000 acres more in three or four separate pieces. Each of these     farms is managed by a farmer who is responsible to the top manager,     who also has charge of one of the individual farms. My destination     was a farm where Mr. ---- was believed by the railway people to be     that day.     "The first half of the ride we were cooked in the sun; then     darkness came on--black darkness; then some ominous drops of rain,     which were soon _sheets_ instead of _drops_, and such thunder and     lightning as I never want to hear or see again in this life.     "I was afraid we should get lost in the dark; for, although it was     called a 'main road,' it was in reality merely a _track_--not that     in many places--with any amount of 1 ft., 2 ft., 3 ft., and 4 ft.     holes (no, I draw the line at the 3 ft. holes, upon consideration);     but my driver, who dignified himself with the title of 'mail     contractor,' was sure that his horses could find the way in the     darkest darkness, as they do the journey each way twice every week.     But when the darkness got so dense that we could not even see the     horses except when it lightened, even he grew doubtful, remembered     that he _himself_ had not driven them along that road for more than     eight months (though his boy had done), and he thought that we had     better stand still where we were till the storm was over and the     moon rose; but I knew the moon would not rise till 10.30, and we     were already about eighteen miles from anywhere!     "My entreaties that he should proceed met with success, and the     result that we lost the road twice, got into a deep hole and     capsized--the whole caboose.     "When at last we reached the farm, it was to be met with the     announcement that Mr. ---- had left there the previous day, and was     believed now to be about twenty-six miles (three hours nearly)     further on.     "I was soaked to the skin, as hungry as a hunter, and dead beat     into the bargain. The farm manager insisted that I must stay the     night--it was imposible to go on in that storm--and go on in the     morning.     "This is a little world. Mr. ---- had mentioned my name in speaking     to him of The General's visit to Johannesburg, and he had     remembered it as that of the only Salvation Army Officer from whom     he had ever received a letter. Ten years ago or more he had     addressed some inquiry or other to Headquarters, and I had written     him in reply.     "The next morning I drove on to -----, and found Mr. ----in his     orchard. He had not received The General's wire saying I was coming     for the simple reason that, not wanting to be bothered with mails     or telegrams for a couple of days, he had instructed the post     office people to forward all his dispatches to a place which he did     not intend to go until the next day!"If public receptions at railway stations, speeches and addresses byGovernors, Mayors, and Ministers, and Press eulogies could havesatisfied him, The General could not but have been delighted with SouthAfrica, as the following extracts may show. In _The Ladysmith Gazette_we read:--     "General Booth has flashed past Ladysmith like a meteor, but I am     inclined to think he has left a trail of light behind him. It is     fifteen years since I last saw the Leader of The Salvation Army.     Those fifteen years have made but little alteration in the man.     There is the same old Saxon profile, the same storm-defying,     weather-beaten, almost eagle-eyed features, and the same slightly     rasping, but intensely interesting in its earnestness, voice.     "There is plenty of strength still in that patriarchal figure, and     with the exception of a slight stoop The General is as vigorous as     he was fifteen years ago. In appearance, The General reminded     myself of Canon Kingsley. They have the same Anglo-Saxon,     falcon-like features, and the same indomitable energy and courage.     Canon Kingsley was not so well provided with hair as The General;     but, on the contrary, he could boast of a more prominent nasal     organ. Both men had flashing eyes, deeply-set and overhanging     eyebrows, giving force and determination to the face.     "Both the late Canon and General Booth were equally sturdy     specimens of Saxon descent, and both worked for the masses. Canon     Kingsley, as he would admit to-day, was before his time, and in     aiding the Chartist movement made a fatal mistake. Canon Kingsley,     as shown in _Alton Locke_, endeavoured to raise the masses to     heights attainable only by men of education and men of thought, and     to-day the recoil of that pernicious doctrine is being felt.     "General Booth places a man in the position God intended him to     occupy, and if the man can raise himself higher by strenuous effort     then well and good.     "The Salvation of General Booth is the true Salvation--the     Salvation of regeneration, and the world's thinkers are surely     recognising the fact that The Salvation Army is a factor to be     reckoned with. General Booth and his people have succeeded when all     others have failed."_The Rhodesia Herald_, of Salisbury, said:--     "General Booth has well been called the Grand Old Man of The     Salvation Army, for undoubtedly it is his remarkable personality     and fierce energy which has made The Army what it is to-day, and     has enabled it to do a work which no other religious organisation     has attempted to do on anything like the same scale, and to reach a     section of the people who remained untouched by the more orthodox     methods of other bodies. It is not so very many years ago that     branches of The Army in many towns in the United Kingdom were     striving to make headway against most determined     opposition--opposition employing methods of which the authors soon     became heartily ashamed. Yet to-day, the different branches of The     Army are doing their work, not only unmolested, but helped and     encouraged by all classes of the community. And this because The     Army has wrung recognition by transparent honesty of purpose, and     unceasing efforts to help those most in need of help and     encouragement. As the aged General put it on his arrival in     Johannesburg, the Organisation of which he is the mainspring has     set before itself the task of giving a helping hand to the very     poor, those who are without friends, and those who have fallen in     the battle of life."The members of the Cape Town and district Evangelical Church Council intheir address to General William Booth, D.C.L., said:--     "We have been deeply touched by the energy, the wisdom, and the     consecration with which you carry on your work at a period of life     when most men have retired from active service.     "We would join with our brethren of the Christian Churches     throughout the world in assuring you of our admiration, mixed with     our wonder, at the success which has attended your labours for the     Salvation of the most helpless and degraded members of our race.     "Hand in hand with your efforts for the Salvation of the souls of     the fallen have gone a true Christlike care for the bodies of the     unfortunate, and an attempt to stem the current of social evil and     degeneracy.     "We are deeply interested in your experiments in colonising those     parts of our Empire which are at present sparsely populated, and     thus relieving the tension of social problems in the larger cities     of Great Britain, and that congestion of population which is a     fruitful source of individual and of social degradation.     "We trust your visit to South Africa may result in the settlement     in the rich lands now untilled of a population, which by its     industry, thrift, and character will compare with those of Canada,     New Zealand, and Australia.     "We rejoice that the great Captain of Salvation continues to lead     the Organisation, of which you are the head and heart in one, to     great victories over the forces of evil, and assure you that in     this land we recognise The Salvation Army as a powerful force for     the spiritual and social uplift of the people. It is always a     pleasure for the Churches we represent to render any aid in our     power to an Organisation for whose members and whose work we have     the deepest regard.     "It is the earnest prayer of the Council that your visit may be     full of blessing to your community, that it may result in a fresh     infusion of hope and enthusiasm into the hearts of your     fellow-workers, and that God may abundantly fill you with spiritual     and physical energy in the fulfilment of the great enterprise on     which you have entered.     "_August 26_, 1908."The address of the Bloemfontein Town Council very carefully avoids anyreference to the proposed Over-Sea Colony. Perhaps the whole secret ofSouth Africa's indifference to it is revealed in the following extractfrom a paper, whose name we omit, lest any appearance of hostility toany locality or any element in that enormous country should seem to havecrept into our feelings here.After half a column of compliments as to his good work and intentionsthe editorial gentleman, not of Bloemfontein, goes on with his great"But" as follows:--     "But the social elevation, or the spiritual conversion of the boozy     scum of a European nation may not be advanced at the cost of the     well-being of our own people. We protest most earnestly against     that at once. It does not matter whether he has fixed his eye upon     Rhodesia or the Kalahari desert--these lands belong geographically     to South Africa, and we need it for its own peoples. True, we have     plenty of territory, even for others who may wish to come and     settle amongst us, and wish to be of us.     "But we have no room for the 'submerged tenth' of any other nation     whatever."In vain did The General keep explaining in every land he visited that hehad never thought of, or made any plan for, "dumping" crowds of wastrelson any country, but only such people as had been tested and proved fitfor such an opportunity as they could not get in overcrowded countries.There was always the same loud and continued applause for "his noblework," and, then, almost everywhere--not often with the honestoutspokenness of that newspaper--the same "I pray thee have _me_ (mycountry) excused from receiving this Colony."And then the old man would give the tiny handfuls who, thanks to insaneconstitutionalism, have been left to monopolise vast areas of theearth, warnings of the future that may be remembered by generations tocome. Whilst in South Africa he was gladdened by receiving the followingreport as to the multitudes he was sending out to Canada:--     "Emigrated from October, 1903, to July 31, 1908, 36,308; of whom     were assisted by loan, 9,400; total amounts advanced, L38,375;     total amounts repaid (within first five years _already_!), L5,112."But as to South Africa, he grasped the main feature of the situationthere; and thus wrote, in words that may be remembered, _not only inthat country,_ when, for the British Empire, it is for ever too late:--     "The more I see of this country, the more I am convinced of the     folly of the controversy that prevails in some minds, and of the     fears that are entertained about the predominance of the Dutch     element. Before many years have passed the question will not be as     to what nation of whites shall have the mastery, but whether the     whites will have any mastery at all; not whether it shall be Dutch     land or British land, but whether it shall be a white man's land.     The undisputed growth in intelligence of the African and Indian     combined will soon give them so great a preponderance that they     will capture the agriculture and trade generally.     "What is to hinder them from the capture of the mineral production,     and the mastery of the country in general? There is only one way     for the white man, and that is to add to his numbers such as will     join him in the struggle, and to convert the coloured element to     righteousness and truth and honesty and industry.     "I want to help them, but they cannot see far enough.     "These are the sentiments that ought to be pressed upon the     attention of our government."Here is another letter which is valuable especially for the light itgives with regard to The General's careful examination during hisjourneys into all that concerned the efficiency of The Army and of everyleading Officer in it:--     "I have not said much about the character and condition of the work     generally, having reserved my ideas for the closing of my     correspondence.     "In a general way, however, I will make a few observations:--     "1. The Territory must certainly be in better form than it has ever     been before. This, considering the havoc made by the war, is saying     a good deal. There are more Corps, more Officers, more Soldiers,     plenty of money to meet their requirements, and as much favourable     public opinion as is good for them, perhaps a little more.     "2. So far as we have had opportunity for observation, the Officers     and Soldiers appear to be in good spirits.     "3. Some important advances are under consideration, or in     progress, in the direction of properties, both Social and     Spiritual.     "4. Several very remarkable Revivals have taken place.     "5. The Commissioner appears to be much improved.     "6. The more I see of ---- the more I like him, and my impression     is confirmed that he is a long way the best man in the country for     dealing with the natives.     "7. The Commissioner thinks that what there is to be known as to     cattle, land, products, etc., is known to ----. I love him very     much.     "8. The same applies very largely to ----. What he does know he may     know better than ----, though I am not sure whether his knowledge     is so extensive.     "9. I have seen little of ----; but he is said to be very     successful in his present appointment. Two gentlemen who have been     inspecting his place say they could not have believed that such     wonderful results could have been achieved in so unlikely a place.     "10. This man, ----, has sat on the platform, and prayed when he     has been called upon to pray; but he has done nothing more. I shall     instruct K., I think, to ask him a few questions, one of which will     be whether he is willing to take a position in another part of the     world."Of course, I am only snatching such sentences as convey the main ideas,without their fuller development, which would risk indicating thepersons referred to.Will it be believed that, whilst this octogenarian was toiling in theheat to prepare if he could a brighter future for some of the poor, asyndicate of slanderers in London, some well educated, some of theTrafalgar Square bawler type, were seeking to bless "the Britishpublic" by enlightening them as to his selfish and foolish designs uponthem? According to their theories his every new scheme was only broughtforth to turn aside attention from his entire failure, and ensure acontinuous flow of money into his coffers!Perhaps, the best feature of all about his "dreams" was that they neverbecame less cheery for all that, and their continuously increasinginfection of the world, despite every attack.The General writes, after his great Meeting with some of our nativecomrades as reported in connexion with his final Congress:--     "I have been much occupied, as I have already told you I expected     to be, with the _Native Question_; and I am satisfied that one of     the greatest things ever done in the history of the world can be     done here, and I am determined to make an attempt to do it.     "I do not say that our chance is _greater_ than it is in     India--though I am not sure whether it does not equal it in many     ways. Anyway, it appears to me that it is open to us to realise a     mighty success."Chapter XVIIJapanese HeroismJapan, amidst all the records of its modern progress, must certainlycount the honour of having properly recognised the value of The Generaland his Army before the old "Christian" countries of Europe did so.The Army's beginning in Japan was almost laughable in its feebleness.The little company of Officers sent out by The General, in 1895, wereindeed truly devoted, and in their anxiety to be from the first "asJapanese to the Japanese," were so taken in whilst halting in Hong Kongthat they landed in the most extraordinary garments--and it was a longtime before they seemed likely to make any impression upon thenon-Christian Japanese. But upon the Christians they, undoubtedly, made,from the first, an excellent mark.With all their lack of knowledge of the language, there could be nomistake about their willingness to learn, and to be the servants of allmen. It was clear that they possessed those two great qualifications forApostolic success, an unlimited readiness for hard work, and anunbounded faith in the will and power of Christ to save. Their firstinterpreter, a student anxious to do his uttermost for Christ and hiscountry, was speedily won over completely to their side, and as he wasalready known amongst the Pressmen, this became a very great help to theprogress of their work generally.Yet, under several successive leaders, they toiled on for some yearswith but little prospect. The language is one of the most difficultimaginable for foreigners to learn, and, although there was from thefirst great liberty as to Open-Air Meetings, and congregations weregathered outdoors and into the little Halls that were contrived out ofshops and dwelling-houses, it seemed likely to prove slow work to raisea Japanese force.But all at once, in 1902, God gave the little company a greatopportunity. For years already some faithful Japanese under missionaryinfluences, had been lamenting the position of the girls given over toimmorality, who were severed for life from the rest of the community,and kept under police supervision, in a special quarter called theYoshiwara of each city, as well as cut off from all the hopes of theGospel. A law had indeed been passed allowing such girls as might wishto abandon their awful calling to do so; but it was so administered aspractically to remain a dead letter."Why," thought our leaders, "should we not issue a special edition ofour _War Cry_, explaining Christ's love and power to save the deepestsunken in sin, and our Rescue Work, and then go and sell it in theYoshiwara?"The idea was carried out, and, to all appearance, the first day, withwonderful success. The great companies of pleasure-seekers saw in the"Paper" a novelty of interest and bought and read it eagerly. But it wasfar too great a success to please the brothel keepers, who at once hiredmen to attack _The War Cry_ sellers, should they repeat their invasion.When it became known that our Officers had thus been attacked, reportersof the Tokio and Yokohama papers hurried to see the, for Japan, unusualsight, and then the whole Press of the country came out strongly on ourside. We were fully recognised as the loving friends of the friendlessand oppressed, and from that day our standing in the country wasassured.Not many girls were gathered into our little Rescue Home; but thousandslearnt the way of escape from their houses of bondage, and within a fewyears many thousands returned to their old homes all over the country.It should be explained that the brothels were really supplied as aresult of the heroic devotion of the girls to their parents and homes.It was common for a girl, in any time of extra want or destitution, tosuggest or consent to her sale to one of the bad houses for the reliefof her family. This fact, however, of course increased both thenational sympathy for the victims, and the high appreciation of our carefor them.But the main thing, after all, in all this action was the revelation ofan Army, unable as yet to make itself well understood in words butcapable of thus manifesting its resolution to fight for the liberationof all men from the power of sin.We had issued already a _Common People's Gospel_, written by our ChiefSecretary, Colonel Vamamuro, which gave a very clear explanation of ourteachings and system. This book was not only a sort of harmony of theGospels, but explained how we understand and teach the Salvation Christbought for us all. This Gospel came to be appreciated and utilised byalmost all the missions in the country, and greatly helped us also inmaking clear our meaning to the nation. By its sale, as well as that of_The War Cry,_ throughout the country very many, even of those who weretoo far off for it to be possible for them to attend any of ourMeetings, were led to Christ.And thus steadily, though slowly, we made our way, until we had Corps inmost of the great cities, and became known generally wherever there werethinking and reading people. Our Halls were, and still are, very small,it being almost impossible to find either large ones hireable, or largespaces available for building upon, in the great cities. Yet marvellouswere the displays of God's power to save in the little rooms, which werepacked to the doors night after night, and in the Open-Air Meetings. Ourleaders in the country, for several years, were Officers who, amidst themultitudes of India, or of the slums of London had seen how souls couldbe won, in spite of every outward disadvantage, by the irresistiblepower of the Holy Ghost. And thus the numbers of our Japanese Soldiersand Officers steadily grew. Just as in England, men who had beennotorious in sin became equally notorious witnesses for Jesus. Japan isa great country for holiday festivals, when all the streets are by daybeflagged and by night illuminated with Chinese lanterns, almost thewhole population turning out on such occasions. Our troops naturallymade the most of such days, and it became a common thing to see men andeven women kneeling in an Open-Air Meeting to seek Salvation.So when it was announced, in 1907, that The General was coming, Japanresolved to give him a welcome such as he had never had before. That aman should undertake, at seventy-eight years of age, such a journey, wasfelt to be a tribute both to the country and to the man himself, andthere was a desire, if anything more in non-Christian than in Christiancircles to hear him, and do him honour."Tell him," said a Tokio editor, "that he is coming to a country such ashe has never before visited--which can appreciate self-sacrifice, as wehave shown in the late war."And from the moment when his steamer entered Yokohama Harbour to that ofhis departure, nothing was omitted that could open his way to the earsand hearts of the entire nation. I had the pleasure myself to witnessthose unforgettable scenes, and to notice The General's own astonishmentat the universal interest of the people. In each city he found therailway station decorated. A platform was erected, generally in somepublic space, whence he could address the multitudes who came out tohear him. The largest public buildings were crowded for his indoorservices, and hundreds came out publicly in reply to his appeals fortheir surrender to Christ.Not only was he received by the late Emperor in his palace, and welcomedto every provincial centre by the Governors of the Provinces, and theMayors of the Cities, but again and again the most eminent men gave himopportunities to plead with them for Christ. What a sight it was to seethe great platform crowded with all the chief men of a city, singinglike the rest of the audience "Stand up, stand up for Jesus." TheGeneral was accepted by almost unanimous consent, as representing a lifeof entire self-abandonment to the glory of God and the Salvation of thelost, and far beyond anything even that at the moment appeared, was hisCampaign a general victory for the Saviour.There could be no mistake as to the message he delivered, for, even tothe vast crowds of students gathered in the quadrangle of theUniversity, or in and around the Theatre of Kobe to hear him, he stoodand cried in no new terms, although with due adaptation to their ways ofthought, just as he might have cried to any English audience, that Goddemanded and deserved a whole-hearted, life-long service from every one."What?" asked the Ambassador of a great power, "Do you really want me tocome out on to the stage and confess my sins before everybody?" when awoman-Officer invited him to one of The General's last Meetings. Had HisExcellency done so, no Japanese would have thought it anything beneaththe highest human dignity, for they all recognised the value of thatcourage for Christ and His War which The General personified to them.We are still few in number and struggling hard for victory in Japan, forthe very appreciation of all that is excellent tends to create in thepeople a self-satisfaction that fortifies them against all appeals forrepentance. But one of the leading officials of the Japanese Home Officehas recently paid a tribute to The General's helpfulness to everypeople.Mr. Tomioka says, in his _Society and Humanity_, after having studiedThe Army in England and America, as well as in Japan, that he considersit to be "the greatest and most successful Organisation in the world fordealing with and helping the poor and unfortunate classes of society."He attributes our success to the following reasons:--1. The great personality of The General, whose character greatlyresembled that of his Divine Master--the Founder of Christianity.2. Our aggressive spirit--ever marching on, like the Japanese soldiersin the last war with Russia.3. Our adaptation to the circumstances of every country.4. Our straightforward and practical way of preaching Salvation.5. Our principle of self-support. Teaching men and women to helpthemselves.6. Our scientific and business-like methods, as distinct from meresentimentality.Some day, surely, men equally eminent in other countries will begin tospeak as heartily and thoughtfully of The General's life work.That the great Mikado, to whose wisdom and energy Japan owed so much ofits great renewal and entry amongst the "civilised" nations, should havepassed into eternity only a few months before the Founder of a wider andgrander, because spiritual, Empire, is an interesting fact. The Mikadoreceived our General, in spite of every court usage that might havehindered, because he found that all the greatest leaders and heroes ofJapan, like their Press, saw in him the personification of the highestand noblest purpose for every land and every people.The Japanese Government gave our Officers, women as well as men, aliberty of access to their prisoners greater than we as yet possess inthis and most other "Christian" countries, because they saw the value ofour love for the victims of sin, and our power, by God's grace, toinspire them with hope for themselves. How many more years, I wonder,will it take other nations to follow this common-sense example?Chapter XVIIICo-operating With GovernmentsThe Government of the Dutch East Indies, which was in the hands, at thetime, of a military man, has won for ever the honour of appreciating andutilising The Army of The General they had never seen, before any ofthose who had seen him. Certainly, The General never ran after earthlyrulers, or showed any disposition to court their favour; but he saidconstantly, "Here we are; if any Government, municipal or national,likes to use us, we can save them more than half of what they now spendupon their poor and criminal classes, and do for these far more thanChristian Government officials, however excellent, ever hope to do. Theyare invariably so bound to avoid any meddling with religion that theycannot bring to bear upon those most in need of it, the heavenly lightand love and power, in which we place all our confidence for dealingwith these classes.""Gentlemen," said a Town Councillor, in a German city, when the questionof subsidising The Army was being discussed, "The Army can do for yourpoor what you never can attempt. You can only deal with them fromwithout. The Army works upon them from within, and produces results thatwill considerably lighten your burdens."The General had arranged for the Dutch Indies to be missioned fromAustralia, that country being our nearest Field and one accustomed todeal with pioneer effort. But when he found that Dutch officialdomdreaded contact with British agents, though ready to welcome Dutch ones,he very quickly changed his plans, and as soon as the ColonialGovernment found that The Army was as much Dutch as English, and couldsend them a Dutch leader, they showed themselves ready to use us asfully as possible.Our Officers in every town and village are supplied with all themedicines and bandages they can use, for the Government has found thatthey live amongst the poorest all the time, and are always ready tobathe and bandage their wounded limbs and feet, or to give them the fewmedicines needed to combat the ordinary maladies. Moreover, from someterrible losses by death of Officers, in our earliest years there, itwas made only too plain to every one that our Officers would not abandontheir people in times of cholera or other epidemics, but would rathersuffer and die with them.More unsanitary surroundings than we have in lovely Java could scarcelybe imagined, and no government can hope to alter the habits of an entirepeople very rapidly. The Chinese and others in the cities have never yetbegun to consider dirt in house or street as dangerous, and the entirepopulation has grown up with such a love for bathing in the very samecanals which serve largely for drainage and every other purpose, thatthere cannot, for a long time to come, be great hopes of much sanitaryimprovement.But when it was seen that we had Officers not only willing and ready tolive and die with the people, but, also capable of lifting them into anew life, and of carrying out any simple administrative duties thatmight be laid upon them, we had first one and then another of theGovernment's institutions offered for our care, as well as theprovisioning of the hospitals. From daybreak in the morning till the endof their evening Meetings, our Officers may be seen showing the people,old and young, brotherly and sisterly love; and though they may not, asyet, have succeeded in many places in raising up such a native force aswe should desire, the Government has found them as persevering as ifthey had gained the crowd which their toils and endurances havedeserved.The first Leper Institution placed in our charge was so rapidlytransformed from a place of despair and misery into a home of Salvationhope and joy, that the Government naturally desired to see more suchinstitutions, adequate to receive the entire leper population of theislands, which is, alas! large.Our position in Java, and the consequent discussion of us in the DutchParliament, led to our first public recognition in the world as aChristian force. Because we do not baptise with water there has been inJava a disposition amongst some Christian teachers to refuse to any ofour people burial in a Christian cemetery. But when in the Dutch budgetdiscussion this was made an objection to our receiving any grant, theColonial Minister simply read out the whole of our Articles of War, andasked how any one could refuse to recognise as Christians those who hadsigned such declarations.The Governments of the various Australian Colonies must, however, havethe credit of first giving to our Officers public patronage. As hasalready been mentioned, the Governors, Premiers, and Ministers have, forsome twenty-seven years past, been seen presiding over the anniversariesof our Colonial work, speaking in no measured terms of all ouractivities, and so helping us to get the means to support them.The Queen Mother and the present Queen of Holland were the first royalpersonages personally to visit our Institutions, although the presentKing of Denmark, when Crown Prince, had for years used our Refuges inthat country for cases he thought deserving, and his brother, KingHaakon, of Norway, attended, as a warm friend, one of The General'sMeetings in Christiania.Canadian and South African Governors and Ministers have acted like theAustralian ones in their public expressions of confidence in us, andthey have given us very considerable liberty in their prisons, so thatmost of the criminal population comes more or less under our influence.The greatest of our governmental victories have, however, been won inSwitzerland and Germany, where we were for so many years looked upon asa dangerous, if not harmful, influence, owing chiefly to the grosscalumnies of "Christian" teachers and writers. The results of our workupon those whose lives had been a disgrace and burden to the communitycould not be hidden, however, and there is now scarcely a cantonalgovernment in Switzerland which does not subsidise some one or other ofour Institutions. The cities of Hamburg and Elberfeld, in Germany, haveled the way in granting to us similar assistance, and it can only be aquestion of time before we gravitate into an equally honoured positionelsewhere. For although we continue to keep as far as possible alooffrom all parties, and party feeling, and have not, therefore, the meansof influencing and obtaining grants from politicians in the ordinaryway, we compel attention by what we do, and have, undoubtedly, done morethan any other religious community to create that inclination towardsintelligent care for the criminal and outcast which is almost becoming afashion, in governmental circles, nowadays.It begins to look as if, had The General lived, some of the SouthAmerican republics would have been the first, after all, to gladden hisheart by a hearty and handsome co-operation. For twenty years he pleadedfor an opportunity to show what could be done for those whose life andcharacter have been wrecked amidst the breakers of modern life, if theywere removed from their old surroundings and compelled to live under ourinfluence in country air. We have come so far in this direction, in NewZealand, that we have bought islands, where former inebriates and theirchildren can be kept completely severed from their old temptations, andso have every opportunity to begin a new life if they will. Men, as wellas young people, are frequently handed over to us by the authorities;but there is not yet anywhere a sufficient power given to detain thosewho are disinclined to hard work.And recently, The General was promised, in the course of interviews withauthorities, a considerable extension in the United Kingdom of theliberty to deal with prisoners, which we have long enjoyed in Americaand Canada. The long night, when prisoners were treated only astroublesome animals against whom society needed protection, seems to bepassing, and with the new, earnest resolve to try and fit them for abetter life, which, without God's help, can never be done, we arelooking forward to greatly improved opportunities. In India, as hasalready been noted, many persons belonging to the criminal tribes arealready under our care, and, wherever we have the opportunity to provewhat the power of God can do in such hearts, there can be no doubt ofthe ultimate result.Upon the question of temperance, there is happily a widespread awakeningamongst the nations. So convinced are all Governments and peoples thatdrinking and crime are closely connected, that much has already beendone, with good effect, to lessen the sale of intoxicants in many lands,and more is being promised. Anxious as we are to see the drink-trafficabolished everywhere, it has never appeared to us to be desirable tojoin in agitations of a political kind on the subject. And the wisdom ofthis attitude has been shown, on both sides of the Atlantic, by themanner in which this question has been used to embitter party strife.But it was a puzzle at first to know by which course to steer. When aLicensing Bill was before the English House of Commons, The Generalwrote:--     "The Licensing Bill has given me much anxiety, mainly because I see     so imperfectly what we ought to do. However, we shall do what seems     the best to be done--with what success has to be seen. I am     heartily sick of politics and parties, and that, mainly, because     they seem to me so insincere.     "What an unsatisfactory thing is life, apart from the real work we     do for God and the Salvation of souls! I want more faith, more     conquering faith. I must have it.     "I have got work to-day to do that cannot be done without Divine     wisdom. I have asked for it. I am asking for it while I write, and,     surely, it will be given; and yet it seems as though the Spirit     whispers in my ear, 'You will not believe you have it when it is     imparted.' But I will. Anyhow, I will make a desperate effort to     believe that the Spirit of the living God guides my judgment,     however I may feel, or whatever the outcome may be. Pray for me. I     cling to life and the work I love so well."Remarkably enough, the German police, who, more than any other,suspected and watched and restricted us at first, have become the firstconvinced of the value of our operations, and those in the city ofCologne have been the very first heartily to arrange for ourco-operation with them by placing at our disposal a convenienthand-waggon for the transport of helpless drunkards, and by arrangingfor their officials to call us upon the telephone, whenever such help isneeded, instead of taking the poor drunkards to the cells.This plan was arrived at only after the police had seen the work carriedout by our people with an ambulance which required the services of twostrong men. But there is reason to suppose that our cordialrelationships with the authorities in Cologne and elsewhere are largelydue to the good impression made upon them by The General himself. Of hisgreat Meeting in Cologne, attended by many officials, and other personsof influence, he wrote:--     "I had certainly a remarkable Campaign, and my Meeting in Cologne     was one of the most remarkable in my history. Oh, it was a moving,     hope-inspiring affair. Oh, what wonders the dear Salvation Army may     yet accomplish in the Fatherland! I am sure it will be so, whoever     lives to see it."Thank God that he was spared to see another seven years of progress inthat direction since this was written.In Japan, which cannot be supposed to be specially favourable to anyChristian Society, we have long had opportunity regularly to visit allpersons in custody, and as we have already seen, to invite all girlsliving an immoral life to come to our Institutions.Why is there still difficulty in the way of our work for the prisoners,and other needy ones in Christendom? Chiefly, because there arechaplains and others specially appointed to deal with such needs, andwho, naturally, do not wish to see others "interfering," as they think,with their parishioners. In very many cases nowadays there is a muchbetter feeling than formerly, and such persons heartily welcome ourhelp, knowing that we never wish to meddle with any one's work, but onlyto work where others can gain no entrance.In a certain Australian jail, at the time when men there could besentenced to death for many crimes other than murder, a condemned manwas in such agonies of remorse that none of the warders could get anyrest. The help of one of our Officers was greatly desired, but thechaplain would not consent, so that our Officer could not be admitted.In another part of the prison, however, one of our Soldiers was awarder, and those who knew this sought him out and brought him to thedistressed sinner, whom he very soon succeeded in leading to theSaviour, who gave him a peace as complete as that which He gave to Hiscompanion in crucifixion.It is by this patience and efficiency that our Officers, wherever theyget opportunity, win the favour of authorities, prisoners, and sufferersof every kind. Therefore, we reckon that it can only be a question oftime before our way is opened to do far more than ever for thefriendless of every land.In times of special emergency, The General's Officers always find anopportunity to distinguish themselves. Thus, in the last earthquake ofJamaica our Officers in Kingston were said to have been the calmest andreadiest to undertake all that needed to be done. In those terribledays, again, of earthquake and fire in San Francisco the Salvationistsprovided food and shelter for the Chinese, and others of the mostdespised; and in South Italy such was the impression produced by the wayin which our Officers laboured, when Calabria was desolated byearthquake, that our Officer there, Commissioner Cosandey, had thehonour of a Knighthood conferred upon him in recognition of the mannerin which he had superintended the distribution of blankets and otherarticles provided out of the Lord Mayor of London's fund, the skill hemanifested gaining the approval of both the Italian Government and theBritish Ambassador there.We seek neither honours nor rewards, however; but only the opportunityto carry out our first General's plans for the good of all meneverywhere.Chapter XIXConquering DeathOnly those who have had some experience of a perfectlife-partnership--such as existed for thirty-five years between TheGeneral and his wife--can form any conception of the sufferings he hadto pass through, in connexion with her prolonged illness and death.She had always been more or less delicate in health, yet had, throughnearly all those years, triumphed so completely over weakness andsuffering as to be at once one of the happiest of wives and mothers, andthe most daring of comrades in the great War.During much of 1887 she had suffered more than usually, and yet hadtaken part with him in many great demonstrations; but in February, 1888,new symptoms made their appearance, and she decided upon consulting oneof the ablest of London physicians, because she had always dreaded thather end would come, like that of her mother, through cancer, and wishedto use every possible care to prolong, as much as might be possible, herdays of helpfulness.When in February, 1888, Sir James Paget told her that she had,undoubtedly, got this disease, and would, probably, not be alive formore than eighteen months or two years, she received the announcementwith the greatest calm and fortitude. The General says:--     "After hearing the verdict of the doctors, she drove home alone.     That journey can better be imagined than described. She told me     how, as she looked upon the various scenes through the cab windows,     it seemed to her as if sentence of death had been passed upon     everything; how she had knelt upon the cab floor and wrestled in     prayer; and how the realisation of our grief swept over her.     "I shall never forget, in this world or the next, that meeting. I     had been watching for the cab, and had run out to meet and help her     up the steps. She tried to smile upon me, through her tears; but,     drawing me into the room, she unfolded to me gradually the result     of her interview. I sat down speechless. She rose from her seat and     came and knelt beside me, saying, 'Do you know what was my first     thought? That I should not be there to nurse you, at your last     hour.'     "I was stunned. I felt as if the whole world was coming to a     standstill. She talked like a heroine, like an angel, to me. She     talked as she had never talked before. I could say nothing. I could     only kneel with her and try to pray.     "I was due in Holland for some large Meetings. I had arranged to     travel there that very night. She would not hear of my remaining at     home for her sake. Never shall I forget starting out that evening,     with the mournful tidings weighing like lead upon my heart. Oh, the     conflict of that night journey! I faced two large congregations,     and did my best, although it seemed to me that I spoke as one in a     dream. Leaving the Meetings to be continued by others, I returned     to London the following evening. And then followed, for me, the     most painful experience of my life. To go home was anguish. To be     away was worse. Life became a burden, almost too heavy to be borne,     until God in a very definite manner comforted my heart."After this, there were two years and a half of such tortures for him tobear! For some time, indeed, Mrs. Booth was still able occasionally totake part with him, even in very large Meetings. But any one canunderstand how such privileges only increased his sense of coming loss.Her last address was delivered in the City Temple, on June 21, 1888, andshe had to remain for nearly an hour after in the pulpit before shecould move. Nevertheless, she was able to continue her help by writingfor our publications, and to individuals, for a long time after this.Before the Self-Denial Week of 1888 she wrote to our Soldiers:--     "Although not able to be at the front of the battle in person, my     heart is there, and the greatest pain I suffer arises from my     realisation of the vast opportunities of the hour, and of the     desperate pressure to which many of my comrades are subject, while     I am deprived of the ability to help them, as in days gone by."In 1889 she wrote:--     "I am now realising, as never before, how much harder it is to     suffer than to serve. I can only assure you again, by letter, that     my heart is as much with you as ever. Regard no opposition,     persecution, or misrepresentation. Millions upon millions wait for     us to bring to them the light of life."To the great Crystal Palace Demonstration of 1889 she sent a messagewhich was displayed in large letters:--     "My place is empty, but my heart is with you. Go forward. Live holy     lives. Be true to The Army. God is your strength. Love and seek the     lost. God is my salvation and refuge in the storm."Hers was, indeed, a prolonged storm of suffering, the strain of whichupon The General cannot easily be realised. He would go out, time aftertime, to his great journeys and Meetings with, necessarily, a gnawinguncertainty as to what might occur in his absence, and would be called,again and again, to what he thought might be her last agony, only to seeher, after hours of extraordinary pain and weakness, rally again, tosuffer more. To the very end her mind continued to be as clear andpowerful as of old, so that her intense interest in everything connectedwith his work made it difficult for The General to realise that shemight at any moment be called away from him. Often through the longhours of the night he would watch beside her.To a party of Officers who visited her in 1889, she said:--     "I feel that at this moment I could put all my children into their     graves, and go to a workhouse bed to die, sooner than I could see     the principles of The Salvation Army, for which I have lived and     struggled, undermined and sacrificed. God will not fail you. Give     the children my dear love, and tell them that, if there had been a     Salvation Army when I was ten years old, I should have been as good     a Soldier then as I am to-day."To the last she maintained her interest in comrades who were furthestoff, as well as in those who were near. To Australians she sent themessage:--     "Tell them I look on them and care for them, as for my English     children, and that I expect them to gather in many a sorrowing     mother's prodigal, who has wandered far from his Father's house."Of one of those terrible occasions when it seemed as if the end hadcome, The General writes, in December, 1889:--     "To stand by the side of those you love, and watch the ebbing tide     of life, unable to stem it, or to ease the anguish, is an     experience of sorrow which words can but poorly describe. There was     a strange choking sensation in the throat which threatened     suffocation. After several painful struggles there was a great     calm, and we felt the end had come."What a mercy that nobody knew how many months of agony were yet tofollow! It was not till October, 1890, that the end really came. Shesent that year to The Army for its Self-Denial Week, the message:--     "My Dear Children and Friends,--     "I have loved you much, and in God's strength have helped you a     little. Now, at His call, I am going away from you.     "The War must go on. Self-Denial will prove your love to Christ.     All must do something.     "I send you my blessing. Fight on, and God will be with you.     Victory comes at last. I will meet you in Heaven.     "Catherine Booth."On October 1st violent haemorrhage set in. The General was telegraphedfor, and after days and nights of continual suffering and extremeweakness, she passed away on Saturday afternoon, October 4, 1890.Writing immediately afterwards, The General said:--     "Ever since our first meeting, now nearly forty years ago, we have     been inseparable in spirit; that is, in all the main thoughts and     purposes of our lives. Oh, what a loss is mine! It cannot be     measured."And yet, anxious, as in every other case, to make the very best of thefuneral for the good of souls, The General rose, by God's grace, socompletely above his own feelings as to be able to take part in all theunparalleled services that followed. More than forty thousand peoplevisited the Congress Hall, Clapton, to look upon her remains there, andto pray and give themselves to God in many cases, whilst her favouritehymns were sung by bands of Cadets. The coffin was then removed to theOlympia, the largest covered building we could hire in London, and30,000 persons passed the turnstiles to attend the funeral service,conducted mostly by signs, according to a printed programme.The next day, the funeral march was restricted to Officers of whom 3,000were present; but the crowds which looked on as it passed right throughfrom our Headquarters in the City to the Abney Park Cemetery were beyondall computation. A crowd of 10,000, admitted by ticket, surrounded thegrave, where The General spoke, as one newspaper reported, "as aSoldier, who had disciplined his emotion without effort, and straightfrom the heart." Of his wonderful address, we have only room to quotethe final words:--     "What, then, is there left for me to do? Not to count the weeks,     the days, and the hours which shall bring me again into her sweet     company, seeing that I know not what will be on the morrow, nor     what an hour may bring forth. My work is plainly to fill up the     weeks, the days, and the hours, and cheer my poor heart as I go     along, with the thought that when I have served my Christ and my     generation, according to the will of God, which I vow this     afternoon I will, to the last drop of my blood, that then she will     bid me welcome to the skies, as He bade her. God bless you all!     Amen."And then he knelt and kissed the coffin, and we lowered it into thegrave. The Chief of the Staff read a form of Covenant, which thousandsrepeated, and then we parted.From that very day The General rose up and went forward, sorrowing, asevery one could see, to his last days over his irreparable loss, butnever allowing his grief to hinder his labours for those who, amidsttheir afflictions have no heavenly Comforter.A still further blow was to fall upon him, only three years later. Mrs.Booth had delighted, especially during her years of suffering, in thefellowship of her second daughter, Emma, who had been married toCommissioner Tucker, in 1890, and who had always seemed to The Generalto be the nearest representative, in many respects, of her mother. Hehad gladly given her up to go with her husband to India, and was equallywilling for her, later, to go to the United States. But he always keptup a very full correspondence with her. Her last letter to him, writtenon an American train, said:--     "My Precious General,--     "I am still on the wing. We were at St. Louis on Sunday, where we     had, in some respects, a rather remarkable day. The entire feeling     of the city has been distinctly different since your visit--the     sympathy now is most marked.     "I also spoke for 'fifteen minutes' (stretched a little) in the     Merchants Exchange, a huge marble structure. No woman, they say,     has ever been heard there before. This was on Saturday at noon, and     quite a number of the leading business and money men turned up at     Sunday's Meetings.     "Can't write more. How I wonder how you are! Up above us all so     high, like a diamond in our sky, though perhaps I ought to say     cyclone or race-horse, or--but there is no simile fine enough.     "Good-night! Would that you were here, so that I could say it, and     hear all that you would like to say, and then start off again to     try and carry out your wishes with better success, as     "Your unfailing Emma."Alas, alas, for the uncertainties of human life! Little did she imaginethat before the letter could reach him she would be gone from anothertrain, for ever from his side.Her own devotion to the War, from her very childhood, had always beensuch as to set an example to all who knew her. As head, for ten years,of our Training Home for women Officers, she did more than can ever beknown to ensure the purity and excellence of The Army's leaders, so thatit may be easily guessed how much her father valued her.As joint leader with her husband of our forces in India, and afterwardsin the United States, she never spared herself, but, in spite ofrepeated illnesses, and without, in any way, neglecting her duties asmother of six children, she travelled and laboured incessantly.Starting out at one o'clock in the morning of October 28th, fromColorado, to ride to Chicago, she managed to make a rush-call, betweentrains, in Kansas City, to view a new building The Army was about totake as an Industrial Home. Throughout most of the two days' journey,she was in conversation with one or another Officer as to comingextension of the work until, finding that Colonel Addie, whose Provinceshe last passed, had composed a new song, she asked him to sing it overto her, and to repeat three times the last verse, which was asfollows:--    Time and place will cease to know you,      Men and things will pass away;    You'll be moving on to-morrow,      You are only here to-day.Little did either of them imagine how terribly the words were to beverified within four hours of their being sung.Just as she was leaving her place in one carriage, to go to the sleepingberth prepared for her in another, a tremendous crash announced to allthe passengers that the car through which she and one of our Officerswere passing had left the rails and been destroyed. Both were buried inthe debris. The Colonel (Holland) survived, but Mrs. Booth-Tucker, afterlingering in unconsciousness a couple of hours, passed away.What a blow for The General! He wrote at the end of the year: "This hasbeen, is, and will be, to the end of my earthly chapter, a mysteriousand painful dispensation--at least, so it appears at the moment. WhatGod may do for me in the future, and how He may make it work for my gooddoes not at present appear. But He is able to make it mightily helpfulto His glory, and the Salvation of souls. With this prospect, Godforbid, then, that I should be other than content--nay, filled withpraise. I am at present strangely supported and cheered; and notstrangely either, for is it not what might have been expected, with somany loving prayers going up to Heaven on my account hour by hour."Remembering that he had lost not only the most tenderly beloved one leftto him, but an Officer holding one of the most important posts he had tofill, we can somewhat estimate the grace that could thus sustain him,and make it possible, even then, to go gladly forward!Yet again he was to drink the bitter cup of family bereavement, thistime affecting his youngest daughter, who had married CommissionerHellberg, already mentioned as one of our first Swedish Officers.Not only had he kept all the promise of his first brave and sturdy standfor The Army as a student, but, gaining by every year's experience invarious lands, he had shown remarkable ability in many spheres.With his no less able and devoted wife, he had laboured in India, atInternational Headquarters, in France and in Switzerland, whenconsumption, alas! showed itself, and, in spite of all that could bedone for him, during years of suffering, in Algiers, and in variousresorts of health-seekers, he steadily sank. Though, of course, deathhad long threatened him, he was caught suddenly at the last, and died inBerlin on the journey homewards to Sweden from South Germany, at a timewhen his wife could not be with him.It will be readily understood how much more trying this was to TheGeneral than if he had been near to comfort his daughter in all hersorrow. And yet this blow, falling upon him when he was seventy-nineyears old, found him no less resolute than ever. He sent this widowedmother out into Denmark, where she was a stranger, to persevere in thefight. She had showed herself, like her father; able to plead at thevery grave-side with the crowd, for God.In connexion with the loss of Mrs. Booth we began a system of specialMemorial Services which have been wonderfully blessed. The first one,held on the first anniversary of her death, in the AgriculturalHall--one of the largest buildings in London, was altogether too largefor any speaking to be heard. The plan was adopted, therefore, as at thefuneral, of a complete form of service, each point of which wasindicated on the programme, and by large illuminated signs. By thismeans the audience, of some 15,000, was able closely and unitedly tojoin in all the songs and prayers, whilst scenes from Mrs. Booth's life,and messages taken from her writings and from The General's, were alsoon the great lantern screen passed on to them. Thousands of the mostcareless and thoughtless were present; but there was no break in thesolemnity of the service. Hundreds went as requested, from the Meetingto a room in the stables, to volunteer for life-service as Officers.What it cost The General to be present on this, and, since then, onsimilar occasions, specially after his daughter's death, may beimagined; but he never hesitated to endure this, for the sake of themany souls such services have invariably aroused to repentance, faith,and self-sacrifice for the War. Writing, in 1905, to a friend, hesays:--     "Were you at the Memorial Service? That was a trying ordeal for me,     but I hear that many were benefited. It seems selfish to ask for so     many intercessions; but I cannot get on without them. (In all our     Memorial Services all present are asked to unite in prayer for the     bereaved ones.) The mere fact of my knowing that so large a number     of the very elect of the Kingdom are pleading for power and love on     my account, helps me forward. God bless and keep and comfort you     every day and every hour."Undoubtedly, these services, whilst blessed to all present, have alsoserved to provoke much prayer and faith for all our bereaved ones, andfor The General most of all, and have thus made it easier for him, andfor all of us, to triumph over personal sorrows and losses, and pressforward to ever-increasing victory.That The General's example of burying his own sorrows in redoubledeffort to cheer and help others has been followed everywhere, may countas large compensation for all he has lost. And yet, all who knew himbest, have seen that the wound caused by Mrs. Booth's loss was neverhealed. With the badge of bereavement, which we have substituted for anycostly mourning, ever upon his left arm, just as it was twenty yearsago, our first General went onward to the great re-union above, "assorrowful, yet always rejoicing," his sadness ever touching as manyhearts as his merry remarks aroused.Curiously enough, The General, whilst anxious at all times to remindevery one of death and judgment, and to prevent their being sointoxicated by pleasure and passing trivialities as to prevent theirthinking of their souls and of eternity, abolished, so far as hisfollowers were concerned, the horrible formalities which, in allcountries have come to be thought necessary whenever death and the gravecome into view.Nothing could be more opposed to everything taught by Christ than theusual processes of "Christian burial," and the records of "thedeparted." He who "brought life and immortality to light" through HisGospel could not wish to see His people's graves surrounded exclusivelyby signs of mourning, and then plastered over with flattering records ofearthly glory, making, as a rule, no mention of His Salvation, and theeternal glories it assures. He manifested, indeed, and always shows thedeepest sympathy with our sorrows; but He does so most by teaching us tomake them steps to higher life and joy.This great purpose The General aimed at in all his arrangements as toburials, and thus alleviated sadness, and turned death into victory to avery remarkable extent. No widow or orphan under his Flag will add toall the inevitable costs of nursing the dying those of fashionable"mourning," clothing, flowers, or monuments. The cross and crown badgeworn on the left arm by himself and his bereaved ones, sometimes foryears, whilst providing a most touching token of abiding affection forlost friends, is, at the same time, a special declaration of faith andhope, and yet obviates entirely the need for any peculiar dress "for theoccasion."Every funeral thus becomes a very valuable opportunity for comfortingand strengthening the mourners, and for urging the unsaved to ensure aneternal triumph. It would not be easy to compute the total of crowdsthus brought under the sound of the Gospel, in connexion with ourlosses, every year.Thus all these occasions for sadness have been turned into fountains ofjoy, not merely to those most immediately concerned, but to the wholecommunity. We have not yet had time or opportunity, thank God!sufficiently to redeem the grave and the cemetery from the scandal ofmen-praising expenditure, for any sort of tombstone has generally beentoo costly for our people. But the small, simple edge-stone which marksthe resting-place of "Catherine Booth, Mother of The Salvation Army,"and which asks every passer-by, "Do you also follow Christ?" has set anexample, consistent with all our past and our eternal future.Surely, the day will come when our General's teaching and practice inthis matter will help to lighten the burden of every bereaved family,and make every cemetery the birthplace of crowds of souls. The music andsong with which we surround every deathbed and funeral, still too muchtinged sometimes with the follies of traditional show, have already beenused by God's Spirit to bring life and gladness to many a spirituallydead soul.Chapter XXHis Social WorkMost erroneously and unfairly it has been widely assumed that the greatwork of The General was the establishment in the world of some SocialInstitutions. Happily, we have got a verbatim report of an address tohis Social Officers gathered around him a year before his death in whichwe have a complete statement as to the beginnings and principles of thework, so that we can see exactly how he wished it to be regarded.     1. By the Social Work, I mean those operations of The Salvation     Army which have to do with the alleviation, or removal, of the     moral and temporal evils which cause so much of the misery of the     submerged classes, and which so greatly hinder their Salvation.     2. Our Social Operations, as thus defined, are the natural outcome     of Salvationism, or, I might say, of Christianity, as instituted,     described, proclaimed, and exemplified in the life, teaching, and     sacrifice of Jesus Christ.     Here I would like to say that Social Work, in the spirit and     practice which it has assumed with us, has harmonised with my own     personal idea of true religion from the hour I promised obedience     to the commands of God.     To help the poor, to minister to them in their slums, to sympathise     with them in their poverty, afflictions, and irreligion, was the     natural outcome of the life that came to my soul through believing     in Jesus Christ.     Before many days--nay, before many hours--had passed after my     conversion, I was to be found praying in the cottages in the     working-class quarters of the town in which I lived, talking in the     slums, comforting the dying, and doing, so far as I knew how and     had ability, what seemed to me most likely to help the poor and     miserable classes, both for this world and the world to come.     3. But Social Work, as a separate entity, or department of the     Kingdom of Jesus Christ, recognised, organised, and provided for,     had to wait for The Salvation Army.     For many years after the commencement of my public work, during     which time I had, as opportunity served, helped the poor in their     distress, I was deterred from launching out to any great extent in     this direction by the fear so commonly entertained that by     relieving their physical necessities I should be helping to create,     or at any rate to encourage, religious hypocrisy and pretence.     All this time, nevertheless, I felt, and often keenly felt, that     there surely must be some way by which, without any evil     consequences, I could legitimately fulfil the cravings of my own     heart, as well as comply with the commands of my Lord, who had     expressly told me that I was to feed the hungry, clothe the naked,     care for the sick, and visit the prisoners. For a long time,     however, I failed to see how this work could be done in any     organised or extensive manner.     Gradually, however, the way opened, and opened largely, as a result     of our determination to make the godless crowds hear the message of     Salvation.     I said, "They shall hear; we will make them hear; and if they won't     hear in any other way, we will feed them, and accompany the food we     give them with the message to which they so determinedly turn a     deaf ear." In the very earliest days of The Army, therefore, in     order to reach the people whom we could not reach by any other     means, we gave the hungry wretches a meal, and then talked to them     about God and eternity.     4. Then came the gradual unfolding of our Social methods, which     have been so remarkably successful.     My dear wife's heart had been particularly drawn out on behalf of     the fallen outcasts of society, who, often more sinned against than     sinning, appealed peculiarly to her large and tender sympathies.     More than once she found opportunity for extending help to     individual cases of misfortune, obtaining homes amongst her friends     for some of the children, and assisting the poor mothers to win     their way back to virtue.     But it was not until the end of 1883, or thereabouts, that anything     like a systematic effort in this direction was organised on their     behalf. Touched by the helpless and pitiable condition of some poor     girls who had sought Salvation at the Corps at which, with her     husband, she fought as a Soldier, a baker's wife, living in one of     the most wretched streets in Spitalfields, took the girls, in     distress and trouble, into her own home. Before long it was crowded     to its utmost capacity, and still other women were clamouring for     admission. She implored us to help her, and we engaged and opened a     house as our first Rescue Home, placing it under the direction of     Mrs. Bramwell Booth.     The breaking forth of the same spirit in different directions in     other lands quickly followed.     At about this time our first Prison Rescue Brigade, in the Colony     of Victoria, was organised by the late Colonel Barker. So striking     was the success attending his effort that, before many months had     passed by, magistrates in the city of Melbourne were actually     giving delinquents the option of being sent to prison or to our     Prison-Gate Home, and the Government placed the former Detective     Police Building at our disposal, at a nominal rental.     Not only does the genuine Christian spirit carry the soul out in     sympathy with misery, but it often leads it to prefer certain     particular classes of sufferers or wrongdoers, on whom to lavish     its self-sacrificing love, and restlessly spend itself in efforts     for their benefit. In the case of one Salvationist, it will be the     dying; in another the daughters of sin and shame; in another the     homeless; in another the children, and in yet another the     drunkards.     With Colonel Barker, as with other comrades under our Flag to-day,     it was the criminals.     This spirit thrives and becomes more effective by what it feeds     upon. It must, therefore, be wise to favour its preferences, so far     as it is possible to do so without losing sight of the well-being     of the whole.     We did this with Colonel Barker, and we are acting on the same     principle with others to-day.     Then came our first Women's Rescue Home in Melbourne, to help us in     the establishment of which the Colonial Government gave L1,000.     It was upon foundations of this character that our Social     Operations in New Zealand, France, South Africa, and several other     countries were subsequently built up.     For years past our Officers, men and women, both in the United     Kingdom and elsewhere, had carried on what may be spoken of as an     unorganised form of Slum Work; but it fell to the hands of my     glorified daughter, the Consul, to institute, in London, what was     then and for some time afterwards known as "the Cellar, Gutter,     and Garret Brigade"--the forerunner of scores of Slum Posts, which     are now such a recognised feature of our operations all over the     world.     Our first Men's Shelter was opened in Limehouse, London, during the     winter of 1887-8, and was soon followed by the opening of similar     Institutions in other countries, far-off and near at hand.     From our earliest days drunkenness had been one of the many foes of     God and man against which we had specially taken our stand, and     thousands of its slaves had been rescued from its grip, and become     valiant Soldiers in our ranks. Our first Inebriates' Home,     conducted in the interest of women, was not, however, opened until     1887. This was in Toronto, Canada.     The Social Work in the United States had its birth in 1885, in an     effort made on behalf of prisoners at Hartford, Connecticut.     Similar efforts followed in other cities, and Rescue and Industrial     Homes, Shelters, and Farm Colonies followed on in due course.     All these enterprises and many others, to which I have not time now     to refer, were prior to the publication of "In Darkest England and     the Way Out," and had, no doubt, a powerful influence in inspiring     that volume.     Since then one branch or other of Social Work has been commenced in     every country in which our Flag is flying.     Notwithstanding the satisfaction produced by these and kindred     efforts in my own mind, and in the minds of those immediately     associated with me, and although the results were truly remarkable,     and the possibilities seemed to be still more wonderful, the     beginnings of these Social enterprises attracted comparatively     little notice.     The New Movement--for thus I may describe it--which, with half an     eye, thoughtful men might have seen to be pregnant with blessings     for the whole world, was almost unnoticed by either the Authorities     or the Press; while our supplies of men and money for its conduct     and extension were very limited.     Suddenly, however, the scene was changed, and, all at once,     everybody was asking, "What is The Salvation Army?" "Who is General     Booth?" and "What is this Social Scheme?"     This change was largely brought about by the publication of "In     Darkest England and the Way Out," together with the notices of the     Scheme in the Press which it brought about.     Judged by the effect produced, the book was certainly a remarkable     one. In the first place it had a title which, in a striking manner     described its character. Everybody wanted to see it, and, as a     result, it was sold, lent, read, thought about, and talked about in     every direction. Nearly a quarter of a million copies were sold.     The profits from the publication and sale amounted to about     L20,000, of which sum I had the privilege of handing over     L5,380--which might have been considered rightfully to accrue to me     personally as the Author--to the fund devoted to the promotion of     the object for which the book was published.     In its pages I propounded those Schemes which I thought would prove     most successful in alleviating the terrible misery I had described,     and in rescuing some, at least, of the sufferers from the conduct     that produced it.     In order to set the Scheme in motion, I asked the public to give me     L100,000, and a further L30,000 per annum to maintain it.     I can never forget the morning that directly followed the     appearance of the volume. I was, of course, in ignorance of what     the nation would think or say about it.     I had made plans for the book to be delivered to the newspapers at     one and the same time, and, regarding the Press as being to some     extent the voice of the people, I was anxious to hear what that     voice would say.     I was not kept long in suspense. As I ascended the stairs at     Headquarters that morning, a gentleman with a countenance beaming     with kindness and anxiety met me. I do not think he had ever seen     me before, and I was certainly in complete ignorance of him.     "General Booth, I believe?" he said.     "Yes, sir," I answered.     "I have been reading the critique in _The Times_ of your Darkest     England Scheme," he said, "and, believing your plan to be right and     good, I want to be the first to express my sympathy and practical     assistance in carrying it out, and I wish to give you the first     L1,000 towards the sum asked for."     This gentleman proved himself a firm friend of the Scheme, actively     co-operating with us so far as he had opportunity.     A short time afterwards our friend was present at the opening of     our first London Ex-Prisoners' Home. When I had finished speaking     he expressed a wish to say a few words. I invited him forward for     that purpose. He came, hurried and excited, began to speak,     staggered, reeled, fell into my arms and immediately expired. It     may be truly said that he died calling down blessings on the     Darkest England Scheme.     After meeting this gentleman on the stairs, I had scarcely sat down     at my desk, with his cheque in my hand, before a telegram was     handed me, from one of the most influential newspaper proprietors     in the city, expressing a similar hope, and promising a similar     amount for its realisation.     But along with these cheering expressions of approbation there came     the invariable murmuring objections. One of these strove to     minimise the value of the effort, by arguing that it was only an     attempt to extend The Army's religious influence. People said they     would be willing to help if all religious and propagandist motives     were eliminated from the Scheme.     One night a gentleman was announced as wishing to see me. He     declined to give his name, and the only description of him I could     gain was that he was a prominent member of the Stock Exchange.     "I want to ask you one question--only one," he said, upon entering     my office, "about this Social Scheme of yours."     "All right," I replied, "as many as you like."     "Well," he continued, "I want to know whether you are going to give     religion alongside your other benefits to these people whom you     seek to help? I am not a religious man myself. I am not saved, and     never shall be--I am a lost soul; but there is no reason why these     poor wretches should not have religion; and if you will give them     religion, I will help you."     "Yes," I answered, "we will give them religion. While we won't     refuse to help them because they are irreligious--but, on the     contrary, will take in the vilest and the worst--we will give them     all as much religion as we can."     "I will help you," he answered, as he handed me Bank of England     notes for L500.     He came to see us again and again, proving for the time being a     generous friend. Then he disappeared.     In a very short time, and in the readiest and most kindly manner,     L104,000 were subscribed. But, alas! only a very small proportion     of the L30,000 that was asked for annually was forthcoming.     In this, as in many other similar cases, I have found that whilst     the public will be ready--nay, eager--to embrace a new thing, they     soon get tired of it, run after some other novelty, and leave you     largely to struggle for its continuance, as best you can.     5. It is enough here to state that the results at the onset were     remarkable. Amongst others four, which might have been expected,     were immediately realised:--     (a) The first was the bringing into public view the ocean of     tears, misery, and evil which was rolling around us in every     direction.     (b) Another result was that people everywhere were awakened from     their selfish lethargy, to look upon these waters of tribulation,     and were amazed to find the depth, the darkness, and the despair     with which they rolled forward, as well as the damnation to which     they invariably led.     (c) A further effect was that a large number of people were won     over to care for the class whom it was proposed to benefit, and to     believe in the possibility of the Scheme being realised. Many of     these proved permanent friends of our Social Operations.     (d) Yet another effect was that the fountains of compassion broke     out in the hearts of large numbers of individuals, and led them to     make similar efforts. Everywhere the call was sounded to labour for     these poor lost people, and instances were adduced which showed     that their humble toil was productive of very striking results.     But until now nothing, or next to nothing, had been done to stop     this rolling river, or deliver those perishing in its waters,     because everybody had felt helpless in the presence of the enormous     evil.     But here, now, were results of sufficient magnitude to convince     those who became interested in the matter that, by the employment     of the methods set forth in "In Darkest England and the Way Out,"     something permanently effective might be accomplished.     On the other hand, others, as might have been expected, who had     never manifested any particular interest before, either for or     against, now came out openly as our enemies, and a stiff fight     followed, out of which the Social Operations, although in their     infancy, may be said to have emerged victorious.     One of the results of this conflict of opinion was the "Darkest     England" Inquiry.     The preparation of "In Darkest England" will for ever remain     remarkable in my own memory, as it was mostly written and     corrected in the adjoining chamber to that in which my dear wife     was suffering those awful agonies associated with the disease which     finally carried her away.     The spirit which originated and controlled the Social Work had     been, pre-eminently, the spirit of her religion. She certainly was     the most practical exponent of the Christianity of which I have     been speaking that it was ever my lot to meet. It was her religion;     she preached it with natural eloquence and remarkable skill; and,     in life and death, she exemplified it.     From that day to this the history of the Social Work has been one     of steady progress and of surpassing interest, and I have sometimes     wondered whether any movement, based so solidly upon principles of     permanence, and so calculated to bless the classes for whose     benefit it was, by the Providence of God, called into being, has     ever existed within the memory of men.     Now what has come out of this beginning?     1. Here is a list of the various Social enterprises we have in     hand. I do not vouch for its completeness; but, anyway, we have     here a goodly number of schemes for the benefit of the poor and     friendless already in active and useful  operation:--        (a) For the Starving, we have--           i. Children's Free and Farthing Breakfasts.          ii. Midnight Soup and Bread Brigades for the Homeless.         iii. Cheap Food Depots.          iv. Special Relief Funds for cases of Special Destitution.           v. Old Clothes' Depots for Slum Families.          vi. Poor Men's Hotels,         vii. Cheap Grain Stores.        viii. Famine Loan Fund for Destitute Indians.        (b) For the Drunkards, we have--           i. Drunkards' Brigades.          ii.

Labour Wood Yards.          iv. City Salvage Brigades.           v. Workshops.        (e) For the Homeless, we have--           i. Midnight Scouts.          ii. Shelters for Men and Women.         iii. Metropoles.        (f) For the Criminals, we have--           i. Prison Visitation.          ii. Police-court Work.         iii. Prison-Gate Work.          iv. Probationary Police.           v. Correspondence Bureaux.          vi. Ex-Criminals' Homes.         vii. Criminal Settlements        (g) For the Daughters of Shame, we have--           i. Visitation of Streets, Brothels, Yoshiwaras, Clubs, etc.          ii. Midnight Meetings.         iii. Receiving Homes.          iv. Rescue Homes.           v. Factories, Laundries, etc.          vi. "Out of Love" Funds.         vii. Service Girls' Brigades.        viii. Shepherding Brigades.          ix. Maternity Homes.           x. Investigation and Detective Department.        (h) Slum Work. We have--           i. Visitation.          ii. First-Aid Brigades.         iii. District Nursing.          iv. "Poorest of the Poor" Aid.        (i) For the Sick, we have--           i. Visitation.          ii. Hospitals.        iii. Dispensaries.         iv. Village Dispensing,          v. Leper Hospitals,         vi. Maternity Nursing.        (j) For the Lost, we have--          i. Inquiry and Correspondence Bureaux.         ii. Legal Assistance.        (k) Prevention and Protective Work for Young Girls. We        have--          i. Servants' Homes.         ii. City Institutes.        iii. Theatrical Girls' Home.         iv. Registries.          v. Students' Homes.        (l) Anti-Suicide Bureaux. We have--          i. Advice Department.         ii. Loan Department.        (m) The Home League.        (n) Land Schemes. We have--          i. Emigration.         ii. Home Colonisation.        iii. Colonisation over the Sea.         iv. Lands and Farm Colonies.          v. Small Holdings.        (o) Deep Sea Brigades. We have--          i. Mission Boats.         ii. Life-boat.        (p) Training Colleges.        (q) Students' Homes.        (r) Working-Men's Association.        (s) Village Banks.     The total number of our Social Institutions is now 954.     The value of properties, etc., held for the use of our Social     Operations  is:--        At Home (U.K.)           L228,000        In other Countries        747,000        Total                    L975,000     2. In the history of the Social Work, nevertheless, there have     been, as you will know, any number of shortcomings. We have not     realised all our expectations, nor fulfilled all our dreams. It was     not to be expected that we should. This is an imperfect world; the     Movement has been imperfect, and the people who have carried it on     have been imperfect also. Consequently, it is only natural that we     have had imperfect results.     (a) Many things have been calculated to cause these shortcomings.     For example:--     i. There has been a great lack of direct aim at the true goal of     our Social Work on the part of some Officers who have been engaged     in its direction.     Some of our comrades have been content with a "soup-and-blanket"     regime. That is to say, they have too often been satisfied with the     alleviation of the miseries of the hour, and have stopped short of     the removal of the evils that have caused the poverty, vice, and     agony from which the sufferings sprang.     Consequently, the work, being superficial, has in some cases only     had superficial and temporary results.     You get out of a thing as much as you put in--and no more, and     that, not only in quantity, but in quality. If you go in for     root-and-branch efforts, you will get root-and-branch results.     ii. Another cause of our shortcomings has been the lamentable fact     that some of our Officers have been deficient in personal religion.     Our Social Work is essentially a religious business. It can neither     be contemplated, commenced, nor carried on, with any great success,     without a heart full of pity, and love, and endued with the power     of the Holy Ghost.     iii. Another of our difficulties has been the scarcity of suitable     people for carrying the work on. This was also to be expected.     If we had been content with hirelings, and had sought them out from     among the philanthropies and Churches, we should have found plenty     in number, but it is equally certain we should have had     considerably more doleful failures than those we have experienced.     We are not only making but are now training the Social Officers,     and we shall doubtless improve in this respect, whilst the work     they turn out will be bound to improve proportionately.     iv. Then again a further reason for our shortcomings has been our     shortness of money.     This need unfortunately is not passing away, as you will all well     know. But I suppose some of you have come from distant lands with     bags of francs and dollars to present The General with an ample     supply of this requirement. He thanks you beforehand.     (b) Nevertheless, and notwithstanding all our shortcomings, the     position now occupied by our Social Operations, and the influence     exercised by them on the great and small of the earth, is in     evidence in every Continent and on every hand.     There is no doubt that the world, as a whole, feels much of the     admiration and gratitude which the Press lavished upon me on my     recent Birthday--admiration which was assuredly intended not only     for myself, but for The Army as a whole, and not only for The Army     as a whole, but for its Social Workers in particular.     1. And now, in conclusion, let me summarise a few of the advantages     which have flowed out of the Social Work, and which will continue     to flow out of it as long as time rolls on.     (a) The first benefit I will mention is the Salvation of     thousands of souls.     (b) The world has been further benefited by the knowledge of     Salvation spread throughout every part of the habitable globe.     (c) The world has been further benefited by the Conviction that     has been brought to governmental, philanthropic, and religious     agencies, as to the duty they owe to the classes we seek to     benefit.     (d) The world has been further benefited by the sympathy created     in the hearts of royal personages, scientists, literary people, and     the Press generally; indeed, in every class and grade of mankind.     (e) The world has been further benefited by the removal of misery     on such an extensive scale as had never even been dreamed of as     possible.     Think of the multitudes who, by our operations, are daily saved     from starvation, vice, crime, disease, death, and a hundred other     nameless woes.     In some of the principal cities in Italy, Holland, Germany, and     elsewhere, visited during my recent Continental Campaign, I have     been looked upon with unspeakable satisfaction and enthusiasm as     The General of the Poor, and The Salvation Army has been regarded     as their friend.     (f) The world has been further benefited by the help which our     Social Operations have afforded to the Field and other Departments     of The Army all over the world.     (g) The world has been further benefited by the confidence the     Social Work has created in the hearts and minds of our own     people--both Officers and Soldiers--as to the truth and     righteousness of the principles and practices of The Salvation     Army.     (h) The world has been further benefited by the answer which the     Social Work constitutes to the infidel's sneers at Christianity and     the assertion of its effeteness.     Truly, our future chroniclers will have to record the fact that our     Social Operations added a celestial lustre and imparted a Divine     dignity to the struggles of the early years of The Salvation Army's     history.To our own eyes in The Army, however, that which has been done inconnexion with the Institutions is only a very insignificant part of thewhole effect produced. Until the present movement all over the world infavour of the betterment of the social condition of the masses of thepeople has had time to accomplish definite results, our Institutions mayyet have a good work to do.But the great work The General did in this connexion was the restorationto men's minds of the Saviour's own view, that we owed to every manevery care that a truly brotherly heart must needs bestow. Thatprinciple, as The General pointed out, had always been acted upon, asbest it could be, from the beginning, and is daily acted upon to-day,wherever The Army exists.Chapter XXIMotoring TriumphsDuring one of his Motor Tours The General remarked:--     "It was here (Banbury) that the idea of a Motor Campaign was     conceived. Seven or eight years ago (1900) I held an afternoon     Meeting in this place. On that occasion a crowd of my own people     and friends came to the station to give me a send-off. Such was the     affection shown, and so manifest was the pleasure derived from my     visit, that I said to myself:--     "'Why should I not impart this satisfaction to those comrades and     friends throughout the country who have never had the satisfaction     of seeing my face, or hearing my voice?'     "And then the idea occurred to my mind that the automobile would     not only be the readiest means of transit, but the only plan by     which I could reach the small towns and outlying hamlets. Moreover,     it would perhaps prove the only method by which we could get     through the crowds who would be likely to assemble on such a     Campaign."By most men, in their prime, it would be thought an ample filling up ofany week to address three large Meetings on the Sunday, and one eachweek night; but The General, at seventy-four, saw that, travelling bymotor, and visiting in the daytime such smaller towns and villages ashad never seen him before, or not for many years, he could not onlyreckon upon three large indoor Meetings every day, but speak, perhaps,to millions of people he had never before addressed. And so in six MotorTours he passed from end to end and from side to side of Great Britain,gathering crowds from day to day for six weeks at a time.We have met with people frivolous enough to write of all that as if TheGeneral's Motor Tours were luxuries! In one glorious sense they werereally so, for, to him, there could never be a greater luxury than toproclaim the Gospel to a crowd. But, as a matter of fact, he found itless expensive to travel in this way than to go as he ordinarily did fora long journey to and from London by train to reach each townseparately.And the economy of Army forces, by means of Motor Tours, has beenmarvellous, every little Corps and village Outpost on the route onweek-days being given an opportunity to gather crowds they neverordinarily reached together, and to unite their own efforts for oncewith those of their General in trying to lift up Christ more than everbefore.And The General was so alive to the value of inflaming the love of anyhandful of villagers or children, but especially of his Soldiers andOfficers to the Master, that it was to him a continual delight to moveabout amongst his Soldiery in every land.The General could rarely venture to plan very far ahead, because hispublic appearances had all to be made to fit in with other and ofteneven more important engagements, of which only his Staff knew anything.It is, indeed, marvellous how few engagements he made ever had to bebroken, and how successful almost every Campaign of his has been, seeingat how short notice most of them were undertaken. In one of his diariesI found a bitter complaint of the waste of time involved in having towait for three hours between the steamboat and train. "Why," he asks,"could they not have arranged a Meeting for me?"One who has travelled 8,000 miles with him on four Motor Tours says,though everybody, everywhere, pressmen included, were of necessityimpressed with his sincerity and transparency, they could see that hehad all the time only one object in view, the glory of God and theSalvation of souls.And it is the extent to which he led all ranks into the same spiritwhich made it easy for arrangements to be made and carried out in so fewhours for the very largest demonstrations, as to which it was neverpossible to hold any approach to a rehearsal, those joining in themliving usually so widely apart from each other.An occasional private letter gives, perhaps, the best possibleexplanation of his own heart in this perpetual motion towards the Cross.Who that saw him in some grand demonstration could imagine that he hadbeen feeling just before it as this letter reveals:--     "My feelings alternate; but my faith is steadfast. Morning, noon,     and night I tell God He is my only help. He will not fail me.     To-night's Meeting will be, as you say, a great strain; but the     memories of God's goodness encourage me to go forward in spite of     unutterable sadness and gloom."And who that heard him on one of those Congresses, in which a greatcompany of his Officers and Soldiers felt themselves to be feasting onheavenly manna for days together, could imagine his writing the weekafter:--     "If ever I felt my full agreement with my Lord's definition of     service as expressed in the parable, I do to-day. After all, I am a     poor, unprofitable servant, and I have lost no little sleep since     Friday night in criticising regretfully and condemning my share of     the wonderful Congress that has certainly taken a large part of the     world by storm. Nevertheless, I thank God from the bottom of my     heart for the part I have been allowed to have in the matter."Amongst the incidents of all touring, but especially of motoring, arestorms such as the one The General thus triumphed over:--     "We are still rushing on. I had five Meetings yesterday, Friday,     and an hour's ride through the most blinding storm I ever     encountered. Two of our cars broke down, gave up, and retreated to     the nearest town for the night; another got through in a damaged     condition, and three with difficulty arrived at our destination.     However, we who did get in, were rewarded with a big audience and a     big reception. It was very wonderful. I am now reckoning on the     closing Meeting which takes place on Wednesday afternoon.     "Everybody continues to bless me and speak well of me. Is it not a     little surprising, and, viewed from the Master's Standpoint, a     little dangerous? You must keep on praying that my faith fail not.     Abundance of trying things await me. I must wait for my rest     'until the Morning.' God bless you!"Well may a man sometimes long for rest who has experiences like thefollowing:--     "I nearly killed myself on Saturday and Sunday at Birmingham. For     some cause or other both throat and head got wrong, and it was with     difficulty I could frame my sentences or pronounce my words, and     yet I had to meet the great opportunity that was presented. I am     paying the price to-day in weariness extreme. There is hardly a     bone in my body that does not ache, or a nerve that does not seem     overstrung.     "But I shall rally and be myself again; indeed, I must, for things     of vast importance have to be attended to before the day is out.     Our exchequer is empty, and I have to prepare for my autumn     Campaign in Holland, Germany, Italy, etc."     "A mile or two after Penzance, the chauffeur turned to General     Booth, and 'Now she's waking up!' he said, with a satisfied sigh,     as the great car began to hurry through the open lanes.     "The General nodded his head meditatively. 'Yes,' he said, in his     beard, 'people have to wake up before they begin to move. England     wants waking up; I'm trying to wake her up myself, just a little,     and then we shall move.'     "I asked him what he made of our national apathy.     "He shook his head. 'I don't know how it is," he said, 'but people     are somehow afraid to examine themselves, afraid to see facts as     facts. There is a spirit in England which is worse than opposition     to religion; it's a spirit of--of--of detachment, of separation, a     spirit which says, "I don't want you, I can do without you; and so     long as you leave me alone I shan't interfere with you." It's a     kind of slackness. They want waking up. They want rousing. They     want a good shaking. It seems as if they have fallen into a deep     slumber--opium-eaters!'     "He is setting out to rouse England once again, make one great     final effort for the future of humanity. The future of humanity, he     believes, can only be secured by 'conversion.'     "Look at him in his car! There he sits, with a light-coloured     overcoat buttoned round his neck, a grey forage cap pressed over     his ears, his hands in his pockets, his eyes looking straight     ahead, and his lips biting at his beard--an old, old man in the     newest of motor-cars.     "Through lanes where Wesley rode his horse, poring over a book as     he went, General Booth flies in his beflagged car--on the same     errand. These two men, so dissimilar in nature, so opposed in     temperament, and separated by nearly two hundred years, the one on     horseback, the other in a motor-car, sought and are seeking the     same elusive end--the betterment of humanity.     "One feels as one rides along our country roads with General Booth     the enormous force of simple Christianity in this work of     evolution. One sees why Wesley succeeded, and why The Salvation     Army is succeeding.     "'We make too much of sin,' says evolution. 'We don't make half     enough of sin!' cries The General. Politicians and men of science     seem like scene-shifters in the drama of life, and religion stands     out clear and distinct as the only actor.     "'People have taken to The Salvation Army because it's so kind to     poor people,' General Booth tells me; 'they know I love the poor,     they know I weep bitterly for all the hunger and nakedness and     sorrow in the world. People know I'm sincere. That's it! They know     The Salvation Army is sincere, that it's doing kind actions, and     helping those whom nobody else will help or can help. That's what     makes us popular. Sympathy.'     "But the secret of The General is not humaneness. His secret is the     reality with which he invests sin. Hear him talk about sin, and you     realise the man's spell.     "At one moment he is full of humour and robust talk, a genial,     merry, shrewd-eyed old gentleman; at the next--at the mention of     real sin--his brows contract, his eyes flash, and his tongue hisses     out such hatred and contempt and detestation as no sybarite could     find on the tip of his tongue for anything superlatively coarse or     ill-flavoured.     "'Sin!' he cries to me. 'Sin is a real thing--a damnable thing! I     don't care what science calls it, or what some of the pulpits are     calling it. I know what it is. Sin is devilish. It is sin and only     sin which is stopping progress. It is sin and only sin which     prevents the world from being happy. Sin! Go into the slums of the     great cities--pick up little girls of six years of age sold into     infamy by their parents; look at the drunken mother murdering her     child, the father strapping his cripple son--sin!--that's what I     call sin; something beastly and filthy and devilish and     nasty--nasty, dreadfully nasty.'     "As you listen and as you realise that The Salvation Army contains     numberless men changed in the twinkling of an eye from lives of     such sin as this to lives of beneficent activity, you begin to feel     that General Booth, right or wrong, has at least hit upon one of     the most effective ways for helping evolution.     "He makes sin as real to the individual as only the mystics can     imagine for themselves. Perhaps humanity likes to be told how black     it is, how far it is from the perfectness after which Nature is     blundering and staggering. I know not; but it is manifest that when     this grim old man, with the ivory face, the black, flashing eyes,     the tangle of white hair and the tangle of beard, leans over the     rostrum and calls sin 'beastly' and 'devilish' and 'nasty' the     people sit as white and spellbound as the patient of the hypnotist.     "It is a different General Booth whom the villagers flock to see as     he drives, smiling and genial, through Cornish villages, whom the     band plays into towns, and whom mayors and councillors receive with     honour. But the reason of this honour and this popularity is the     fact that he is a force, a living, breathing power who has made sin     real to the world and has awakened the religious consciousness in     thousands of human beings."William Booth was always very wide awake to the discouraging emptinessof mere demonstrations, and never expressed himself more contemptuouslywith regard to them than when he thought that any of his Officers, inthe midst of some grand display, which was attracting unusual attention,seemed to be likely to be satisfied with the show of what had been done,instead of pressing forward to greater things.Yet he saw that, in presence of the continual and enthrallingexhibitions of the world, there was absolute need for suchmanifestations of united force as might encourage every little handful,usually toiling out of sight, and convince the world that we weredetermined fully to overcome all its attractions.There had been before his time large demonstrations in favourof teetotalism, and in some parts of the country the SundaySchools were accustomed annually to make displays of more or lessfashionably-dressed children and teachers. But The General was alone inhis own country and time in organising any such public demonstrations inhonour of Christ, and of total abstinence from sin and fromworldly-mindedness.How perfectly The General could always distinguish between the enjoymentof demonstration and of real fighting, was strikingly manifested on oneof our great Crystal Palace days. Looking down from the balcony upon thevast display, when some 50,000 Salvationists were taking part in variouscelebrations, he noticed a comparatively small ring of our convertedmilitary and naval men kneeling together on the grass, evidently withinhearing of one of the band-stands upon which one Band after another wasplaying, according to programme."Go and stop that Band," said he to one of his A.D.C.'s. "We must nothave those praying men hindered in their fight for souls by the music."And this was only one example of his frequent abandonment of anyprogramme, or practice, or arrangement which seemed to him only to havedemonstrative effect, when any more enduring benefit could be otherwisesecured.In short, demonstration in his eyes was only valued at its militaryworth, and he never wished any one to become so occupied with appearanceas to miss enduring victory.The following description, by a writer in a big London daily, of one ofThe General's tours might be fairly accepted as a sample of them all,and as giving some idea of the way in which they manifested his care forall that concerned men:--     "'An easy day' was The General's description of that on which we     fared to mediaeval Godalming, through the beautiful Hindhead region     to Petersfield, and thence in the evening to antiquity and     Winchester. He meant that he had only to address three great     gatherings (the day's course admitted of scarcely any of the     customary wayside and hamlet musters), so his oratory would be     merely a matter of five hours or thereabouts. There were solid fact     in The General's airy designation; it _was_ an easier day than most     of those of the tour; but it had sundry distinctions of its own,     apart from the great, welcoming Meetings.     "It was curious and pleasant to see gipsies salute The General from     their wayside Bohemia on the road to Hindhead; it was delightful to     see The General himself as he descended and spoke to the church     school-children who hailed him by the wayside at Roke, in one of     the most charming wayside spots on the journey. They stood with     their teachers under the trees in the sunshine, little pictures of     bloom and happiness. 'Now wouldn't you like to be running round the     country on a motor?' he asked them straight away, and their answer     come with hearty directness. In a naive and tender little speech,     that had a touch of airiness, he told them of the joy of motoring,     turning anon to the many glad and beautiful things within the reach     of little people who yet might not go a-motoring, and so in simple     little touches appealing to the joy of life and soul that the     child-sense could understand.     "'Isn't he like Father Christmas?' a little girl was heard to     whisper. Here he charmed those in the morning of life; away at     Petersfield in the afternoon the sight of him consoled some in     life's evening. One poor old lady, who had lost the use of both     limbs, was carried to her door and set in a bath-chair, and there     she remained till The General had passed. We noticed the light on     her face, and how vehemently she waved her handkerchief. An Army     Officer chatted with her before we left the town in the evening. 'I     can now die happy,' she said; 'I have seen The General. And when     the call comes I know that God will send down the hallelujah motor     for me, and the loss of my old limbs won't matter in the least.'     "I have mentioned 'an easy day.' Having now described in a broad     way the typical early stages, it may be well, in a somewhat more     intimate and personal way, to give an idea of the work, moods, and     trend of the average day of the whole tour. The stress and     excitement it meant in the long stretch of country from the first     town to the last were extraordinary. We mustered, as a rule, at     nine in the morning for the day's work and travel, most of the folk     of the town where the night had been spent turning out for the     send-off.     "The General was on the scene almost invariably to the minute.     Nearly always at those starts he looked grave, resigned, and calm,     but unexpectedly careworn. It was as if he had wrestled with all     his problems, with a hundred world-issues in the watches of the     night, and was still in the throes of them, and unable for the     moment to concentrate his attention on the immediate town and crowd     that hurrah'd around him. But, of course, he stood up and     acknowledged the plaudits--though often as one in a dream. But the     picturesqueness of his appearance in the morning sunshine--with his     white hair, grave face, and green motor garb--took the imagination     of the mass, and without a word from him the people were left     happy.     "He looked a new personality at the first important stopping-place,     reached usually about an hour before noon. His air and mood when he     stepped to the platform for the public Meeting had undergone a     radiant change; all the more radiant, we noticed, if the children     who had hailed him from the waysides had been many and strenuous.     There was something of the child in his own face as he stepped to     the platform's edge, and replied to the enthusiasm of the house by     clapping his own hands to the people. There was always something     naive and delightful in The General's preliminary task of     applauding the audience.     "Here came his first important address of the day, lasting an hour     and a half, or even longer. It had many 'notes,' and displayed The     General in many moods. He was apt to be facetious and drily     humorous at first. He had racy stories to tell--and none can tell a     story for the hundredth time with fresh zest than he--in     illustration of the old and bitter prejudices against The Army. A     typical one was that of an old woman, arrested for the hundredth     time for being drunk and disorderly, who was given the option of     going to prison or being passed over to The Salvation Army. Too     drunk to realise what she did, she decided for the latter. She was     kindly tended, set in a clean cosy bed, and watched over by a     sister till the morning. When she woke the sunlight streamed     through the window, and the happy, unaccustomed surroundings     surprised her. 'Where am I?' she exclaimed in bewilderment. 'You     are with The Salvation Army,' said the sister kindly and softly.     'Oh, goodness gracious,' roared the old woman, 'take me away, or     I'll lose my reputation!'     "Often in these long and comprehensive addresses The General told     how he found the work of his life. He was never so impressive as at     this stage. And the tale in its intensity was ever new. His     language was nervous, intense, almost Biblical, his figure     suggestive of a patriarch's in a tragedy. 'Sixty years ago--sixty     years ago--sixty years ago,' each time with a different and a     grimmer intonation--'the Spirit of the Living God met me.... I was     going down the steep incline when the great God stopped me, and     made me think.'     "In the last stage of his address he was the coloniser, the     statesman, the social wizard who would recast character and     rearrange humanity. He gave an epic sense to the story of     emigration and colonisation. But he was invariably clear and lucid     in his detail, so that the immediate and practical meaning of it     all was never lost on the mayors, and corporation and council     worthies, who heard him. Then miles and miles away at the second     important stopping-place in the early afternoon, after incidental     wayside speeches and idylls, he went over the same ground in a     further address of an hour or more. Somehow in the afternoon he     appeared to speak with added individuality and passion, as if the     wants and woes of the world had been growing upon him since the     morning.     "A needed rest, perhaps a little sleep, then away once more by the     waysides and through the welcoming hamlets. The third and last     great stopping-stage was reached, as a rule, about eight o'clock.     He typified serene old age as he stood up in the white car, passing     the long lines of cheering humanity. Here in the evening light it     was not easy to regard him as a propagandist. He might be a study     for Father Christmas, or a philosopher who dealt much in     abstractions and knew little of men. The General who, twenty     minutes later, proclaimed his spiritual truths and his social     ideals to a new audience, seemed, once more, an absolutely     different personality. Often at these evening meetings he spoke for     the better part of two hours."Chapter XXIIOur Financial SystemThe continued strain to raise the money needed for the work was,undoubtedly, to William Booth the greatest part of his burden all theway through life. And it is to this day the puzzle which makes it mostdifficult to write as to The Army's finances. On the one hand, we haveto praise God for having helped him so cheerily to shoulder his crossthat he did not seem many times to feel the burden that was almostcrushing him to the ground, and hindering all sorts of projects he wouldgladly have carried out. Yet, on the other hand, we must guard againstsaying anything that could lead to the impression that The Army has nowgot to the top of its hill of difficulty, and needs no more of the help,in small sums as well as in big ones, that has been so generously sentto it.It would be hopeless to attempt to estimate the numbers of appeals TheGeneral sent out in any one year, for he not only tried at fixed periodsto get for his various funds truly interested subscribers, but wasalways seeking to link the hearty giver with the deserving receivers.But perhaps the very extremity of his one need helped him with the mostpractical wisdom to avoid all unnecessary expenditure, and to cultivateall those habits of economy and systematic effort which alone made itpossible to keep up so vast a work mainly by the gifts of the poor. Tothis very day it is the same old struggle to get each L5 that is wantedtogether. Yet all of it is precious to us because it so guaranteesexemption from indifference, and the pervasion of all our rankseverywhere with the principles of self-help which The General always soinculcated as to make The Army everywhere independent of the wealthy,yet their trusted and skilful almoners.Rejoicing as we do in all that, we cannot too strongly guard every oneagainst the impression that The Army has become, either at its centre,or anywhere else, so situated that there is not at any given momentextraordinary strain in some financial direction. It has come to be verygenerally known that the individual Officer can only keep in existencebecause he has schooled his desires to be content with what others allaround would regard as "an impossible pittance."We hear one day of a great city where the conditions of life are suchthat a Rescue Home is evidently urgently needed, and the lady who callsour attention to the matter offers at once to find L500 towards thefitting-up of such a Home. But we know that to keep it up requires giftsamounting to some thousands of pounds each year, which, if notsubscribed locally, we shall have to provide from Headquarters.Now what is to be done? Are we to stand still with what seems to us sovaluable an offer, not only of money-helps but of opportunity to help?Under the circumstances we know what The General would have done. Hewould without a moment's hesitation have said: "This ought to be done,and must be done"; and, trusting in God, he would have made the otherstep forward, though perfectly conscious that it would probably involvehim in new cares and anxieties."Four shillings and tenpence. Now, really, can't we manage that twopenceto make five shillings?"Such an appeal, heard at a street-corner, where one of our Open-AirMeetings is being closed, is, I fear, the first and last that manypeople hear of The Salvation Army. They have not been present at theMeeting. All the beautiful speaking and singing of happy men and women,anxious to do anything they can for the good of others--of this thepassers-by know nothing. Many of them "would not be seen standing tolisten" amidst the crowd, still less when, for want of any considerablecrowd, they would be more conspicuous. Hence they have no chance to seeor know what really takes place. Had they even seen the whole processof getting that four shillings and tenpence they would have noted thatmost of the money really came from the Salvationists forming the ring,who threw their pence, or sixpences, gradually, in the hope of incitingothers to do likewise.As it is, I fear, many go their way "disgusted at the whole thing,"because of the little scrap of it they have overheard.But, pray, what is the essential difference between the call for"twopence to make up a shilling," and the colossal call made in the nameof some royal personage for "an additional ten thousand pounds" to makeup the L25,000 needed for a new hospital wing? Surely, a hospital, whosevalue and services commend it to the entire population should need nosuch spurs as subscription lists published in all the papers, or eventhe memory of a world benefactor to help it to get the needed funds. Butit does, and its energetic promoters, be they royal or not, deserve andget universal praise for "stooping"--if it be stooping--to any device ofthis kind needed to get the cash. Do they get it? is the only questionany sensible person asks.And nobody questions that our "stooping" Officers and "begging Sisters"get the twopences and shillings and pounds needed to keep The Armygoing, in spite of all its critics--whether of the blatantstreet-corner, or of the kid-gloved slanderer type.If we reflect upon the subject we shall see how sound and valuable arethe principles on which all our twopenny appeals are based.From the very beginning The General always set up the standard of localself-support as one of the essentials of any real work. Whilst labouringalmost exclusively amongst the poorest of the poor, he wrote, in 1870:--[Illustration: Emma Booth-TuckerBorn January 8th. 1860. Died October 28th. 1903.]     "The entire cost of carrying on the Mission at present is about L50     per week. The offerings of the people themselves at the various     stations are now about L17 per week; indeed, nearly every Station     is paying its own working expenses. Thus the poor people themselves     do something. This they ought to do. It would be wrong to deprive     them of the privilege of giving their mite, and if they prize     the instrumentalities that have been blessed to them, and are     rightly instructed, they will cheerfully give, however small their     contribution may be."It has only been by clinging to this plan that the little Society, begunin the East of London, has been able to spread itself throughout theworld and yet remain independent, everywhere, of local magnates. And TheGeneral had the sorry satisfaction of seeing the structure tested by themost cruel winds of slander and suspicion, with the result that thetotal of contributions to its funds during the last years has beengreater than ever before. Part, indeed, of our greatest difficulty withregard to money now is the large total yearly at our disposal, when allthe totals in every country and locality are added together. Any one canunderstand that this must be so, and that it could not help us topublish the amount all together. If in a hundred places only a thousandpounds were raised, anybody can see that to cry aloud about the hundredthousand in any one of those places could not but make everybody in thatplace less capable of strenuous struggle such as is needed to gettogether each thousand.Therefore, whilst publishing every year the properly auditedbalance-sheet referring to amounts received and spent in London, andsimilar balance-sheets, similarly audited, in each other capital, wehave always refrained, and always shall refrain, from any such massingof totals, or glorying in any of them, as could help our enemies tocheck the flow of liberality anywhere.When, in 1895, there seemed to be a general cry for some specialinvestigation into the use made of the Fund raised as a result of TheGeneral's "Darkest England" Appeal, we were able to get a Commission ofsome of the most eminent men in the country, whose Report effectivelydisposed of any doubts at the time.The Commission had for Chairman Earl Onslow, and its members were theRight Hon. Sir Henry James (afterwards Lord James), Messrs. SydneyBuxton, Walter Long, and Mr. Edwin Waterhouse, President of theInstitute of Chartered Accountants, the Right Hon. Hobhouse, M.P.,acted as Secretary.The Report of no Commission could, however, still any hostile tongue.The cry for "investigation" has always been simply the cry of enmity orenvy, which no amount of investigation could ever satisfy. The Generalperfectly understood this at the time, and wrote to a friend of thediscerning order:--     "How I feel generally with respect to the future is expressed in     one word, or rather two, 'Go forward.' The Red Sea has to be     crossed and the people rescued from Hell here and Hell hereafter.     We must stick to our post.     "I am quite aware that I may now, probably shall be, more     misunderstood than ever. But God and time will fight for me. I must     wait, and my comrades must wait with me.     "I need not say that the subject has had, and still has, our     fullest consideration; but I cannot say more until I see clearly     what position the country will take up towards me during the next     few days."Need I say that this Report never checked for one day the ferocity ofthe attacks upon the General or his Army. Had public opinion beendeluded by the babblings of our critics in any country we should notonly have lost all support, but been consigned to jails as swindlers androbbers. But the fact that we get ever-increasing sums, and are evermore and more aided by grants from Governments and Corporations, or bypermissions for street-collecting, is the clearest demonstration that weare notoriously upright in all our dealings.So many insinuations have been persistently thrown out, year after year,with regard to the integrity of The General's dealings with finance,that I have taken care not merely to consult with comrades, but to giveopportunity to some who were said to "have left in disgust" with regardto these matters, to correct my own impression if they could.Having been so little at Headquarters myself since I left for Germany,in 1890, I knew that my own personal knowledge might be disputed, andmy accuracy questioned; therefore, I have been extra careful toascertain, beyond all possibility of dispute, the correctness of theview I now give.One who for many years had the direction of financial affairs at theInternational Headquarters, and who retired through failing healthrather than become a burden upon the Army's ever-strained exchequer,wrote me on November 28, 1910:--     "The General has always taken the keenest interest in all questions     bearing upon The Army's financial affairs, and has ever been alive     to the necessity for their being so administered as to ensure the     contributing public's having the utmost possible value for the     money contributed, at the same time rendering a careful account     from year to year of his stewardship.     "Carefully prepared budgets of income and expenditure are submitted     to him year by year in connexion with all the central funds,     reports are called for from time to time as to the extent to which     such estimates have been realised.     "He was always keen and far-sighted in his consideration of the     proposals put before him, and quick to find a flaw or weakness, or     to point out any responsibilities which had not been sufficiently     taken into account.     "Until recent years, when his world-wide journeyings made it     necessary to pass the responsibility on to the Chief of the Staff,     he largely initiated his own schemes for raising money, and wrote     his own principal appeals.     "Those who refer to The General as 'a puppet in the hands of     others,' or as anything but an unselfish, disinterested servant of     humanity, only show their ignorance of their subject."One of the schemes by which our finances have been greatly helpedeverywhere, and which is now imitated by many Churches and Societies allover the world--the Self-Denial Week, established in 1886--was TheGeneral's own invention. It was at a time when, as he writes:--     "In some Corps half, and in some more than half, of our Soldiers     have been for months without any income at all, or at most with     just a shilling or two. In addition, many of our regular     contributors, as owners of land or of manufacturing houses, have     suffered from the depression, and have not been able to assist us     further.     "The rapid extension of The Army has necessitated an increased     expenditure. Our friends will see that our position is really a     serious one.     "What is to be done? Reduction, which means retreat, is impossible.     To stand still is equally so.     "We propose that a week be set apart in which every Soldier and     friend should deny himself of some article of food or clothing, or     some indulgence which can be done without, and that the price     gained by this self-denial shall be sent to help us in this     emergency.     "Deny yourself of something which brings you pleasure or     gratification, and so not only have the blessing of helping us, but     the profit which this self-denial will bring to your own soul."This effort, which in the year of its inauguration only produced 4,280,has in twenty-six years grown till it totalled in Great Britain in 1911,L67,161, and has so taken hold of the people's minds and heartseverywhere as to produce even in poor little Belgium last year 7,500 f.Perhaps it need hardly be explained that the system of special effortand special begging near the entrance to railway stations, and in allthe most prominent places of the cities, which has grown out of thisweek, with the approval of Governments and Press everywhere, has donemore than any one could have dreamt of to increase interest in the needsof others, and holiness and self-denial in attending to them.And it is, after all, upon that development of practical love foreverybody that The Army's finance depends.Merely to have interested so many rich people in The Army might havebeen a great credit to The General's influence, but to have raised upeverywhere forces of voluntary mendicants who, at any rate, for weeks ata time are not ashamed to be seen begging in the streets for the good ofpeople they have never seen, is an achievement simply boundless in itsbeneficent value to all mankind, and limitless in the guarantee itprovides for the permanent maintenance and extension of our work.Do let me beg you to realise a little of the intense interest taken inour finances locally by all our Soldiers. Did you ever get to know oneof our Corps Treasurers? If not, believe me, that your education isincomplete. Whether he or she be schoolmistress in the mining village ofUndergroundby, shopkeeper in Birmingham, or cashier of a London orParisian bank, you will find an experienced Salvation Army Treasurergenerally one of the most fully-developed intelligences living. He orshe could easily surpass Judas Iscariot himself, either for ability atbargaining, or for what we call "Salvation cheek." He considers the Dukewho owns most of his county, or the Mayor of the city, is "duty bound"to help The Army whenever its Officer thinks a fitting moment has cometo him to ask them to do so--and the Treasurer never thinks that theyalready have helped us enough.Every farthing his Corps has received or paid, for years past, haspassed through his careful fingers. In any city Corps I would accept hisjudgment about a "doubtful" coin before that of almost any one. And nohuman being could surpass him in eagerness or care to get the veryuttermost possible value for every penny spent. Hours after greatMeetings are over you may find him with other officers busy stillparcelling coppers, or in some other way "serving tables." His ownbusiness or family would very often suffer for his late hours of toil inthe cause, if God allowed that sort of thing. But God has seen to itthat many such a Treasurer has climbed out of the very gutter into awell-to-do employer's position, _because_ he sought first His Kingdomand His righteousness.These Treasurers, if anybody took the trouble to interview them, wouldmake it impossible for any decent person to believe the lies that havebeen told about our "not publishing accounts," our "extravagance," etc.They know how carefully even the smallest Corps book or collecting-cardis examined, and with what precise and skilful method every account iskept.Like almost all our Local Officers, they are particularly cheery,friendly men and women. I fear we have but few women Treasurers, asfinance, like so many other things, is supposed to be "beyond women'spowers," and the sisters really do not, as a rule, like arithmetic. Butman or woman, you have only to watch one of them a few moments, whenanybody is trying to arrange a joint excursion with various Corps, tosee that, with all their kindliness, the interests committed to theircharge always command their first sympathy. Treasurer Pitman, ofLeatherby, "never could see," and never will, why either Birmingham I orLeamington, or any other Corps, should be more favoured, or moreburdened, than his own. Even should his words at times seem rough, orfew, he will charm you, almost without exception, if you get out of hiswife or the Captain, or somebody, all he does and suffers for Christ'ssake. Nobody will ever know how often it was the Treasurer who gave halfthe "twopence to make up a shilling" in the street-corner collectionthat, perhaps, made the impression that The Army was "notself-supporting!"But, in spite of all his jollity, the Treasurer is often a sorely-triedand burdened man. For, Oh, it is a struggle to get the pence together,week after week, especially where the Corps has a "Hall of its own," forground rent and interest on which it must pay L5 to L10 a week!The Treasurer's great opportunity comes when he has the joy ofharbouring in his own home, for a night or two, the Chief of the Staff,or some other "Special from London." Then he may get a chance to "put aword in" for his Corps.Does the Chief ask him, "Why do we not get on better in this town?""Well, Chief," he will reply, "just look at our Hall. It fairlystinks--always has done, owing to that canal at the back. That hasalmost made it impossible for us to get a large congregation, especiallyin warm weather.""But why don't you get a better place?""Well, there is nothing in the town large enough to let, and as forbuilding--any site that would be of use would cost a pile of money, andwe have no hope of raising any large sum here.""Why? Have you no rich friends?""There are a few very rich men here. I was seeing one of them myselfonly last month when we wanted to get some new instruments for our Band.But what do you think he said to me?"'Why,' said he, 'I have more than enough to do to keep up my ownchurch. We have got to rebuild it, and it will cost us L30,000.'""There is not a mill-owner in the place who does not want to getSalvationist workpeople, even to the boys of our Soldiers, because theyknow they can depend on them. But to help us to get a Hall! Ah! 'that isnot in their line.'"Therefore, the Treasurer and every Officer must go on week after week,with the miserable beg, beg, beg, which afflicts them, perhaps, evenmore than the most critical listener. And then our great work mustsuffer both for want of the needed plant to carry it on, and from theappearance of too much begging, which, in so many instances, hasundoubtedly hindered our gathering in the very people we most wished tohelp.What stories of self-denial, not one week in the year more than another,any such Treasurer could tell! How Officers managed to rear a healthyand promising family upon less than a pound a week: how The General'sown granddaughters "made six shillings a week do" for their personalsupport, for months, because their Corps could not afford more: how theSergeant-Major's wife did her washing during the night "beforeSelf-Denial Week came on," so as to be able to stand all day longoutside the station, in the cold, collecting: how widow Weak "keeps upher cartridges"; that is to say, goes on giving the Corps a regularsubscription of sixpence a week since her husband's death, as before,"lest the Corps should go down."Lately they took me to see a German widow, now suffering in a hospital,who when her whole weekly cash earnings outside only totalled twoshillings a week, invariably "put in her cartridge" two pfennigs, say afarthing. No. I gave her nothing, nor did anybody else in my presence,as her needs are now attended to; and I am sure she would rather keep upthe fact of never having received anything from, but always having givento, The Army.Of course we do not pretend that all Treasurers and Soldiers are of themodel sort. If they were, many of our bitterest financial struggleswould never occur. If everybody who "kept back part" of what they oughtto give to God were struck dead for singing such words as--    Were the whole realm of nature mine,      That were a present far too small.God would need many a regiment of corpse carriers, I fear.The General, seventeen years ago, wrote to a wealthy lady who had beenexcusing somebody's want of liberality to us by some of the slandersthey had heard.     "Tell your friends in Gull-town the same that I am telling the     public: that nine out of every ten statements in the Press that     reflect upon us are either out-and-out _falsehoods_ or     '_half-lies_,' which are worse still; and that, though not     infallible, when in one case out of ten we do make mistakes, there     are circumstances which, if known, would excuse them very largely.     "I am having wonderful Meetings--immense crowds, soul-awakening     influences all day--Penitent-Forms; back-sliders, sinners and     half-and-half saints coming back to God. Never saw anything,     anywhere, in any part of my life, much more blessed.     "Read my letter in _The War Cry_ about the Two Days--every word as     from my heart.     "Money or no money, we must and will have Salvation. If the rich     won't help Lazarus through us, then their money must perish. We     must do the best we can.     "Join the Light Brigade, and give a halfpenny per week! We shall     get through. Is your soul prospering? Cast yourself this morning on     your Lord for a supply of _all your need_."This "Light Brigade" is another invention of the General's, partlyfounded upon the Indian habit of taking a handful out of every newsupply of food, and laying it aside for the priests.The "Light Brigade" consists of Soldiers and friends who place on theirtable a little box, into which all who like can drop a little coin byway of thanksgiving to God and care for the poor before they eat. Theseare called "Grace-before-Meat" Boxes, and in England alone they producedlast year L8,284. 17_s._ 2_d._ for the support of our Social Work.Altogether I venture to say it will be found that for every shilling heever got anywhere he prompted the giving of at least a thousandshillings to other benevolent enterprises, and that mankind is indebtedto him for the stirring up to benevolent action of countless millionswho never even heard his name.At the same time it will be found that by his financial plans he hasmade The Army so largely dependent upon public opinion that, were itsbeneficent work to cease, its means of survival would at the same timebecome extinct, so that it could not continue to exist when it hadceased to be a Salvation Army.Chapter XXIIIIn Germany in Old AgeThough we have had occasion to mention Germany repeatedly, there hasbeen no opportunity to call attention to the great importance which TheGeneral attached to our Work in that country. It seemed almost as thoughwe had been premature in our attack upon the country, so little wereeither Governments or people prepared for our violent urgency, when webegan in Stuttgart, in 1886. But The General lived to see his annualvisits to Berlin looked forward to by the Press and public as a naturalprovision for the spiritual wants of those who had practically ceased tobe of any religion.In the following description of him, taken from German papers during oneof his last visits to that country, we get not only some idea of hisappearance to the people when he was eighty-one years of age, but hissense of the importance of that people in the future of The Army. And itis a remarkable fact that German cities should have been subsidising TheArmy's work before any English one did so.We have happily got complete enough accounts of The General's tour inGermany, when eighty-one, to supply not merely a most artisticrepresentation of his own appearance and action at that age, but at thesame time to give an almost perfect view of the impressions andteachings his Army has been giving out there for nearly thirty years.In Duesseldorf, we are told:--     "The old idealist spoke for an hour and a half with the fire of     enthusiasm, throwing out every now and then some spark of his     humour amidst his stream of eloquence. He did not speak like a     dying greybeard, but like a young man ready to take up to-morrow     morning the struggle with the misery of the whole world. Out of     such material as this old man are made the great men who do great     deeds on the battle-field, in the sphere of science, in the     province of religion, of humanity, and of society."The _Cologne Gazette_ goes more into detail, and says:--     "At his great age the Founder and Leader of The Salvation Army     hastens from continent to continent, from land to land, to awaken     in Public Meetings love for your neighbour. After a journey through     Holland he came into West Germany. In this week he speaks in great     cities from Dortmund to Carlsruhe, each day in a new place, and     often in several Meetings. Many thousands came together last Sunday     from Essen and neighbourhood, so that the great hall of the     Soldiers' Home itself was not large enough to hold them at the     various Meetings. Here yesterday evening 2,000 people wanted to     give him a warm welcome in the Emperor's Hall.     "The eighty-one-year-old philanthropist, who strides so unbendingly     along, is full of youthful enthusiasm. His tall figure, with its     gleaming eyes, long curved nose, and flowing beard, help him to     present himself to the audience, with lively gestures illuminating     his thoughts, as at once accuser of our times and gentle judge. He     is especially a gentle judge of fallen women and girls, 55,000 of     whom, from ten years of age upwards, he tells us, The Army has     rescued.     "'The fallen young men are forgiven by their fathers and mothers,'     says he. 'Why should not we also forgive the fallen girls? If     nobody else will do so, we will.' This sentiment called forth     general applause.     "'And then,' The General went on, 'The religion of The Army has     three main principles: (1) You must get right with your God. You     must be reconciled with Him, and feel the kiss of His forgiving     love. (2) You must live righteously in your own private life, in     your family, and in holiness of heart. (3) You must give yourself     up to the service of your fellow-men--must not wait to be called     upon, but must have a fire in yourself--the fire of love.'     "It took mightily hold of the audience as, following upon this     definition of the religion of The Army, he told them that he felt     himself now nearing the cold stream of death, but fully believed     that this religion, which had carried him through so much of care     and disappointment up to this day, would also carry him through the     dark valley into Paradise, where he, who for so long had known no     holiday, would at last find rest."Everywhere in Germany it is this revelation of a religion, founded onunshakable faith, which impresses even the sceptical journalist. Hereand there the tendency to doubt shows itself a little between the lines,and it is suggested that the audience were only for the time being underthe spell of this remarkable speaker. But most impressive is always thedescription of The General's calls to repentance and faith.In Berlin for a number of years the General held Meetings in the greatCircus Busch on the National Buss-tag, Repentance Day; and, as the wayin which his name is pronounced by most Germans comes very near one ofthe two words, it has almost become a Booth Day in the thoughts of many.     "It was evident," says one paper, "again in the two Meetings held     yesterday that the personality of the Founder and Leader of The     Army still exercises its charm. Both Meetings were crowded; the     Circus was filled from arena up to gallery with a pressing     multitude. At the close of the evening address there was the call     to the Penitent-Form, and 158 men and women, out of the most     differing circles of society, obeyed the call. Mr. Booth spoke in     both Meetings with the freshest energy and youthful fire, and     to-day he travels to Denmark."The _Frankfort Gazette_, and other papers, having the opportunity forthe first time to report The General's Meetings on a whole Sunday, alittle later, gave a much completer description of his preaching:--     "The Founder of The Army," says the _Gazette_, "bears his     eighty-one years lightly. He is still equal to all the toils of the     agitation, and spoke for over five hours in three Meetings in the     great hall of the Merchants' Union. The old gentleman keeps up his     good humour, and perfectly understands how to intersperse     interesting anecdotes in his addresses."     "Last Sunday," says another paper, "was a Booth Day, and certainly     a Repentance Day. The General came to win Soldiers for his Army,     and ammunition for it, too; but there was plenty of opportunity for     repentance given. Everybody knows now the why and wherefore of The     Army's Meetings. There is music--then prayer with closed eyes, and     then a little sister sings a religious song to a worldly tune. That     was so yesterday; but then The General came as chief speaker. He     had no need of any other influence; his mere appearance works upon     every one.     "The public was composed of all sorts of people. Politicians,     Socialists, as well as clergymen and leaders in Church work were     there, together with officials and working-men and women."Nothing could be more impressive as to the ever-widening circles whocrowded to listen to The General than the following description of hisMeeting in Potsdam, the German Windsor, where the Emperor generallyresides. Says the local paper:--     "One could not cease to marvel at the crowded state of the     auditorium. The intelligent public, which generally keeps away from     popular demonstrations, was there in force. Jurists, state     officials, officers in uniform, doctors, and many ladies were     amongst the hearers of The General."But some of the papers in smaller but not less striking reports gave usa far fuller description of what The General's appeals brought home tothe hearts of his hearers everywhere.     "No laboured rhetoric," said a Leipzig paper, "distinguished the     speech, and applause was not won by catchy phrases. The speaker     talks like a plain man to plain people. Everybody listens     enthralled as he tells of his life's work, of the unbounded love     with which he would like to surround and lead to Salvation every     one who lives and moves. One gets to understand how this man could     gather around him such masses of disciples, and why, right and     left, many a lady deeply touched puts her handkerchief to her eyes     and many a man wipes a tear from his cheek."Best of all, however, comes ever and anon in these reports thetestimony that The General has not been a mere talker, like so manyothers of his day, but has raised up a real fighting force who have, bygradual painstaking labour and endurance, won for him this unboundedconfidence in what he says of The Army's religion.     "I remember," writes one reporter, "how in the nineties, in Berlin,     no Soldier, much less a Sister, could appear in the street without     being laughed at at every step, made fun of, and even abused, and I     visited Meetings in which there was great disorder. But how the     picture was altered a few years later! Quietly and patiently the     Soldiers let scorn and even assaults pass, until the very rowdiest     of the Berliners were sick of it. And on the other hand every one     soon said that these people, after all, were doing nothing but to     go right at the deepest miseries of the great cities--that they fed     the hungry, visited the sick, and generally carried out practical     Christianity."     "True," writes another, "it is naturally not every one whose taste     is pleased with the ceremonies of The Army; but before the     world-wide, unending, unselfish work of the Salvationist every one     feels like saying, 'Hats off!'     "It was not mere love of sensation that led such a stream of men to     the Princes Hall on Tuesday evening. They wished for once to come     face to face with the old General whose work they had learnt in the     course of time to value. Men of science, clergymen and officials     and educated people generally, for once made The Army their     rendezvous."And those who had heard the General before immediately recognised thatthey had not only to do with the very same resolute Leader, followingthe one aim with undiminished ardour, but relying upon the same oldGospel to win the world for Christ.     "He speaks," says a Hamburg paper, "mostly with his hands behind     his back, swaying gently to and fro. The short, sharp English     sentences are translated one by one. It is the old recruiting talk     of the chief captain in the fight against the sins of this world,     the pressing exhortation to get converted at once, to-day, in this     very hour. It is the old entreaty to become a child of God, in     spite of all opposition; the old call to purity of heart and life.     Whoever has wandered must come back again. He who has fallen a     hundred times must get up again for the hundred and first time.     "This General believes in the Salvation of the worst and the most     deeply sunken. He preaches the gospel of holding on, of going     steadily forwards, of freedom from the lusts of the flesh and from     public opinion. He preaches at the same time the gospel of work, of     unwearied faithfulness in business, and of love to all mankind.     "When he has finished The Army sings with musical accompaniment and     clapping of hands its glad and even merry-sounding songs, not     without a mixture of that sudden inrush of enthusiasm which springs     from the conviction of having the only faith that can make people     blessed, and the consciousness of a resistance hard to be overcome.     And then begins that extraordinary urgent exhorting of the sinner     from the stage--the ten-and-twenty times repeated 'Come'--come to     the Penitent-Form, represented here by a row of twenty chairs. 'In     the last Meeting of The General's in Copenhagen thirty-three came     out. How many will it be in Hamburg?' cries the leading Officer.     "The first are soon kneeling, sobbing, praying, their hands over     their eyes at the chairs. Ever new songs are sung--spiritual songs     set to worldly melodies. Ever anew sounds the ringing 'Come' from     the stage. Below, the men and women Soldiers go from one to     another, speaking to the hesitating ones, laying a hand on the     shoulder of the ready ones, and leading them to the front. What a     long time it may be since any loving hand was laid on the shoulder     of many of those Recruits! Life, the rough, pitiless life of the     great city, has always been pushing them along lower and lower down     till it got them underfoot. Here they listen to the sound of a     voice of sympathy, and feel the pressure of a hand that wishes to     lead them. And there above sits The General for a while in an     arm-chair, saying: 'The deepest-fallen may rise again. He has only     to step out into the ranks of The Army, which is marching upwards     to the Land of Grace.' As we left the Hall the thirty-fourth had     already come out."It must be remembered that all these descriptions come from part of asingle month's journeys, and that The General was dependent upontranslation for nearly every moment of intercourse either in public orprivate with the people, and that it will be entirely understood howgreat a power for God in this world a man entirely given up may be afterhe has passed his eightieth year, and with what clearness witness forGod can be borne even in a strange tongue when it is plain and definite.     "From time immemorial it has been customary to class     philanthropists amongst the extraordinaries, the marvellous     people--who do not pass muster in the common world--exceptions.     Nobody thinks of measuring himself with them, for the battle of     life belongs to the egotists--each one of whom fights for himself.     He who fights for others is smilingly acknowledged by the     well-disposed as a stranger in the world. The ordinary man of the     street pitilessly calls him a fool, and the mass considers him     unworthy of a second thought. He is there, and he is endured so     long as he does not bother any one.     "There are three factors against which the old General has had to     fight all his life long--against well-meaning hesitation, against     hard-hearted egoism, and against the idle indifference born of     ignorance. And these three streams that have flowed against him in     every part of the world have not been able to hold him back. To     those who think he has only become an important man, and to those     who measure a man's worth by the outer honours he gains, he became     a man of importance when London made him a citizen and Oxford an     honorary Doctor. And now men are better inclined to excuse in his     case the curious title of General of a curious Army.     "I have often heard the grey-headed General in Public Meetings. For     the first time on Saturday evening I got near to him in a more     private way. And then it seemed to me like a picture, as when a     grey warrior, a commander with snow-white beard and keen profile,     stands upright by the mast of a ship and gazes straight before him     towards a new country.     "And General Booth, despite his eighty-one years, is looking out     towards new land. He does not live on memories like the generality     of old men. He does not allow himself any favoured spot by the     fireside. Full of fight and always leading, General Booth stands at     the centre of a gigantic apparatus. And the old gentleman does not     look like allowing men to take the control out of his hands.     "Everything about him displays energy and justifiable     self-consciousness. He energetically shook my hand. With the     ability of the man of the world he drew the conversation to that     which was nearest to his heart. And what his eyes can no longer     exactly observe his ears doubly well hear. He arrived on Friday     evening from Denmark, holds three Meetings in Hamburg on Sunday,     travels on to Potsdam on Monday, and occupies himself with thoughts     of a journey of inspection in India.     "The comfortable arm-chair that was offered him he declined almost     as if it were an insult.' That is meant for an old man,' he said;     and really the remark was justified when one heard the plans of the     grey General, for he has plans such as one of the youngest might     have. He appears to me like an able business man who constantly     thinks how to expand his undertaking and to supply it with all the     novelties that a time of progress offers. He has altogether modern     views. He does not hold fast with the reluctance of old age to old     things, except to the old faith.     "In the Meetings The General seemed to me rather severe; but that     disappears when you get at him personally, especially when you have     got used to his way of speaking. He almost flings each sentence     out. Every phrase, accompanied by some energetic gesture, is like a     war cry. 'I will, and I carry out what I will,' seems to breathe in     all about him; and who can complain of this will, this iron     resoluteness with which he works at the raising up of men. He is in     his kingdom an unlimited ruler, but one with a benevolent look who     sees for the benefit of the blind. He must be all that for his     extraordinary work.     "The General asks us to put questions. I could not manage it. It     seemed to me to be so useless in the presence of this important     man. So he said, 'We are never satisfied with the progress we make     in view of what still remains to be done.' He spoke of the progress     made by the Social Work of The Army in Germany, and of his plans.     "I never heard The General speak without his having plans, upon the     carrying out of which he was at work with all his might. He puts     his whole body and soul into whatever he is engaged in.     "'The Salvation Army is the most interesting thing under the sun,'     said The General at the close of this earnest talk, and then added,     jokingly, 'next to the Hamburg Press.'     "On the Sunday I saw him again as he spoke to a Meeting of     thousands, a curiously mixed public, where there were many of the     foremost gentlemen and ladies of society and many very common     people. All, however, were equally enthused. I will only mention a     couple of sentences out of the speech: 'The Army wants to come into     competition with nobody, only to be a friendly helper--nobody's     enemy, but the friend of everybody. It will gladly be an     inspiration and example. It has become the almsgiver for many     Governments. It is not British because it was born in Britain, just     as little as Christianity is Jewish because it came into the world     in Judea.'"--Else Meerstedt.Now that we see it all but completed, we think this book singularlywanting in reference to The General's frequent merriness of mood. Wehave thought it needless to insert any of the amusing anecdotes thatcould have been so abundantly culled from any of his visits to anycountry had we not been so anxious to select from the small space at ourdisposal what was most important.Nor have we wished to present the reader with the portrait of aninfallible genius, or a saint who never said or did anything that heafterwards regretted. A victim almost all his life to extremeindigestion, it is indeed to all who knew him best marvellous that hecould endure so much of misery without more frequently expressing interms of unpleasant frankness his irritation at the faults and mistakesof others. But really after his death as during his life we have beenfar too busy in trying to help in accomplishing his great lifework tonote these details of human frailty.Chapter XXIVThe EndIt seems almost impossible to describe the ending of The General's life,because there was not even the semblance of an end within a week of hisdeath.The last time I talked with him, just as I was leaving for Canada inJanuary, he for the first time made a remark that indicated a doubt ofhis continuance in office. He hardly hinted at death; but, referring tothe sensations of exhaustion he had felt a few days previously, he said:"I sometimes fancy, you know, that I may be getting to a halt, andthen"--with his usual pause when he was going to tease--"we shall have achance to see what some of you can do!"We laughed together, and I went off expecting to hear of his fullyrecovering his activity "after the operation," to which we were alwayslooking forward. Oh, that operation! It was to be the simplest thing inthe world, when the eye was just ready for it, as simple and as completea deliverance from blindness as the other one had seemed, for a fewdays, to be. But this time he would be fully warned, and most cautiousafter it, and I really fancied the joy he would have after so long aneclipse.It seemed to me that he never realised how great his own blindnessalready was, so strong was his resolution to make the best of it, and soeager his perception, really by other means, of everything he could inany way notice. We had difficulty in remembering that he really couldnot see when he turned so rapidly towards anybody approaching him orwhose voice he recognised!To Colonel Kitching during this dark period he wrote one day: "Anybodycan believe in the sunshine. We, that is you and I and a few more ofwhom we know, ought to be desperate believers by this time--Saviours ofmen--against their will, nay, compellers of the Almighty."And his writing was always so marvellous, both for quantity and quality.His very last letters to several of us consisted of a number of pagesall written with perfect clearness and regularity with his own hand. Itwas, perhaps, the greatest triumph of his own unfailing faith and sunnyoptimism that he kept even those who were nearest to him full of hope asto his complete recovery of strength till within a few days of hisdeath; and then, gliding down into the valley, surprised all by sinkingsuddenly into eternal peace without any distinct warning that the endwas so near. His youngest daughter, Mrs. Commissioner Booth-Hellberg,was with him during the last days.But, really, it would be only fair to describe his end as having begunfrom the day when, during his Sixth Motor Tour, the eye which had beenoperated upon became blind. Though after having it taken out, he verylargely rallied, and passed through grand Campaigns for some years, hewas ever looking forward to the operation on the other eye, which was torestore him to partial sight. His cheeriness through those years and hismarvellous energy astonished all.The following notes of his first foreign journey after the loss of sightcannot but be of special interest, showing with what zest and enjoymenthe threw himself into all his undertakings for Christ:--     "Saturday, _February_ 12, 1910.--The crossing has been quite rough     enough. I slept very little, and it was with real difficulty that I     shambled through the long railway depot to my train for Rotterdam.     At eight o'clock was woke up from a sound sleep with a startling     feeling. It is a pity I could not have slept on. Fixed up at the     old hotel six floors up (the Mass Hotel). Very fair accommodation,     but a little difficult to get anything to eat, that is, such as     meet my queer tastes and habits. Nevertheless, on the principle of     'any port in a storm,' I have had much worse accommodation.     "Sunday, _February_ 13, 1910.--Had a wonderful day. Far ahead of     anything experienced before in this place. My opinion about it is     jotted down in _The War Cry_. I had, as I thought, remarkable power     on each of the three occasions, and finished off at ten o'clock far     less exhausted than I frequently am. Still, I scarcely got into my     rooms before the giddiness came on in my head very badly, and     continued off and on until ten the next morning. I can't account     for it. It may be my stomach, or it may have something to do with     the rocking of the steamer on Friday night. It may be what the     doctors fear, my overtaxed brain, or it may be something else.     Whatever it is, it is very awkward while it lasts. Fifty-seven     souls for the day.     "Monday, _February_ 14, 1910.--Left by the 12:37 p.m. train for     Groningen. Slept a good bit of the way. Arrived about 5:12 p.m.     Reception very remarkable, considering the population is only some     78,000. It was one of the most remarkable greetings I have ever had     in any part of the world. There must have been getting on for a     couple of thousand people in the station itself, who had each paid     five cents for a platform ticket, and outside 5,000 is a low     estimate. Everybody very friendly.     "Entertained by the Governor's wife's sister. The Meeting was as     wonderful as the reception. Immense hall. Could not be less than     1,500 people packed into it on one floor. I talked for an hour and     three-quarters. Colonel Palstra, my translator, did splendidly, the     people listening spellbound; not a soul moved until the last     minute, when three or four went out for some reason or other. It     was a wonderful time. Settled to sleep about 11:30 p.m. not feeling     any worse.     "Tuesday, _February_ 15, 1910.--Had a fair night's sleep. The     strange feelings in the head continue off and on, and the fact that     they don't pass off, in connexion with the entreaties of the Chief,     and those about me, made me consent to give up the Officers'     Council I was proposing to hold at Amsterdam next week, putting on     Lectures on the evenings of the two days which I would otherwise     have used for Councils. I am very loath to do this, from feeling     that the Officers are the great need. So far I have been delighted     with what I have seen of the Officers in the country. We ought to     capture Holland.     "The Governor has sent word to say that he is coming to see me this     afternoon.     "I have had a long sleep, and I hope I shall be better for it. The     Governor has just come in. He appears a very amiable person, very     friendly disposed towards The Army. We had a very nice conversation     about matters in general, and at parting he expressed his kindest     wishes for my future and for the future of The Army.     "I left at a few minutes before seven. It has been snowing and     raining, and freezing and thawing the last few hours, consequently     the atmosphere is not very agreeable. However, my carriage was well     warmed, and we arrived at Assen in half an hour.     "A very nice hall--packed with a very respectful audience. I spoke     on the old subject, 'The Lesson of my Life,' and made it 'better as     new' as the Jew says about his second-hand garments. I was very     pleased with it and the people were too. I am entertained by Baron     and Baroness Van der Velts. The lady speaks English very nicely,     and they are evidently very pleased to have me with them.     "I was glad to settle to sleep about eleven, and thankful for the     mercies of the day."It was thus that nearly three years passed away. Then came at last thetime when the long-hoped-for operation was to take place.Rookstone, the house in Hadley Wood, a village on the northern outskirtsof London, where The General died, stands almost at the foot of thegarden of the present General, so that they could be constantly in touchwhen at home, and the General's grandchildren greatly enjoyed his lovefor them.But in the large three-windowed room, where his left eye was operatedupon, and where a few months later he died, his Successor, his youngestdaughter, Commissioner Howard, and his Private Secretary, ColonelKitching, had many valued interviews with him during those last months.I had not that opportunity until it was too late to speak to him, for hehad said when it was suggested, full as he had been of the hope ofprolonged life almost to the end, "Oh, yes, he'll want to come and getsomething for my life and that will just finish me."Of the operaton itself we prefer to let the physician himself speak inthe following extract from _The Lancet_ of the 19th October, 1912:     "...He was not in very good health in March, 1910; he had     occasional giddy attacks and lapses of memory, and from April till     June of the same year he had albuminuria, from which, however, he     appeared entirely to recover. The vision of his left eye became     gradually worse, but I encouraged him to go on without operation as     long as he could. He did so until about the end of 1911, when his     sight had become so bad that he could barely find his way about;     indeed, he met with one or two minor accidents on account of not     being able to see. It then appeared to me he had much to gain and     very little to lose by an operation, and further, he was in much     better health than he had been for some time. I pointed out to him     that there was a risk and that if the operation failed he would be     totally blind, but that there were very long odds in his favour,     and that I was willing to take the risk if he was. He asked one     question: 'If you were in my place would you have it done?' I said     certainly I would. That quite decided him and all that remained to     be done was to fix a time. General Booth at that date had some work     which he wanted to finish, and eventually the date for operation     was fixed for May 23rd. On that day I operated. I did a simple     extraction under cocaine.     "Nothing could have been more satisfactory, as will be seen from     the notes, and the bulletin sent to the papers was, 'The operation     was entirely successful; the ultimate result depends on The     General's recuperative power.' When I covered the eye and bandaged     it I thought that success was certain, and was confirmed in that     opinion on the following morning when I lifted up the dressing and     found all was well, and that the patient, when he partly opened the     eye, could see. On the third day Dr. Milne, who was in attendance,     at once saw that mischief had occurred, and the sequence of events     I have narrated. How the eye became infected I am unable to say. I     used every precaution; as I told the patient afterwards, the only     omission I could think of was that I had not boiled or roasted     myself.... I looked carefully for these before each operation. I     regret two things in the case: (1) that the last operation was not     done two or three months before when General Booth was in better     health; (2) that it was not postponed for another month, in which     case I should not have done it, for looking back on the whole     history I feel certain that he was not in his best condition on May     23rd when the operation was performed."The General's own response when he was gently informed that there wasno hope of his seeing objects any more was:--     "Well, the Lord's Will be done. If it is to be so I have but to bow     my head and accept it."He subsequently remarked that as he had served God and the people withhis eyes he must now try to serve without them. He continued to dictateletters, and even to write occasionally as he had been accustomed to do,with the help of his secretaries, and a frame that had been prepared forthe purpose. But the very struggles against depression and to cheerothers, together with the sleeplessness that resulted took from hislittle remaining strength, and it became evident that he was graduallysinking. Yet he was so remarkably cheerful and at times even confidentthat all around him were kept hoping up to the very last.To a group of Commissioners who visited him he said:--     "I am hoping speedily to be able to talk to Officers and help them     all over the world. I am still hoping to go to America and Canada     as I had bargained for. I am hoping for several things whether they     come to pass or not."But on Tuesday, the 20th August, it became evident that the end was verynear. There gathered around his bed Mr. and Mrs. Bramwell Booth, Mrs.Commissioner Booth-Hellberg, Commissioner Howard, who had been summonedby telegram from his furlough, Colonel Kitching, Brigadier Cox, AdjutantCatherine Booth, Sergeant Bernard Booth, Captain Taylor, his lastAssistant Secretary, Nurse Ada Timson of the London Hospital, andCaptain Amelia Hill, his housekeeper.The heart showed no sign of failure until within half an hour of hisdeath, and the feet remained warm till within twenty minutes of theevent. But the heart and pulse became gradually weaker, the breathingfaster and shorter and more irregular, and at thirteen minutes past teno'clock at night it entirely ceased.London awoke to find in our Headquarters window the notice, "GeneralBooth has laid down his Sword. God is with us."The day after his death, at a meeting of all the Commissioners presentin London, the envelope containing the General's appointment of hissuccessor was produced by the Army's Solicitors, endorsed in theGeneral's own writing and still sealed. Upon being opened, it was foundto be dated the 21st August, 1890, and that it appointed the Chief ofthe Staff, William Bramwell Booth, to succeed him. The new General, inaccepting the appointment, and promising by God's help to fulfil itsduties, expressed his great pleasure in discovering that it was datedduring the lifetime of his mother, so that he could feel sure that herprayers had been joined with his father's for him at the time.Immediately there began to pour in upon us from every part of the worldexpressions of admiration and sympathy which were most valuable in theirpromise for the Army's increased opportunity and usefulness in thefuture.His Majesty, the King, who had manifested deep sympathy with The Generalin his illness, sent the following generous message, which was one ofthe first to come to hand:--     "Abbeystead Hall.     "I am grieved to hear the sad news of the death of your Father. The     nation has lost a great organiser, and the poor a whole-hearted and     sincere friend, who devoted his life to helping them in a practical     way.     "Only in the future shall we realise the good wrought by him for     his fellow-creatures.     "To-day there is universal mourning for him. I join in it, and     assure you and your family of my true sympathy in the heavy loss     which has befallen you.     "George R. I."Queen Alexandra telegraphed:--     "I beg you and your family to accept my deepest and most heartfelt     sympathy in the irreparable loss you and the nation have sustained     in the death of your great, good, and never-to-be-forgotten Father,     a loss which will be felt throughout the whole civilised world.     But, thank God, his work will live for ever.     "Alexandra."President Taft wired:--     "Washington.     "To General Bramwell Booth:     "In the death of your good Father the world loses one of the most     effective practical philanthropists. His long life and great     talents were dedicated to the noble work of helping the poor and     weak, and to giving them another chance to attain success and     happiness.     "Accept my deep sympathy.     "Wm. H. Taft."The King of Denmark wired:--     "Express my sincere sympathy.     "Christian R."The Lord Mayor of London, Sir Thomas B. Crosby, wired:--     "The City of London sincerely mourns the passing away of its     distinguished citizen, General Booth, whose grand and good work     entitles him to imperishable gratitude."Whilst the Governors and Premiers of most of the Colonies where the Armyis at work cabled in similar terms. The Emperor of Germany, as well asthe King and Queen, and Queen Alexandra, sent wreaths to be placed onThe General's coffin, and the tributes of the press all over the worldwill be found in the following chapter.More than 65,000 persons came to Clapton Congress Hall to look upon hisface as he lay in his coffin, and more than 35,000 gathered for thegreat Memorial Service in the Olympia, the largest obtainable buildingin London, on the evening before the funeral. All the press commentedupon the remarkable joyfulness of our funeral services, and the funeralitself the next day was admitted to have been the most impressive sightthe great city has seen in modern times.In addition to officers, many bands from all parts of the country cameto join in it.The coffin had been brought in the night to Headquarters in QueenVictoria Street. The funeral procession was formed on the Embankment,and whilst it marched through the city all traffic was suspended from 11till 1 o'clock. The millions who witnessed its passage along thefive-mile march to Abney Park Cemetery seemed as generally impressed andsympathetic as the multitude gathered there. It was indeed touching tosee not only policemen and ambulance workers; but publicans and numbersof the people offering glasses of water to the sisters who had been ontheir feet for six or seven hours before the service was ended.The memorial services held all over the world on the following Sundaywere attended by quite unparalleled crowds, of whom very many publiclysurrendered their lives to God.The following letters to members of his own family show the spirit ofaffection and of cheerfulness which to the very last distinguished him.To his youngest daughter, the widow of Commissioner Booth-Hellberg, who,though she had been fighting in one post or another in this country,India, America, Sweden, Switzerland, or France for over twenty years, hestill regarded as his "baby" and special darling, he wrote:--     "Hadley Wood,     "_May_ 3, 1912.     "My very dear Lucy,--     "Your letter is to hand. I am interested in all you say. It was     very kind, indeed beautiful, of you to sit by the couch of dear     Erickson all those hours. But it will be a recollection of pleasure     all through your life, and I have no doubt, after the fading hours     of this life have passed out of sight and thought, it will give you     satisfaction in the life to come.     "There is a great deal in your suggestion that we should do more in     the hospitals. It would be, as you say, beyond question a means of     blessing and comfort--indeed, of Salvation to many of the lovely,     suffering, dying people whose melancholy lot carries them there.     But the old difficulty bars the way--the want of Officers and money     for the task. Well, we are doing something in this direction, and     we must wait for the power to do more.     "I think much about many of the things you say. Your practical     common sense comes out at every turn. Based, as your comments and     suggestions usually are, on the _religion of love_, makes them very     precious.     "Go on, my dear girl. God, I feel, is preparing you for something     very useful in His Kingdom. I feel quite sure.     "But, oh, do be careful and not overrun your strength.     "Through mercy I am keeping better. I had a very trying day     yesterday on the top of my table work, which I find a continuous     trial to my nerves, but I came through it--that is, through     yesterday's hard pull. It was a visit to my native town. But you     will read about it in the _Cry_.     "I am eating much more, not only in quantity, but am indulging in a     little more variety.     "My difficulty at the moment is, that while a good supper helps me     to sleep, a scanty supper is agreeable to my brains, and my     feelings hinder me from sleeping, as I am so lively after it.     "_Later._     "I have just had a nice little sleep. Quite refreshing it has been,     and very welcome also.     "I am now in for a cup of tea. What a pleasure it would be if you     were here to pour it out and chatter to me while I drink it.     "Well, I had anticipated this delight on my visit to Norway and     Sweden in this coming July, but that, I am afraid, will not     come--that is, my visit to Denmark; but I shall hold on to it     (D.V.) in connexion with my Annual Campaign in Berlin and round     about. Then I shall expect quite a long stay in your Territory,     similar to my last; or better, I hope.     "I am positively working night and day now, and only hope I shall     not break down; but I am careful, after all, and seem to be really     substantially improved.     "I cannot finish this letter now, and, although it is not worth     posting, I think it will be best to send it off. I may put in a     P.S. if there is opportunity.     "Anyway, believe me, as ever and for ever,     "Your affectionate father,     "W. B."At his last public Meeting to celebrate his 83d birthday, at the RoyalAlbert Hall, on the 9th day of May, the General had said:--     "And now comrades and friends I must say good-bye. I am going into     dry dock for repairs, but The Army will not be allowed to suffer,     either financially or spiritually, or in any other way by my     absence, and in the long future I think it will be seen--I shall     not be here to see, but you will, that The Army will answer every     doubt and banish every fear and strangle every slander, and by its     marvellous success show to the world that it is the work of God and     that The General has been His Servant."In his last letter to the Chief, he wrote two months later:--     "International Headquarters, London, E.C.     "_July 4, 1912_.     "My Dear Chief,--     "I am pleased to hear that you are sticking to your intention of     going away for a few days, in spite of my continued affliction, for     affliction it can truthfully be called.     "I am very poorly, and the trial of it is that I cannot see any     positive prospect of a definite, speedy recovery. But it will come;     I have never seriously doubted it. God won't let me finish off in     this disheartening manner--disheartening, I mean, to my comrades,     and to those I have to leave with the responsibility of keeping the     Banner flying. God will still do wonders, in spite of men and     devils.     "All will be well. Miriam will get well, Mary will get well, and     both be brave warriors. Florrie will flourish more than ever, and     you will be stronger; and, although it may require more patience     and skill, I shall rally!     "I am in real pain and difficulty while I dictate this. These     horrid spasms seem to sit on me like a mountain, but I felt I could     not let you go without a longer good-bye and a more affectionate     kiss than what is so ordinarily. This is a poor thing, but it     speaks of the feeling of my heart, and the most fervent prayer of     my soul. Love to all,     "Yours, as ever,     "W. B.     "The Chief of the Staff."To his second daughter, in command of The Army in the United States,his last letter read as follows:--     "_July 20, 1912_.     "My dear, dear Eva,--     "I had your letter. Bless you a thousand times! You are a lovely     correspondent. You don't write your letters with your pen, or with     your tongue, you write them with your heart. Hearts are different;     some, I suppose, are born sound and musical, others are born     uncertain and unmusical, and are at best a mere tinkling cymbal.     Yours, I have no doubt, has blessed and cheered and delighted the     soul of the mother who bore you from the very first opening of your     eyes upon the world, and that dear heart has gone on with that     cheering influence from that time to the present, and it will go on     cheering everybody around you who have loved you, and it will go on     cheering among the rest your loving brother Bramwell and your     devoted General right away to the end; nay, will go on endlessly,     for there is to be no conclusion to our affection.     "I want it to be so. I want it to be my own experience. Love, to be     a blessing, must be ambitious, boundless, and eternal. O Lord, help     me! and O Lord, destroy everything in me that interferes with the     prosperity, growth, and fruitfulness of this precious, Divine, and     everlasting fruit!     "I have been ill--I have been very ill indeed. I have had a return     of my indigestion in its most terrible form. This spasmodic feeling     of suffocation has so distressed me that at times it has seemed     almost impossible for me to exist. Still, I have fought my way     through, and the doctors this afternoon have told me, as bluntly     and plainly as an opinion could be given to a man, that I must     struggle on and not give way, or the consequences will be very     serious.     "Then, too, the eye has caused me much pain, but that has very     much, if not entirely, passed off, and the oculist tells me that     the eye will heal up. But, alas! alas! I am absolutely blind. It is     very painful, but I am not the only blind man in the world, and I     can easily see how, if I am spared, I shall be able to do a good     deal of valuable work.     "So I am going to make another attempt at work. What do you think     of that? I have sat down this afternoon, not exactly to the desk,     but any way to the duties of the desk, and I am going to strive to     stick to them if I possibly can. I have been down to some of my     meals; I have had a walk in the garden, and now it is proposed for     me to take a drive in a motor, I believe some kind soul is loaning     me. Anyhow, I am going to have some machine that will shuffle me     along the street, road, and square, and I will see how that acts on     my nerves, and then perhaps try something more.     "However, I am going into action once more in the Salvation War,     and I believe, feeble as I am, God is going to give me another good     turn, and another blessed wave of success.     "You will pray for me. I would like before I die--it has been one     of the choicest wishes of my soul--to be able to make The Salvation     Army such a power for God and of such benefit to mankind that no     wicked people can spoil it.     "Salvation for ever! Salvation--Yellow, Red, and Blue! I am for it,     my darling, and so are you.     "I have heard about your Open-Air services with the greatest     satisfaction, and praise God with all my heart that in the midst of     the difficulties of climate and politics, etc., you have been able     to go forward.     "I have the daily papers read to me, and among other things that     are very mysterious and puzzling are the particulars that I gather     of the dreadful heat that you have had to suffer, both as a people     and as individuals.     "You seem to have, indeed, been having lively times with the     weather. It must have tried you very much.     "My telling you not to fret about me is the proper thing to do.     That is my business in this world very largely, and if I can only     comfort your dear heart--well, I shall do good work.     "Good-bye, my darling child. Write to me as often as you can, but     not when overburdened. I am with you, and for you, and in you for     ever and ever. Love to everybody.     "Your affectionate father and General,     "William Booth."To an Officer whom he regarded almost as a daughter, and whose hearinghad been greatly affected, he wrote:--     My Dear C.,--     "Thanks for your sympathetic letter. It is good of you to think     about me now and then. Specially so as you must be much and often     exercised about your own affliction.     "Perhaps you will think that it is easier for me to accept mine     than it will be for you to accept yours. I have just been thinking     that to have any difficulty in the Hearing Organ is not so serious     as a difficulty with the Seeing. You can read and write, and with a     little contrivance and patience you can hear any communication that     may be specially interesting and important. It is true, you are     shut out from the pleasure and profit that comes from the general     conversation of a company, and from listening to Public Speakers,     although a great deal that you miss is no serious loss at all!     "In my case, I can imagine I am worse off. With me, reading is     impossible, and writing is so difficult that, although I can     scratch a few lines, the work soon becomes so taxing and difficult     that I have to relinquish it. So we'll sympathise the one with the     other. We will trust in God, take courage, and look forward to     brighter days.     "Anyway, God lives, and there are a thousand things we can do for     Him, and what we can do we will do, and we will do it with our     might."Every thoughtful reader of this volume will naturally have asked himselfmany times over, how was it possible for the Leader of a greatworld-wide Mission to leave his Headquarters, year after year, for weeksand sometimes for months at a time, without involving great risk ofdisaster to his Army?The answer, familiar to every one at Headquarters, and, indeed, to manyothers, lay in the existence, largely out of sight even to the vastmajority of the Soldiers of The Army, of a man who, since his veryyouth, had been The General's unwearyable assistant. It was the presentGeneral Bramwell Booth, content to toil mostly at executive oradministrative work, whether at Headquarters or elsewhere, unseen andunapplauded, who was ceaselessly watching over every portion of the vastwhole, and as ceaselessly preparing for advances, noting defects,stopping mistaken movements, and urging at every turn, upon every one,the importance of prayer and faith, the danger of self-confidence,and, the certainty of God's sufficiency for all who relied wholly uponHim. It was this organiser of victory in the individual and on manyfields who made it possible for the Army to march forward whilst itsGeneral was receiving from city to city, and from village to village, inmotor and other tours, the reward of faithful service to the pooresteverywhere, and was also ever advancing on the common foe.Therefore this book could not be complete without some account of thethen Chief of the Staff to explain his construction.Born in Halifax, in 1856, amidst one of those great Revival Tours inwhich his parents shared in the tremendous toils that brought, in everyplace they visited, hundreds of souls into deep conviction of sin andhearty submission to God, the little one must have drunk in, from hisvery childhood, some of that anxiety for the perishing, and joy in theirdeliverance, which form the basis of a Salvationist career. Named afterone of the greatest Holiness preachers, who accompanied John Wesley inhis campaigning, in the express hope to both father and mother, that heshould become an apostle of that teaching, the faith of his parentsreceived abundant fulfilment in his after life.As a boy he shared with them all the vicissitudes of their eight gipsyyears, during which they were practically without a home, and the onesettled year of (as they thought) half wasted time, amidst the usualformalities, always galling to them both, or ordinary Church life; sothat, with his usual acuteness of observation, he must have noted alltheir horror of routine, and learnt, more than anybody noticed, thereasons why the Churches had become divorced from the crowds and thecrowds from the Churches.In his tenth year, when they settled in London, and began their reallife work, he cannot but have partaken fully of the satisfaction thisgave to them, whilst they were, as yet, buried amidst the mass ofEast-End misery. It was shortly before the foundation of the Work thathe was converted at one of his mother's own Meetings. The shrinking frompublicity, which seems an essential part of every conscientious person,held him long back from resolving to become one of their Officers. Butduring all the years between his being saved and that great decision,he was constantly helping, first in Children's Meetings, and then inoffice work, so that at twenty-one he was already a very experiencedman, both in the work of saving souls, and in much of the businessmanagement for which a great Movement calls.When I first saw him at seventeen, he was still studying; but he hadbeen, during the previous eighteen months of the General's illness andabsence, his mother's mainstay in the managing both the public and theoffice work of "The Christian Mission," and the Secretary and, largely,manager of a set of soup kitchens, the precursors, in some ways, of ourpresent Social Wing. For all this to be possible to a lad of seventeen,of delicate health, may give some little indication of the facultieswith which God had endowed him.It was not, however, till five years later, when he had fully conqueredhis own taste for a medical career that he gave himself fully to theWar. Alone, or with one of his sisters, he visited the towns where manyof our largest Corps were being raised, holding Meetings in theatres andother popular resorts, so that he gained first-hand all the experiencesof Officers, both in the pioneering days and in the after years ofstruggle against all manner of difficulty, when every sort of problem asto individuals, and Corps, had to be dealt with from hour to hour.This much to explain how it was possible for a man so young to become attwenty-five the worthy and capable Chief of the Staff of an Army alreadyat work in both hemispheres and on both sides of the world. The readerwill also be able to understand how the Chief, travelling by night asoften as by day, could visit the General in the midst of any of hisCampaigns, and in the course of a brief journey from city to city, orbetween night and morning confer fully with him, and take decisions uponmatters that could not await even the delay of a mail.The comfort to The General, as he often testified, of the continualfaithful service of this slave of a son was one of the most invaluableforces of his life. Whilst, on the one side we may see in suchself-renouncing abandonment a certificate to and evidence of the natureof The General's own life, we must read in it, at the same time, somepart of the explanation of his boundless activities and influence.For the Chief of those days, The General of these, to have gone to andcome away from his father's daily scenes of triumph without getting theslightest appetite himself for public displays, or yielding in theslightest to the craving after human support or encouragement, to turnhim aside from the humdrum of duty, is one proof of those graciousevidences of God's saving and keeping power with which the history ofThe Salvation Army abounds.Chapter XXVTributesThe great tribute The General received by the vast assemblies in everycountry at his Funeral and Memorial services, said far more than anywords could have expressed of the extent to which he had becomerecognised everywhere as a true friend of all who were in need, and ofthe degree to which he had succeeded in prompting all his Officers andpeople to act up to that ideal.The following, a small selection of the most prominent testimonies borneto his life by the Press of various countries, will give some idea ofwhat was thought and felt by his contemporaries about him and hiswork:--The Christian World, _August 22, 1912_"No name is graven more deeply in the history of his time than that ofWilliam Booth, Founder and General of The Salvation Army, who passed tohis rest on Tuesday night. At sixteen, the Nottingham builder's sonunderwent an 'old-fashioned conversion,' and, as he told arepresentative of _The Christian World_, 'within six hours he was goingin and out of the cottages in the back streets, preaching the Gospelthat had saved himself.' From that day he toiled terribly, and nevermore terribly than since his sixtieth year, after which the SocialScheme was launched, and The General undertook those evangelistic toursin which he traversed England again and again in every direction, andcovered a great part of the Western world. How he kept up is a miracle,for he was a frail-looking figure, and he ate next to nothing--a sliceor two of toast or bread and butter or rice pudding and a roasted apple,were his meals for many years past. It was his great heart, hisinvincible faith, his indomitable courage that kept him going."Plutarch would have put William Booth and John Wesley together in his'Parallel Lives.' Each man 'thought in continents.' 'The world is myparish,' said Wesley, and Methodism to-day covers the world. So GeneralBooth believed in world conquest for Christ, because he believed inChrist's all-conquering power, and he had the courage of his conviction.He learnt much from Wesley, for he began as a Methodist. He knew whatcan be done by thorough organisation, and what financial resources thereare in the multiplication of small but cheerful givers. Like Wesley,too, he combined the genius for great conceptions with the genius forpractical detail, without which great conceptions soon vanish into thinair. He was more masterful than Wesley. When he broke away from theMethodist New Connexion, and founded the Christian Mission of which TheSalvation Army was the evolution, he found that committees wasted theirtime in talk and were distracted in opinion. He read lives of Napoleon,Wellington, and other great commanders, and came to the conclusion thata committee is an excellent thing to receive and carry out instructionsfrom a masterful man who knows what he wants, but otherwise they areworthless. He persuaded those of his colleagues who had unbounded beliefin him, and whose sole concern was the progress of the Mission, toaccept the military organisation with himself as Commander-in-Chief, andwith his driving power and the inspiration of his heroic example, thoseOfficers went to every part of Great Britain and to something like fiftydifferent countries and 'did exploits.' That system may work with aselfless Christian hero who is a born Caesar or Napoleon. The SalvationArmy's severe testing time has now come, when it will be seen whether,after all, the more cautious Wellingtonian methods of Wesley laid firmerfoundations."The secret of General Booth's personal force and commanding power wasan open one. To him there were no realities so demonstrable as therealities of the spiritual world--most of all, the reality of Christ'sreal personal presence and saving power to-day. He found thatunquestioning faith in Christ's saving power worked everywhere and underall conditions. We differed from him on theological details, but wegladly recognise that scores of thousands of 'moral miracles,' in theshape of lives remade that were apparently shattered beyond repair andtrodden in the mud of dissipation and bold habitual sinning, verifiedthe faith. The burglar who had been forty years in prison and penalservitude, the most shameless of Magdalens, the drinker and gamblerbrought down to the Embankment at midnight, greedy for a meal of soupand bread, the man or woman determined to end a state of despair anddisgust with the world by suicide, these, under the influence of TheSalvation Army, became 'new creations.' But the same conviction, and theevidences of its miraculous Operation, captured a large number of menand women of the cultured and refined classes, who were either thevictims of moral weakness, or who felt the challenge to service andsacrifice for the sake of others. Kings, Queens, and Royal Princes andPrincesses were glad to see General Booth, and gave their encouragementto his work, and it was fitting that, when King Edward died, a SalvationArmy band should comfort the widowed lady by playing in the courtyard ofBuckingham Palace her husband's favourite hymns."The Social Work was an inevitable outcome of the evangelistic work. Ithad its dangers, and The Salvation Army has not escaped all of themwithout scathe. But it was found that the difficulty with thousands ofthe Converts was that of giving them a chance to redeem their past, andto nurse them physically and morally till they were able to stand alone,in a position to take their places again in the ranks of decent andself-respecting citizenship. Then there was the 'Submerged Tenth'--thehuman wreckage tossed hither and thither by the swirling currents of thesocial sea. To safeguard the one class, and to save the other fromthemselves and their circumstances, the Social scheme was launched, andthose who estimate its success by moral valuation rather than in termsof finance, will say that it has justified itself, though it neveraccomplished what The General fondly hoped."Now that his worn-out body lies awaiting burial, The General's personalworth and the worth of his work are frankly confessed even by those whowere once his bitterest critics. _The Times_ had a leader in which itsaid that he rose from obscurity to be known as the head of a vastorganisation 'well known over all the world, and yielding to him anobedience scarcely less complete than that which the Catholic Churchyields to the Roman Pontiff.' We wish _The Times_ had followed _TheStandard_ in dropping the invidious quotation marks from the title,General. William Booth was a great leader of men in a world campaign ofindividual and social Salvation. Why reserve the title only for menskilled in the art of wholesale human slaughter?"The Times, _August 8, 1912_"The death of General Booth, which we announce with great regret thismorning, closes a strange career, one of the most remarkable that ourage has seen, and will set the world meditating on that fervent,forceful character, and that keen, though, as some would say, narrowintelligence. Born of unrecorded parentage, educated anyhow, he hadraised himself from a position of friendless obscurity to be the head ofa vast Organisation not confined to this country or to the British race,but well known over half the world, and yielding to him an obediencescarcely less complete than that which the Catholic Church yields to theRoman Pontiff. The full memoir which we publish to-day shows how thisSalvation Army grew up--the creation of one man, or rather of a pair ofhuman beings, for the late Mrs. Booth was scarcely less important to itsearly development than was her husband. Both of them belonged to theWesleyan body, of which William Booth at the time of his marriage was aminister, though a very independent and insubordinate one; and deepingrained in both was the belief which is a more essential part of theWesleyan than of any other creed, the belief in conversion as aninstantaneous change affecting the whole life. Booth himself had beenconverted at fifteen, and at sixty he wrote of 'the hour, the place ofthis glorious transaction' as an undying memory. Out of this idea ofconversion, as not only the most powerful motive force in life, but as aforce which was, so to speak, waiting to be applied to all, arose thewhole Salvation Army Movement. It was not, of course, in any sense a newidea. Christians had been familiar with it in all ages, and both the NewTestament and the history of the early saints supply instances insupport of it. But Booth was probably more affected by more recentevidence. Imperfect as had been his training for the ministry, hedoubtless learnt pretty thoroughly the history of Wesley and Whitefield,and of the astonishing early years of the Methodist movement. In his ownyouth, too, Revivalism was an active force, and he himself had beenstrongly moved by an American missionary. His originality lay incarrying down the doctrine not only to the highways and hedges, but tothe slums, the homes of the very poor, the haunts of criminals andriff-raff; in getting hold of these people; in using the worst ofthem--'converted,' as he honestly believed--as a triumphantadvertisement; and then in organising his followers into a vast Army,with himself as absolute Chief. On the methods adopted nothing need beadded to what is said in the memoir; they are familiar to all, thoughnot so familiar as they were some twenty years ago."The root-idea of William Booth's religion, the object of his missionarywork, was 'the saving of souls.' Translated into other language, thismeans the establishment of a conviction in the minds of men, women, andchildren that they were reconciled to God, saved, and preserved to alleternity from the penalties of sin. We do not propose to enter on thedelicate ground of theological discussion, or to argue for or againstthe truth or value of such a conviction. The interesting point, inrelation to General Booth's ideas and personality, is to note how thisbelief is worked into the system of The Army in the official programme,fantastically called the Articles of War, which has to be signed byevery Candidate for enrolment. This curious document, which will greatlyinterest future social historians, consists of three parts--a creed, asdefinite as any taught by the Churches; a promise to abstain from drink,bad language, dishonesty, etc.; and a solemn promise to obey the lawfulorders of the Officers, and never on any consideration to oppose theinterests of The Salvation Army. The last part, the promissory part, ismade much stricter in the case of Candidates for the position ofOfficer; these solemnly promise not only to obey The General, but toreport any case they may observe in others of 'neglect or variation fromhis orders and directions.' Membership of the Organisation thus dependson absolute obedience, and on a profession of faith in Salvation in thedefinite sense formulated in the Articles of War. The two areinseparably conjoined. When we reflect upon what human nature is, in theclass from which so many of the members of The Army have been drawn,when we think how difficult it is to reconcile the hand-to-mouthexistence of the casual labourer with any high standard of conduct, letalone of religion, General Booth's success, partial though it has been,is an astonishing fact. It implies a prodigious strength of character,and a genius for seeing what would appeal to large numbers of humblefolk."Will that success continue now that General Booth is dead? Everywherewe hear that The Army is not bringing in Recruits as fast as of old. Itsnovelty has worn off; its uniforms are no longer impressive; its streetservices, though they provoke no opposition, do not seem to attract thewastrel and the 'rough' as they did at first. We can readily believethat the work goes on more or less as before; but the gatherings, wesuspect, are mostly composed of those who have long frequented them andof a certain number of new members drawn rather from existing sects thanfrom persons till now untouched by religion. Then, with regard to theother side of The Army's work, the Social Schemes outlined in _InDarkest England_ have met with only moderate success, as all coolobservers foretold in 1890. They have, at least, provided no panacea forpoverty. Probably Mr. Booth felt this during the last years of his life;but he has been spared the sight of the still further decline of hisprojects, which to most of us seems inevitable. Of course, some personsare more confident: they argue that Napoleon's system did not disappearafter Waterloo, nor Wesley's system with the death of its founder, andthat the Roman Catholic Church is as strong as ever, though Pope afterPope disappears. That is true, but for the very reason that thesesystems were elaborate organisations, based on the facts of life. TheCode Napoleon and the Methodist Connexion were much too well adapted tohuman needs to disappear with their authors. On the other hand,movements and systems which depend wholly upon one man do not oftenprove to be more than ephemeral. But none would deny that there is muchto be learnt from The Salvation Army and from the earnest, strenuous,and resourceful personality of the man who made it. Let us hope that, ifThe Army as an Organisation should ultimately fade away, the greatlesson of its even temporary success will not be forgotten: the lessonthat any force which is to move mankind must regard man's nature asspiritual as well as material, and that the weak and humble, the poorand the 'submerged,' share in that double nature as much as those whospend their lives in the sunshine of worldly prosperity."The Daily Chronicle, _August 21, 1912_"To-day we have the mournful duty of chronicling the passing of WilliamBooth, the Head of that vast Organisation, the Salvation Army. The worldhas lost its greatest missionary evangelist, one of the supermen of theage. Almost every land on the face of the globe knows this pioneer andhis Army, The Army which has waged such long, determined, and successfulbattle against the world's ramparts of sin and woe. Not one country, butfifty, will feel to-day a severe personal loss. From Lapland to Honoluluheads will be bowed in sorrow at the news that that striking figure whohas been responsible for so much of the religious progress of the worldof to-day is no more."The stupendous crusade which he initiated had the very humblestbeginnings. It opened in the slummy purlieus of Nottingham, that citywhich gave to the world two of the greatest religious leaders of moderntimes--General Booth and Dr. Paton. It has passed through periods ofopen enmity, opposition, criticism, but its Leader and his band ofdevoted helpers have never lost sight of their high aim. They wereengaged in 'war on the hosts that keep the underworld submerged,' andthey have now long been justified by their unparalleled achievements.The time of scorn and indifference passed, and General Booth lived toreceive honour at the hands of kings and princes, and to have theirsupport for his work."It is not given to every man who sets out with a great purpose toaccomplish his aims. But of General Booth it may be said that he didmore. His Movement reached dimensions of which he probably never dreamedin its early days, yet the extraordinary results made him ever hungrierfor conquest. In a way the latter years of his life were perhaps themost notable of his whole career. He displayed a vitality and enthusiasmwhich seemed to increase with the weight of time. At a time when mostmen seek a greater measure of repose, General Booth worked on with allthe freshness of early years. And it can be said that he has died inharness. He did not lift his finger from the pulse of the far-reachingOrganisation which he brought into being until death called."The story of the growth of The Salvation Army is the most remarkable inthe history of the work of the spiritual, social, and materialregeneration of the submerged. From the by-ways of all the world humanderelicts, which other agencies passed by, have been rescued. No one wastoo degraded, too repulsive to be neglected. The work is too great to beestimated in a way which can show its extent. It has been achievedmainly by two great factors. The first is perfect organisation. LordWolseley once described General Booth as the greatest organiser in theworld. The second feature was the wonderful personality of The Army'schief. He impressed it not only upon his colleagues but upon those whomhe wished to rescue, and on the public at large. He radiated humansympathy and enthusiasm. His loss will be a heavy one for the world; itwill be a severe blow for The Army. But we cannot think that his goodwork has not been built upon sound foundations, and that the war hedirected so ably and so long will be relaxed. Nationally The Army hasdone magnificent work in fifty countries, and it has, therefore, tendedto promote a greater spirit of brotherhood among the nations. To-day thewhole world will unite to pay its tribute to a splendid life of devotionto a great cause. To that world he leaves a splendid example, and itwill be the highest tribute that can be paid to his memory to keep greenthat lofty example which he set before all peoples."The Daily Telegraph, _August 21, 1912_"It is with no ordinary or conventional regret that we record thismorning the death of General Booth. The news will be received byhundreds of thousands of Salvationists with profound and reverentialgrief, and by many who are not Salvationists, and who never could be,with respectful and sympathetic sorrow. For, whatever we may think ofWilliam Booth and of the wonderful Organisation which he so triumphantlyestablished, it is certain that he belonged to the company of saints,and that during the eighty-three years of a strenuous life, he devotedhimself, so far as in him lay, to the solemn duty of saving men's soulsand extending the Divine Kingdom on earth. That success attended hisefforts is, from this point of view, not of so much consequence as thatthe success was deserved by the patient, devout, and self-sacrificingzeal of the Founder of The Salvation Army. Long ago William Boothprevailed against the easy scepticism of those who found fault with hisaims, and the sincere dislike of humble and reverent men, who doubtedwhether the cause of religion could be advanced by such riotous methods.Not only was The General of The Salvation Army a saint and a mystic, wholived in this world and yet was not of this world, but he also waspossessed of much practical ability and common sense, without which thegreat work of his life could never have been accomplished. We need onlyrefer to that remarkable book which he published in 1890, _In DarkestEngland, and the Way Out_, in which will be found proposals to remedythe crying evils of pauperism and vice by such eminently wise expedientsas Farm Colonies, Oversea Colonies, and Rescue Homes for Fallen Women;to say nothing of picturesque but also practical devices, such as thePrison-Gate Brigade, the Poor Man's Bank, the Poor Man's Lawyer, andWhitechapel-by-the-Sea. How is it possible to ridicule the objects orcharacter of a man who has proved himself so earnest a worker for God?As a matter of fact, William Booth was nothing less than a genius, andtowards the end of the nineteenth century the world at large gave verygenerous recognition, not only to the spirit and temper, but to theresults of an extraordinarily effective, and, indeed, epoch-makingMovement. At the instance of King Edward VII The General was officiallyinvited to be present at the Coronation ceremony in 1902. Nothing couldhave marked more significantly than this single fact the completeness ofthe change of public feeling; and when, in 1905, William Booth went on aprogress through England, he was welcomed in state by the Mayors andCorporations of many towns."Is it better to live in this world with no religion at all or with anarrow and violent form of religious belief? People will judge thedeceased teacher and chief, in respect of his theological andpropagandist work, in accordance with the views which they hold uponthis alternative. As regards his social labours, his passionate effortsto help the 'submerged tenth,' his widespread helpfulness of the poor,his shelters and refuges, the feeling must and will be almost universalthat he was an energetic and warm-hearted benefactor of his kind, whowrought much good to his times, and helped others to do it, and who hadwhat Sir John Seeley called the 'enthusiasm of humanity' in veryhonourable, if noisy and demonstrative, form. But, since The Generalmingled all this with a cult--a distinct theological teaching, a theoryof the Divine government and destiny of mankind which was in externalform, as Huxley styled it, 'Corybantic'--the question does and mustarise whether religion of the Salvationist school does good or harm tothe human natures which it addresses. It is not necessary to dwell uponthe dislike--we might, indeed, say the repulsion--felt by serious andelevated minds at the paraphernalia, the pious turmoil, the uproar and'banalite' of much that has developed under the Banners of The SalvationArmy. Prayers uttered like volley-firing, hymns roared to the roll ofdrums and the screaming of fifes, have been features of this remarkablerevival which outraged many of the orthodox, and made even the judiciousand indulgent ask whether any good could come out of such a Nazareth.Nobody gave utterance to this feeling with greater moderation orkindliness than Cardinal Manning, when, while confessing that the needof spiritual awakening among the English poor was only too well provedby the success of General Booth--that the moral and religious state ofEast London could alone have rendered possible The Salvation Army--hisEminence added these grave sentences: 'Low words generate low thoughts;words without reverence destroy the veneration of the human mind. When aman ceases to venerate he ceases to worship. Extravagance, exaggeration,and coarseness are dangers incident to all popular teachers, and thesethings pass easily into a strain which shocks the moral sense anddeadens the instinct of piety. Familiarity with God in men of chastenedmind produces a more profound veneration; in unchastened minds it runseasily into an irreverence which borders upon impiety. Even the Seraphimcover their faces in the Divine Presence.'"Yet against what new movement of spiritual awakening in thepeople--against what form of religious revival might not the sameargument of offended culture and decorous holiness be employed? Andwhere would the lower masses of men be to-day if Religion had notstooped out of her celestial heights--from the first chapters ofChristendom until the last--to the intellectual and moral levels of thepoor and lowly? In the sheet, knit at four corners, and lowered out ofHeaven, there was nothing common or unclean. If, as is practicallycertain, General Booth, by the vast association which he founded andorganised, touched with the sense of higher and immortal thingscountless humble and unenlightened souls; if, in his way, and in theirway, he brought home to them the love and power of Heaven, and the dutyand destiny of men, then it is not for refined persons who keep alooffrom such vulgar tasks to mock at the life and deeds of this remarkableman. The particulars which we give elsewhere of his career show how,like Wesley, Whitefield, and Spurgeon, in this country, and likeSavonarola, Peter the Hermit, and the Safi mystics abroad, WilliamBooth, the builder's son of Nottingham, was obviously set apart, andsummoned by time, temperament, and circumstances for the labours of hislife. Like Luther, his answer to all objections--worldly orunworldly--would always have been, 'I can no other'. Meeting in MissCatherine Mumford the wife who exactly suited him, and reinforced bymany children, all brought up in the temper and vocation of theirparents, The General made his family a sort of Headquarters' Staff ofThe Salvation Army, and celebrated his household marriages or bewept hisdomestic bereavements with all the eclat and effect of oecumenicalevents. We saw him buy up and turn into stations for his troops suchplaces as the 'Eagle Tavern' and 'Grecian Theatre,' overcome popularrioting at Bath, Guilford, Eastbourne, and elsewhere; fill the UnitedKingdom with his _War Cry_ and his fighting centres, and invade allEurope, and even the Far East. At home he plunged, insatiable of moraland social conquests, into his crusade for 'Darkest England,' beingpowerful enough to raise in less than a month as much as all England andthe Colonies contributed for the Gordon College at Khartoum in responseto another victorious general. For General Booth certainly ended bybeing victorious. If the evangelical creed he inculcated was rude,crude, and unideal, it was serious, sincere, and stimulating. He wagedwar against the Devil, as that mysterious personage was understood byhim, with the most whole-hearted and relentless zeal. He enjoined, letit be remembered, an absolute temperance, soberness, and chastity uponthe Officers and rank and file of his motley host; and, ugly as some maythink the uniforms of Salvationists, the police and magistrates knowthat they cover for the most part honest hearts. Could The General haveaffected all this--or a tenth part of it--if he had not lent himself tothe eternal necessities and weaknesses of the uneducated, and given themhis drill, his banners, his drums, his prayer-volleys, his poke-bonnets,and his military tunics? We doubt it, and in contemplating, therefore,the enormous good this dead man did, and sought to do, and the neglectedfields of humanity which he tilled for the Common Master, we judge himto be one of the chief and most serviceable figures of the Victorianage; and well deserving from his own followers the ecstasy of grief andveneration which is being manifested, and from contemporary notice thetribute of a hearty recognition of pious and noble objects zealouslypursued, and love of God and of humanity made the passion and thepurpose of a whole unflinching life."Daily Chronicle, _August 22, 1912_By Harold Begbie"Scarcely could you find a country in the whole world where men andwomen are not now grieving for the death of General Booth. Among peoplesof whom we have never heard, and in languages of which we do not knoweven the alphabet, this universal grief ascends to Heaven--perhaps themost universal grief ever known in the history of mankind."One realises something of the old man's achievement by reflecting onthis universal grief. It will not do to dismiss him lightly. More, itwill not do to express a casual admiration of his character, anindulgent approbation of his work. The man was unique. In some ways hewas the superman of his period. Never before has a man in his ownlifetime won so wide a measure of deep and passionate human affection."It will not do to say that by adopting vulgar methods and appealing tovulgar people, General Booth established his universal kingdom ofemotional religion. Let the person inclined to think in this way dresshimself in fantastic garments, take a drum, and march through thestreets shouting 'Hallelujah.' There is no shorter cut to humility. Manyhave tried to do what William Booth did. Many men as earnestly and astenderly have sought to waken drugged humanity and render the Kingdom ofHeaven a reality. Many men have broken their hearts in the effort tosave the Christian religion from the paralysis of formalism and thesleeping sickness of philosophy. It is not an easy thing to revivify areligion, nor a small thing to rescue many thousands of the human racefrom sin and misery."Let us be generous and acknowledge, now that it is too late to cheerhis heart, that General Booth accomplished a work quite wonderful andquite splendid, a work unique in the records of the human race. Let usbe frank and say that we ourselves could have done nothing like it. Letus forget our intellectual superiority, and, instead of criticising,endeavour to see as it stands before us, and as it really is, theimmense marvel of his achievement. Our canons of taste, our notions ofpropriety, will change and cease to be. The saved souls of humanity willpersist for ever."I remember very well my first impression of General Booth. I was young;I knew little of the sorrow of existence; I was perfectly satisfied withthe traditions I had inherited from my ancestors; I was disposed toregard originality as affectation, and great earnestness as a sign offanaticism. In this mood I sat and talked with General Booth, measuredhim, judged him, and had the audacity to express in print my opinionabout him--my opinion of this huge giant, this Moses of modern times. Heoffended me. The tone of his voice grated on my ears. His manner to aservant who waited upon him seemed harsh and irritable. I found itimpossible to believe that his acquaintance with spirituality was eitherintimate or real. Saints ought to be gentlemen. He seemed to me a vulgarold man, a clumsy old humourist, an intolerant, fanatical, one idea'dHebraist."Later in my life I met him on several occasions, and at each meetingwith him I saw something fresh to admire, something new to love. I thinkthat he himself altered as life advanced; but the main change, ofcourse, was in myself--I was able to see him with truer vision, becauseI was less sure of my own value to the cosmos, and more interested todiscover the value of other men. And I was learning to know the sorrowsof the world."There is one very common illusion concerning General Booth. The vulgarsneers are forgotten; the scandalous slander that he was a self-seekingcharlatan is now ashamed to utter itself except in vile quarters; butmen still say--so anxious are they to escape from the miracle, sodetermined to account for every great thing by little reasons--that hissuccess as revivalist lay only in his powers as an organiser. Now,nothing is further from the truth. General Booth was not a greatorganiser, not even a great showman. He would have ruined any businessentrusted to his management. He would long ago have ruined theorganisation of The Salvation Army if his life had been spent on thatside of its operations. Far from being the hard, shrewd, calculating,and statesmanlike genius of The Army's machinery, General Booth hasalways been its heart and soul, its dreamer and its inspiration. Thebrains of The Army are to be looked for elsewhere. Bramwell Booth is theman of affairs. Bramwell Booth is the master-mind directing all thoseworld-wide activities. And but for Bramwell Booth The Salvation Army asit now exists, a vast catholic Organisation, would be unknown tomankind."General Booth's secret, so far as one may speak about it at all, lay inhis perfectly beautiful and most passionate sympathy with suffering andpain. I have met only one other man in my life who so powerfullyrealised the sorrows of other people. Because General Booth realisedthese sorrows so very truly and so very actually, he was able tocommunicate his burning desire for radical reformation to other people.The contagiousness of his enthusiasm was the obvious cause of hisextraordinary success, but the hidden cause of this enthusiasm was theliving, breathing, heart-beating reality of his sympathy with sorrow.When he spoke to one of the sufferings endured by the children of adrunkard, for instance, it was manifest that he himself felt the verytortures and agonies of those unhappy children--really felt them, reallyendured them. His face showed it. There was no break in the voice, nopious exclamation, no gesture in the least theatrical or sentimental.One saw in the man's face that he was enduring pain, that the thoughtwas so real to him that he himself actually suffered, and sufferedacutely. If we had imagination enough to feel as he felt the dreadfulfears and awful deprivation of little children in the godless slums ofgreat cities, we, too, should rush out from our comfortable ease toraise Salvation Armies. It would be torture to sit still. It would beimpossible to do nothing."This wonderful old man suffered all his life as few have ever suffered.And his suffering arose from the tremendous power of his imagination. Ata Meeting he would tell amusing stories, and in the company of severalpeople he would talk with a gaiety that deceived; but with one or two,deeply interested to know why he was a Salvationist, and what he reallythought about life, he would open his heart, and show one at leastsomething of its agony. He was afflicted by the sins of the whole world.They hurt him, tore him, wounded him, and broke his heart. He did notmerely know that people suffer from starvation; that children run tohide under a bed at the first sound of a drunken parent's step on thestair; that thousands of women are friendless and defaced on thestreets; that thousands of boys go to their bodily and spiritual ruinonly for want of a little natural parental care; that men and women arelocked up like wild beasts in prison who would be good parents andlaw-abiding citizens were love allowed to enter and plead with them--hedid not merely know these things, but he visualised and felt in his ownperson the actual tortures of all these perishing creatures. He wept forthem. He prayed for them. Sometimes he would not sleep for thinking ofthem."I have seen him with suffering face and extended arms walk up and downhis room, crying out from the depths of his heart: 'Oh, those poorpeople, those poor people!--the sad, wretched women, the little,trembling frightened children meant to be so happy!--all cursed withsin, cursed and crushed and tortured by sin!' And he would then open hisarms as if to embrace the whole world, and exclaim, 'Why won't they letus save them?'--meaning, 'Why won't society and the State let TheSalvation Army save them?'"His attitude towards suffering and sorrow was, nevertheless, harder inmany ways than that of certain humanitarians. He believed in a Devil, hebelieved in Hell, and he believed in the saying that there are those whowould not be persuaded though one rose from the dead. And so he held itthe wisdom of statesmanship that when all men have been given a fairopportunity for repentance, and after love has done everything in itspower to save and convert the lawless and bad, those who will not acceptSalvation should be punished with all the force of a civilisation thatmust needs defend itself. The word punishment was very often on hislips. I think that he believed in the value of punishment almost asprofoundly as he believed in the value of love. He believed that lovecould save the very worst man and the very worst woman in the world whowanted to be saved; and he also believed that nothing was so just andwise as rigorous punishment for the unrighteous who would not be saved.I think that he would have set up in England, if he had enjoyed thepower which we give to politicians, two classes of prison--the reformingprison, controlled only by compassionate Christians who believe in love;and the punishing prison, which isolates the evil and iniquitous fromcontact with innocence and struggling virtue. In that direction thismost merciful man was merciless."Why he became a Salvationist is very clear. He knew that the centre oflife is the heart. He saw that all efforts of statesmanship to alter theconditions of existence must be fruitless, or, at any rate, that theharvest must be in the far distant future of humanity, while the heartof man remains unchanged. He suspected the mere respectability whichsatisfies so many reformers. Even virtue seemed to him second-rate andperilous. He was not satisfied with abstention from sin, or with thechange from slum to model lodging-house. He held that no man is safe, noman is at the top of his being, no man is fully conscious of life'stremendous greatness until the heart is definitely and rejoicingly givento God. He was like St. Augustine, like Coleridge, and all the supremesaints of the world in this insistence upon the necessity for a cleansedheart and a will devoted to the glory of God; he was different from themall in believing that this message must be shouted, dinned, trumpeted,and drummed into the ears of the world before mankind can awaken to itstruth."He made a tremendous demand. Towards the end of his life he sometimeswondered, very sadly and pitifully, whether he had not asked too much ofhis followers. I think, to mention only one particular, that he waswavering as to his ban upon tobacco. He was so certain of the happinessand joy which come from Salvation, that he had no patience with thetrivial weaknesses of human flesh, which do not really matter. Let usremember that he had seen thousands of men and women all over the worldliterally transformed by his method from the most miserable animals intoradiant and intelligent creatures conscious of immortality and filledwith the spirit of unselfish devotion to humanity. Is it to be wonderedat that The General of this enormous Army should scarcely doubt thewisdom of his first terms of service?"But towards the end he suffered greatly in his own personal life, andsuffering loosens the rigidity of the mind. Those of his own householdbroke away from him, the dearest of his children died, trusted Officersforsook him, some of those whose sins he had forgiven again and againdeserted his Flag, and whispered scandal and tittle-tattle into the earsof degraded journalism. He was attacked, vilified, and denounced by thevilest of men in the vilest of manners. Sometimes, sitting alone byhimself, blind and powerless, very battleworn and sad, this old man atthe end of his life must have suffered in the solitude of his soul agrief almost intolerable. But he became more human and more lovable inthese last years of distress."We are apt to think that very remarkable men who have risen throughopposition and difficulty to places of preeminence, must sometimes lookback upon the past and indulge themselves in feelings ofself-congratulation. It is not often true. A well-known millionaire toldme that the happiest moment in his life was that when he ran as a littleboy bareheaded through the rain into his mother's cottage carrying toher in a tight-clenched fist his first week's wage--a sixpenny bit. Mr.Lloyd George told me that he never looks back, never allows himself todream of his romantic life. 'I haven't time,' he said; 'the present istoo obsessing, the fight is too hard and insistent.' Mr. Chamberlain inthe early days of Tariff Reform, told me much the same thing. Perhaps wemay say that men of action never look back. And so it was with GeneralBooth. He might well have rested during these last few years in a largeand grateful peace, counting his victories, measuring his achievement,and comparing the pulpit in Nottingham or the first wind-battered tentin East London with this innumerable Army of Salvation which all overthe world has saved thousands of human beings from destruction.Sometimes smaller men are able to save a family from disgrace, or torescue a friend from some hideous calamity, or to make a crippled childhappy for a week or two, and the feelings created by these actions arefull of happiness and delight. But this old, rough-tongued,weather-beaten, and heart-tortured prophet, who had saved not tens butthousands, who could see with his own eyes in almost every country ofthe world thousands of little girls rescued from defamation, thousandsof women rescued from the sink of horrid vice, thousands of men new-bornfrom lives of unimaginable crime and iniquity, thousands of homes oncedreary with squalor and savagery now happy and full of purest joy; nay,who could see, as I have seen in India, whole tribes of criminal races,numbering millions, and once the despair of the Indian Government,living happy, contented, and industrial lives under the Flag of TheSalvation Army--he who could see all this, and who could justly say,'But for me these things had never been,' was not happy and was notsatisfied. He ached and groaned to save all such as are sorrowful."In the last letter he ever wrote to me, a letter that broke offpitifully, because of his blindness, from the big, bold, challenginghandwriting, and became a dictated typewritten letter, occurred thewords, 'I am distressed.' He was chiefly distressed by the over-devotionmost of us pay to politics and philosophy, by the struggle for wages, bythe clash between master and man, by the frivolity of the rich, thestupor of the poor, by the blindness of the whole world to the necessityfor the cleansed heart. He did not want to establish a Salvation Army,but to save the whole world. He did not want to be acclaimed by manynations, but to see suffering and poverty and squalor clean banishedfrom the earth. And he believed that with the power of the State at hisback, and with the wealth now squandered in a hundred abortivedirections in his hands, he could have given us a glad and unashamedEngland even in a few years. He knew this and believed it with all hisheart. And he held that his dictatorship would have hurt no just man.He suffered because poverty continues and thousands are still unhappy.For such men this world can never suffice. They create eternity."Others may criticise him. And no man ever lived, I suppose, easier forevery little creature crawling about the earth in self-satisfiedfutility to criticise and ridicule. For myself, I can do nothing butadmire, revere, honour, and love this extraordinary old realist, whosaved so many thousands of human beings from utmost misery; who arousedall the Churches of the Christian religion throughout the world; whocommunicated indirectly to politics a spirit of reality which every yeargrows more potent for social good; who was so tender and affectionateand cordial, and who felt for suffering and sorrow and unhappinesswherever he found it with a heart entirely selfless and absolutely pure."Even if The Salvation Army disappeared from every land where it is nowat work--and, though it will not disappear, I anticipate during the nextten years many changes in its organisation--to the end of time thespirit of William Booth will be part of our religious progress. Wecannot unthink ourselves out of his realism, out of his boundless pity,out of his consuming earnestness.

It rang out in hisburning, earnest words, it breathed in the deep heartfelt prayers in hisMeetings, it expressed itself in wondrous deeds of love, which ignoreddifficulties and shrank from no sacrifice.

In that body, worn with age, was born againsomething of that unconquerable faith which had made Booth as a lad cryout seventy years before, in a prophetic transport, 'The trumpet hassounded the signal for the fight. Your General assures you of successand a glorious reward. Your crown is ready. Why do you wait and hesitateso? Forward, forward, forward!'"Booth was not one to be intimidated. He tolerated insults with Olympicpatience. He just wiped off the dirt his persecutors threw at him, andsmilingly invited them to follow him.

S. Daily"It is one of the day's strongest personages who is gone--a man with theutmost wealth of energy and power.

Nobody candispute that The Army did much good."Stockholm Morning"It lay in the Leader's extraordinary foresight that The Army had agreat and blessed work to fulfil to save the deepest sunken in thecommunity."Chapter XXVIOrganisationThe high reputation which The General gained as an Organiser seems tomake it desirable to explain, as fully as we can, what he aimed at, andby what means he made The Army the remarkable combination it has become.We have, happily, in several of our books his own dissertations on thesubject, for he always sought to make clear to all who should followhim, especially in this respect, the reasons for his plans. In hisintroduction to _Orders and Regulations for Staff Officers_, he writesas follows:--     "Some of the Converts resided in other parts of London, and they     soon commenced themselves to hold Meetings afterwards, and to win     souls in their localities. I was entreated to care for these also.     The Christian Churches, even when they were willing to receive     these Converts, were as a result generally so much occupied with     the maintenance of their own existence, or so lukewarm in coping     with the necessities of the poor people, as to be unequal to the     task of caring for them. I soon found that the majority of those     who joined the Churches either relapsed again into open     backsliding, or became half-hearted professors. I was, therefore,     driven to select men and women who I knew to be lovers of souls,     and to be living holy lives, for the purpose of caring for these     new Converts. These helpers I afterwards directed to hold Meetings     in the streets and in cottages, and then in Halls and other Meeting     Places. The Lord was with them in great power, and hundreds of     wicked and godless people were converted and united together in     separate societies.     "These operations were, in course of time, extended to the     Provinces, where my late beloved wife, who was my unfailing helper     and companion in this work until God took her from me, preached     with much acceptance and remarkable results. It soon became     difficult, and at length impossible, for me to express my wishes     and give my instructions to my helpers by word of mouth, and     consequently I had to issue them in the form of correspondence.     This I also soon found to be a task beyond my ability. And yet, if     unity and harmony were to be preserved among the people God had     given me, and if the work were to be carried on successfully, it     was evident that they must know my wishes. I was, therefore,     compelled to _print_ such Directions and Rules as I deemed to be     necessary.     "This practice has continued to the present day, and been increased     by reason of the advance of the Work to an extent I never could     have anticipated. Some seventeen years ago I issued a volume of     _Orders and Regulations for Field Officers_. More than once since     then this book has been enlarged, and revised to date, and,     although some further developments have been made since that time,     that volume may be taken as the expression, in general terms, of my     present convictions of what a Field Officer of The Salvation Army     should be and do, and as such I commend it to the attention of     Officers and Soldiers of every rank in The Army throughout the     world.     "Soon after the publication of the _Orders and Regulations for     Field Officers_, a volume describing the duties of Divisional     Officers was issued. This volume has also been outgrown, by reason     of continued developments in the organisation of the Army rendering     further enlargements necessary.     "Meanwhile, the ablest and most devoted Officers throughout the     world have been contriving, and, with the authority of     Headquarters, executing what have seemed the wisest and best     methods for attaining the objects we have in view. It now appears     to me not only desirable, but absolutely necessary, that these     usages should be again examined and classified, and, if found to be     in harmony with our principles, corrected, reduced to writing, and     then, endorsed by my authority, published for the benefit of The     Army throughout the world, and for the advantage also of those who     will hereafter be our successors in the responsibility for carrying     forward the War. The _Orders and Regulations_ contained in this     volume are the result.     "It was my intention to make this book a complete Compendium of     Regulations for Staff Officers of all Departments in all parts of     the world; but it became evident that, owing to the multiplication     of the different branches of our operations, and the diversity of     the Regulations required by their varied character and conditions,     such a volume would have been swollen to most inconvenient     dimensions, and I therefore determined to omit everything not     applying to the Officers under the command of the British     Commissioner.     "It must not be inferred from this that the Staff Officers employed     at International Headquarters, or of those engaged in the Social     Work, do not rank equally with those whose duties are herein     described. Further _Orders and Regulations_ required by them, and     for Staff Officers in other Territories, will be issued from time     to time as needed. The Regulations contained in Part I of this     volume are to be carried out as far as possible in all Territories     and Departments.     "The Regulations herein contained must not be regarded as a final     authority on the duties and responsibilities to which they refer.     Development has been the order of The Army from the beginning, and     will, I hope, remain so to the end. Our methods must of necessity     be always changing with the ever varying character and     circumstances of the people whom we seek to benefit. But our     principles remain as unchangeable as the Throne of Jehovah. It is     probable that in succeeding years other _Orders and Regulations_     will be issued by the Central Authority to take the place of these     I am now publishing. It is right, and safe, and necessary that it     should be so. God will, I believe, continue to make known from time     to time, to those who follow His good pleasure, the way in which     the War should be carried on, and The Army will, I hope, continue     to receive and record in _Orders and Regulations_ that manifested     Will, and, by obedience, continue to go forward from victory unto     victory!     "I think I may truthfully say that in no words which it has been my     privilege to write in the past, and in no work that it has ever     been my lot to undertake, have I been more conscious of the     presence and guidance of another Spirit, than in the preparation of     these Regulations. That Spirit has been, I believe, the Spirit of     Eternal Light. I have asked wisdom of God, and I verily believe     that my request has been favourably regarded. Of this, I think,     these Regulations will, to those for whom they have been prepared,     bear witness.     "These Regulations are not, I repeat, intended as a finality. If     any Staff Officer into whose hand this book may come, or may be     brought into knowledge of the working of the Regulations contained     in it, can suggest any improvement, let him do so. If he can show     any plan by which the end aimed at can be more simply, or     inexpensively, or effectually gained, either as regards work, or     men, or methods, or money, by all means let him make the discovery     known to us. God is in no wise confined to any particular person     for the revelation of His will. It would be the vainest of vain     desires were I so foolish as to wish that it should be so. Let Him     speak by whom He will. What I want to see is the work done, souls     saved, and the world made to submit at the Saviour's feet.     "I cannot conclude without saying that there has been present with     me, all the way through the preparation of this book, a vivid sense     of the utter powerlessness of all system, however wisely it may     have been framed, which has not in the application of it that     Spirit of Life who alone imparts the vital force without which no     extensive or permanent good can be effected.     "And now, on the completion of my task, and at the moment of     placing it in the hands of my Officers, this conviction is forced     upon me in an increasing, I may almost say, a painful, degree.     "No one can deny that the religious world is full of forms which     have little or no practical influence on the minds, or hearts, or     lives, of those who travel the weary round of their performances     day by day. Are the Regulations that I am now issuing at no distant     date going to swell the number of these dead and powerless systems?     God forbid that it should be so! Nothing could be further from my     contemplation than such a result.     "However, there must be Regulations. They are necessary. If work is     to be done at all, it must be done after some particular fashion,     and if one fashion is better than another--which no one amongst us     will question--it must be the wisest course to discover that best     fashion, and to describe it in plain language, so that it may be     acted upon throughout our borders until some better method is made     known. We want certain things done in The Army for the Salvation of     souls, for the deliverance of the world from sin and misery, and     for the glory of our God; and the Regulations herein set forth     represent the best methods at present known either to me, or to     those around me, for the accomplishment of these things. Therefore     praying for God's blessing upon them I send them forth with the     expectation that the Staff Officers whom they concern will render a     faithful, conscientious, and believing obedience to all that they     enjoin."All this was only written in 1904, and there has been nothing sincematerially to change the system set forth in the 350 odd pages whichfollow, and which explain as fully as was necessary how the plans whichare so fully explained in the volume of _Orders and Regulations forField Officers_, above referred to, were to be carried into effectthroughout the whole country.The opening chapter of these _Regulations_ explains the Organisation asfollows:--     "THE GENERAL DIVISIONS OF THE ARMY     "The divisions of The Army in the Field are at present as follow:--     "Ward, under the charge of a Sergeant.     "Corps, under the charge and command of a Field Officer.     "Section, under the charge and command of a Sectional Officer.     "Division, under the charge and command of a Divisional Commander.     "Province, under the charge and command of a Provincial Commander.     "Territory, under the charge and command of a Territorial     Commissioner.     "A Ward is a part of a town or neighbourhood in which a Corps is     operating, placed under the charge of Local Officers, whose duty it     is to watch over the welfare of the Soldiers and Recruits belonging     to it.     "A Corps is that portion of a country in which a separate work is     carried on, and for which it is responsible. It may consist of a     city, a town, or a particular district of either, and it may     include one or more Societies in adjoining places, or it may     consist of a number of such Societies grouped together, in which     case it is called a Circle Corps.     "A Section is a group of Corps placed under the command of one or     more Officers.     "A Division consists of a number of Corps grouped together with     that part of a country in which these Corps are situated.     "A Province comprises a number of Divisions.     "A Territory consists of a Country, or part of a Country, or     several Countries combined together, as The General may decide."In _Orders and Regulations_ for his Territorial Commissioners, that is,those who hold the highest command over whole countries, he writes:--     "The higher the authority with which Officers are entrusted, and     the larger the responsibilities resting upon them, the greater is     the need for that absolute devotion to the principles of The Army,     and that complete abandonment to the purposes of God which our     _Orders and Regulations_ express and represent, and without which     no system, however perfect, and no body of men, however capable,     can achieve the great work He has called us to do in establishing     the Kingdom of God in the earth."One of the greatest problems connected with all organisation is thekeeping up to the ideal of those who are in danger of forgetting it;and, therefore, the following section will, we think, be foundespecially interesting to those who may ask, How has it been done, orhow is it to be done? It is the section on "The Development of FieldOfficers," and reads as follows:--     "The Divisional Officer is responsible for seeking to develop the     spiritual life of the F.O.'s. No matter what gifts or zeal the     Officer may possess, if he is not walking in the light, and living     in the favour of God, it is vain to hope that he will be really     successful.     "The D.O. must always, therefore, when he comes in contact with     Officers under his command, make inquiries with regard to their     spiritual life, leading them to acknowledge their faults and heart     conflicts, so that he may give suitable counsel and help.     "The D.O. must regard himself as responsible to God for     maintaining the _devotion_ of the Officers under him to the great     purpose to which they have already consecrated their lives. He     cannot expect to deal faithfully with an Officer on such matters     unless he does so, and he must bear in mind how easy it is to draw     back from that whole-hearted sacrifice without which no Officer can     succeed.     "The D.O. must see that his Officers possess, and live in, the     _spirit_ of The Army. Without it their Officership will be like a     body without a soul, or like a locomotive without any power. The     D.O. must encourage Officers to cry out to God for this, and must     continually explain its importance.     "The D.O. must understand that if Officers under his command     decline in their love for souls and become careless about the     progress of their work, he will have failed in a very important     part of his duty. The D.O. exists for the purpose of helping and     saving his F.O.'s.     "The D.O. is responsible for the development of energy and     enterprise in his Officers. One great temptation of F.O.'s is to     settle down and to be content with a formal discharge of duty, and,     what is worse still, to offer all sorts of excuses for their     lackadaisical Laodicean condition. Few people have in themselves     sufficient force of character, human or Divine, to keep them     pushing ahead for any considerable length of time. Officers who     when they first enter the Field are like flames of fire, will, if     not looked after, get into ruts, and content themselves with     holding so many Meetings, doing so many marches, raising the     ordinary Corps funds, Meeting the ordinary expenditure, keeping the     ordinary number of Soldiers on the Roll, and doing everything in     the ordinary day, while the world, undisturbed, is going forward at     express speed to Hell. The D.O. should endeavour to prevent this     settling down on the part of his Officers by continually stirring     up their minds with inducements to labour and encouragements to     renewed activity and increased sacrifice for the Salvation of the     world.     "The D.O. is also responsible for the improvement of the gifts of     his Officers and of their efficiency for the work they have in     hand. He must not only show them wherein they fail, but must teach     them how they may do better.     "The D.O. must encourage his Officers. If they have gifts and     capacities--and none are without some--he should cheer them     forward by acknowledging them. He should point out where they do     well, at the same time setting before them the higher positions of     usefulness they may reach with a little application and     perseverance. He may always remind them of Officers who during the     early part of their career have had little success, but who, by     sticking to the fight have reached positions of great usefulness.     There are few Officers who during their early days are not cast     down and tempted to think that they do not possess the gifts     necessary to success, and that they have missed their vocation in     becoming Officers. This class of melancholy feelings should be     battled with by the D.O. with all his might, for if allowed to run     their course the result will be not only depression, but despair,     and perhaps desertion.     "The D.O. should give particular attention to the development of     the ability, energy, and religion of the Lieutenants in his     Division. Their position in a Corps often makes it difficult for     them to exercise their gifts to advantage, and they are often     depressed and discouraged. A D.O. should always inquire on his     visiting a Corps having a Lieutenant--     "Whether he is happy with his C.O. and in the Work;     "What special work he has to do and for which he is actually     responsible.     "Every Division must have its own Officers' Meeting, which should     always be conducted by the Divisional Officer, unless the     Provincial Commander, or some Officer representing Headquarters be     present.     "Every Officer in the Division must be present at, at least, one     Officers' Meeting in each month; and where it is possible, in great     centres Meetings should be held once a week. The D.O. must be     careful that the Officers' Meetings do not involve a financial     burden on the Officers, and he must make such plans as will avoid     this, and submit the same to the P.C.     "It will sometimes be found convenient to pool the travelling     expenses, but this may easily work unfavourably to the smaller     Corps instead of in their favour, and in such cases the D.O. must     assist his F.O's with part of the travelling expenses incurred in     attending Officers' Meetings in all such cases where F.O's are     drawing the standard salary or less for their support. Should his     Funds be insufficient to meet the whole of the burden in such     cases, he must apply to the P.C. for assistance.     "The Officers' Meetings should always be held in a comfortable     room of a size proportionate to the number of Officers present. The     Officers should be seated directly before the leader.     "Only Field Officers shall be admitted. A D.O. who wishes to meet     his Local Officers with his F.O. may announce a Special Meeting for     that purpose at any time.     "There shall always be at the beginning of a Meeting some     considerable time spent in prayer for--     "The Officers present and the Division in general;     "The universal Army, its Officers and Soldiers, and especially for     any portion of it that may be suffering persecution or passing     through trial;     "For wisdom for those upon whom the direction of the Army lies;     "The supply of money and all else needed to carry on the War.     "The mightier baptisms of the Holy Ghost, and the Salvation of a     large number of souls.     "The D.O., or any other Officer present, shall have the     opportunity, if desired, of pouring out his soul in loving     exhortation to his comrades, but nothing in the nature of     discussion or the expression of opinions on any orders that may be     given must be permitted.     "The Officer being most used of God at the time should be asked to     urge his fellows to more holy living, greater self-denial, and     increased activity.     "There shall be the opportunity for the publication of any great     blessing that may have been obtained, or any remarkable work of     grace that may have been realised in the souls of the Officers     present, or in their Corps, or for the description of any other     wonderful work of God that may have been wrought during the week in     the Division. When at all possible, every Officer present should     pray aloud during the Meeting.     "There should occasionally be a time set apart for the confession     of unfaithfulness and for the open reconsecration to God and the     War on the part of any Officer.     "There should be a general rededication of all present to the War     at every Meeting.     "There must be a time set apart for the statement by the D.O. of     any event of general interest to the whole Army, or of any     remarkable occurrence in the Division, or any Meetings,     Demonstrations, or other services of importance that may be likely     soon to take place in the Division or elsewhere.     "There must be an opportunity after the Meeting, to transact     business. It is of the greatest importance that there should always     be time allowed for personal intercourse between the D.O. and the     Officers present. The D.O. should always announce at the     commencement of the Meeting that he will be glad to see any Officer     present, personally, at its close.     "It will be seen what an enormous power the D.O. possesses in this     Meeting for inspiring, directing, and controlling all the forces of     his Division; how every week he can spend the greater part of a     day, and as much more time as he likes, in making his Officers, who     have the leadership of The Army in that neighbourhood, think and     feel exactly as he does. How solemnly important, then, must it be     that the D.O. should think and feel just as our Lord Jesus Christ     would have him think and feel on such an occasion, and in the     presence of such an opportunity.     "It is most important that the D.O. should arrange beforehand, with     great care, such business as will have to be transacted. For     instance, he should have, among other things--     "A list of the matters requiring attention. He will save himself     much trouble and correspondence, much loss of time, and much     expense in travelling by seeing the Officers about matters that     concern their Corps, and themselves personally at the Meeting. If     he have no such list, it is probable he will forget some of the     most important questions of business he has on hand.     "He should have a list of the Officers he wants to see, together     with the business upon which it is necessary that he should confer     with them.     "Notes must always be taken by him of the results of these     interviews, according to rule. Especially should any engagements     the D.O. makes for himself be carefully recorded.     "The D.O. should make some personal spiritual preparation for the     Meeting. There must of necessity be many things of a perplexing and     trying character in connexion with the Officers whom he will have     to meet, and the condition of the Corps concerning which he will     have information. He ought, therefore, to make an opportunity     beforehand for special prayer for Divine guidance and strength, and     so enter the Meeting with his mind calm, and confident in the     assurance not only of the Divine favour in his own soul, but that     God will sustain and direct him in the Meeting and in all the     business that may subsequently come before him.     "The condition of heart and spirit in the D.O. at such times will     be instinctively felt by every Officer in the room before the     Meeting has been going on for a quarter of an hour, and this will     have far more influence--as has been remarked before--on his     Command than anything he may say or do. How important is it, then,     that he should be as Saul among the prophets--not only head and     shoulders above every one present as regards authority, but in the     possession of the wisdom and power of the Holy Ghost!"Chapter XXVIIIThe Spirit of The ArmyAs pointed out in the foregoing chapter, The General was always anxiousto make clear to all, and to avoid, the possibility of a continuance oforganisation and a routine of effort without the spirit in which thework has been begun. We could not better describe that spirit than hedid in the following address to his Officers gathered around him inLondon, in 1904.He pictured to them the idea of Seven Spirits sent out from Heaven topossess the soul of every Officer, and thus described the action of twoof them:--     "The Spirit of Life     "We begin with the good Spirit--the Spirit of Life. What did he     say? What were the words he brought to us from the Throne? Let me     repeat them: 'O Officers, Officers, I am one of the Seven Spirits     whom John saw. I travel up and down the earth on special errands of     mercy. I am come from Him that sitteth on the Throne, and reigneth     for ever and ever, to tell you that if you are going to succeed in     your life-and-death struggle for God and man, the first thing you     must possess, in all its full and rich maturity, is the Spirit of     Divine Life.'     "Now, before I go to the direct consideration of this message, let     me have a word or two about life itself     "Life, as you know, is the opposite principle to death. To be alive     is to possess an inward force capable of action without any outside     assistance. For instance: anything that has in it the principle by     which it is able to act in some way, independent of the will of any     other thing or creature outside of itself, may be said to be alive.     It has in it the principle of life.     "This principle of life is the mainspring and glory of God's     universe.     "We have it in different forms in this world. For instance: We have     material life. There is living and dead water, and there is living     and dead earth.     "Then there is vegetable life. In the fields, and woods, and     gardens, you have living trees, and flowers, and seeds.     "Then there is animal life. Only think of the variety, and     usefulness, and instinctive skill of unnumbered members of the     animal world.     "Then, rising higher in the scale of being, you have human life.     Every man, woman, and child posesses, as it were, a trinity of     existence; namely, physical life, mental life, and soul life; each     being a marvel in itself.     "Then, rising higher still, we have a life more important, and     bringing more glory to God than any of the other forms that I have     noticed, and that is _Spiritual Life_.     "On this Spiritual Life let me make one or two remarks.     "Spiritual Life is Divine in its origin. It is a creation of the     Holy Spirit. I need not dwell on this truth. Jesus Christ was at     great trouble to teach it. 'Marvel not,' He said, 'ye must be born     again. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is     born of the Spirit is spirit.' You have gone through this     experience yourselves. You must insist on it in your people.     Spiritual life proceeds from God. It can be obtained in no other     way.     "Spiritual Life not only proceeds from God, but partakes of the     nature of God.     "We see this principle, that the life imparted partakes of the     nature of the author of being that imparts it, illustrated around     us in every direction.     "The tree partakes of the nature of the tree from which it is     derived. The animal partakes of the nature of the creature that it     begets. The child partakes of the nature of its parents. So the     soul, born of God, will possess the nature of its Author. Its life     will be divine.     "This is a mystery. We cannot understand it, but the Apostle     distinctly affirms it when he says, the Son of God is a partaker of     the Divine nature.     "Spiritual Life, like all other life, carries with it the     particular powers belonging to its own nature.     "Every kind of life has its own particular powers--senses,     instincts, or whatever they may be called.     "Vegetable life has its powers, enabling it to draw nutrition out     of the ground.     "Fish life has power adapting it to an existence in the water.     "Animal life has powers or senses suitable to its sphere of     existence, such as seeing, hearing, tasting, and the like.     "Human life has faculties, emotions, loves and hatreds, suitable     to its manner of existence. And it has its own peculiar destiny. It     goes back to God, to be judged as to its conduct when its earthly     career terminates.     "And the Spiritual Life of which we are speaking has powers or     faculties necessary to the maintenance of its existence, and to the     discharge of the duties appropriate to the sphere in which it     moves. For instance: it has powers to draw from God the nourishment     it requires; it has powers to see or discern spiritual things; it     has powers to distinguish holy people; it has powers to love truth,     and to hate falsehood; it has powers to suffer and sacrifice for     the good of others. It has powers to know, and love, and glorify     its Maker.     "Those possessed of this Spiritual Life, like all other beings, act     according to their nature.     "For instance: the tree grows in the woods, and bears leaves and     fruit after its own nature. The bird flies in the air, builds its     nest, and sings its song after its own nature. The wild beasts roam     through the forest, and rage and devour according to their own     nature. If you are to make these or any other creatures act     differently, you must give them a different nature. By distorting     the tree, or training the animal, or clipping the wings of the     bird, you may make some trifling and temporary alteration in the     condition or conduct of these creatures; but when you have done     this, left to themselves, they will soon revert to their original     nature.     "By way of illustration. A menagerie recently paid a visit to a     northern town. Amongst the exhibits was a cage labelled 'The Happy     Family,' containing a lion, a tiger, a wolf, and a lamb. When the     keeper was asked confidentially how long a time these animals had     lived thus peacefully together, he answered, 'About ten months.     But,' said he, with a twinkle in his eye, 'the lamb has to be     renewed occasionally.'     "As with these forms of life, so with men and women and children.     The only way to secure conduct of a lasting character different     from its nature is by effecting a change in that nature. Make them     new creatures in Christ Jesus and you will have a Christlike life.     "The presence of the powers natural to Spiritual Life constitutes     the only true and sufficient evidence of its possession.     "The absence of these powers shows conclusively the absence of the     life. If a man does not love God and walk humbly with Him; if he     does not long after Holiness, love his comrades, and care for     souls, it will be satisfying evidence that he has gone back to the     old nature--that is, to spiritual death.     "All Spiritual Life is not only imparted by Jesus Christ, but     sustained by direct union with Him.     "'I am the Vine,' He says, 'ye are the branches; he that abideth in     Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without     Me ye can do nothing' (John xv. 6).     "Nothing will make up for the lack of this life.     "This, indeed, applies to every kind of existence. You cannot find     a substitute for life in the vegetable kingdom. Try the trees in     the garden. Look at that dead apple-tree. As you see it there, it     is useless, ugly, fruitless. What will make up for the absence of     life? Will the digging, or the manuring of the ground around it do     this? No! That will be all in vain. If it is dead, there is only     one remedy, and that is to give it life--new life.     "Take the animal world. What can you do to make up for the lack of     life in a dog? I read the other day of a lady who had a pet dog.     She loved it to distraction. It died. Whatever could she do with it     to make up for its loss of life? Well, she might have preserved it,     stuffed it, jewelled its eyes, and painted its skin. But had she     done so, these things would have been a disappointing substitute.     So she buried it, and committed suicide in her grief, and was     buried by its side.     "Take the loss of human life. What is the use of a dead man? Go to     the death-chamber. Look at that corpse. The loved ones are     distracted. What can they do? They may dress it, adorn it, appeal     to it. But all that human skill and effort can conceive will be in     vain. All that the broken hearts can say or do must soon terminate,     as did Abraham's mourning for Sarah, when he said, 'Give me a piece     of land that I may bury my dead out of my sight.' Nothing can make     up for the lack of life.     "But this is specially true of the Spiritual Life of which we are     speaking. Take this in its application to a Corps. If you want an     active, generous, fighting, dare-devil Corps, able and willing to     drive Hell before it, that Corps must be possessed, and that fully,     by this spirit of life. Nothing else can effectively take its     place. No education, learning, Bible knowledge, theology, social     amusements, or anything of the kind will be a satisfactory     substitute. The Corps that seeks to put any of these things in the     place of life will find them a mockery, a delusion, and a snare;     will find them to be only the wraps and trappings of death itself.     "And if it is so in the Corps, it is so ten thousand times more in     the Officer who commands that Corps--in you!     "Spiritual Life is the essential root of every other qualification     required by a Salvation Army Officer.     "With it he will be of unspeakable interest.     "He will be a pleasure to himself. There is an unspeakable joy in     having healthy, exuberant life.     "He will be of interest to those about him. Who cares about dead     things? Dead flowers--throw them out. Dead animals--eat them. Dead     men--bury them. Dead and dying Officers--take them away. Give them     another Corps.     "If he is living he will be of interest to all about him. Men with     humble abilities, if full of this Spiritual Life, will be a charm     and a blessing wherever they go. Look at the lives and writings of     such humble men as Billy Bray, Carvosso, and Hodgson Casson. Their     memory is an ointment poured forth to-day after long years have     passed away.     "Without this life an Officer will be of no manner of use. No     matter how he may be educated or talented, without life is to be     without love; and to be without love, the Apostle tells us, is to     be only as 'a sounding brass.' But it is not that of which I want     to speak just now.     "Spiritual Life is essential to the preservation of life.     "The first thing life does for its possessor is to lead him to look     after its own protection. When the principle of life is strong, you     will have health and longevity. When it is weak, you have disease.     When it is extinct, you have decay and rottenness.     "Only vigorous Spiritual Life will enable a Salvation Army Officer     to effectually discharge the duties connected with his position.     "Life is favorable to activity. It is so with all life. Go into the     tropical forests, and see the exuberant growth of everything there.     Look at the foliage, the blossom, the fruit. Look at the reptiles     crawling at your feet, and take care they do not sting you. Look at     the birds chattering and fluttering on the trees, and they will     charm you. Look at the animals roving through the woods, and take     care they do not devour you.     "Contrast all this movement with the empty, barren, silent, Polar     regions, or the dreary, treeless sands of the African desert.     "Go and look at the overflowing, tirelss activity of the children.     Why are they never still? It is the life that is in them. Go to the     man at work. With what glee, and for what a trifling remuneration,     he sweats, and lifts and carries the ponderous weights. Go to the     soldier in the military war. How he shouts and sings as he marches     to deprivations, and wounds, and death.     "Even so with Spiritual Life. It never rests; it never tires; it     always sees something great to do, and is always ready to undertake     it. What is the explanation? How can we account for it? The answer     is, Life--abundant life.     "It is only by the possession of Life that The Salvation Army     Officer can spread this life.     "That is, reproduce himself, multiply himself, or his kind. This     reproduction or multiplication of itself is a characteristic of all     life.     "Take the vegetable kingdom. Every living plant has life-producing     seed, or some method of reproducing itself. The thistle: who can     count the number of plants that one thistle can produce in a year?     One hundred strawberry plants can be made in ten years to produce     more than a thousand million other strawberry plants!     "Take the animal kingdom. Here each living creature has this     reproductive power. They say that a pair of sparrows would in ten     years, if all their progeny could be preserved, produce as many     birds as there are people on the earth--that is, 1,500,000,000. 'Ye     are of more value than many sparrows.'     "Just so, this Spiritual Life is intended to spread itself through     the world.     "It is to this end it is given to you. God's command to Adam was,     'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.' How much more     does this command apply to you and to me! You are to be progenitors     of a world of men and women possessed of Spiritual Life; the     parents of a race of angels. How this is to be done is another     question. About that I shall have something to say as we go along.     For the moment, I am simply occupied with the fact that you have to     call this world of holy beings into existence by spreading this     life.     "Every Officer here is located in a world of death. Sometimes we     style it a dying world, and so it is on its human side, but on its     spiritual side it is past dying; it is dead. By that I do not mean     that the spiritual nature, that is the soul, ever ceases to be in     any man. That will never come to pass. Perhaps nothing once created     will ever cease to be. Anyway, man is immortal. The soul can never     die. Neither do I mean that there is no Spiritual Life.     "By spiritual death we mean that the soul is--Separated from God;     no union with Him. In a blind man the organ may be perfect, but not     connected.     "Inactive. No love for the things God loves. No hatred for the     things He hates. Dead to His interests, His kingdom; dead to Him.     "Corrupt, bad, devilish, etc. What a valley of dry bones the world     appears to the man whose eyes have been opened to see the truth of     things. Verily, verily, it is one great cemetery crowded with men,     women, and children dead in trespasses and sin. Look for a moment     at this graveyard, in which the men around you may be said to lie     with their hearts all dead and cold to Christ, and all that     concerns their Salvation. Look at it. The men and women and     children in your town are buried there. The men and women in your     city, in your street. Nay, the very people who come to your Hall to     hear you talk on a Sunday night are there. There they lie. Let us     read the inscriptions on some of their tombs:--     "_Here lies Tom Jones_     "He had a beautiful nature, and a young, virtuous wife, and some     beautiful children. All starved and wretched through their father's     selfish ways. He can't help himself. He says so. He has proved it.     He is dead in drunkenness.     "_Here lies Harry Please-Yourself_     "Mad on footballing, theatres, music-halls, dances, and the like.     Nothing else morning, noon, or night seems to interest him. There     he is, dead in pleasure.     "_Here lies James Haughtiness_     "Full of high notions about his abilities, or his knowledge, or his     family, or his house, or his fortune, or his business, or his dogs,     or something. There he is, dead in pride.     "_Here lies Jane Featherhead_     "Absorbed in her hats, and gowns, and ribbons, and companions, and     attainments. There she is, dead in vanity.     "_Here lies Miser Graspall_     "Taken up with his money--sovereigns, dollars, francs, kroner,     much or little. 'Let me have more and more' is his dream, and his     cry, and his aim, by night and day. There he is, dead in     covetousness.     "_Here lies Sceptical Doubtall_     "Hunting through the world of nature, and revolution, and     providence, and specially through the dirty world of his own dark     little heart, for arguments against God and Christ and Heaven.     There he is, dead in infidelity.     "_Here lies Jeremiah Make-Believe_     "With his Bible Class and Singing Choir, and Sunday religion, and     heartless indifference to the Salvation or damnation of the     perishing crowds at his door. There he is, dead in formality.     "_Here lies Surly Badblood_     "Packed full of suspicions and utter disregards for the happiness     and feelings of his wife, family, neighbours, or friends. There he     is, dead in bad tempers.     "_Here lies Dives Enjoy-Yourself_     "Look at his marble tomb, and golden coffin, and embroidered     shroud, and ermine robes. This is a man whose every earthly want is     supplied--Carriages, music, friends. There he is, dead in luxury.     "_Here lies Dick Never-Fear_     "His mouth is filled with laughter, and his heart with contempt     when you speak to him about his soul. He has no anxiety, not he.     He'll come off all right, never fear. Is not God merciful? And did     not Christ die? And did not his mother pray? Don't be alarmed, God     won't hurt him. There he is, dead in presumption,     "_Here lies Judas Renegade_     "His grave has a desolate look. The thorns and thistles grow over     it. The occupant has money and worldly friends, and many other     things, but altogether he gets no satisfaction out of them; he is     uneasy all the time. There he is, dead in apostacy.     "There are any number of other graves. It is interesting, although     painful, to wander amongst them. All, or nearly all, their     occupants are held down by a heavy weight of ignorance, a sense of     utter helplessness. And all are bound hand and foot with chains of     lust, or passion, or procrastination, of their own forging. In the     midst of these graves you live, and move, and have your being.     "What is your duty here? Oh, that you realised your true business     in this region of death! Having eyes, Oh! that you could see.     Having ears, Oh! that you could hear. Having hearts, Oh! that you     could feel. What are you going to do with this graveyard? Walk     about it in heartless unconcern, or with no higher feeling than     gratitude for having been made alive yourselves? Or will you     content yourselves with strolling through it, taxing its poor     occupants for your living while leaving them quietly in their tombs     as hopeless as you found them? Heaven forbid! Well, then, what do     you propose? What will you do?     "Look after their bodies, and feed and nourish them, making the     graveyard as comfortable a resting-place as you can? That is good,     so far as it goes, but that is not very far. Will that content you?     Decorate their graves with flowers and evergreens, and wreaths of     pleasant things? Will that content you? Amuse them with your music,     or the singing of your songs, or the letting off of your oratorical     fireworks among their rotting corpses? Will that content you?     Instruct them in doctrines, and rescues, and Salvations in which     they have no share? Will that content you? No! No! No! A thousand     times no! You won't be content with all that. God has sent you into     this dark valley for nothing less than to raise these doom-struck     creatures from the dead. That is your mission. To stop short of     this will be a disastrous and everlasting calamity.     "What do you say? It cannot be done? That is false. God would never     have set you an impossible task. You cannot do it? That is false     again, for you have done it before again and again. There is not an     Officer here who has not called some souls from the dead. Not one.     How many thousands--how many tens of thousands, in the aggregate,     have the Officers present at this Congress raised from the graves     of iniquity? Who can tell?     "Go, and do it again. Go, and look at them. Go, and compassionate     them. Go, and represent Jesus Christ to them. Go, and prophesy to     them. Go, and believe for them. And then shall bone come to bone,     and there shall be a great noise, and a great Army shall stand up     to live, and fight, and die for the living God.     "THE SPIRIT OF PURITY     "And now we come to the consideration of the message of the second     Spirit. Let us recall his words: 'O Officers, Officers, the Great     Father has sent me to tell you that if you would be successful in     your campaign against wickedness, selfishness, and fiends, you must     yourselves be holy.'     "I come now to the task of showing, as far as I am able, what the     plan of life is which God has formed for a Salvation Army Officer.     "What must an Officer be and do who wants satisfactorily to fill up     the plan God has formed for him? Of course, there will in some     respects be certain striking differences in that plan. But in the     main there will be remarkable resemblances.     "The first thing that God asks is, that the Officer shall possess     the character He approves.     "You might say the character that He admires. The very essence of     that character is expressed in one word--_Holiness_.     "In the list of qualifications for effective leadership in this     warfare, The Salvation Army has ever placed Holiness in the first     rank. The Army has said, and says to-day, that no other qualities     or abilities can take its place. No learning, or knowledge, or     talking, or singing, or scheming, or any other gift will make up     for the absence of this. You must be good if you are to be a     successful Officer in The Salvation Army.     "Let us suppose that a comrade were to present himself before us     this morning, and say, 'I am a Salvationist. I want to be an     Officer amongst you, and I want to be an Officer after God's own     Heart; but I am ignorant of the qualifications needed.' If I were     to ask you what I should say to this brother, I know what your     answer would be. You would say, with one voice, 'Tell him that,     before all else, he must be a holy man.'     "Suppose, further, that I appeared before you myself for the first     time at this Congress, and were to say to you: 'My comrades, I have     come to be your Leader. What is the first, the foundation quality I     require for your leadership?' I know the answer you would give me.     You would say, 'O General, you must be a holy man.'     "If there were gathered before me, in some mighty building, the     choicest spirits now fighting in The Salvation Army the world     over--Commissioners and Staff Officers, Field Officers and Local     Officers, together with Soldiers of every grade and class; and     suppose, further, that standing out before that crowd, I was to     propose the question: 'In what position in our qualifications shall     I place the blessing of Holiness?' you know what the answer would     be. With a voice that would be heard among the multitudes in Heaven     the crowd would answer: 'Holiness must be in the first rank.'     "If this morning I had the privilege of ascending to the Celestial     City, and asking the assembled angels in that mighty temple where,     day and night, they worship the Great Jehovah: 'What position ought     Holiness to occupy in the qualifications needed by Salvation Army     Officers in their fight on earth?' you know that angels and     archangels, cherubim and seraphim, would join with the Seven     Spirits that are before the Throne with one united shout, loud     enough to make the ears of Gabriel tingle, and would answer, 'Place     it first.'     "If I could have the still greater privilege of kneeling before the     intercessory Throne of my dear, my precious, my glorified Saviour,     and of asking Him what position this truth should hold in the     hearts and efforts of Salvation Army Officers, you know that He     would answer: 'Blessed are the pure in heart.' Holiness comes     first.     "If, further still, borne on a burning seraph's wings I could rise     to the Heaven of Heavens, and, like its holy inhabitants, be     allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, where Jehovah especially     manifests His glory; and if, prostrate before that Throne, with all     reverence I should ask the question: 'What is the first and most     important qualification a Salvation Army Officer must possess in     order to do Your Blessed Will?' you have His answer already. You     know that He would reply: 'Be ye holy, for I am holy.'     "What, then, is that Holiness which constitutes the first     qualification of an Officer, and which is asked for by that Blessed     Spirit of Purity coming from the Throne of God?     "In replying to this question I cannot hope to do more than put you     in remembrance of what you must already know.     "I will, however, to begin with, take the broad ground that     Holiness, in the sense in which The Salvation Army uses the word,     means entire deliverance from sin. I shall explain myself as I go     along. But I begin with the assertion that holy souls are saved     from sin.     "You all know what sin is. And it is important that you should, and     that you should be able to define it at a moment's notice to     whomsoever may inquire. John says: 'All unrighteousness is sin,'     That is, everything that a man sees to be actually wrong, that to     him is sin. Whether the wrong be an outward act, or an inward     thought, or a secret purpose does not affect its character. If the     act, or thought, or purpose is wrong to that particular soul it is     sin. Whether the wrong be done in public and blazoned abroad before     the world as such, or whether it be committed in darkness and     secrecy, where no human eye can follow it, matters not; it is sin.     "To be holy, I say, is to be delivered from the commission of sin.     Is not that blessed?     "To be holy is to be delivered from the penalty of sin. 'The wages     of sin is death.' Holy men are fully and freely forgiven. One of     the evidences of the possession of Holiness is the full assurance     of that deliverance. Salvation from doubt as to this. Is not that     blessed?     "Holiness includes deliverance from the guilt of sin.     "Sin has a retributive power. At the moment of commission it     implants a sting in the conscience which, in the impenitent man,     lights a flame, which, without the application of the Precious     Blood, is never extinguished. In Holiness the sting is extracted,     and the fire is quenched. Is not that blessed?     "Holiness supposes deliverance from the defilement of sin.     "Sin pollutes the imagination, defiles the memory, and is a     filth-creating leaven, which, unless purged away, ultimately     corrupts and rots the whole being.     "In Holiness all the filth is cleansed away. The soul is washed in     the Blood of the Lamb. This is the reason for so much being said in     the Bible, and in the experience of entirely sanctified people,     about purity of heart. Is not that blessed?     "Holiness means complete deliverance from the bondage of sin.     "Every time a sin is committed, the inclination to do the same     again is encouraged, and those habits which belong to the evil     nature are strengthened until they assume the mastery of the soul,     and the soul comes more and more under the tyranny of evil.     "In conversion the chains that bind men to sin are broken, but the     tendency to evil still lingers behind. In Holiness the bondage is     not only entirely destroyed, and the soul completely delivered from     these evil tendencies, but is free to do the will of God, so far as     it is known, as really as it is done in Heaven. Is not that     blessed?     "Holiness supposes the deliverance of the soul from the rule and     reign of selfishness.     "The essence of sin is selfishness; that is, the unreasoning,     improper love of self. The essence of Holiness is benevolence. Holy     souls are mastered by love, filled with love. Is not that blessed?     "It will be seen, then, that the Officer who enjoys this experience     of Holiness will have received power from God to live a life     consciously separated from sin.     "A man cannot be living in a God-pleasing state if he is knowingly     living in sin, or consenting to it, which amounts to the same     thing. Let us look a little more closely at this.     "Holiness will mean a present separation from all that is openly or     secretly untrue.     "Any one pretending to be doing the will of God, while acting     untruthfully or deceitfully in his dealings with those around him,     is not only guilty of falsehood, but of hypocrisy.     "To be holy is to be sincere.     "Holiness means separation from all open and secret dishonesty.     This applies to everything like defrauding another of that which is     his just and lawful due.     "Holiness also means separation from all that is unjust.     "Doing unto others as you would that they should do to you, may be     truly described as one of the lovely flowers and fruits of Purity.     "Holiness means Salvation from all neglect of duty to God and man.     "All pretensions to Holiness are vain while the soul is living in     the conscious neglect of duty. A holy Officer will do his duty to     his Maker. He will love God with all his heart--such a heart as he     has, big or little. He will love and worship Him, and strive to     please Him in all that he does. A holy Officer will love his     neighbour as himself. The law of love will govern his dealings with     his family, comrades, neighbours--body and soul.     "That is a beautiful experience which I am describing, is it not,     my comrades? And you cannot be surprised that the Spirit of Purity     should bring you the message that it is God's plan of life for you.     "Upon it let me make a few further remarks.     "Holiness is a distinct definite state; a man can be in it or out     of it.     "Holiness is enjoyed partially or entirely by all converted people.     It can be enjoyed partially. No one would say that every converted     man was a holy man, and no one would say that every man who was not     perfectly holy was not converted. But I should say, and so would     you, that every truly converted man is the master of sin, although     he may not be entirely delivered from it.     "Then, again, Holiness is a continued growth in sincere souls. With     faith, watchfulness, prayer, and obedience, the power of sin     diminishes as the days pass along, and the strength of Holiness     increases.     "The line which separates a state of entire from a state of partial     Holiness may be approached very gradually, but there is a moment     when it is crossed.     "The approach of death is often all but imperceptible, but there is     a moment when the last breath is drawn. Just so there is a moment     when the body of sin is destroyed, however gradual the process may     have been by which that state has been reached. There is a moment     when the soul becomes entirely holy--entirely God's.     "By perseverance in the sanctified life spiritual manhood is     reached, and the soul is perfected in love; that is maturity.     "Let me illustrate the doctrine of Holiness, in its varied aspects,     by comparing its attainment to the ascent of a lofty mountain.     "Come with me. Yonder is the sacred mount, towering far above the     clouds and fogs of sin and selfishness. Around its base, stretching     into the distance, as far as eye can reach, lies a flat, dismal,     swampy country. The district is thickly populated by a people who,     while professing the enjoyment of religion, are swallowed up in     unreality about everything that appertains to Salvation. They talk,     and sing, and pray, and write, and read about it, but they are all     more or less in doubt whether they have any individual part or lot     in the matter. Sometimes they think they have a hope of Heaven, but     more frequently they are afraid that their very hopes are a     delusion.     "The land is haunted by troubling spirits continually coming and     going, that point to past misdoings and coming penalties. Such     venomous creatures as hatreds, revenges, lusts, and other evil     passions are rife in every direction; while the demons of doubt and     despair seem to come and go of their own free will, leading men and     women on the one hand to indifference, worldliness, and infidelity,     and on the other to darkness and despair. This wild, dismal     territory we will style 'The Land of Uncertainty.'     "In the centre of this unlovable and undesirable country the     mountain of which I want to speak lifts its lofty head. Call it     'Mount Pisgah' or 'Mount Beulah,' or, if you will, call it 'Mount     Purity'--I like that term the best. But whatever you name it, there     it is, rising up above the clouds and fogs of sin and selfishness,     and doubt and fear and condemnation that ever overhang the swampy     Land of Uncertainty, of which I have given you a glimpse.     "Look at it. There are some monster mountains in the natural world,     but they are mere molehills alongside this giant height. Look at it     again. Is it not an entrancing sight? Its lofty brow, crowned with     a halo of glorious light, reaches far upwards towards the gates of     endless day, those living on its summit having glorious glimpses of     the towers and palaces of the Celestial City. The atmosphere is     eminently promotive of vigorous health and lively spirits. But its     chief claim is the purity of heart, the constant faith, the loving     nature, and the consecrated, self-sacrificing devotion of those who     are privileged to dwell there. It must be a charming place. The     multitudes whose feet have ever been permitted to tread its blessed     heights think so.     "But while gazing on the entrancing sight, the question     spontaneously arises: 'How can I get there?' There is evidently no     mountain railway nor elevator on which, while reclining on pillows     of ease, and serenaded by music and song, you can be rapidly and     smoothly lifted up to the blessed summit. Those who reach that     heavenly height must climb what the Bible calls the 'Highway of     Holiness.' And they will usually find it a rugged, difficult     journey, often having to fight every inch of the way. But, once on     the celestial summit, the travellers will feel amply repaid for     every atom of trouble and toil involved in the ascent.     "The road to this glorious height passes through various plateaux     or stages which run all round the sides of the mountain, each     different from the other, and each higher than the one that     preceded it. Travellers to the summit have to pass through each of     these stages. Let me enumerate some of the chief among them.     "To begin with, there is the awakening stage, where the climbers     obtain their first fair view of this holy hill.     "It is here that the desire to make the ascent first breaks out.     This longing is often awakened by reading various guide-books or     Holiness advertisements, such as _The War Cry_, or _Perfect Love_,     which set forth the blessedness experienced by those who make the     heavenly ascent. Sometimes the desire to ascend the holy hill is     awakened by the pure light which every now and then shines from the     summit direct into the travellers' hearts. Or, it may be their     souls are set on fire with a holy longing to be emptied of sin and     filled with love by the burning testimonies of some of the people     who live up there, but who come down into the valley every now and     then to persuade their comrades to make the ascent. Anyway, it     almost always happens when those who read these guide-books and     listen to these testimonies begin to search their Bibles and cry to     God for guidance, that a spirit of hunger and thirst sets in which     gives them no rest until they themselves resolve to take the     journey up the side of this wonderful mountain.     "A little higher up, and you reach the starting stage.     "Here those who fully resolve upon seeking holiness of heart first     enter their names in the 'Travellers' Book.' On this plateau I     observe that there is a great deal of prayer. You can hear the     earnest petitions going up to Heaven, whichever way you turn. And,     much prayer as there is, you can hear much singing also. One of the     favourite songs  commences:--        "O glorious hope of perfect love!        It lifts me up to things above,          It bears on eagles' wings;        It gives my ravished soul a taste,        And makes me for some moments feast          With Jesus' priests and kings.     "There is another favourite song which  begins:--        "O joyful sound of Gospel grace!          Christ shall in me appear;        I, even I, shall see His face,          I shall be holy here.     "But, still ascending, we come to the wrestling stage.     "Here the travellers are met by numerous enemies, who are in dead     opposition to their ever reaching the summit.     "I observe that the enemies attack those travellers with doubts as     to the possibility of ever reaching the mountain's top, and with     scores of questions about apparently conflicting passages of     Scripture, and contradictory experiences of Christian people; and,     alas! with only too frequent success, for the whole plateau seems     to be strewn with the records of broken resolutions relating to the     renouncements of evil habits, tempting companions, and deluding     indulgences.     "And I observe that lying about are many unfulfilled consecrations     relating to friends, and money, and children, and time, and other     things; in fact, this stage seems to be a strange mixture of faith     and unbelief; so much so that it is difficult to believe that we     are on the slopes of Mount Purity at all.     "Here you will find posted on the sides of the rocks in all     directions placards bearing the words: 'The things I would do those     I do not, and the things I would not do those I do, and there is no     spiritual health in me.' And up and down you will also see     notice-boards warning would-be travellers not to climb any higher     for fear they should fall again.     "But, thank God, while many chicken-hearted souls lie down in     despair on this plateau, or retrace their steps to the dreary     regions below, others declare that there is no necessity for     failure. These push forward in the upward ascent, singing as they     go:--        "Though earth and hell the world gainsay,          The word of God can never fail;        The Lamb shall take my sins away,          'Tis certain, though impossible;        The thing impossible shall be,        All things are possible to me.     "So, persevering with our journey, higher up, very much higher up,     we come to the sin-mastering stage.     "This is a glorious plateau. All who enter it do so by the narrow     passage of repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus     Christ; receiving in their souls, as they pass the threshold, the     delightful assurance of full and free forgiveness through the Blood     of the Lamb.     "Here men and women walk with heads erect in holy confidence, and     hearts glad with living faith, and mouths full of joyous song, and     eyes steadily fixed on the holy light that streams from the summit     of the mount above them. That holy beacon guide is ever calling on     them to continue their journey, and ever directing them on the way.     "Those who have reached this stage have already made great and     encouraging progress; for God has made them conquerors over their     inward foes. The rule and reign of pride and malice, envy and lust,     covetousness and sensuality, and every other evil thing have come     to an end.     "They triumph on that account, but the conflict is not yet ended.     Sometimes the battling is very severe; but with patient, plodding     faith they persevere in the ascent, singing as they  go:--        "Faith, mighty faith, the promise sees,          And looks to that alone;        Laughs at impossibilities,          And cries, 'It shall be done!'     "And now, close at hand, is the stage of deliverance, where the     triumph is begun.     "And now, ten thousand Hallelujahs! let it be known to all the     world around, that once on this plateau the separation from sin is     entire; the heart is fully cleansed from evil; the promise is     proved to be true, 'They that hunger and thirst after righteousness     shall be filled.'     "At a great Christian Conference the other day an eminent divine     said that The Salvation Army believed in a 'perfect sinner,' but     that he believed in a 'perfect Saviour.' This, I contend, was a     separation of what God has joined together and which never ought to     be put asunder. For, glory be to the Father, glory be to the Son,     and glory be to the Holy Ghost, The Salvation Army believes, with     its Lord, that a perfect Saviour can make a poor sinner into a     perfect saint. That is, He can enable him to fulfil His own     command, in which He says: 'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your     Father which is in Heaven is perfect.' (_Matthew_ v. 48.)     "But there is one plateau higher still which, like a tableland,     covers the entire summit of the mountain, and that the maturity     stage.     "Here the graces of the Spirit have been perfected experience, and     faith, and obedience, and the soul does the will of God as it is     done in Heaven, united in the eternal companionship of that lovely     being--the Spirit of Purity.     "What do you say to my holy mountain, my comrades?     "Are you living up there? Have you climbed as near to Heaven as     that represents? If not, I want to make a declaration which you     have often heard before, but which it will do you no harm to hear     again, namely, that it is the will of God that you should not only     reach the very summit, but that you should abide there.     "Do you ask why God wills that you should reach and abide on this     holy mountain?     "I reply it is the will of God that you and I, and every other     Officer in this blessed Army, should be holy for His own     satisfaction.     "God finds pleasure in holy men and holy women. We know what it is     to find pleasure in kindred companions. It is to like to be near     them. To want to live with them, or have them to live with us. It     is to be willing to travel any distance, or put ourselves to any     inconvenience to reach them. According to the Bible, that is just     how God feels towards His faithful people. He finds satisfaction in     their doings, and praying, and worship, and song. But when there is     unfaithfulness or sin of any kind this pleasure is sadly marred, if     not altogether destroyed. In such cases the pleasure is turned to     pain, the satisfaction to loathing, and the love to hatred.     "Hear what He says of Israel: 'In all their affliction He was     afflicted, and the angel of His presence saved them; in His love     and in His pity He bare them, and carried them all the days of     old.' If for no other reason than the pleasure it will give to God,     don't you think every Officer should, with all his might, seek for     Holiness of heart and life?     "Another reason why God wants you to live on that blessed mountain     is the interest He feels in your welfare.     "He loves you. He has told you so again and again. He has proved     His love by His deeds. Love compels the being entertaining the     affection to seek the good of its object. He knows that sin is the     enemy of your peace, and must mean misery here and hereafter. For     this reason among others, He wants to deliver you from it.     "You will remember that by the lips of Peter God told the Jews that     He had raised up His Son Jesus, and sent Him to bless them by     turning every one of them away from his iniquities. That applies     to you, my comrades. You have heard it before; I tell it you again.     Holiness is the royal road to peace, contentment, and joy for you.     The love God bears you, therefore, makes Him ceaselessly long after     your Holiness of heart and life. Will you not let Him have His way?     Will you not do His Will?     "God wants every Officer to be holy, in order that through him He     may be able to pour His Holy Spirit upon the people to whom that     Officer ministers.     "The men and women around you are in the dark. Oh, how ignorant     they are of God and everlasting things! They cannot see the vile     nature of the evil, and the foul character of the fiends that tempt     and rule them. They do not see the black ruin that lies before     them. So on they go, the blind leading the blind, till over the     precipice they fall together. God wants their eyes to be opened.     The Spirit can do the work, and through you He wants to pour the     light.     "The men and women around you are weak. They cannot stand up     against their own perverted appetites, the charms of the world, or     the devices of the Devil. God wants to pour the Spirit of Power     upon this helpless crowd. But He wants holy people through whom He     can convey that strength. He works His miracles by clean people.     That is His rule.     "There is nothing in the work of the early Apostles more wonderful     than the miraculous manner in which they went about breathing the     Spirit of Life and Light and Power on the people. But they were     fully consecrated, Blood-and-Fire men and women.     "What do you say, my comrades? Will you be holy mediums? Do you not     answer, 'Thy will be done'?     "God wants you to be holy, in order that you may reveal Him to the     world by your example.     "Men do not believe in God--that is, the real God--the God of the     Bible; and they do not believe in Him, because they do not know     Him.     "He seeks to reveal Himself to men in various ways. He reveals     Himself through the marvels of the natural world; and many say they     can see God in the sun, and stars, and seas, and trees. He reveals     Himself by speaking to men in their own hearts, and many hear His     whisperings there. He reveals Himself in His own Book, and some     read and ascertain what is His mind there.     "But, alas! the great multitude are like children. They require to     see and hear God revealed before their very eyes in visible and     practical form before they will believe. And to reach these crowds,     God wants men and women to walk about the world so that those     around, believers and unbelievers alike, shall see the form and     hear the voice of the living God; people who shall be so like Him     in spirit, and life, and character as to make the crowds feel as     though the very shadow of God had crossed their path. Will you be a     shadow of God?     "God wants you to be holy, in order that you may know what His mind     is about the world, and about your work in it.     "He entertains certain opinions and feelings with respect to it. He     has His own plan for saving it. He wants to reveal to you what     those opinions and feelings are, and to do this so far as it will     be good for you and those about you. He wants you to know how you     can best fight devils, convict sinners, save souls, and bless the     world.     "You can have this wonderful knowledge. Paul had it. He said 'We,'     that is, I, 'have the mind of Christ.' God is no respecter of     persons. He is as willing to reveal His mind to you, so far as you     need it, as He was to reveal it to Paul.     "But to possess this knowledge you must be holy. Sin darkens the     understanding, and hinders the perception of truth. A grain of sand     in the eye will prevent you seeing the most beautiful landscape in     the universe, or the dearest friends you have. It is with the heart     that men see divine things, and an atom of sin will darken the     brightest vision that can come before you. With a pure heart you     can not only see God's truth, but God Himself. Oh, God wants to     reveal Himself to you. Will you let Him? But if He is to do so, you     must have a clean heart.     "It is God's will that you should be holy, because He wants you to     be men and women of courage.     "Courage is the most valuable quality in this War. There are few     gifts of greater importance. Only think what it has enabled the     Prophets, the Apostles, and the Salvation leaders of modern times     to accomplish! How it covered Moses, and Joshua, and David, and     Daniel, and Paul, and a crowd of others with glory, and enabled     them to conquer men, and devils, and difficulties of all kinds. I     shall have something more to say about this before I have done.     "Courage and Holiness are linked closely together. You cannot have     one without the other. Sin is the very essence of weakness. A     little selfishness, a little insincerity, a little of anything that     is evil means condemnation, and loss of courage, which means     cowardice and failure.     "'The wicked flee when no man pursueth.' Double-minded people are     uncertain, fickle, unreliable in all their ways. 'The righteous are     bold as a lion.' Remember Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego.     "God wants you to be holy, in order that He may do mighty works     through your instrumentality.     "I verily believe that His arm is held back from working wonders     through the agency of many Officers, because He sees that such     success would be their ruin. The spirit of Nebuchadnezzar is in     them. He cannot build Babylon, or London, or New York, or anything     else by their instrumentality, because He sees it would create the     spirit of vainglory and boasting, or of ambition; make them     dissatisfied with their position; or otherwise curse them and those     about them. Look at Saul. What a lesson his history has in it for     us all. 'When thou wast little in thine own sight wast thou not     made the head of the Tribes of Israel? and the Lord anointed thee     king over Israel.'     "Now, I may be asked whether some Officers do not fail to reach the     higher ranges of the experience I have here described, and the     reasons for this.     "To this question I reply that I am afraid that it is only too true     that some Officers are to be found who are willing to dwell in the     land of uncertainty and feebleness. They are the slaves of habits     they condemn in others. Their example is marred, their powers are     weakened for their work, and, instead of going onward and upward to     the victory they believe so gloriously possible, they are a     disappointment to themselves, to God, and to their leaders.     "If I am asked to name the reasons for their neglect of this     glorious privilege, I would say:--     "They have doubts about the possibility of living this life of     Holiness.     "They think there is some fatal necessity laid upon them to sin--at     least a little, or just now and then. They think that God cannot,     or that He will not, or that He has not arranged to save them     altogether from their inward evils. They know that the Bible says,     over and over again, in a thousand different ways, that the Blood     of Jesus Christ cleanses from all sin; and they read God's promise     again and again, that He will pour out His Spirit upon them, to     save them from all their idols and filthiness; but they doubt     whether it is strictly true, or anyway, whether it applies to them.     And so, tossed to and fro by doubts about this holy experience, no     wonder that they do not seek to realise it in their own hearts.     "Other Officers are kept back from climbing this mountain by the     idea that the experience is not possible for them.     "They say, 'Oh, yes, it is good, it is beautiful. I wish I lived up     there. How delightful it must be to have peace flow like a river,     and righteousness abound as the waves of the sea, and to be filled     with the Spirit! But such a life is not for me.' They admit the     possibility of Holiness in those about them, and occasionally they     push it on their acceptance; but they fancy that there is something     about their own case that makes it impossible, or, at least,     overwhelmingly difficult, for them to attain it.     "They imagine that there is something in their nature that makes it     peculiarly difficult for them to be holy. Some peculiar twist in     their minds. Some disagreeable disposition. Some bad, awkward     temper. Some unbelieving tendency. Or, they are hindered by     something that they suppose to be specially unfavourable in their     circumstances--their family. Or, there is something in their     history that they think is opposed to their living pure lives--they     have failed in their past efforts, etc.     "Anyway, there is, they imagine, some insurmountable obstacle to     their walking with Christ in white, and, instead of striking out     for the summit of the Holy Mountain in desperate and determined     search, relying on God's word that all things are possible to him     that believeth, they give up, and settle down to the notion that     Holiness of heart and life is not for them.     "Then, other Officers do not reach this experience because they do     not seek it; that is, they do not seek it with all their hearts.     "They do not climb.     "They know that their Bible most emphatically asserts that those     who seek heavenly blessings shall find them. No passage is more     familiar to their minds or much more frequently on their lips, than     the one spoken by Jesus Christ: 'Seek, and ye shall find.' And they     condemn the poor sinner who lies rotting in the sins which will     carry him to Hell, because he won't put forth a little effort to     find deliverance. And yet, do not some Officers act very much after     the same fashion with respect to this blessing?     "In their efforts they are truly sincere, but they are not much     more forward for them. They say 'It is not for me,' and settle down     as they were.     "The reason for this is not that the promise is not to them. But it     is because they have not been thorough in their surrender; or     because they have been wanting in their belief; or because they do     not persevere; or because they have been mistaken in some past     experience:--     "Another reason why Officers do not find the blessing is the simple     fact that they will not pay the price.     "There is something they will not do; or there is something they     will do; or there is something they will not part with; there is     some doubtful thing that they will not give up. The sacrifice is     too great. They think they would not be happy, or some one else     would not be happy, or something would not be satisfactory; and so     they look and look at the mountain, and long and long, but that is     all. They would like to be there, but the price is too great.     "Another reason why Officers fail is neither more nor less than     their want of faith.     "This, with sincere souls, is by far the most common hindrance. I     have something to say about faith further on.     "And, doubtless, the reason that some Officers fail to reach the     upper levels of Mount Purity arises out of their mistaken views as     to the nature of this experience.     "You have so often heard me dwell on this view of the subject that     I despair of saying anything fresh that will help you. But, knowing     that I am on ground where truly sincere souls are often hindered, I     will make one or two remarks:--     "I have no doubt that many fail here by confounding temptation with     sin.     "They pray--they consecrate--they believe that they receive, and     they rejoice. But by and by, when bad thoughts are suggested to     their minds, they say to themselves, 'Oh, I can't be saved from     sin, or I would not have all those wicked thoughts and suggestions     streaming through my soul."     "They confound temptation with sin. Whatever they may say about it,     they do not see the difference existing between temptation and sin.     "Some Officers are hindered in the fight for Holiness by supposing     that purity will deliver them from serious depression, low spirits,     and the like.     "With many sincere souls I have no doubt that one of the most     serious hindrances in this strife is the confounding of Holiness     with happiness, and thinking that if they are holy they will be     happy all the time; whereas the Master Himself was a Man of     Sorrows, and lived, more or less, a life of grief.     "Then there comes the last reason I shall notice, and that is the     want of perseverance. There are some Officers who have been up the     mountain--part of the way, at any rate, if not to the top. But     through disobedience, or want of faith, they have no longer the     experience they once enjoyed.     "The condition. You say to sinners that they are never to give up.     I do, at least. So with those who are seeking Holiness. They must     persevere or they will never find it."Chapter XXVIIIThe General as a WriterNone of us have yet any idea how voluminous a writer The General was,because so much of his writing was in the form of contributions to ourmany publications, or of letters to Officers.We can only insert here a few, specimens of what he wrote at variousdates, and remark that in private letters there was always the very sameflow of happy earnest life, the same high ideal as finds expression inthe following extracts. In his _Orders and Regulations for FieldOfficers_ he says:--     "It must always be remembered by the Field Officer, and by every     one who is desirous of producing any great moral or spiritual     changes in men, that the example of the individual attempting this     task will be much more powerful than the doctrines they set forth,     or any particular methods they adopt for teaching those doctrines,     however impressive these may be.     "The correctness of this statement has been proved over and over     again in this Salvation War. Everywhere the people measure the     truth and importance of what the Field Officer says by their     estimate of his character. If he produces the impression in their     minds that he is a mere talker or performer, they may listen to his     message, and--if he has more than ordinary ability--treat him with     a degree of respect; but if this be all, he will be next to     powerless in effecting any great change in their hearts and lives.     On the other hand, where the life of the Field Officer convinces     his Soldiers that he is himself what he wants them to be, truly     devoted to God, it will be found that he will possess a marvellous     mastery over their hearts and characters. In other words, if he     makes his Soldiers feel that he is real and consecrated, he will be     able to lead them almost at will; they will follow him to the     death.     "The same shot, with the same charge of gunpowder, from a rifled     cannon, will produce ten times a greater effect than from one with     a smooth bore. The make of the gun gives the extra force to the     shot. Just in the same way the truth from the lips of a man whom     his hearers believe to be holy and true will strike with a     hundredfold more force than the same message will from another who     has not so commended himself. The character of the man gives the     extra force to the truth.     "The Field Officer, by virtue of his position, stands out before     his Soldiers more prominently than any other man. To them he is the     Ambassador and Representative of God. He is their Captain, their     Brother, and Friend. Their eyes are on him night and day. They     regard him as the pattern expressly set for them to copy, the     leader who at all times it is their bounden duty to follow.     "How important it is, therefore, that every Officer should be     careful to perfect his character to the utmost in order that he may     be useful to the fullest extent.     "The Field Officer must lead his Soldiers on to the full     realisation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost; he must make them     Blood and Fire. The work of the Spirit is to fill the soul with     burning zeal for the Salvation of the world. Christ's work must be     finished. He has left that task to His people; it can only be     continued and carried on to completion by His Spirit working in the     hearts and through the lives of His people. The Holy Ghost was     promised for this end. This is what His people have, therefore, a     right to expect, and without it they are powerless for the War.     "In order that his Soldiers may be effective, the Field Officer     must not only act for the purification of his Soldiers, but to have     them filled with the Spirit of Christ, in order that they may be     competent for the mighty work they have to accomplish.     "This will make them wise. They will understand how to fight, what     to say, what to sing, how to pray, and how to talk to the     consciences and hearts of men. The Spirit of God will lead them     into right methods of action, will show them how to make     opportunities, and how to put these opportunities to the best use,     when they are made.     "The Holy Spirit will give them perseverance, keeping them going on     in the face of difficulty.     "The Holy Spirit will give them power, making them not only     willing to endure the Cross, but to glory in it.     "The Holy Spirit will give them the fire of love, the seraphic     spirit, the live coal from off the altar, making them both burn and     shine. With this they will come to Knee-Drill, to the Open-Air, to     face mocking crowds, and to endure the scorn, and hatred, and     persecution of men; not merely from a sense of duty, dragging     themselves to it, because it is the will of God; or for the good of     The Army; or as an example to their comrades; or even for the     Salvation of souls; but because they love it, and cannot stay away.     "This baptism will be a fire in their bones, which must have vent.     It will be a spirit that must have a voice. It will be a love, a     burning love in the heart, which all the waters that earth and Hell     can pour upon it, cannot quench a love with which no other love can     compare. It will be the Saviour again loving a dying world through     His people. It will be Christ indeed come again in the flesh.     "The Soldiers must be baptised with fire. It will give them the     Soldier's spirit; and, with that, all a Soldier needs in the way of     drill, and duty, and sacrifice will inevitably follow."In his _Letter to his Officers on his Eightieth Birthday_, he wrote:--     "On the coming 10th of April, in many lands and in many ways, the     Officers, Soldiers, and Friends of The Salvation Army will be     celebrating my Eightieth Birthday.     "The occasion is one which inspires in me many deep emotions; and,     next to the gratitude I feel to Almighty God for the unmeasured     blessings He has been pleased to vouchsafe to me, I find the desire     to write and tell you, my dear Officers, something of the love and     sympathy ever welling up in my heart towards you.     "The times and friends of long ago are sometimes said to have been     brighter or better than those of to-day. This may have been the     experience of some. It has not been mine. It is true that in the     early years of my Salvation Warfare there were battlings and     victories of deep interest and value, but no conflicts or triumphs     in those far-back times exceeded, or indeed equalled, in value and     interest the conflicts and triumphs of my later days.     "It is true that from the beginning I have been associated with     many remarkable men and women--men and women whose ability,     affection, and devotion to God have been of the greatest service to     me. But with, perhaps, one or two exceptions, I have had no     co-workers who have excelled, or even equalled, in ability, in     affection or devotion, the Comrades who at the present hour are     struggling with me all over the world for the highest well-being of     their fellows, and for the advancement of the Kingdom of our Lord     Jesus Christ.     "Sixty-five years ago I chose the Salvation of men and the     extension of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ as the supreme object for     which I would live and labour.     "Although that choice was made in my early youth, in much ignorance     of the world, and of the religious needs of those about me, still,     it was not arrived at without much thought and some information;     and that purpose is still, and will be to the end, the object which     has shaped and mastered the thoughts, ambitions, and activities of     my whole life.     "From the hour of my first Prayer Meetings in one of the cottage     homes of my native town, down to the present moment, that object     has been the governing principle of my life. The adornments and     flowers and music and other pleasant things connected with     religious service have all been secondary to efficiency in the     search for that object and success in attaining it.     "My hourly usage with regard to every effort I put forth has been     to ask myself: What does this action contemplate? What will it     achieve? Can it be improved upon? I believe I can say that every     conversation and prayer and song and address and Meeting I have had     a hand in have been valued in proportion to their ability to     promote the realisation of that great purpose.     "No greater mistake can be made with respect to The Salvation Army     than to suppose that it is not a school for thought. Perhaps more     theories have been produced and more schemes invented by us for     gaining the highest ends of the Christian faith (bearing in mind     our age and the extent of our work) than by any other religious     movement in existence. Indeed, as I have often said in public, when     we have so many thousands of hearts inflamed with the love of     Christ for sinning, suffering, and dying men, and possessed with a     passionate desire for their rescue, you must have the constant     evolution of new plans and contrivances for that purpose.     "But, while thus inventive, The Army does not content itself with     hopes and theories merely; it seeks to put every fresh idea to the     test of practical application, waiting for the issue, before it     regards it of permanent value. At least, that has been my own     usage, and the practical character of my mind and work has come to     be generally allowed.     "While, then, I glory in the fact that our religion is Divine in     origin and manifestation, I equally maintain the necessity for     human skill, human energy, and human enterprise, in the efforts put     forth to establish and extend it; and, accordingly, I have only     adopted any efforts so far as they have proved themselves effective     in the school of experience.     "So with this confidence in my convictions I proceed once more to     push them upon your attention."In the _Orders and Regulations for Soldiers_, perhaps the concisestdescription of earnest living ever written, he says:--     "The Salvation Soldier must have been converted or changed by the     power of the Holy Spirit from the old, worldly, selfish, sinful     nature, to the new, holy, heavenly, Divine nature; and not only     must he thus have received a new heart, but he must have the Holy     Spirit living in that heart, possessing it, and working through it,     to will and to do the good pleasure of God.     "This is the first and main condition of Soldiership. It is     understood that every Soldier has come into the possession of this     true Religion by passing through that change which is usually     described in The Army as being 'saved.' There is nothing more     common throughout our ranks than! the expression, 'I am glad I am     saved!'     "As it is impossible for a Salvation Soldier to perform the duties     hereafter set forth with satisfaction to himself, and profit to     others, unless this change has been experienced, it will be well to     describe it rather particularly, so that every Soldier who reads     these Regulations will be able to satisfy himself whether he has     really undergone this change.     "If on reading this description, any Soldier should have reason to     believe that he has not experienced this change, and is still in     his sins, or that he has been unfaithful since he did realise it,     and is, therefore, a backslider, the first business of such an one     will be to go to God and seek Salvation; otherwise it will be     impossible for him to be a good Soldier.     "Salvation implies the devotion of the whole life to the     accomplishment of the purpose for which Christ lived and suffered     and died. It means that the Soldier becomes His disciple.     "Enlisting in His Army, the Soldier receives not only power to walk     in His commandments for himself, but to subdue other men to the     Lord.     "His new nature now continually cries out, 'What wilt Thou have me     to do?' and carries him forth with the feet of cheerful obedience     in the service of his new Master, to weep and suffer, and, if     necessary, to die, to bring others into the enjoyment of the     Salvation which he himself has found. He lives the same kind of     life and is actuated by the same purposes as God Himself."In _Religion for Every Day_ he writes:--     "I am always talking to you about what we call religious duties,     such as praying and singing, making efforts to save your own soul     and the souls of the people about you. In these letters I propose     speaking of the things that men call secular, and which many people     reckon have nothing to do with Religion. But I want to show you, if     I can, that the Salvationist's conduct ought, in every particular,     to be religious; every meal he partakes of should be a sacrament;     and every thought and deed a service done to God. In doing this you     will see that I shall have to deal with many quite commonplace     subjects; and, in talking about them, I shall try to be as simple     and as practical as I possibly can.     "The first topic to which I shall call your attention is your daily     employment, and by that I mean the method by which you earn your     livelihood. Or, supposing that, having some independent means of     support, you are not compelled to labour for your daily bread, then     I shall point out that special form of work, the doing of which     Providence has plainly made to be your duty. Because it is     difficult to conceive of any Salvationist who has not some regular     employment, for which he holds himself responsible to God     "Work is a good thing, my comrades. To be unemployed is generally     counted an evil--any way, it is so in the case of a poor man; but     it seems to me that the obligation to be engaged in some     honourable and useful kind of labour is as truly devolved upon the     rich as upon the poor, perhaps more so. Work is necessary to the     well-being of men and women of every class, everywhere. To be     voluntarily idle, in any rank or condition of life, is to be a     curse to others and to be accursed yourself.     "You would utterly condemn me if you thought that I engaged in my     work in The Army merely to make a good show, or for some personal     profit, and did not care about what God thought of the matter. My     comrades, there are not two different standards of work--one for     you and one for me. You must, therefore, be under the same     obligation to do your work in the house or in the mine or in the     warehouse, or wherever the Providence of God has placed you" to     please your Heavenly Master, as I am on the platform, in the     council chamber, or wherever my duty may call me.     "But here another question arises. Do you accept Jesus Christ as     your Master in the affairs of your daily life? If not, of course,     this part of my argument will be thrown away; but if you do, then     it will be the most powerful of all.     "At the commencement of His ministry, Jesus Christ announced that     He was about to establish the Kingdom of Heaven on the earth. By     the Kingdom of Heaven He meant a Kingdom consisting of heavenly     government, heavenly laws, heavenly obedience, heavenly power,     heavenly love, heavenly joy. These, taken together, constitute the     chief characteristics of this Kingdom, and instead of being     confined, as it had been hitherto, to a handful of people in     Jerusalem and Judea, it was to cover the whole earth.     "Now the subjects of that Kingdom must accept Jesus Christ as their     Master and Lord. No one can either come into that Kingdom or remain     in it without compliance with this law. You cannot be a son without     being a servant.     "But you have written yourselves down as His servants, and said you     will 'no longer live unto yourselves,' nor to please the world, but     to do the will of Him who has redeemed you; that is, to please Him.     Now the Master's province, everybody knows, is, not only to choose     the work of His servants, but to get it done, if possible, to His     satisfaction.     "He has appointed me my work. He has arranged that I should direct     the movements of this great Army, preach Salvation, write Letters     for you to read, save as many sinners as I can, and strive to get     my Soldiers safely landed on the Celestial Shore. Before all else,     I must do this Work, as nearly as I can, to satisfy my Lord--and     nothing short of the best work I can produce will accomplish that.     "And as with me so with you. He has chosen your work, if you have     put your life into His hands, just as truly as He has chosen mine,     although it may be of a different kind. I am writing this letter in     the train. I am a poor writer at best. When I was a child my     schoolmaster neglected to teach me to hold my pen properly. In this     respect he did not do good work, and I have had to suffer for it     ever since. Still, I am doing my work as well as I can, in order     that it may profit you and please my Lord.     "In settling how much work he will do, a man must have due regard     to the claims of his own health. If he rushes at his work without     due discretion, and does more than his strength will reasonably     allow, he will probably break down, and so prevent his working     altogether, or for a season, at least. Whereas, if he exhausts no     more energy than he can recover by sleep and food and rest, at the     time he can go steadily forward, and by doing so, accomplish a     great deal more, in the long run, than he would by temporary     extravagant exertion. When speaking on this subject, I sometimes     say that I use my body as I should use a horse, if I had one--that     is, I should not seek to get the most labour out of him for a week,     regardless of the future, but I should feed and manage him with a     view to getting the most I could get out of him all the year round.     That is, doubtless, the way a man should use his body, and to do     this he should take as much time for his food and daily rest as is     necessary to replace the energies he has used up by his work.     "In the leisure taken for this purpose, it will be necessary to     have specified hours, as otherwise, those who are without principle     will take advantage of the weak, and anything like system will be     impossible.     "Then, again, when the proper performance of a particular task     depends upon the united labour of a number of individuals, who have     agreed to work in co-operation, it will be necessary, in the     interests of the whole, that each should conform to the regulations     laid down, always supposing that such rules are in harmony with     truth and righteousness.     "The wishes and interests of employers have also to be taken into     consideration. But, in every case, the principle is equally     obligatory upon all.     "These duties will demand, and must have devoted to them, a     measure of the time at our control. What that amount of time shall     be, must be determined by the relative importance of those duties.     For instance:--     "There is the work a man can do for his earthly employers, over and     above the amount that is considered to be a strict and just return     for his wages. Here, again, he must be guided by Jesus Christ's     rule, and to do unto his master as he would that his master should     do unto him.     "There is the work that he ought to do for his family, apart and     beyond the bare earnings of their daily bread. This is work which     no one else can do so well, and which, if it be neglected by him,     will probably not be done at all.     "There is the effort that every workman should put forth for his     own personal improvement. For instance, a youth of seventeen works,     we will say, ten hours a day for his employer, who would very much     like him to put in another hour at the same task, and would be     willing to pay him extra for doing so. This, we will suppose, the     youth could do without any injurious effect to his health. But     then, by reading his Bible, or cultivating his mind, he might     qualify himself to become an Officer, or to fill some other     important position, in either case fitting himself for a field of     greater usefulness, in the future, than the one he already     occupies. Under such circumstances, it must be the duty of that     youth to take that hour for his own improvement, rather than to use     it to enrich his master or increase his earnings.     "Then, every Soldier of Jesus Christ must duly consider and obey     the claims of the Salvation War. That is, he must strive to take     his fair share in that conflict. Whether he is his own master,     having the direct control of his time, or whether he works for an     employer, who only allows him many hours for leisure, he must     conscientiously devote much of that time as he can to saving his     fellow-men, settling this question, he must use his common sense,     and claim the promised direction of the Holy Spirit. God will guide     him.     "What I protest against here is the notion, born of indolence and     selfishness, which affirms that we should do little, rather than as     much, work as is consistent with the maintenance of health, and     with the claims arising out of the relations in which we stand to     those about us.[Illustration: {Handwriting}Soldiers. God and a sinning suffering world cal you to rise up and meetyour great opportunity. Do it and do it with your might.For the present I must say farewell; but always think of ****Your affectionate GeneralWilliams S. BoothCape Town,_October 12, 1908_AN AUTOGRAPH MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL]     "However, circumstances will transpire, during the earthly career     of every one of us, calling for self-sacrificing work that must be     performed, regardless of consequences to health or any other     interest.     "Supposing, by way of illustration, a ship has sprung a leak,     through which the water is rushing rapidly in, endangering the     lives of both the passengers and crew. Under such conditions, would     not every man on board be justified in working night and day to     prevent the threatened calamity? Nay, further, would not the laws     of humanity call upon every one concerned to do so at the risk of     crippling themselves, or even sacrificing life itself, in order to     gain the greater good of saving the vessel from destruction, and     rescuing a number of their fellows from a watery grave?     "My contention then, is, that whether in the shop or on the ship,     in the parlour or in the kitchen, in the factory or in the field,     on the Salvation platform or in the coal mine, whether Officers or     Soldiers, we are all alike, as servants of God, under the     obligation to do all we possibly can in the service of men; and to     do it with the holy motive of pleasing our Heavenly Master.     "Here let me review my warrant for requiring from you the kind of     loving labour that I advocate.     "The Bible enjoins it. We have already quoted Paul's words to the     Ephesians, in which he says that our work is to be done, 'Not with     eye-service as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing     the will of God from the heart; with goodwill doing service, as to     the Lord, and not to men.' That is all I ask for.     "It is enjoined by the doctrine of brotherly love. I cannot     understand how any one can suppose, for a moment, that he is living     a life acceptable to God unless he is striving, with all his might,     to fulfil the Divine command, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as     thyself.' Your master, or whoever has a claim upon your service,     must be included in the term 'neighbour'; and to comply with the     command of the Saviour, you must work for that master, or mistress,     as the case may be, from the voluntary principle of love rather     than the earthly and selfish principle of gain.     "Is not the disinterested method I am urging upon you in keeping     with the loftiest ideals the world possesses with respect to work?     About whom does it write its poetry? Whom does it laud to the     heavens in the pulpit, on the platform, and in the Press? Whose     names does it describe the highest in its Temples of Fame, or hand     down to posterity as examples for rich and poor, old and young     alike, to follow? Is it the man who makes his own ease and     enrichment his only aim in life, and who toils and spins for     nothing higher than his own gratification? Nothing of the kind. It     is the generous, self-sacrificing, disinterested being who uses     himself up for the benefit of his fellows.     "Nay, at whom does that same world ceaselessly sneer, and whom does     it most pitilessly despise? Is it not the mean and narrow spirit     whose conduct is governed by selfish greed and sensual indulgences?     Whatever may be its practice, in this respect, the sentiment of the     world is in the right direction. It asks for benevolence evidenced     by unselfish labour, and admires it when it finds it.     "A paragraph went the round of the newspaper world, a little time     back, describing how an American millionaire had decided to spend     the rest of his days on a Leper Island in the Pacific Ocean, in     order to labour for the amelioration of the miseries of its     unfortunate inhabitants. Wonder and admiration everywhere greeted     the announcement.     "Shall we go back on all this spirit of self-sacrifice? Shall this     kind of thing die out, or only have an existence in poetry books,     platform quotations, or anecdote collections? Shall we change over     to the 'pound-of-flesh' principle, and hire out the work of our     hands, the thoughts of our minds, and the burning passions of our     souls, for the largest amount of filthy lucre, and the greatest     measure of earthly comfort, that we can obtain for them; so     justifying the lying libel on humanity, long since spoken, and     still often sneeringly quoted, that every man has his price? Or     shall we say that love--the love of God and man--is the highest and     divinest motive of labour--a motive possible not only to the sons     and daughters of genius, but accessible to the plainest, humblest     man or woman who suffers and toils on the lowest round of the     ladder of life.     "I argue in favour of this doctrine on the ground of its     profitableness to the worker. My readers will probably have asked     long before this, How far do these propositions harmonise with the     interests of the servant? Ought he not to take his own well-being     into account? Certainly. He must have just as true a regard for his     own welfare and the welfare of those dependent upon him, as he has     for that of others. The command, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as     thyself,' can only be rightly interpreted by another, like unto     it, which reads: 'Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do     ye even so to them.' Therefore, he must ask, that others should do     unto him as he would do unto them, supposing they occupied changed     positions. This must mean that, while righteously concerned for the     interests of others, he must be reasonably concerned for his own.     "But here a little difficulty comes into our argument, arising out     of the play of the higher motives of affection. What does love care     for gain in its calculations of service? The husband who loves his     wife as Christ loved the Church, does not stop to consider the     claims of duty, or the advantages following its discharge in     toiling for her welfare. He will be willing to die for her, as     Christ died for the Church.     "He does not say, 'I will toil for my delicate wife, and deny     myself pleasant things, in order to obtain for her the necessaries     and comforts she requires, because she would do the same for me, if     I were in her place and she in mine.' Nothing of the kind! The wife     I spoke of, who told me the other day that she had not had her     clothes off for seventeen days and nights in nursing her husband     did not make it appear that she thought she was doing anything     extraordinary, or that she rendered this service to her companion     in life because she felt sure that had he been the wife and she the     husband, he would have gladly done the same for her.     "Had the newspapers thought that the American millionaire was going     to the Leper Island, with his gold, to make something out of it for     himself and family, or to make a name in the world, instead of his     being greeted with a chorus of admiration, there would have been a     universal chorus of execration at his selfishness. It was because     they believed that he was going to make the sacrifice of his own     gain, if not of his own self, for the benefit of the poor     sufferers, that they praised him.     "Supposing, however, that we come down to the low level of     self-interest, we insist then, that those who work from the motive     of love, rather than the motive of gain, will not necessarily be     sufferers in consequence, so far as this world goes. But it may be     asked, 'Will not unprincipled masters or mistresses be likely to     take advantage of this docile and unselfish spirit?' Perhaps, nay,     doubtless, in many cases, they will. The Salvation Army has been     taken advantage of all through its past history, and so have all     the true saints of God, because they have submitted to wrong, and     have not fought the injustice and false representations and     persecutions inflicted upon them from the beginning. It will     possibly be so to the end, but that does not affect the principle     for which I argue, which is, that we _must_ do good work, and as     much of it as we can, regardless of what the world may give us in     return.     "But, I think, I have sufficiently shown, as I have gone along,     that this class of service is not without its earthly rewards, and     that every interest of human nature--selfish and otherwise     alike--testify to the probability of its proving profitable to     those who practise it.     "If, however, the reward does not come in the form of money, or     houses, or lands, there will be gain in that which is far more     valuable than money and houses and lands, and which money and     houses and lands cannot buy. There will be the gain in peace, in     satisfaction, and in joy in the Holy Ghost in this life, to say     nothing of the gain in the world to come. But, on this point, I     shall have more to say another time.     "I remember hearing a gentleman relate the following incident in a     large meeting: 'Some time back,' he said, 'I was passing through     the streets of Liverpool. It was a cold, raw, wintry day. The     streets were ankle-deep in an unpleasant mixture of mud and ice,     and battling through it all, the came along a little procession of     ragged, haggard, hungry looking boys. Splash, splash, on they went,     through freezing slush, at every step making the onlookers     shudddered as they stood by in their warm, comfortable coats and     furs." In the front rank was a little fellow, who was scarcely more     than a bag of bones, half-naked, barefooted, his whole frame     shivering every time he put his foot down on the melting snow.     "'All at once, a big boy came forward, and, stooping down, bade the     lad put his arms round his neck, and, lifting him up on his back,     took his perished feet one in each hand and jogged along with his     burden.     "'I was moved,' said the speaker, 'at the sight; and going up to     the boy, commended him for his kindness. In his Lancashire brogue     the lad replied, "Aye, aye, sir; two feet in the cold slush are     not so bad as four." After a while,' said the speaker, 'I offered     to carry the little chap myself" but the honest fellow shook his     head, and said, "Nay, nay,' Mister; I winna part with him. I can     carry him; and he's a-warming o' my back."'     "And so, if seeking the good of others may not bring as much     worldly gain as a selfish course of action, it does ensure that     joyful warmth of heart which all loving service brings, and which     is among the most valuable of all the treasures of earth or Heaven.     Every man who acts on this principle is adding to the general sum     of human happiness. What is the sum of celestial happiness, the     happiness of God, the happiness of the angels, the happiness of the     Blood-washed spirits who are safely landed there? In what does this     happiness chiefly consist?     "I reply, Not in the golden streets, the unfading flowers, the     marvellous music, nor all the other wonders of the Celestial Land     put together, but in Love. Love is the essence of the bliss of     Heaven, for 'Love is Heaven, and Heaven is Love.' This happiness we     can have below. It is not the love others bear to us that makes our     felicity, but the love we bear to them; and, thank God, we can as     truly love on earth as we can in Heaven.     "And then, as I have been saying all along, acting on this     principle constitutes true religion. As labour done from selfish,     fleshly motives is of the earth, and as the results which follow it     will perish with the earth, even so labour done to bless mankind     and to please God is Divine, and the results flowing out of it must     be everlasting honour and joy. Where this principle is carried into     effect, every part of human conduct becomes religious--nay, a     positive act of Divine worship, and an acceptable song of praise."Important Events Connected With The General's Life And Work1827.

The general tendency towards indifference quite as much as the betterimpulses of our age have produced such a toning down of the teachings ofCalvin, both in and out of Switzerland, that it may be startling to someto be reminded that, except the Lutheran and Methodist, every Churchstill has in its list of Doctrines those of Election and Predestination.If it were true that every human being was predestined, before birth,either to a good or a bad life, there would, of course, be no meaning ina Saviour or a Gospel; and we can understand the indignation of thishonest lad, when he was asked to undertake to teach such things. Henever learned how to reconcile the profession of a set of doctrines onedoes not believe with any religion. The recollection of this incidenthelped him in limiting to the utmost possible extent, the DoctrinalDeclarations of The Army. But whatever he asked any one to subscribe tohe expected them truly to believe and earnestly to teach.1. Transcriber's note: In the original, the words "in the United Statesand Denmark, yet it will only make" were repeated.
